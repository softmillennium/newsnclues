Fawning for Trump's favor, European leaders are ramping up military spending at the expense of public benefits.

Fawning for Trump's favor, European leaders are ramping up military spending at the expense of public benefits.

At last week's NATO summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that his country would be buying a dozen F-35A fighter jets from the U.S., each one capable of carrying a payload of tactical nuclear weapons. It marks the first time since shortly after the end of the Cold War that U.S. nuclear weapons capable of being dropped from aircraft are to be stationed in the U.K.

At the NATO summit, a triumphant Trump — who has made skepticism about NATO and, at best, ambivalence about its collective defense provisions centerpieces of his emergent political ideology over the decades – engaged in one of the most brazen displays of shakedown politics in modern history. In exchange for maintaining U.S. security commitments, the U.S. president demanded, in the weeks leading up to the summit, that NATO members move toward spending an astounding 5 percent of their GDP on defense and security, more than doubling what most NATO members, with the exception of Poland and the Baltic States, currently spend.

Leaders of the NATO member countries competed with each other over who could fawn the most in efforts to gain Trump's favor, and ultimately almost all of them fell into line, agreeing to huge defense spending hikes over the coming decade. Their goal is that by 2035 they will be spending at least 3.5 percent of their respective GDPs on core military spending, and another 1.5 percent on security and miscellaneous other expenditures designed to harden economies and infrastructure against cyberattacks, people trafficking, and additional risks and perceived risks to NATO economies.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The one exception was Spain, the socialist government of which balked at the increased spending commitment and received an opt-out, to the chagrin of Trump, who launched a blitz of social media posts against the Spanish government and declared that, in consequence, Spain would have to pay twice as much in tariffs in any future trade deal with the U.S. (This seemingly ignores the fact that Spain is a part of the EU and can't be treated differently from other bloc members in any negotiated agreement.)

NATO leader Mark Rutte, ex-head of the Dutch government, lauded Trump as “Daddy,” and praised to the rafters his decision to pre-emptively attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Photos showed him laughing and smiling at every Trump aside, like a courtier at the Sun King's court, a display of quite astounding sycophancy. Other NATO leaders followed suit. Cumulatively, The Guardian wrote, it was an “orchestrated grovel,” the likes of which hadn't previously been seen in U.S. relations with its allies. This wasn't a conference of equals; rather it was a spectacle in which the U.S.'s strongman demanded — and received — the sort of accolades and over-the-top tributes that Soviet general secretaries used to demand from satellite state leaders in Eastern Europe, or that emperors of old required of conquered vassals.

Trump demanded that NATO members move toward spending an astounding 5 percent of their GDP on defense and security

Trump's agenda was pretty straightforward: if Europe and Canada wanted the security guarantees that the U.S. has provided since World War II, then they would have to pay through the nose for the privilege. This would be manifested through massively increasing military spending, reducing domestic safety net spending, and channeling hundreds of billions of dollars toward U.S. arms manufacturers.

The F-35A fighter jets alone will cost the British government over 1 billion pounds, and, once refueling planes, which the jets will need to operate far from U.K. shores, and other supportive infrastructure are factored in, that cost will rise still further. That's money going straight to Lockheed Martin.

This same week, the U.K. government has been pushing for massive reductions to social safety-net payments for hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities — and has, in consequence, faced a huge rebellion from within its own Labour Party ranks. And that follows on from an ill-fated effort last year to curtail an energy assistance program intended to ensure that Brits, especially pensioners, could keep their heating on during the cold winter months.

Much of the increase in military spending will come out of existing social programs, foreign aid commitments, and even pension and health care systems.

Similar trade-offs will, in coming years, be felt throughout NATO. Unlike the U.S., which for years has been able to tap international lenders' willingness to fund an American debt spree, most other NATO members simply do not have the market clout — or under the rules that bind the EU together, the legal right — to borrow on such a massive scale. As a result, much of the increase in military spending will come out of existing social programs, foreign aid commitments, and even pension and health care systems. Germany, for example, is planning to nearly double its military spending over the next five years, leaving a hole of tens of billions of euros in its budget. Denmark has created an “acceleration fund” that will channel an additional $7 billion into military spending over the coming two years, representing roughly 1.5 percent of its GDP. France, which has long battled with its own budget woes, will likely have to introduce a combination of tax hikes and social spending cuts to fund its military build-up. Poland has asked the European Commission to shift nearly $7 billion in green projects expenditures allotted to Poland into military spending instead. The continental commitments to increased military spending likely will result in a further erosion of the decades-old European social compact.

While Europe's leaders fawn, it's not at all clear that their populaces will back them up.

Caught between Putin's expansionist and imperialistic impulses — as demonstrated so brutally in Ukraine and with the increasingly militarist rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin — and Trump's transactional, America First foreign policy, Europe's leaders have decided to embrace the sort of massive ramp-up in military spending that so often serves as the prelude to war. No one wants to be caught wrongfooted should Putin order his military to breach NATO borders on the East, or NATO airspace elsewhere in Europe. No one wants to be the country that Trump steps back from defending — as he has, in the past explicitly said he would do, announcing he would encourage Putin's forces to “do whatever the hell they want” — because they aren't meeting the military spending goals that he has laid out. And thus, NATO's member states have ratcheted up military expenditures to a degree that, even a couple of months ago, would have seemed to be both implausible and dangerously destructive toward Europe and Canada's social compacts.

Not all of that money now earmarked for military spending will flow to U.S. defense contractors; but given the U.S.'s pre-eminence in the field of high-tech weaponry, it's a sure bet that, at least in the short term, while Europe grapples with how to diversify away from an unpredictable and even predatory U.S., an awful lot of it will.

All of this stands to benefit the military-industrial complex mightily. The losers, of course, will be those who rely on the social safety net programs that get pushed aside in the rush to find funds to boost military spending. But it won't happen without resistance: Stamer's announcement immediately triggered opposition from anti-nuclear groups. During the last years of the Cold War, groups such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament engaged in civil disobedience campaigns to pressure the government to remove nuclear weapons from the Greenham Common air base. Now, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and other peace groups have once again begun mobilizing for rallies, as early as this weekend, at the Royal Air Force bases slated to host the planes and weapons.

It is, of course, early days. But there are signs that European populaces won't uncritically rally around Trump's demand for wholesale, breakneck rearmament. Of course, Europe and Canada do need to work out ways to protect their interests in the face of U.S. retrenchment. But what Trump is demanding is something entirely different; he is insisting on a form of tribute imposed via mandated weapons purchases — and while Europe's leaders fawn, it's not at all clear that their populaces will back them up.

In the last few months, we witnessed two violent attacks on pro-Israel events organized by American Jewish groups, by perpetrators who shouted “Free Palestine!” as they acted. The attacks — which killed two young Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C., and severely burned participants in a “Run for Their Lives” event in Boulder, Colorado, in support of Israeli hostages — have been roundly condemned as antisemitic by politicians and Jewish groups, even though both attackers were vocal about targeting Zionists and seemingly motivated by anger at Israel's actions in Gaza, rather than hatred toward Jews.

The attacks have led to calls for increased surveillance and security around Jewish institutions, as well as accusations that the Palestine liberation movement “radicalized” the assailants.

The response to these terrifying events is predictable and follows a long-established pattern: intense fear and anguish, cynical complaints that rising antisemitism is being ignored and Jews left unprotected, and fevered demands for action. Yet, despite an understandable craving for security, does resorting to increased surveillance, policing, and more severe crackdowns on protests actually make Jews safer? Or is it exacerbating the problem?

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

To address a problem, one must first have a clear idea of its causes. For many in the mainstream Jewish community, as well as in the Trump administration, the answer is simple: pro-Palestinian activism. After the murders of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky in D.C., the Zionist organization JewBelong put up billboards stating, “Make no mistake: if you screamed ‘Free Palestine' you helped pull the trigger” and “When will you learn? ‘Free Palestine' is a death chant.” Counterterrorism expert Seamus Hughes blamed “violent imagery” (presumably of Gazans being slaughtered) as “triggering” even though the images “may actually not be true or correct.” The Republican-led congressional resolution condemning the Boulder attack labeled “Free Palestine” an “antisemitic slogan that calls for the destruction of the state of Israel and the Jewish people.”

Zionists have long asserted that “antisemitism on the left” is under-reported and not taken seriously, along with claiming that “anti-Zionism is antisemitism” (another pithy JewBelong billboard). Yet over the past decade, this has morphed into the notion that progressivism itself, not just pro-Palestine activism, is inherently dangerous to Jews.

We hear this in Anti-Defamation League (ADL) CEO Jonathan Greenblatt's June 6th speech to an assembly of Republican Attorneys General, quoted in the Jewish Forward, in which he claimed that “the radical left” harbored the “real death threat” to Jews. “You have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to see what's happening on the left. There is a throughline from Occupy Wall Street to BLM [Black Lives Matter] to ‘defund the police' to ‘River to the Sea.' They are the same people; these are the same kind of nihilists.” Hughes is less doctrinaire, but insists that “the rise in antisemitic attacks in recent years comes from all forms of ideologies and extremism — far right, far left, single issue.”

It is this Zionist, right wing narrative conflating all Jews with the State of Israel, and thus with Israel's war crimes, that is placing Jews in danger.

What should we on the left make of Hughes and Greenblatt's assertions? Obviously, progressives sometimes make antisemitic comments, just as they may sometimes make sexist or racist or homophobic ones. But antisemitism is not a core part of left-wing ideology, as it is on the right. Antisemitism — along with anti-Blackness and Islamophobia — is definitively baked into right-wing ideology. That is the crucial difference.

Antisemitism, like anti-Black racism and Islamophobia, has deep roots in white Christian nationalism, an ideology that, by definition, considers nonwhite, non-Christians to be outsiders. Every major study of contemporary antisemitism, particularly antisemitic violence, ascribes it primarily to right-wing white nationalists. All sources on antisemitism, including the ADL and the Southern Poverty Law Center, acknowledge that antisemitism is far more prevalent on the right than on the left. A 2022 survey, Antisemitic Attitudes Across the Ideological Spectrum, commissioned by Tufts University, concluded:

For overt measures, we find antisemitic attitudes are rare on the ideological left but common on the ideological right, particularly among young adults on the right. Even when primed with information that most U.S. Jews have favorable views toward Israel – a country disfavored by the ideological left – respondents on the left rarely support statements such as that Jews have too much power or should be boycotted.

But that study was done before October 7, 2023, and of course, both of these recent attacks were perpetrated by supporters of the Palestinian cause (although not Palestinians). Clearly there is a connection between the attacks and support for Palestine. There is deep frustration at the lack of attention to Palestinian suffering and continued U.S. backing for Israel's genocide in Gaza and apartheid policies. Many U.S. Jews are rightly concerned that they are being blamed for Israel's genocide of Palestinians. But who is trying to distinguish between Jews and Zionists: the left, which includes anti-Zionist Jewish groups like Jewish Voice for Peace; or the right, and mainstream Jewish institutions which insist that there is no daylight between Judaism and Zionism, and call anti-Zionist Jews “fake” or “self-hating” Jews? It is this Zionist, right wing narrative conflating all Jews with the State of Israel, and thus with Israel's war crimes, that is placing Jews in danger.

These right-wing voices are often loudest in condemnation of “progressive antisemitism,” largely because it deflects criticism of white nationalist antisemitism, the most prevalent, most dangerous source of antisemitism and racism. We hear it in Republican Nancy Mace's patronizing dismissal of CodePink's Medea Benjamin: “I love Jews! I love Israel! Even self-hating Jews like you.”

Yes, white nationalism is fully ingrained in American government and systems. White nationalists have been a major factor in the January 6 insurrection and in Trump's cabinet. The White House Faith Office and “anti-Christian bias” task force are part of the implementation of Project 2025's radical blueprint for installing Christian Nationalist governance throughout the federal bureaucracy. Vice President J.D. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and House Speaker Mike Johnson all maintain connections to the movement, forming what the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism has called a triangle of influence. While these men are all ardent Zionists, they are also connected to deeply antisemitic institutions; their reasons for supporting Israel have less to do with Jewish welfare than millenarian prophecies that see the ingathering of the Jews in Israel as a necessary step towards the apocalypse. Focusing on right-wing, white Christian nationalist claims of supposed “leftwing antisemitism” and allowing Trump, Mace, Johnson, and others to proclaim their “love for Jews and love for Israel” unchallenged gives them cover for antisemitism and racism, ultimately facilitating more attacks on people of color and the left.

What is most sinister is how these two tragic attacks have been exploited by the right to criminalize and subdue not only Palestinians, but immigrants from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. One of Trump's first actions in response to the Boulder attack was to issue a travel ban against citizens of 12 countries and restrictions on seven more, declaiming, “This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.” The congressional resolution tying Boulder to the Free Palestine movement also claims the attack “demonstrates the dangers of not removing from the country aliens who fail to comply with the terms of their visas” and expresses gratitude to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “for protecting the homeland.”

The tragedy here is that by clinging to the chimera of “leftwing antisemitism” and making common cause with the right, the mainstream Jewish community is allowing itself to be isolated from other marginalized populations. When Greenblatt identifies Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and “Islamist groups” as part of this leftwing cabal, he is telling Jews that to survive they must turn against people of color, progressive movements, and the poor. When he claims that recent attacks against Jews are “the worst expression of hate against any group in the country for the last 100 years” he dismisses and minimizes the lynchings, dispossessions, and deportations of African Americans, Native Americans, Latino Americans, and Japanese Americans. Only Jewish oppression counts, only Jewish oppression is real.

When Greenblatt identifies Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and “Islamist groups” as part of this leftwing cabal, he is telling Jews that to survive they must turn against people of color, progressive movements, and the poor.

This blinkered view not only traps the Jewish community in a funhouse of paranoia and isolation, it also threatens other marginalized communities and deprives us all of desperately needed solidarity. The typical, ADL-advised response to incidents of antisemitism builds physical and emotional walls and fortresses within and around our communities, creating a perceived sense of protection and certainty. (“Does your church need armed guards? ‘Cause our synagogue does” JewBelong dutifully reminds us.) Safety plans devised by groups like ADL and the Jewish Federations rely heavily on working with police. In its guide to protecting religious and communal institutions, the ADL suggests that congregations volunteer their sites to serve as locations for local SWAT teams to train, with no consideration for how this may affect Black, Latino, Muslim, or LGBTQ members or neighbors.

Many of these “safety measures” are blatantly racist. Take the police “antisemitism” training for New York City officers provided by Combat Antisemitism and the Program on Extremism, which listed the keffiyeh and the watermelon as examples of images that “incite hatred, violence, or discrimination against Jewish individuals or communities.” Hughes's description of the Boulder and D.C. attackers as “self-radicalized” is disturbingly similar to the discredited Countering Violent Extremism programs, which focused on infiltrating mosques and Muslim community centers to identify “self-radicalized” Islamist terrorists, creating a broad net of surveillance and repression and fear in Muslim communities.

A better route to Jewish community safety lies in building solidarity with all marginalized groups: people of color, Muslims, immigrants, LGBTQ folks, and those with disabilities. There are historical precedents: in the 1970s, Jews for Urban Justice released a manifesto titled “The Oppression and Liberation of the Jewish People in America,” outlining their ideology as an anti-racist, anti-war, Jewish socialist organization. The manifesto called for white Jewish solidarity with African American, Native American, Chicano, Italian American, and Appalachian communities, and was also critical of Israeli policy towards Palestinians.

In the late 1980s and 90s, Portland, Oregon, responded to a wave of skinhead neo-Nazi racist and homophobic violence with an “unlikely collaboration between groups of activists, immigrants, militant youth and queer organizers.” The Coalition for Humanity that formed was made up of Black, Indigenous, and people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and Jews, using street defense and community activism rather than policing to make Portland safer for everyone. This sounds very similar to the Jews For Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ) community safety pledge, which suggests:

Start or deepen conversations with your community about what safety can look like beyond the narrow confines of police and militarization.

Reach out to neighboring communities and organizations — particularly Muslim communities, Black communities, including churches, immigrant communities and other communities of color who have had to navigate their own safety outside of a police framework.

The Community Safety Campaign (CSC), a national project led by a multiracial, cross-class, multidenominational, and gender-diverse team of Jewish organizers, political educators, researchers, healers, and spiritual leaders, recently produced a 100 page guide for Jewish communities and partners seeking to transform their safety practices. CSC helps congregations build community safety plans and teams based on political education about antisemitism, antiracism, white & Christian nationalism, and transformative justice.

These efforts have one thing in common: They do not look at antisemitism in isolation, but recognize its connections to all forms of racism and oppression. This is the approach taken by PARCEO's (Participatory Action Research Center for Education Organizing) “Antisemitism from a Framework of Collective Liberation” curriculum, which points to the historical commonalities and parallels between the oppression of Jews and that of other marginalized populations. The PARCEO framework is central to Jewish Voice for Peace's Principles for Dismantling Antisemitism.

During the first Trump administration, many Americans were horrified by the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally, which called for the unification of the white nationalist movement, and exemplified the nature of white nationalist violence in action. Its leaders chanted, “Jews will not replace us,” insisting that Jews are an evil cabal infecting white America by supporting inferior races. Unlike “radical leftists,” these people are actually in power — and they are actually a threat to Jews, unlike keffiyeh-wearing students at Columbia University. If we truly value Jewish safety we must throw off the isolationist mentality. We must give equal value to Black, Brown, queer, and Palestinian safety. We must focus on the true enemy — white supremacy and white nationalism — and not look to ethnonationalism, militarism, and policing to protect us, while endangering those who should be our allies.

Hopes that pause to the killing may be agreed were boosted despite 24 Palestinians being killed including 10 seeking aid

Israel has continued to launch waves of airstrikes in Gaza, hours after Hamas said it was ready to start talks “immediately” on a US-sponsored proposal for a 60-day ceasefire.

The announcement by the militant Islamist organisation increased hopes that a deal may be done within days to pause the killing in Gaza and possibly end the near 21-month conflict.

Saturday was relatively “calmer” after days of intense bombardment, aid officials and residents in Gaza said, although 24 Palestinians were killed, including 10 people seeking humanitarian aid, according to hospital officials.

Airstrikes struck tents in the Mawasi coastal area in southern Gaza, killing seven, including a Palestinian doctor and his three children, according to medics at a nearby hospital. Four others were killed in the town of Bani Suheila, and three people were killed in three different strikes in the town of Khan Younis.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) made no immediate comment on the attacks.

Israel's security cabinet was due to meet after sundown on Saturday but officials in Jerusalem said there was “no guarantee” that ministers would make a decision on the Hamas response to the ceasefire deal.

Separately, two US contractors with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) were injured in the south of the territory after unknown assailants threw grenades at them at a food distribution site, the organisation said.

The GHF, a US-supported private organisation that began handing out food parcels in Gaza last month, has been mired in controversy, with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, saying it was “inherently unsafe” and that it was “killing people”. The GHF denies this, saying it has delivered tens of millions of meals in “safety and security”.

Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks in shooting or shelling by the IDF while travelling to GHF sites or gathering in large crowds to get aid from convoys brought into Gaza by the UN that are often stopped and looted.

Aid workers in Gaza have called again for an immediate cessation of hostilities, saying that fuel stocks for NGOs are close to running out, which would lead to the “complete collapse” of humanitarian operations, much of the health system and communications across the territory. Power supplies in Gaza rely primarily on large quantities of diesel for generators.

“We are pretty much down to about half a day's worth. When that is gone, everything has to shut down,” said one humanitarian worker in Deir al-Balah.

Israel imposed a tight 11-week blockade on Gaza after the most recent ceasefire collapsed in March, which has only been partly lifted to allow a small amount of food aid and medical supplies into the territory. No fuel has been permitted to enter, and supplies that still exist in Gaza are often in Israeli-controlled areas or combat zones and so inaccessible.

Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, is to fly to Washington on Sunday for talks with the US president, Donald Trump, who has said in a series of social media posts that he wants the Gaza war to stop.

Drafts of the proposed deal seen by the Guardian include a provision specifying that Trump would personally announce any ceasefire – possibly in the coming days during Netanyahu's visit.

However, sources close to Hamas said the organisation wants greater clarity over guarantees that the initial truce would lead to a permanent end to the war and the eventual withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.

There is also disagreement over who would be allowed to deliver the “sufficient aid” described in the draft. Hamas want the GHF to be closed down. Israel wants to maintain a system of distribution independent from the UN or other countries.

Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One late on Friday, Trump said he was optimistic and suggested there “could be a Gaza deal” next week. But Israeli media have described a series of steps involving separate Israeli delegations flying to Qatar and Egypt to complete negotiations, and the current draft specifies that Steve Witkoff, Trump's personal envoy, will travel to the Middle East to finalise the deal.

Analysts said this could mean lengthy delays before an agreement is reached.

The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise Hamas-led attack into Israel in October 2023, during which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Fifty remain in Gaza, less than half still alive.

Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 57,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to a count by the territory's ministry of health that is considered reliable by the UN and many western governments.

A handful of states are using DOGE initiatives to push ahead with cuts conservatives have been wanting for decades.

Elon Musk has left the White House, but the Trump administration has no plans to halt or reverse the destruction Musk's slash-and-burn tactics caused over his five months leading the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE). And the damage doesn't stop at the federal level. At least 26 states have launched “government efficiency” initiatives of their own in recent months, typically through executive order, legislation, or the creation of a legislative committee, according to an April analysis by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).

The EPI briefing outlines how these state-level initiatives “use disingenuous calls to ‘root out inefficiency' and ‘cut wasteful spending' as a smokescreen,” with the ultimate goal of funding tax cuts for the wealthy.

“State lawmakers are using the DOGE brand to restructure government in favor of partisan interests,” Nina Mast, an EPI policy and economic analyst and a coauthor of the briefing, told Truthout. “They're weaponizing ‘efficiency,' in order to limit agency authority and put burdensome new requirements on agencies that serve the public.”

She added: “These efforts are not new, but this new [DOGE] brand gives them cover to enact changes that would otherwise be condemned as abuses of power.”

These state-level DOGE initiatives typically seek to wrest power from civil servants and state agencies. So far this year, four states (Kentucky, Utah, Oklahoma, and Louisiana) have enacted so-called “REINS-style” laws, modeled after the federal “Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny” (REINS) Act. The federal REINS Act, which was originally designed by a Tea Party activist and has been introduced in every Congress since 2009, seeks to give Congress the authority to block major regulations issued by federal agencies. Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, warns that the REINS Act threatens the government's ability to protect public health and safety, enact worker protections, and institute financial reforms, noting: “It will only benefit those corporations that wish to game the system and evade safety standards and do nothing to improve protections for the American public.”

While the REINS Act has never passed the U.S. Senate, and an attempt to slip it into Trump's massive tax bill was stripped by the Senate parliamentarian in June, several similar laws have been enacted in the states, thanks in large part to Americans for Prosperity (AFP), a libertarian political advocacy group affiliated with the Koch family. Once passed, these laws hinder the ability of state agencies to enact regulations and protections. In Wisconsin, for example, which passed the second state REINS-style law under Gov. Scott Walker in 2017, the law prevented the Department of Natural Resources from restricting manure spreading in areas sensitive to groundwater pollution.

While some state DOGE efforts seem gimmicky or designed to impress Donald Trump and Musk — or have already stalled out or died — a handful of states are using DOGE initiatives to push ahead with cuts conservatives have been wanting for decades.

“I've been DOGE-ing in Oklahoma since before it was cool,” Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt boasted earlier this year. Stitt created a “DOGE-OK” office by executive order in February, which he specified would be “dedicated to President Trump's vision for federal regulatory and budgetary reform in coordination and partnership with the State of Oklahoma.”

Taking a page out of Musk's book, DOGE-OK maintains a list of alleged cost-saving cuts made by state agencies. Stitt has said he wants to scrutinize any spending “more than a ham sandwich,” and many of the listed items are in fact small: One agency ended three laptop leases, another canceled contracts for a cell phone and iPad, and a third saved $600 by terminating a fax line.

More concerningly, Stitt proudly announced in April that DOGE-OK has recommended the state return $157 million in “wasteful” federal health grants, including funding for diabetes prevention, childhood vaccination, and services for children who are deaf or hard of hearing. The nonpartisan think tank Oklahoma Policy Institute cautioned against slashing this spending, noting that Oklahoma ranks 47th in overall health metrics and 45th in children's health. The organization's executive director warned: “Short-term savings will lead to far greater costs in the future, both in dollars and lives.”

“These efforts are not new, but this new [DOGE] brand gives them cover to enact changes that would otherwise be condemned as abuses of power.”

Even Republican legislators expressed misgivings about returning the federal health funds at a press conference following the report's release. At the conference, Oklahoma House Speaker Kyle Hilbert noted the legislature was also hearing of cuts to agencies that could cost the state in the long run, such as firing employees only to replace them with expensive contractors. What's more, Hilbert said, some contracts are being retroactively revised for services already rendered, a practice he called “bad business” which “just sets us up in a terrible position in any potential lawsuits.”

Even as they question some of Stitt's cuts, Hilbert and the Republican legislature support the overall DOGE ideology. In May, the Oklahoma legislature passed two bills granting itself oversight over agency regulations, including a REINS-style Act.

But not all Oklahomans are on board with the DOGE agenda. When DOGE-OK launched a portal soliciting public feedback on government “inefficiency,” people flooded it with trolling submissions, including song lyrics or expletives directed at Stitt or Musk. Many suggested firing Ryan Walters, the state superintendent who last year directed every teacher in the state to teach the Bible.

One anonymous poster suggested: “Focus more on helping residents of Oklahoma (who pay your salary, just for the record) than boot-licking Donald Trump and Elon Musk. This is getting embarrassing.”

Stitt is not the only governor flaunting his track record of slashing government in the name of efficiency. “I like to say we were doing DOGE before DOGE was a thing,” Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in her January Condition of the State address. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used similar language in February, boasting: “I say we were DOGE before DOGE was cool.”

State DOGE efforts tend to concentrate power in the hands of conservative governors — or in some cases, conservative legislatures.

DeSantis, who has long sought to increase state power in Florida, created a DOGE task force by executive order that extends his authority over local governments and public institutions. In addition to cutting 70 state boards and commissions, his task force's stated goals are to audit and “expose bloat” within local governments, and return “unused or surplus” federal funds. The task force also instructed public college and university presidents to hand over massive amounts of information on staff research, publications, grants, and research funding, and has suggested it may request course syllabi in the near future.

Florida lawmakers have also proposed eliminating the office of lieutenant governor entirely, and replacing it with a cabinet position titled “commissioner of government efficiency.”

The political dynamics are different in Kentucky, where an overwhelmingly Republican legislature is using DOGE tactics to usurp power from Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat. In floor debate over a REINS-style act, which would give the legislature oversight over executive regulations, House Majority Floor Leader Steven Rudy explicitly stated that the bill's intent was to concentrate power in the hands of the state legislature. “It is about a reset to make sure and remove all doubt that the most powerful branch of government is [the legislature],” he alleged.

Governor Beshear vetoed the legislation in March, calling Rudy's claim of legislative superiority “contrary to the United States and Kentucky Constitutions, which recognize three equal branches of government.” The legislature overrode Beshear's veto three days later.

Similar dynamics played out last year in Kansas, when the Republican legislature overrode the veto of Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, to pass similar REINS-style legislation.

Several state DOGE efforts promise to increase “efficiency” with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) — although EPI cautions that “the underlying agenda is to usurp the investigatory authority of civil servants and replace it with untested technological tools that lack accountability.”

In North Carolina, pending legislation would instruct the office of the state auditor, a Republican, to use AI to recommend government offices and jobs to cut. Democrats in the state legislature warned that AI should not be trusted to make these sorts of recommendations in congressional debate in April. Democratic Sen. Sophia Chitlik reminded her colleagues that a University of North Carolina initiative to study youth vaping was recently canceled “because their NIH (National Institutes of Health) grant had the word equity in it.” She added: “We do not need to look any further than our state for examples of what happens when you let an algorithm take control of our workplace.”

“While some states have put forth performative bills that didn't get anywhere, other states fully mirrored the federal DOGE in hypocrisy and bureaucracy, adding another agency that just consolidates power into the hands of bad actors.”

Other state-level DOGE initiatives have similarly touted AI as a cost-saving tool. Florida DOGE plans to use it not only to identify and “cut unnecessary spending and eliminate bureaucracy” within state agencies, but to interfere with county governments as well. In March, the task force sent a letter to local governments throughout the state, requesting their financial information, and announcing plans to use “advanced technology to identify, review, and report on unnecessary spending within county and municipal governments.”

Meanwhile in Wisconsin, Republican Rep. Amanda Nedweski, who is leading a new DOGE congressional committee, told Stateline her committee will seek to increase state efficiency through AI. Emily Schmitt, a businesswoman appointed by the governor to lead a DOGE committee in Iowa, made similar statements to Business Insider. And in Oklahoma, DOGE-OK claims that “modernization efforts” have already saved 100,000 staff hours.

Advocates are pushing back on the idea that a well-run government is one that cuts as much spending as possible.

“‘Efficiency,' reduced to cost savings alone without consideration of effectiveness, doesn't lead to ‘more and better' service — whether within public agencies or outsourced private contractors,” noted the nonprofit In The Public Interest (ITPI) in a March briefing. ITPI contrasts what it calls “smart efficiencies” — such as making the most of innovative technologies, improving processes, and employing people with expertise — with “extractive efficiencies,” like slashing staffing levels, cutting compensation, and reducing service availability.

“One person's concept of waste is another person's vital service,” William Glasgall, a public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that aims to support public sector workers, told Stateline. He noted that government services are not designed to operate like for-profit companies.

Instead, if politicians are interested in eliminating government waste, Glasgall suggests they look at tax breaks, incentives, and abatements, which his organization estimates cost state governments $1 trillion a year.

As is apparent at the federal level — where brutal DOGE government cuts were followed by a Republican spending bill that amounts to a massive, expensive giveaway to the wealthy — cutting government services in the name of “efficiency” is often really about funding tax cuts.

This holds true in the states. Iowa Governor Reynolds boasts about her state's spending cuts: Over the past several years, she oversaw the elimination of 21 of 37 executive-level cabinet agencies, as well as cutting 600 open positions and 1,200 regulations. But over the same timeframe, Iowa has drastically slashed taxes for the wealthy while underfunding public services.

Iowa Democrats also point to the hypocrisy of Reynolds's plans to root out so-called “waste” by creating a new “advisory body” made up of business leaders. They note that in 2023, Reynolds signed legislation stripping power from the state auditor, an elected government watchdog who happens to be a Democrat. “We have someone who has a whole office whose job is to work on this,” State Rep. Adam Zabner pointed out to Stateline. “I think we're more likely to find efficiencies through the state auditor who Iowans elected to that role than we are through a major supporter of the governor's campaigns.”

And in many states where DOGE efforts are underway, critics call it ironic to create a whole new bureaucratic department, in the name of rooting out inefficiency.

“While some states have put forth performative bills that didn't get anywhere, other states fully mirrored the federal DOGE in hypocrisy and bureaucracy, adding another agency that just consolidates power into the hands of bad actors,” Jasmine Payne-Patterson, senior state policy strategist at EPI, told Truthout.

In Texas, for example, legislation creating a Texas Regulatory Efficiency Office (TREO) was signed into law in April. Gov. Greg Abbott promised the law — which is largely a deregulation measure — would “make government more efficient and less costly,” by identifying “unnecessary and ineffective rules.” The law also states that Texas courts do not have to defer to a state agency's interpretation of the law, following in the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of the Chevron doctrine. Yet despite promising efficiency and lowered spending, the TREO office comes at an expected cost of $22.8 million over the next five years.

“The point of DOGE is to cut government, reduce spending and shrink the bureaucracy,” one Republican Texas representative said on the House floor, in opposition to TREO. “Unfortunately, this bill does the exact opposite.”

In Oklahoma, one submitter made a similar point in Governor Stitt's efficiency feedback portal: “Let's make Oklahoma more efficient by not inventing a whole bureaucracy whose mission is to stop other bureaucracies from being bureaucratic. Bold idea — I know. But sometimes the most efficient thing to do is … nothing.”

Russian forces have occupied the villages of Zelenyi Kut and Novoukrainka in Donetsk Oblast, located near the administrative border with Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the battlefield monitoring platform DeepState reported on July 5.

Russian forces are attempting to push further west, according to DeepState.

Donetsk Oblast has been a central battlefield since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 in Ukraine. While Dnipropetrovsk Oblast lies further west and has not seen significant Russian incursions, it is frequently targeted with missile, drone, and aerial bomb strikes.

Russian troops have been escalating their assaults in the area and are attempting to breach into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

"The situation around Dachne is pretty intense," DeepState wrote on Telegram, referring to the nearby front-line settlement in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. 

Ukrainian forces have deployed reinforcements, but Russian units, relying on numerical advantage and constant infantry assaults, have breached some defenses in the area, DeepState said.

Ukraine's military has not officially confirmed the loss of the settlements. 

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed Novoukrainka was captured as early as June 29, though that assertion was not independently confirmed at the time.

On July 2, Ukraine dismissed Russian claims of advancing into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, calling them disinformation. It said that a small Russian reconnaissance unit briefly entered the village of Dachne, took photos with a Russian flag, and was then "eliminated."

Ukrainian military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said in mid-June that Russia was escalating attacks in the Novopavlivka sector — in the western part of Donetsk Oblast — and trying to breach into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. 

DeepState analysts suggest Moscow views an incursion into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast as symbolically significant and a propaganda opportunity, while for Ukraine, holding the administrative line is a strategic priority.

BlackRock, a U.S. investment firm, suspended work on its multibillion-dollar Ukraine recovery fund following U.S. President Donald Trump's election victory, prompting France to work on a replacement, Bloomberg reported on July 5.

The facility develops and manufactures Kometa adaptive antenna arrays used in Shahed-type drones, Iskander-K cruise missiles, and guided aerial bomb modules, according to the Ukrainian military.

Russian troops have been escalating their assaults in the area and are attempting to breach into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which has not seen significant Russian incursions since 2022. 

Russian troops are ramping up attacks in the sector using large numbers of troops, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said.

Fires broke out across the city as Russia attacked the capital overnight on July 4. At least 23 people have been injured, with 14 of the victims hospitalized. 

"Who is behind those attacks is clear to all of us here," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

Moscow is organizing the deployment of a combined unit of military engineers from the Lao People's Armed Forces to Russia's Kursk Oblast, allegedly to help with demining operations, Ukraine's military intelligence said.

Russia launched 322 drones overnight, including Iranian-designed Shahed-type attack drones, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

The airfield hosts Su-34, Su-35S, and Su-30SM jets that Russia regularly uses in air strikes against Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian military.

"It just seems like he wants to go all the way and just keep killing people. It's not good," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

Pressure grows on Pedro Sánchez to call snap election as latest resignation adds to corruption allegations

Pedro Sánchez's efforts to reset Spain's ruling socialist party after damaging corruption allegations that threatened to topple his coalition government have suffered a severe setback after a party official resigned over accusations of sexual harassment.

The prime minister had hoped this weekend's meeting of the federal committee of his Spanish Socialist Workers' party (PSOE) would help the party move past weeks of scandals that have undermined the ethical and anti-corruption pledges on which it came to power seven years ago.

But such hopes were flattened late on Friday night after the online newspaper elDiario published allegations from various female PSOE workers who said they had been subjected to sexual harassment by Francisco Salazar, who oversaw institutional coordination at the Moncloa palace, the office and official residence of the prime minister.

The accusations prompted Salazar to announce on Saturday that he was stepping down from that post and from his new role as a deputy in the PSOE's organisational secretariat.

He told elDiario he could not recall any inappropriate interactions. “I've racked my brains over it and it seems mind-boggling to me,” he said. “I keep wondering if I've screwed up and said something inappropriate to a workmate, and the truth is, I can't find [an example].”

Sources at Moncloa, in Madrid, said an investigation had been launched, but added that no official complaints had so far been made against Salazar.

On Saturday, Sánchez apologised again for what he called his misplaced confidence in those accused of wrongdoing, adding: “I was wrong to place my trust in people who didn't deserve it, but we won't fall short in a time of democratic regeneration.”

The prime minister, who is under growing pressure to call a snap election, said he had no intention of stepping down.

“The captain doesn't shirk his responsibility when the sea gets rough; he stays put to ride out the storm and guide the ship to port,” he said.

Salazar's resignation is the latest blow to the prime minister's authority and judgment.

On Monday, Santos Cerdán – who served as the PSOE's organisational secretary and was Sánchez' right-hand man – was remanded in custody after a supreme court judge found “firm evidence” of his possible involvement in taking kickbacks on public construction contracts.

The investigation began after the Guardia Civil police anti-corruption unit handed material to the court that suggested Cerdán had discussed taking such kickbacks with the former PSOE transport minister José Luis Ábalos and one of the minister's aides, Koldo García. Ábalos and García are also under investigation and have denied wrongdoing. Cerdán, who stepped down from his party role and resigned his parliamentary seat shortly after the news broke, has vowed to clear his name.

Sánchez, who became prime minister in 2018 after using a motion of no confidence to turf the corruption-mired conservative People's party (PP) out of government, is already contending with graft investigations relating to his wife and his brother, who deny any wrongdoing. A former PSOE member was also recently implicated in an alleged smear campaign against the Guardia Civil unit investigating the corruption allegations.

The PP said the latest allegations were further proof of the prime minister's poor judgment and his unfitness to lead the country.

“He has no credibility and his supposed fight against corruption and sexism is mere posturing,” PP sources said on Saturday. “Sánchez is as good at being prime minister as he is at talent-spotting. Either there aren't many decent people in his party or he's not very good at choosing people who deserve to be in Spanish politics.”

Calls for a fresh election are also beginning to bubble up within some sections of the socialist party. Emiliano García-Page, the PSOE president of the Castilla-La Mancha region, said the time had come to let parliament and the people have their say.

According to elDiario, García-Page used Saturday's party meeting to ask Sánchez to consider holding a confidence vote in parliament. “I don't know if we'll win it,” he said. “But if we don't, then don't rule out the option of calling an election.”

The spiritual leader has said his inner circle of monks will find an heir, but China believes the choice is in its hands

Few celebrations have the hills of Dharamshala abuzz like the birthday of the Dalai Lama. But this year, as monks and devotees flooded into the mountainous Indian city before the Tibetan spiritual leader turns 90 on Sunday, the mood of anticipation has been palpable.

For years, the Dalai Lama had promised that around his 90th birthday he would make a long-awaited announcement about his reincarnation. Finally, in a video broadcast to Tibetan monks and leaders on Wednesday, he laid out what the future would hold. It came amid fears of a ruthless succession battle between the Tibetan community and the Chinese government, which for decades has sought to control the institution of the Dalai Lama, revered as the highest teacher in Tibetan Buddhism.

Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, confirmed he would remain in the role until he died. Then, as per centuries of tradition, he would be reincarnated, and only his inner circle – a trust of closely allied monks – would have the “sole authority” to locate his successor; an often lengthy process to track down a child in which his spirit has been reborn.

“No one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,” the Dalai Lama told his monks.

The announcement ended years of speculation that, in an attempt to prevent Chinese interference, the Dalai Lama might put forward an alternative mode of reincarnation, such as transferring his spiritual essence to a successor who could be found while he was still alive. To the great worry of many in the Tibetan diaspora, he had even hinted that he may not reincarnate at all.

The Dalai Lama's latest statement was a clear defiance of the Communist party in China, which has long held the view that only it has the authority to decide the next Dalai Lama and has even enshrined the right into Chinese law.

However, Tansen Sen, a scholar of Indo-Chinese relations and Buddhism, noted that the Dalai Lama's message struck a more diplomatic tone than some of his previous statements. In earlier writings, he had said the 15th Dalai Lama would be born in the “free world” – taken to mean outside China – but this time he did not repeat that.

“I see this as a very strategically handled announcement which avoided ruffling China's feathers too much,” said Sen. “The Dalai Lama is not only a religious leader, he is also a shrewd thinker and I think he realises that there are larger issues at play, particularly that he is caught geopolitically between India and China.”

However, China's sensitivity over the issue was evident in the absence of the Dalai Lama's statement from all Chinese or Tibetan media. “China's propaganda managers seem very reticent for this news to reach Tibetans or even Chinese,” said Robert Barnett, a scholar of Tibetan history at Soas University of London. “Presumably that's because Chinese leaders fear a popular outpouring of support for the Dalai Lama, or they are struggling to agree on how to respond.”

China invaded and took control of the autonomous region of Tibet in 1950. After a failed uprising by Tibetans in 1959, China threatened to arrest the Dalai Lama – who acted as a religious and political leader – forcing him into exile in India.

After his perilous escape across the Himalayas, in April 1959 the Dalai Lama met the then-Indian prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who declared – against much opposition within his own government – that the Tibetan spiritual leader “should be allowed to live in peace” in India.

Since then, the Dalai Lama, along with other Tibetan religious leaders, civilians and parliamentarians in exile, have established their political and religious headquarters in Dharamshala, high in the Himalayan mountains.

From his outpost, the Dalai Lama has been both a religious leader and a tireless and highly effective global advocate for the Tibetan cause and community over the past 66 years. He has vocally resisted calls by China for it to have any say over the institution of the Dalai Lama or to meddle in the succession process.

Within greater Tibet, home to 6 million people, Chinese authorities have imposed increasingly draconian measures and censorship to try to crush the influence of the Dalai Lama, including banning images of him.

Beijing has described the Dalai Lama as a “wolf in monk's clothing” and views him as a dissident and separatist, even as he advocated for greater Tibetan autonomy within China, rather than full independence.

Chinese efforts are widely seen to have failed, and as the Dalai Lama's international profile has grown – he has a Nobel peace prize and millions of devotees, including some of the world's biggest celebrities – he remains more revered than ever.

His presence as a constant thorn in the side of Chinese efforts to impose complete homogeneity over Tibet means officials have become increasingly determined to control what happens when he dies. In a statement after the Dalai Lama's announcement this week – which was only published in English – the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said his successor “must be chosen by drawing lots from a golden urn and approved by the central government”.

Analysts have widely agreed the most likely scenario after the death of the Dalai Lama is that two successors will be appointed; one located by Tibetan monks, as per tradition, probably outside China and recognised by the Tibetan community in exile, and another selected by the Chinese Communist party from within China.

Over the decades, the Dalai Lama's presence in Dharamshala and the free movement he is afforded by India has remained a source of tension in Indo-Chinese relations. Yet since 2020, when border tensions erupted into violent skirmishes, it appeared the Indian government, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, began to see the Tibet issue as a direct form of leverage over China. China has emphasised that any country that interferes in the Dalai Lama reincarnation will be sanctioned – a message seen to be directed at India.

In a notable break from convention, this week India's minister of minority affairs, Kiren Rijiju, himself a Buddhist, said publicly that reincarnation of the Dalai Lama “is to be decided by the established convention and as per the wish of the Dalai Lama himself. Nobody else has the right to decide it except him.”

China's foreign ministry instantly called on India to “stop using Tibet issues to interfere in China's domestic affairs”.

Amitabh Mathur, a former adviser on Tibet to the Indian government, said it was highly likely that the Dalai Lama's office would have pre-informed New Delhi of the reincarnation announcement, and that Rijiju's statement would not have been made without consulting senior ministries. “It certainly goes above and beyond what has been said by India before,” said Mathur.

He suggested the geopolitical challenges over the Dalai Lama were likely to become more complicated after his death, particularly if the Tibetan officials located his reincarnation inside India, in defiance of China's own possible selection.

Tibetan officials have confirmed that unofficial back channels remained open with the Chinese and that the Dalai Lama was doing all he could to prevent the 600-year-old Tibetan Buddhist institution being hijacked by Chinese political interests. “He's viewing these things from a very practical lens,” said Mathur. “Don't forget, the Dalai Lama is as well versed in statecraft as he is in spiritual matters.”

Nonetheless, as he led prayers on the eve of his birthday, the Tibetan leader – who appeared in good health – emphasised that he did not foresee his death coming any time soon. “I hope,” he said, “to live another 30 or 40 years.”

On Canada's East Coast, lobster poutine, sangria and the gift of solitude are found on the Îles-de-la-Madeleine

In the summer of 1915, while the rest of the world was consumed by war, the people of Old-Harry on the Îles-de-la-Madeleine were busy making plans for a new church. But they needed wood, no small challenge in a largely treeless place where building supplies are limited. 

Within a few months, their prayers were answered. A Norwegian freighter carrying a load of timber ran aground on nearby Brion Island during a storm. As if by divine intervention, construction on St. Peter's-by-the-Sea Church began soon after. 

The universe has long smiled on the people of these islands, called Madelinots, who have survived for centuries against all odds on this windswept, crescent-shaped archipelago of sand dunes, beaches and rugged cliffs. More than 500 ships have been wrecked on the dangerous shoals that surround the islands, providing important supplies to build homes, schooners and, yes, even churches.

An old fishing boat rests near St. Peter's-­by-the-­Sea Church on GrosseÎle.

I travelled to the islands with an old friend, for the first time, in June. We'd both grown up in the Maritimes and yet as anglophones, the Maggies – just a five-hour ferry ride north of Prince Edward Island – might as well have been a far-off foreign country. While it's long been a part of Quebec and a summer playground for francophones for decades, most of my English-speaking friends who I told about the trip had to Google where it was. 

The Gulf of St. Lawrence, with its storms, blinding fog and endless wind, is also the thing that makes the place, called the Magdalen Islands in English, so special. Separated from North America by this massive body of water, the sea feels like a buffer from the rest of the world. You feel it as soon as the 750-person car ferry pulls away from the harbour in Souris, PEI. 

It's wash day for this resident of La Grave on Havre-­Aubert.

Once aboard the CTMA Traversier, no one is talking about Donald Trump, tariffs or war in the Middle East. The concerns are more localized: getting the sangria to their seats on the sundeck before the fiddle band begins to play. Suddenly, in this environment, lobster poutine with Hollandaise sauce seems like a perfectly reasonable breakfast choice. 

“When you get on that boat, you leave your troubles back on the wharf,” said Frédéric Myrand, an islander who left for school but returned as an adult. 

Most Madelinots are French-speaking descendants of Acadians kicked out of the Maritimes by the British during the Expulsion in the mid-1700s, people who long ago learned how to adapt to the sea. Many from the small anglophone minority are the descendants of survivors of shipwrecks. They've lived through hurricanes, fishery collapses and isolation, things that have given islanders a determined sense of self-reliance. 

“It's all part of the deal with living here,” Michel Boudreau, manager of the Musée de la Mer, a local history museum in the quaint village of La Grave, told me. 

The payoff is a place that's often tranquil and unspoiled, unique and foreign enough without needing a passport. Outside of the busy months of July and August, it's easy to find a beach all to yourself, an empty table at great restaurants or breathtaking hiking and bicycle trails you don't need to share with anyone else. No wonder the poet Georges Langford called Bird Rock, the landmark island once famous as a graveyard for ships, the “exact address of solitude.”

Home to more than 12,000 people, tourism has become a major industry. Prior to the arrival of modern ferry boats in the 1970s, with their drive-on, drive-off service, you had to pay to have your vehicle hoisted onto a cargo ship and steamed to the islands. More than 63,500 visitors came to the islands in 2023, mostly by ferry. Because of self-imposed American travel boycotts this year, they're expecting a jump in Canadian visitors. 

We got by with our limited French, but unilingual English-speakers shouldn't be concerned about language here. Most Madelinots are by nature friendly and welcoming, and many will switch to broken English if you ask. When we sat down on the grass outside Café des Lupins, surrounded by dozens of tattooed twentysomething hipsters sipping lattes and natural wines, no one blinked at the sight of a pair of middle-aged anglos crashing the party. 

The café served up delicious sandwiches, along with cans of a local blonde ale made with sea water, brewed nearby at a converted crab processing factory. It was a perfect moment, like we'd somehow walked onto the set of a tourism commercial.

Everywhere, there were pleasant surprises when it was time to eat. Seal poutine at Café de la Grave in Havre-Aubert. Excellent lobster and salmon sushi from a food trailer by the beach. Roasted halibut at Resto Bistro Accents. A steaming bowl of chowder served in a former convent, packed with more scallops than a wharf in Digby, N.S. 

Seafood has long been an important part of the Madelinot diet, even as the ocean changes around them. There used to be so much herring around the islands that the big bay turned white when the fish returned for their spring spawn. Today, there's only one smokehouse, Le Fumoir d'Antan, still preparing fish in the old artisanal style, a three-month process done inside wooden barns built in the 1940s. They have to ship their herring in from Newfoundland now, after decades of overfishing and climate change have upended this once-bustling fishery.

“It's always evolving, but it's important to us to keep this alive,” said Éloi Arseneau, the fourth generation in his family to run the smokehouse, which gives daily tours and also sells a wide range of smoked seafood. 

Eloi Arseneau sets fires to smoke herring inside the smokehouse, Fumoir d'Antan.

Almost every Madelinot has stories about how quickly the changing climate is altering their islands, where storms can reshape sandstone cliffs and make dunes disappear. When Hurricane Fiona tore through here in 2022, it washed away bike paths and beaches, clawed at the highway and flooded Cindy Poirier's paddling shop and café, called Cindyhook Sports Adventures. 

“It can be stressful sometimes, but we have no choice. We have to adapt,” Poirier told me. “It's what we've always done.” 

Most Madelinots are French-speaking descendants of Acadians kicked out of the Maritimes by the British during the Expulsion in the mid-1700s.

Visitors can fly to the islands from Montreal and Quebec City, but there's something about the five-hour ferry voyage from Prince Edward Island that is part of the Maggies' appeal. Entry Island, an English-speaking community accessible by pedestrian ferry, emerges from the sea like a beacon as you approach the archipelago. Crossings cost $110 per car and $59 per adult each way in the high season. Reservations are recommended. Travellers should show up 75 minutes before departure.

We stayed at the Château Madelinot, a newly renovated hotel that's a short drive from the ferry terminal in Cap-aux-Meules. It has clean rooms, ocean views and a good top-floor restaurant that overlooks the sea. Rooms start at $197 a night, more in July and August.

Stop at Café de la Grave, housed inside a restored general store in Havre-Aubert, which has been serving up local seafood since 1980. The seal meat is slow-cooked, giving it a consistency like pulled pork, but with a mild gamey taste not unlike deer. At night, musicians sidle up to the piano and guests pack into the space for spontaneous jam sessions. It's a quintessential Îles-de-la-Madeleine experience.

When the phone call came on June 30 notifying him that President Donald Trump had just signed a presidential permit authorizing his “little LLC from Texas” to build a cross-border pipeline in Montana to import Canadian oil, it was no surprise to Mike Dubuisson and his partners at Junction Pipeline Company.

“We weren't surprised—we were shocked,” he said, recalling the early morning call from the State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources Policy Adviser Marcus Lee.

LONDON, July 5. /TASS/. Israel has not disclosed information about Iran's successful strikes on five military targets, including a large airbase, The Daily Telegraph reported, citing an analysis of satellite data conducted by researchers at Oregon State University.

According to the newspaper, six Iranian missiles hit five targets in northern, southern, and central Israel, including an intelligence gathering center and a logistics base. The Daily Telegraph noted that Iran had struck more than 40 Israeli infrastructure targets as a result of the 12-day conflict.

The Israel Defense Forces did not comment on reports of hits on military bases. In turn, The Daily Telegraph said that Israeli and US air defense systems intercepted about 84% of the missiles.

In the early morning hours of June 13, Israel launched a military operation against Iran. Less than 24 hours later, Iran retaliated. Nine days later, on the morning of June 22, US jets attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities, entering the conflict. The following evening, Tehran launched a missile strike on Al Udeid, the largest US military airbase in the region, located in Qatar. According to the US authorities, there were no casualties or significant damage.

On June 24, Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a complete ceasefire. The Israeli authorities confirmed that they had accepted the US proposal and announced that they had completed all objectives in their operation against Iran. In turn, Tehran said that it had achieved a victory over Tel Aviv by forcing it to unilaterally halt its aggression. The ceasefire has been in effect since June 24.

Russia is seeking to involve Laos in its war against Ukraine under the pretense of humanitarian cooperation, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) claimed on July 5.

According to the agency, Moscow is organizing the deployment of a combined unit of military engineers from the Lao People's Armed Forces to Russia's Kursk Oblast, allegedly to help with demining operations.

Ukraine initially captured 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory during a cross-border offensive to Kursk Oblast but lost most of it during a Russian counteroffensive this year, which was supported by North Korean troops.

Laotian authorities have reportedly agreed to send up to 50 engineers to support Russian efforts. In addition, Laos is said to be offering free rehabilitation services to wounded Russian soldiers.

"Russia, under the guise of humanitarian rhetoric, is trying to legalize the presence of foreign military contingents on its territory, effectively using them to wage war against Ukraine," HUR said.

This comes amid broader efforts by the Kremlin to recruit foreign personnel. Russia has drawn heavily on fighters from Asia and Africa, as well as North Korea.

Ukraine has captured multiple foreigners fighting for Russian forces. an April investigation by Russian independent outlet Important Stories identified more than 1,500 foreign fighters from 48 countries who had joined Russia's war.

Laos, a landlocked Southeast Asian country bordering China, Vietnam, and Thailand, has not commented on HUR's claim. The country maintains close ties with both Moscow and its ally Beijing.

BlackRock, a U.S. investment firm, suspended work on its multibillion-dollar Ukraine recovery fund following U.S. President Donald Trump's election victory, prompting France to work on a replacement, Bloomberg reported on July 5.

The facility develops and manufactures Kometa adaptive antenna arrays used in Shahed-type drones, Iskander-K cruise missiles, and guided aerial bomb modules, according to the Ukrainian military.

Russian troops have been escalating their assaults in the area and are attempting to breach into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which has not seen significant Russian incursions since 2022. 

Russian troops are ramping up attacks in the sector using large numbers of troops, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said.

Fires broke out across the city as Russia attacked the capital overnight on July 4. At least 23 people have been injured, with 14 of the victims hospitalized. 

"Who is behind those attacks is clear to all of us here," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

Some passengers reported waiting more than 10 hours, according to the pro-Kremlin Telegram channel Shot.

Moscow is organizing the deployment of a combined unit of military engineers from the Lao People's Armed Forces to Russia's Kursk Oblast, allegedly to help with demining operations, Ukraine's military intelligence said.

Russia launched 322 drones overnight, including Iranian-designed Shahed-type attack drones, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

The airfield hosts Su-34, Su-35S, and Su-30SM jets that Russia regularly uses in air strikes against Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian military.

"It just seems like he wants to go all the way and just keep killing people. It's not good," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

The number includes 1,050 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day, according to the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte presided over the handover, commending outgoing U.S. Army General Christopher G. Cavoli for his contributions to modernizing NATO's collective defense and bolstering support for Ukraine.

Moldovan President Maia Sandu hopes her pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) will retain its parliamentary majority in the September 28 elections. 

"The US has to make sure that the stockpiles are at the level we need for the U.S. to have, because they are crucial for our collective defense," Rutte told reporters on July 4. "At the same time, of course, we hope for the flexibility, we have to make sure also that Ukraine can move forward."

The Sean “Diddy” Combs verdict does not mean MeToo is dying as most sexual assault cases are settled privately, America's most prominent female lawyer has said.

The music mogul was this week acquitted on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering after two of his ex-girlfriends, including the R&B singer Cassie Ventura, testified he coerced them into having sex with male escorts.

Combs, 55, was convicted on two lesser charges of transportation for prostitution.

But Gloria Allred, who is representing several of Combs's alleged victims, including two who have filed civil lawsuits, said the outcome is symptomatic of a waning MeToo movement.

“Nobody should judge the MeToo movement based on what happens in a criminal case,” Ms Allred, who also represented a number of Harvey Weinstein's accusers said.

“Criminal cases are rare, and most of the civil lawsuits that we do and the confidential settlements never result in a criminal case.”

Speaking exclusively to The Telegraph, she added: “There are many, many more civil lawsuits than there are criminal cases. In addition to that, we do many more confidential settlements without a lawsuit than even civil lawsuits, so it's [MeToo] alive and well.”

Around 70 lawsuits have been filed against Combs, including two by Ms Allred's clients: Joi Dickerson-Neal, who alleges the star drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1991, and Thalia Graves, who claims she was drugged and raped by Combs 10 years later.

Combs has denied all the allegations against him.

During her famed career spanning more than 50 years Ms Allred has represented alleged victims of the rich and powerful, including Bill Cosby, Donald Trump, R Kelly and Mohamed Al-Fayed.

Her clients include an unknown number of Weinstein's accusers, including Miriam Haley, who the disgraced film mogul was found guilty of sexually assaulting in his New York criminal retrial last month.

When Mr Trump won the election in November, some feared electing a man who had been found liable for sexual abuse marked the end of the MeToo movement, which sprung up after more than 80 women came forward claiming they had been raped or sexual assaulted by Weinstein.

Following the latest Weinstein verdict, which acquitted the disgraced producer of one count of sexual assault and resulted in a mistrial for his rape charge, Ms Allred, said: “For those of you in the press who have predicted that the MeToo movement might be dead, that obituary was obviously premature.”

Ms Allred insists victims are still contacting her firm Allred, Maroko & Goldberg, which she describes as the most prominent women's rights law firm in the country, every day.

“We won over a billion dollars in the years that we've been in practice for victims, so I am not concerned that this is going to deter victims,” she said.

“Maybe they won't want to perhaps report to law enforcement, but they still want accountability, they still want justice, they can all get that through a civil case, lawsuit or a confidential settlement,” she added.

Several of the witnesses who testified against Combs had pending civil lawsuits against the mogul, including Dawn Richard, who is represented by Ms Allred's daughter Lisa Bloom.

Ventura, 38, settled her civil suit against Combs within 24 hours of filing. She was paid $30 million by the Bad Boy Entertainment founder.

Last year, lawyer Tony Buzbee, who is representing dozens of Combs's alleged victims, claimed several high-profile celebrities had settled with victims quietly before to avoid being named in a public lawsuit.

This week a judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Jay-Z, real name Shawn Carter, accusing Mr Buzbee of trying to blackmail him with false claims of sexual misconduct.

Carter sued after Mr Buzbee contacted the star about a complaint from an anonymous accuser who alleged that Carter and Combs sexually abused her.Mr Buzbee then filed a lawsuit accusing Carter and Combs of raping the alleged victim when she was 13. The lawsuit was later withdrawn by the accuser.

There is still a separate lawsuit pending which Carter filed against Mr Buzbee in federal court in Alabama.

Following the Combs trial, which included showing the Manhattan court CCTV footage of the star beating Ventura at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles, Ms Allred said she plans to propose legislation stating that women cannot legally consent to sex if they are beaten before or after the act.

“We all saw the video, he beat her, he dragged her back, and if that's not force, if that's not coercion, I don't know what is,” she said.

Discussing her recommended legislation, she said: “In the same way that if... a woman is under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, she could not, from a legal point of view, does not have the capacity to consent to a sex act.”She added: “I'm proposing that if a woman is beaten, a victim of domestic violence before or after the sexual assault, it should be considered that she couldn't consent to it.

“And so that's what I'm going to propose to legislators to change the law, so hopefully something good can come out of this.”

            The Supreme Court's decision Thursday to weigh in on transgender sports bans will put two conservative justices in the spotlight in coming months, both because of what they have said in past cases involving LGBTQ rights – and what they haven't.
    


            Only two justices have written majority opinions involving transgender Americans – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch – and both avoided revealing their thoughts about the sports cases last month when, in a blockbuster ruling, the Supreme Court upheld Tennessee's ban on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans youth.
    


            For the second time in as many years the high court will wrestle with a heated legal dispute involving young transgender Americans at a time when they are facing severe political backlash driven in part by President Donald Trump and conservative states. The court agreed to hear appeals in two related cases challenging laws in West Virginia and Idaho that ban transgender girls and women from competing on women's sports teams – including one that was filed by a middle school student at the time.
    


             While the court swerved around fundamental questions about trans rights in last month's decision in US v. Skrmetti, it will be far harder to do so in the sports cases.
    


            And that could put enormous focus on Roberts and Gorsuch.
    


            “Even though the court ruled against the transgender plaintiffs in Skrmetti, it did not decide the larger and more important question of whether discrimination based on transgender status triggers more searching judicial review,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
    


            “Everything,” Vladeck predicted, “is going to come down to where Roberts and Gorsuch are.”
    


            In some ways, the Supreme Court's 6-3 decision on June 18 upholding Tennessee's ban on certain transgender care was limited. That opinion, written by Roberts, explicitly declined to decide if the law discriminated against transgender youth. Tennessee's policy, Roberts reasoned, instead drew boundaries based on age and medical procedures that were well within a state's power to regulate.
    


            That logic avoided thorny questions about whether the law violated the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause if it specifically targeted transgender minors for different treatment.
    


            Tennessee's law, Roberts wrote, “classifies on the basis of age” and “classifies on the basis of medical use.”
    


            But it will be more difficult for the court to duck those broader questions in the sports cases, several experts said.
    


            “It is notable that the court seemed to go out of its way to avoid endorsing the idea that the law discriminated against transgender people and instead found that the Tennessee law had drawn lines based on age and medical diagnoses,” said Suzanne Goldberg, a Columbia Law School professor and an expert on gender and sexuality law.
    


            “The new cases squarely present the discrimination questions in ways that will be hard to avoid,” she said.
    


            “It's important,” she said, “not to lose sight of the fact that these cases involve kids trying to make their way through school and life like every other kid.”
    


            Gorsuch, who was Trump's first nominee to the Supreme Court, joined the majority opinion in the Tennessee case but did not write separately to explain his position.
    


            His silence was significant given that one of the key arguments at stake was how – or whether – to apply the landmark 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County that he authored. In that decision, the court ruled that transgender workers are covered by federal protections against discrimination based on sex  because discrimination against a transgender person is, by extension, necessarily also discrimination based on sex.
    


            The Biden administration and transgender teenagers fighting Tennessee's law asserted that the same logic should apply when it comes to gender identity care bans. But the court has never extended its reasoning in Bostock beyond the workplace, and the decision drew immediate and sharp criticism from the right at the time.
    


            John Bursch, a veteran Supreme Court litigator and senior counsel at the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom, predicted that both Roberts and Gorsuch will ultimately back the state bans on transgender people participating in sports that align with their gender identity given their votes in the Tennessee dispute.
    


            “If they were in agreement that Tennessee's law did not discriminate based on gender identity, I would assume that both of them would come to the same conclusion here when it comes to sports,” Bursch said. “But you never know for sure, and anytime that we go to the court, we assume that all nine justices are in play.”
    


            Alliance Defending Freedom is a co-counsel in both sports cases the Supreme Court agreed to hear.
    


            “Our hope is that we would get a unanimous ruling to protect women's sports in favor of both West Virginia and Idaho in their laws,” Bursch added.
    


            Other members of the court's six-justice conservative wing – including two who are often decisive votes – have more clearly signaled their thoughts on anti-trans laws.
    


            In the Tennessee case, Justice Amy Coney Barrett penned a concurring opinion making clear that she opposed granting transgender status the same anti-discrimination protections that race and sex have under the 14th Amendment. She also was the only member of the court's majority that day to raise sports in an opinion.
    


            “Beyond the treatment of gender dysphoria, transgender status implicates several other areas of legitimate regulatory policy – ranging from access to restrooms to eligibility for boys' and girls' sports teams,” Barrett wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. “If laws that classify based on transgender status necessarily trigger heightened scrutiny, then the courts will inevitably be in the business of ‘closely scrutiniz(ing) legislative choices' in all these domains.”
    


            Justice Samuel Alito wrote a concurrence arguing against extending Bostock's reasoning to constitutional cases.
    


            During oral arguments over Tennessee's law in December, Justice Brett Kavanaugh – another justice who is sometimes seen as a swing vote – mentioned sports as he peppered the lawyer for the Biden administration with skeptical questions about her position.
    


            “If you prevail here,” asked Kavanaugh, who has frequently noted that he coached his daughters' basketball teams, “what would that mean for women's and girls' sports in particular?”
    


            “Would transgender athletes have a constitutional right, as you see it, to play in women's and girls' sports, basketball, swimming, volleyball, track, et cetera, notwithstanding the competitive fairness and safety issues that have been vocally raised by some female athletes?” Kavanaugh pressed.
    


            In response, then-Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar attempted to distinguish the sports cases from Tennessee's law. She noted that some lower courts had already held that the sports bans triggered a higher level of judicial scrutiny.
    


            Kavanaugh also dissented from Gorsuch's decision in Bostock.
    


            The court's three liberals dissented in the Tennessee case, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing that the majority had pulled back from “meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most” and instead “abandons transgender children and their families to political whims.”
    


            In the West Virginia case, then Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, signed the “Save Women's Sports Act” in 2021, banning transgender women and girls from participating on public school sports teams consistent with their gender identity. Becky Pepper-Jackson, a rising sixth grader at the time, who was “looking forward to trying out for the girls' cross-country team,” filed a lawsuit alleging that the ban violated federal law and the Constitution.
    


            The Richmond-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that West Virginia's ban violated Pepper-Jackson's rights under Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at schools that receive federal aid. The court also revived her constitutional challenge of the law.
    


            Two years ago, the Supreme Court denied West Virginia's emergency docket request to let it fully enforce its ban. Alito and Thomas dissented from that decision, though the focus of their objection was that neither the Supreme Court nor the 4th Circuit had offered an explanation for their decisions.
    


            In Idaho, Republican Gov. Brad Little signed the state's sports ban in 2020. Lindsay Hecox, then a freshman at Boise State University, sued days later, saying that she intended to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams and alleging the law violated the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause.
    


            A federal district court blocked the law's enforcement against Hecox months later and the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision last year. Idaho appealed to the Supreme Court in July.
    


            State officials in West Virginia and Idaho praised the court's decision to take up the cases.
    


            “Idaho was the first state to step out and ban boys and men from competing with girls and women in organized athletics,” Little said on Thursday, describing the law as a “common sense” policy intended to “protect the American way of life.”
    


            Lawyers for the transgender athletes described the laws as discriminatory and harmful.
    


            The Supreme Court will likely hear arguments in the cases later this year or in early 2026 and is expected to hand down a decision by the end of June.

Doctors say Israel is blocking deliveries of formula urgently needed as mothers are either dead or too malnourished to feed their babies

Doctors in Gaza have warned that hundreds of babies are at risk of death amid a critical shortage of baby milk, as Israel continues to restrict the humanitarian aid that can enter the beleaguered strip.

Dr Ahmad al-Farra, the head of paediatrics at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, said his ward had only about a week's worth of infant formula remaining. The doctor has already run out of specialised formula meant for premature babies and is forced to use regular formula, rationing it between the infants under his care.

“I can't begin to describe how bad things are. Right now, we have enough formula for about one week. But we also have infants outside the hospital without any access to milk. It's catastrophic,” al-Farra told the Guardian over the phone.

Stocks of infant formula have dwindled in Gaza as Israel has blocked all but a trickle of aid into the Palestinian territory. Food aid that comes through the controversial US-Israeli-backed private company Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) does not include infant formula, according to doctors.

Hanaa al-Taweel, a 27-year-old mother of five living at al-Nuseirat refugee camp, said she was unable to breastfeed as she herself was not getting enough to eat. She has struggled to find infant formula for her 13-month-old child.

“The problem of getting milk started since my son's birth, as due to my malnutrition and general weakness I wasn't able to breastfeed my baby,” al-Taweel said.

Doctors have told her that her son is suffering from stunting due to malnutrition and she has noticed he was developing slower than her other children, who had already begun speaking and walking at his age.

“I try to keep a small piece of bread next to me when he sleeps because he wakes up often asking for food. I feel sadness and fear for my children, I fear they will die from hunger, thirst and disease,” she said.

Already 66 Palestinian children have starved to death since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, according to local health authorities.

Amnesty International accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war against civilians in Gaza, which it said was a tactic intended “to inflict genocide against Palestinians”.

Cogat, the Israeli authority responsible for coordinating humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip, said it does not restrict the entry of baby food, including formula, into the Gaza Strip. The agency added that more than 1,400 tons of baby food had been delivered to Gaza in recent weeks.

Doctors entering Gaza have resorted to packing individual cans of infant formula in their personal luggage. On at least one occasion, Israeli authorities confiscated 10 cans of infant formula from the luggage of an American doctor recently entering Gaza for a medical mission.

“In the end they confiscated all the cans of baby formula, which was specifically formula for pre-term babies. What on earth is baby formula going to do against the security of the state of Israel?” said Dr Diana Nazzal, a Palestinian-German eye surgeon who helped the American doctor pack his bags in a way that would be acceptable to Israeli border authorities.

Nazzal added that many medical staff entering Gaza are filling their bags with calorie-dense foods such as protein bars and nuts, rather than medical supplies.

Infant formula has become more critical as the hunger crisis has worsened in Gaza, with almost 500,000 people facing catastrophic hunger while the rest of the population is experiencing acute food insecurity.

Mothers who are severely malnourished themselves or have been killed are unable to breastfeed, creating a higher need for formula. On the parallel market, what little supply exists has become exorbitantly expensive, with one can of formula going for about $50 – 10 times the normal price.

“I was able to breastfeed her naturally for one month, but due to lack of food I could no longer continue,” said Nourhan Barakat, a 25-year-old mother of three displaced to Khan Younis. “I know that breastfeeding strengthens the bond between mother and child – but what can I do?”

In late June, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said about 112 children were being admitted daily to Gaza's hospitals for malnutrition treatment. Malnutrition before the age of three can cause permanent developmental problems.

“This whole generation is being targeted. They will suffer from memory problems, developmental delays … And the problem is even if nutrition becomes available later on, the damage is permanent,” al-Faraa said.

Doctors said the deaths of infants was a worrying sign of Gaza's looming starvation crisis, as young children are the most vulnerable to the effects of malnutrition.

“When you see babies start to die, panic and alarms should start to flare. Essentially, children are the first to die in starvation crises,” said Dr Thaer Ahmad, a member of a medical delegation trying to deliver aid through the international group Avaaz.

Doctors have blamed the Israeli aid blockade for the shortage, as Israel prevents all but a few aid trucks entering the territory – far below what humanitarians say is required to feed the population. UN agencies say Gaza needs at least 500 trucks a day to meet basic needs, but often less than 50 are admitted.

What UN aid does come through is often confiscated by hungry crowds and armed gangs who have begun looting trucks out of desperation.

If Palestinians want to access aid given by GHF, they have to navigate a complicated, ever-changing set of instructions to queue at one of four distribution sites. More than 500 people have been shot dead by Israeli forces while queueing for aid over the last month.

Humanitarian groups have condemned the GHF, saying it could be complicit in war crimes and that it violates the core principles of humanitarianism. Previously, the UN-led aid system in Gaza maintained more than 400 aid distribution points throughout Gaza set up at points of need. The GHF said it had delivered more than 52m meals in five weeks and that other organisations “stand by helplessly as their aid is looted”.

Israel has said the UN system was being exploited by Hamas to hoard aid, an accusation for which humanitarians say there is no evidence.

The war in Gaza has killed more than 56,000 people since 7 October 2023, and was launched in retaliation for the Hamas-led attack on the same day that killed 1,200 people in Israel. Israel and Hamas have signalled in recent days that they are nearing a US-brokered ceasefire, though key sticking points remain.

In the meantime, doctors in the territory say time is running out. “You should see the children arriving,” said al-Farra. “They're just skin and bones. It's horrifying. The real solution is to end the war, open the crossings and allow baby formula in.”

            Spectators gathered on the cobblestone streets of Madrid's Chueca neighborhood this week to watch one of Spain's most curious races: the “Carrera de Tacones,” or heel race.
    


            Held annually as part of the city's Pride celebrations, the race sees competitors — mostly men in towering heels — pound Calle de Pelayo, as racers have done each year for decades.
    


            Whoops, cheers, and gasps were heard throughout the crowd as racers tried to outpace each other on Thursday — some stumbling ungracefully in unruly heels towards the finish line.
    


            Despite the frenzy, an event of this scale and importance to Spain's LGBTQ+ community takes careful planning. Especially when it's become increasingly popular.
    


            “There will be seven races in total, much more than in recent years,” explained David Bonillo, the event's manager since 2014, who started work early on the day of the event at LL Bar, the iconic drag establishment that founded the competition in the late 1990s.
    


            “Six qualification races at 6pm. Then, the winners will face-off in the grand finale.”
    


            The Carrera de Tacones has rules, and the organizers are strict. In the back room of a neighboring sportswear shop, where runners check-in before the race,﻿ one staff member was found taping participants' shoes tightly to their ankles with black duct tape to reduce the chances of sprains and breaks. Nearer to the store's entrance, another was charged with measuring the heels with well-worn tape.
    


            Runners face disqualification for any footwear under 10 cm high (about four inches).
    


            “I'm sorry, but you're not going to be able to race,” the woman measuring told a visibly disappointed racer, Edson Escolar, who was cradling a pair of blue stilettoes. “(It's) two centimeters too short.”
    


            Escolar told CNN that he had travelled from Guatemala to join the race. “In Guatemala, we have Pride but it's nothing like this. People there still look at you funny if you wear feminine clothes. Here, I feel so free.”
    


            “Maybe they'll let me race if I ask again nicely,” he said hopefully with a smile.
    


            But Escolar was nowhere to be found at the starting line.
    


            “We have a couple of rules to keep the race fair,” said Bonillo. “It's important to maintain them so we can continue to organize this special tradition for years to come.”
    


            There are few in Spain who know more about the race's humble beginnings than the drag queen known as Chumina Power. The singer and comedian is one of the most well-known faces in Chueca. This year, she presented the race with a mix of singing, dancing and commentary from a small platform near the finish line.
    


            Power attended the event's first ever race and began working as a drag performer at LL Bar a few years later.
    


            “The high heel race has been going on for 30 years, but at first, it was a tiny event with just a few people,” she recalled. “Pride itself was also small. The first celebrations in this country took place across only two small streets here, and Calle de Pelayo was one of them.”
    


            “Most people didn't come to Pride to demonstrate because it was still frowned upon back then,” she said. “But the race grew with Madrid Pride, (which is) now one of the most important festivals in Spain.”
    


            Known as “Orgullo Gay de Madrid,” Madrid Pride began as a political demonstration in 1978. In 2019 it became Europe's largest Pride celebration, drawing around two million visitors annually.
    


            As Power returned to the stage, racers began their final stretches. Anticipation was growing in the crowd. People started to huddle closer to the edge of the makeshift running track.
    


            Each of the qualifying heats featured a mix of experience and youth. Some runners were anxious and quiet. Others joked together, drinks in hand.
    


            Brian Healy, originally from Ireland, has been living in Madrid for seven years. “I've competed every year since 2018 and I love it,” he said. “I bought these shoes online from China, and something felt different when I put them on,” he continued, easing himself down to the ground to stretch.
    


            “They were so cheap they didn't even have a left and right one! They were both the same, but I've kind of got used to it now,” he joked.
    


            For some like Pablo Lopez, who chose a long, loose pair of black leather boots, it was their first race. “I'm really scared,” Lopez said with a shy smile. “I practiced a little bit at home, walking and running slowly, but the ground is different here.”
    


            And before the final race, another problem emerged: shoe fatigue. At one point, a finalist lifted their leg to reveal their bloodied toes and the remains of a shredded shoe.
    


            For the rest of the finalists, there was a surprise in store.
    


            All six would have to make a stop to change into a long dress, don a wig, and carry a handbag filled with bricks to the finish line on Power's stage.
    


            The final race couldn't have been closer. The first and second place-winners were separated by less than a second.
    


            “This was so much fun, and I'm so pleased to have won it,” said Raul Prieto, who had travelled to Madrid for the race from his hometown of Bilbao. Clutching a large check for €350 (about $412), he added: “I want to run this race every year for the rest of time!”

A strong earthquake measuring upper 5 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7 hit Akusekijima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture on Saturday morning, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.

The quake with an estimated magnitude of 5.4 occurred around the Tokara Islands, which includes Akusekijima, in the prefecture at 6:29 a.m. The focus was under the sea at a depth of about 19 kilometers, and no tsunami was observed, the agency said.

Between June 21 and Saturday at 7 a.m., a total of 1,303 earthquakes measuring 1 or stronger on the Japanese seismic intensity scale have been recorded in the area.

On Thursday, an earthquake measuring lower 6 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale struck the island.

At a press conference on Saturday morning, an official of the agency urged people to be on alert for earthquakes of a similar scale as Saturday's.

The agency also dismissed rumors about a possible major earthquake in July, stating that it is difficult to predict the date, location and scale of earthquakes under current scientific knowledge. “We want the public to be prepared for earthquakes at all times as they can occur any time in Japan,” the official said.

Toshima Mayor Genichiro Kubo said Saturday he would conduct the second round of evacuation for island residents. They will leave the island on a village-operated ferry for Kagoshima City on Sunday morning. The number of residents wishing to evacuate the island is increasing, and at least 20 people were expected to evacuate Sunday.

On Friday, 13 people of eight households on the island aged 0 to 80 evacuated to the city.

U.S. Air Force General Alexus G. Grynkewich assumed command as the 21st Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) on July 4 during a ceremony at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte presided over the handover, commending outgoing U.S. Army General Christopher G. Cavoli for his contributions to modernizing NATO's collective defense and bolstering support for Ukraine.

Rutte highlighted Cavoli's efforts to strengthen NATO's presence in the Baltic Sea in response to threats to critical undersea infrastructure and credited him with conceiving and establishing NATO's new command in Germany to enhance assistance to Ukraine. He also noted Cavoli's role in refocusing the Alliance on collective defense following the 2022 Madrid Summit, where NATO adopted a new Strategic Concept in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Cavoli played a central role in developing and securing approval for NATO's regional defense plans at the 2023 Vilnius Summit—a significant overhaul of the Alliance's military posture since the Cold War. 

His tenure also included the integration of Finland and Sweden into NATO's military structures, expanding the Alliance's strategic reach. In 2024, Cavoli oversaw "Steadfast Defender," NATO's largest military exercise since the Cold War, involving approximately 90,000 troops practicing large-scale reinforcement across the eastern flank and validating a new high-readiness force model.

Rutte specifically acknowledged Cavoli's leadership in rapidly reinforcing NATO's Baltic Sea presence during threats to underwater infrastructure and for establishing the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), which continues to support Ukraine.

The secretary general welcomed General Grynkewich, noting that, as a former fighter pilot, he brings "a deep understanding of the threats we face from the skies, and across other domains." Rutte added that Grynkewich's recent role as Director of Operations of the Joint Staff provides him with broad experience in advancing military and security priorities amid global challenges. 

Allied Command Operations—responsible for planning and executing all NATO operations—now falls under General Grynkewich's command, a position first held by General Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Head of North America desk

Olena Goncharova is the Head of North America desk at The Kyiv Independent, where she has previously worked as a development manager and Canadian correspondent. She first joined the Kyiv Post, Ukraine's oldest English-language newspaper, as a staff writer in January 2012 and became the newspaper's Canadian correspondent in June 2018. She is based in Edmonton, Alberta. Olena has a master's degree in publishing and editing from the Institute of Journalism in Taras Shevchenko National University in Kyiv. Olena was a 2016 Alfred Friendly Press Partners fellow who worked for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for six months. The program is administered by the University of Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia.

BlackRock, a U.S. investment firm, suspended work on its multibillion-dollar Ukraine recovery fund following U.S. President Donald Trump's election victory, prompting France to work on a replacement, Bloomberg reported on July 5.

The facility develops and manufactures Kometa adaptive antenna arrays used in Shahed-type drones, Iskander-K cruise missiles, and guided aerial bomb modules, according to the Ukrainian military.

Russian troops have been escalating their assaults in the area and are attempting to breach into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which has not seen significant Russian incursions since 2022. 

Russian troops are ramping up attacks in the sector using large numbers of troops, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said.

Fires broke out across the city as Russia attacked the capital overnight on July 4. At least 23 people have been injured, with 14 of the victims hospitalized. 

"Who is behind those attacks is clear to all of us here," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

Some passengers reported waiting more than 10 hours, according to the pro-Kremlin Telegram channel Shot.

Moscow is organizing the deployment of a combined unit of military engineers from the Lao People's Armed Forces to Russia's Kursk Oblast, allegedly to help with demining operations, Ukraine's military intelligence said.

Russia launched 322 drones overnight, including Iranian-designed Shahed-type attack drones, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

The airfield hosts Su-34, Su-35S, and Su-30SM jets that Russia regularly uses in air strikes against Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian military.

"It just seems like he wants to go all the way and just keep killing people. It's not good," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

The number includes 1,050 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day, according to the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte presided over the handover, commending outgoing U.S. Army General Christopher G. Cavoli for his contributions to modernizing NATO's collective defense and bolstering support for Ukraine.

Moldovan President Maia Sandu hopes her pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) will retain its parliamentary majority in the September 28 elections. 

"The US has to make sure that the stockpiles are at the level we need for the U.S. to have, because they are crucial for our collective defense," Rutte told reporters on July 4. "At the same time, of course, we hope for the flexibility, we have to make sure also that Ukraine can move forward."

            • Desperate search: Authorities say more than 25 girls are still unaccounted for at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas, where the Guadalupe River rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours during torrential rains that triggered flash flooding in parts of the state yesterday.
    


            • Death toll rises: At least 27 people, including nine children, have died in the flooding, according to local officials. A 9-year-old camper is among the victims, her mother told CNN.
    


            • Massive effort: Rescue and recovery operations continue today after first responders worked through the night, with authorities saying more than 850 people have been brought to safety. The Trump administration is sending resources to help.
    


            • One-in-100-years intensity: Parts of central Texas saw a month's worth of rain in just a few hours, prompting multiple flash flood emergencies. Hunt, a town near Kerrville, received about 6.5 inches in just three hours early Friday, which is considered a one-in-100-years rainfall event for the area.
    


            Daric and Heidi Easton, restaurant owners in downtown Kerrville, Texas, have pivoted to providing food for first responders and individuals affected by catastrophic flooding in the area.
    


            “I think hospitality and service is uniquely equipped to handle situations like this,” Daric Easton told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield. “It's typically controlled chaos. The difference was, that we were doing this for our community, and not just for a paycheck.”
    


            The couple have utilized the restaurant's connections and resources, including a customer's helicopter, to transport food and supplies to hard-to-reach areas. “We directly loaded food onto the helicopters, that were then flown to Camp Mystic,” Easton said. “So this did come full circle and accomplish the goal of feeding those kids.”
    


            Easton said his own daughter is around the age of the girls missing from that camp. “I can't imagine what these parents are going through, and I don't need to. I just need to make sandwiches,” he told CNN
    


                    “If I keep making sandwiches, people can still be fed. If responders are fed, then they can save lives,” Easton said.
                





            The Trump administration is working with state and local officials in Texas following the devastating flooding there, President Donald Trump wrote on social media today.
    


            Trump said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will be “there shortly.”
    


                    “Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy. Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS,” the president wrote on Truth Social.






            Texas Rep. Chip Roy said he struggled to find the words to describe the heartbreak and chaos his community is facing as rescue crews search for the missing and families begin to grieve the lives lost in this week's flooding.
    


            “Yesterday, I was on the phone with the president, with the secretary … but I couldn't even get the conversation out with the secretary, trying to explain to her what we were dealing with,” Roy said during a news conference today.
    


                    “That doesn't happen often for me, but it took me a while to collect myself to even be able to tell her what we were looking at.”
                





            In the midst of sorrow, the Texas lawmaker recalled moments of hope, including a student from his child's school who had been missing during the flood but was later found safe.
    


                    “I got a call and an update this morning, my kids' school. There was one of their schoolmates was missing, and one of the kids, she was on a mattress for two, three hours in the middle of the night,” Roy said. That little girl has since been reunited with her mother.
                





            “They're the kind of blessings that we should be celebrating while we're also mourning the loss of life,” he added.
    


            About 1,000 local, state and federal personnel are involved in the search effort, which has seen hundreds of rescues, including more than 160 by air, according to Roy.
    


            At least one girl is confirmed dead and 27 are reported missing at Camp Mystic, a private Christian summer camp for girls located near the Guadalupe River — which rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours.
    


            The camp, which is nestled in Hunt, an unincorporated community in western Kerr County, Texas, hosts about 750 kids overall.
    


            The mother of missing Camp Mystic camper Janie Hunt, 9, told CNN in a message this morning that her daughter has passed away.



            Early Friday morning, about 107 game wardens and an aviation group tried to access the camp, according to officials. Shortly after midday, they were able to enter the camp and start rescuing children.
    


            Camp Mystic, founded in 1926, prides itself as a “wholesome Christian atmosphere” and a haven where girls “develop outstanding personal qualities and self-esteem,” according to its website. The girls at Camp Mystic develop friendships, grow spiritually and strive “be a better person” and to “let Mystic bring out the best in them,” according to the camp.
    


            There are 27 children reported to be missing from Camp Mystic, the girls summer camp in Kerr County, Texas, according to Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice.
    


            Rice was unable to say how many other people in the area could be missing in the floods.
    


            “We do not have an accurate count, and we don't even want to begin to estimate at this time,” he said.
    


The summer camp is located near the Guadalupe River, which surged suddenly on Friday due to torrential rains: 



            The San Gabriel River at Georgetown South Fork, located about 30 miles north of Austin, is expected to crest near 30 feet this afternoon, which is major flood stage.
    


            This would result in flooding for many streets and roads, as well as threatening the lowest homes above Georgetown to Granger Lake, National Weather Service meteorologists warned this morning.
    


            Additional heavy rain is expected in those areas today. An additional 5 inches may be added to rainfall totals, with rainfall rates of 3 to 6 inches in one hour a possibility. This could lead to additional rounds of flash flooding.
    


            The Guadalupe River near Spring Branch rapidly rose overnight by around 27 feet, but levels are expected to begin to fall this morning.
    


            A moist airmass remains over the region of Texas where devastating flooding occurred Friday, with little movement and ample moisture. This combination means that the area should remain on alert for more flash flooding, as repeated rounds of heavy rain could fall over areas already affected.
    


Northwest of Austin: Early Saturday, 6.5 inches (a 1-in-100-year rainfall rate) to 7.5 inches (a 1-in-200-year rainfall rate) of rain fell in just 3 hours in Burnet, Texas — which amounts to a 1% chance or less of this happening in any given year.
    


            A flash flood emergency was issued for western Travis County and then expanded into much of Burnet County and western parts of Williamson County on Saturday morning. Rainfall totals for this area have already reached 5 to 10 inches. Ten inches of rain is also about the average rainfall expected in the Austin area in a three-month period — which fell in just 3 hours.
    


            The high rainfall rates led to water inundating homes overnight near Allen Branch Creek in Burnet, according to the emergency management office of Cedar Park. Emergency management officials also reported that water came into the first floors of homes near Liberty Hill, Texas, prompting water rescues.
    


            Showers and thunderstorms are possible through this weekend, but the heaviest rainfall is expected to be farther east than the worst-hit areas so far. A flood watch remains in effect through Saturday evening, with 2 to 4 inches of additional rainfall possible. Any additional rain could aggravate ongoing flooding and lead to new flooding as the ground is saturated.
    


            Kerrville, Texas, Mayor Joe Herring Jr. warned of a tough day ahead and expressed gratitude for the response from city crews, county personnel and state agencies to devastating flooding in the region.
    


                    “People need to know, today will be a hard day,” Herring said, his voice wavering as he made his opening remarks at a news conference. “It will be a hard day.”
                





            Herring also thanked people around the country for an outpouring of offers to help.
    


            “I'm thankful you're here. Today will be a hard day. Please pray for our community,” he said.
    


            Search teams are making rescues in “a very harsh environment,” recovering some people from trees and other high-ground locations, Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said.
    


            “They are looking at every possible location,” Rice said at a Saturday news conference.
    


            Search and rescue operations continued through the evening Friday and overnight into Saturday, with specialized equipment, including helicopters, trying to identify any heat sources in the flooded area, Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said.
    


            “I do want to encourage folks with road damage, even though a road may be open, please use extreme caution. If water does get under the road, we are seeing a lot of debris, a lot of asphalt that is washing up, so there could be some other damaged areas,” he warned.
    


            “We did start boots-on-ground operations about 8 a.m. [9 a.m. ET] this morning, and started about southwest of Hunt, so southwest of Camp Mystic,” Rice said. “These folks will be traveling very difficult terrain, up through Ingram, and we're going to start getting information.”
    


            Kerr County Sheriff Larry L. Leitha said first responders will continue to search for “every single person” who is missing in the floods.
    


            “One thing I want to tell you and assure y'all is, that we will not stop until every single person is found — we've got all the resources we need,” he said during a news conference.
    


                    “Tragic incidents like this affect us all. This community is strong and will continue to pull together during this tragic time,” Leitha said. “We have been humbled by the outpouring of support; we are very appreciative everyone that's stepped up to help us.”
                





            Officials in Texas have recovered the bodies of at least 27 people, including nine children, after catastrophic flooding impacted parts of the state, according to Kerr County Sheriff Larry L. Leitha.
    


            Leitha said officials have evacuated or rescued over 850 people, including eight with injuries.
    


            Both totals were current as of Saturday morning local time, the sheriff said at a news conference. He warned that the situation is still evolving and the numbers could change. The previous death toll provided by authorities Friday night was 24.
    


                    “We're unable to release any further information on deceased at this time as our thoughts and prayers go out to the loved ones,” Leitha said Saturday. “We are working hard to locate anyone who is still missing and ensure they are safe.”
                





            He said locals can contact a call center in the region to report missing people, or email relief teams.
    


This post has been updated with additional comments from the sheriff.



            A Kerrville city councilmember is mourning devastation from the flooding and asked people across the country to keep his community in their prayers.
    


            “When we have an event, a catastrophic event like this, it hits hard and it hurts,” councilmember Jeff Harris told CNN affiliate KABB this morning.
    


            Harris said Kerrville, a city of around 25,000 people, is “a tight-knit community,” and “pretty much everybody knows everybody.”
    


            Harris said friends from accross the country have reached out to ask how they can help. “And the answer to that question, right now, is pray. That's what we need. We need prayers,” Harris said.
    


            Area resident Jerry Adams told CNN that summer camps and Crider's, a local rodeo and dancehall, were “the lifeblood of this community” and “everybody's bread and butter” in Hunt, Texas, which was hit hard by this week's flooding.
    


            Crider's was set to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its annual Fourth of July rodeo, dance and barbecue on Friday, according to its website.
    


                    “Now, it's just nothing,” Adams said. “It's never going to be the way it really was. It's going to take a lot of time, and a lot of effort, and a lot of praying to get this thing back.”
                





            “It's just sad. It's just really sad for the community,” Adams told CNN, holding back tears.
    


            Meanwhile, the search continues for about 20 children who authorities say are unaccounted for at Camp Mystic, a private Christian summer camp for girls in Hunt.
    


            The mother of missing Camp Mystic camper Janie Hunt, 9, told CNN in a message this morning that her daughter has passed away.
    


            Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said yesterday that more than 20 children were unaccounted for at the private Christian summer camp for girls, which hosts about 750 kids overall.
    


            After the catastrophic flooding hit Kerr County in central Texas, Anne Hunt told CNN on Friday that she and her family had not heard anything about Janie's whereabouts and were praying for her return.
    


            Vice President JD Vance voiced his sorrow over the loss of the individuals killed in flash flooding in central Texas and the loved ones they leave behind.
    


            “Our nation's heart breaks for the victims in Texas and their families. Just an incomprehensible tragedy,” Vance said Saturday in a statement on X. “I hope everyone affected knows they're in the prayers of my family, and of millions of Americans.
    


            First lady Melania Trump expressed her sympathy to the parents whose children were caught in the catastrophic flooding in central Texas in a social media post Saturday.
    


            “My heart goes out to the parents in Texas during this difficult time,” she wrote. “I am holding you in my thoughts and sending prayers for strength, comfort, and resilience.”
    


            Around two dozen girls from a private Christian summer camp were still unaccounted for Friday night. Camp Mystic is in Hunt, Texas, near the Guadalupe River, which has swelled to its second-highest level on record, according to the National Weather Service. Everyone at about 18 other camps along the river is accounted for, officials said.
    


            The camp director and co-owner of Heart O' the Hills, a girls camp in Hunt, Texas, died in the catastrophic flooding that struck the area overnight into the Fourth of July holiday, according to an announcement from the camp.
    


            Jane Ragsdale was the “heart and soul” of the camp, according to its website.
    


            “We have received word that Jane Ragsdale did not make it,” the camp wrote about its director. “We are mourning the loss of a woman who influenced countless lives and was the definition of strong and powerful.”
    


            The camp, set alongside the Guadalupe River, was not in session at the time of the flooding, and “most of those who were on camp at the time have been accounted for and are on high ground,” the announcement reads.
    


            Flash floods are the second-deadliest weather hazard after extreme heat. They can occur when a dam or levee is breached – or when intense rain outpaces the ground's ability to absorb it, as was the case in Texas' Kerr County this week.
    


            Pinpointing exactly where flash flooding will occur is a major challenge because geography and topography can vary widely, even over small regions.
    


            Mountainous areas are extremely susceptible to flash flooding. There's not as much surface area for rain to soak into soil before steep inclines send it rushing down, where it can overwhelm streams and rivers and funnel into valleys and rise quickly with little warning.
    


            You can read more here about flash floods and what to do if you get caught in one.
    


            Kerrville, Texas was hit especially hard by flash flooding after heavy rain swelled two forks of the Guadalupe River before they converge and flow “through the city,” City Manager Dalton Rice said at a news conference Friday.
    


            Storms late Thursday into Friday “dumped more rain than what was forecasted on both of those forks,” Rice said, describing how the river swelled from 7 feet to 29 feet in a short amount of time during the night.
    


            “All of that converged at the Guadalupe, and that's where we saw those very quick rising floods,” Rice said.
    


            Rice also noted not all areas along the river have alarms to flag flooding. The alarms are typically “further downstream,” he said, in places such as in Comfort, which sits about 15 miles southeast of Kerrville.

A group of subway riders beat a man who had randomly grabbed a woman on a New York City subway platform. (TikTok: @nicabori5)

A group of everyday New York City subway riders delivered some street justice to a crazed man who randomly grabbed a screaming woman on a platform and ushered her forward, dramatic viral video shows. 

The group sprang into action on Sunday morning atop a Brooklyn subway platform when they heard the young woman screech for help as the heavy-set man bear hugged her from behind and propelled her forward.

"Stop, stop, help," the 20-year-old woman can be heard yelling as a group of onlookers quickly surrounds him and demands that he let her go.

VIGILANTES SERVE STREET JUSTICE AFTER CAREER CRIMINAL TRIES TO RAPE ELDERLY WOMAN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT: REPORT

She eventually broke free of the man, identified by police as 42-year-old Fredrick Marshall, who was dressed in a white suit with a white baseball cap and sunglasses. Police said he was armed with a knife and a blackjack, and the woman did not know Marshall. 

But after the woman caught her breath, Marshall made a second lunge for the woman but was stopped in his tracks by a stranger who tripped him up -- sending him flying headfirst onto the ground. 

The group then pounced on Marshall, delivering him a beatdown with an onslaught of kicks while another person appeared to strike him repeatedly with a stick. 

The distraught woman can be seen sprinting away from the scene in distress, with one of her sneakers appearing to have fallen off during the terrifying ordeal.

Kerrville's city manager says the extreme weather event happened in a span of less than two hours early on Friday, as the Guadalupe River rose rapidly.

Months worth of heavy rain fell over just a few hours overnight in central Kerr County, Texas, causing deadly flash flooding of the Guadalupe River.

KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — Rescuers were searching Saturday for more than two dozen children from a girls' camp and many others still missing after a wall of water rushed down a river in the Texas Hill Country during a powerful storm that killed at least 27 people, officials said. Among the dead were nine children.

The destructive fast-moving waters along the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes before dawn Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as torrential rains continued pounding communities outside San Antonio on Saturday and flash flood warnings and watches remained in effect for parts of central Texas.

Some 27 people remained missing from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the river, said Dalton Rice, Kerrville's city manager. An unknown number of people at other locations were still unaccounted for, he said Saturday.

“People need to know today will be a hard day,” said Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring, Jr. “Please pray for our community.”

Searchers used helicopters, boats and drones to look for victims and to rescue stranded people in trees and from camps isolated by washed-out roads. The total number of missing was not known, according to the city manager, who said he didn't want to give an estimate.

Frantic parents and families posted photos of missing loved ones and pleas for information. 




“The camp was completely destroyed,” said Elinor Lester, 13, one of hundreds of campers at Camp Mystic. “A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary.”




A raging storm woke up her cabin just after midnight Friday, and when rescuers arrived, they tied a rope for the girls to hold as they walked across a bridge with floodwaters whipping around their legs, she said. 

Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said 27 were confirmed dead, including nine children. Authorities said about 850 people had been rescued.

The flooding in the middle of the night on the Fourth of July holiday caught many residents, campers and officials by surprise. The Texas Hill Country, which sits northwest of San Antonio, is a popular destination for camping and swimming, especially around the summertime holiday. 

AccuWeather said the private forecasting company and the National Weather Service sent warnings about potential flash flooding hours before the devastation. 

“These warnings should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps such as Camp Mystic and get people to safety,” AccuWeather said in a statement that called the Texas Hill County one of the most flash-flood-prone areas of the U.S. because of its terrain and many water crossings.

Officials defended their actions Friday while saying they had not expected such an intense downpour that was the equivalent of months' worth of rain for the area.

One National Weather Service forecast earlier in the week had called for up to six inches (152 millimeters) of rain, said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. “It did not predict the amount of rain that we saw,” he said. 

Search crews were facing harsh conditions while scouring the waterlogged rivers, culverts and rocks. “They are looking in every possible location,” Rice said.

More than 1,000 rescuers were on the ground. Helicopters and drones were being used, with some people being plucked from trees. U.S. Coast Guard helicopters were flying in to assist.

One reunification center at an elementary school was mostly quiet Saturday after taking in hundreds of evacuees the day before.

“We still have people coming here looking for their loved ones. We've had a little success, but not much,” said Bobby Templeton, superintendent of Ingram Independent School District.

President Donald Trump said Saturday that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was traveling to Texas and his administration was working with officials on the ground.

“Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy,” Trump said in a statement on his social media network. 

In Ingram, Erin Burgess woke to thunder and rain in the middle of the night Friday. Just 20 minutes later, water was pouring into her home from the river, she said. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree with her teenage son and waiting for the water to recede enough to walk up the hill to safety.

“That's the only thing that saved me, was hanging on to him,” she said.

“My son and I floated to a tree where we hung onto it, and my boyfriend and my dog floated away. He was lost for a while, but we found them,” she said.

Matthew Stone, 44, of Kerrville, said police came knocking on doors but that he had received no warning on his phone.

“We got no emergency alert. There was nothing,” Stone said. Then “a pitch black wall of death.” 

At a reunification center in Ingram, families cried and cheered Friday as loved ones got off rescue vehicles. Two soldiers carried an older woman who could not get down a ladder. Behind her, a woman clutched a small white dog. 

Later, a girl in a white “Camp Mystic” T-shirt and white socks stood in a puddle, sobbing in her mother's arms.

Barry Adelman said water pushed everyone in his three-story house into the attic, including his 94-year-old grandmother and 9-year-old grandson. 

“I was having to look at my grandson in the face and tell him everything was going to be OK, but inside I was scared to death,” he said. 

Authorities were coming under increasing scrutiny over whether the camp and others in the area received proper warning and whether enough preparations were made. 

The forecast for the weekend had called for rain, with a flood watch upgraded to a warning overnight Friday for at least 30,000 people. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the potential for heavy rain and flooding covered a large area.

“Everything was done to give them a heads up that you could have heavy rain, and we're not exactly sure where it's going to land,” Patrick said. “Obviously as it got dark last night, we got into the wee morning of the hours, that's when the storm started to zero in.”

Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, the county's chief elected official, said: “We do not have a warning system.” 

When pushed on why more precautions weren't taken, Kelly said no one knew this kind of flood was coming.

The slow-moving storm stuck over central Texas is bringing more rain Saturday, with the potential for pockets of heavy downpours and more flooding, said Jason Runyen, of the National Weather Service. 

The threat could linger overnight and into Sunday morning, he said. 

The area is known as “flash flood alley” because of the hills' thin layer of soil, said Austin Dickson, CEO of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, which was collecting donations to help with the response.

“When it rains, water doesn't soak into the soil,” Dickson said. “It rushes down the hill.”

River tourism industry is a key part of the Hill Country economy. Century-old summer camps bring in kids from all over the country, Dickson said.

“It's generally a very tranquil river with really beautiful clear blue water that people have been attracted to for generations,” Dickson said.

Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R- Okla., discusses the challenges those who voted against the 'big, beautiful bill' could face and more on ‘The Will Cain Show'.

Jason Kelce was just like plenty of Americans on the Fourth of July, taking in some of the best fireworks.

However, when the Philadelphia Eagles legend took to social media to celebrate, he was met with plenty of vitriol.

"Man I love the 4th! One of the great days we all can set aside our differences in this country, and enjoy the one thing we all share in common. That we are American! Cheers to you oh beautiful America," Kelce wrote in an Instagram post of a video of some fireworks.

Almost immediately, he was ripped in the comments.

Kelce's post came hours after President Donald Trump signed the "big, beautiful bill," which seemed to be the catalyst for the backlash in the former NFL player's comment section. 

"Set aside differences? One party wants to feed children. The other wants to feed brown people to alligators," one person wrote.

"Unfortunately Jason this is not real life for many. They signed the worst bill for so many Americans today just to rub it in our faces. I know it's hard to understand, but so many will suffer," another added.

Another user called his post "tone deaf."

"love u bud but this is so out of touch, i beg you please read the room rn. so many are suffering," added another.

One more user said there is "nothing beautiful about this country right now."

The post had over 2,000 comments at the time of publishing. His three previous posts combined for just over 1,000 comments.

The Kelces have normally been silent about their political beliefs, but Travis Kelce's girlfriend, Taylor Swift, endorsed Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election.

‘Fox News @ Night' panelists Luke Ball and Emily Wilson discuss the media's reaction to the U.S.' strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.

New York Times opinion columnist Jamelle Bouie argued on Wednesday that President Donald Trump is much more of a "normie Republican" than both his supporters and critics may lead one to believe.

Bouie's opinion piece, titled, "Face It. Trump Is a Normie Republican," contended that Trump has governed as a "mostly orthodox Republican" over the duration of his second term, and compared his first term to a hypothetical third George W. Bush presidency.

"Perhaps the most underappreciated fact about President Trump is that he is a Republican," Bouie stated, noting that "nearly every commentator under the sun" has considered Trump to be unique "in ways that defy traditional categorization."

The columnist pushed back on the notion that Trump cannot be considered a typical Republican due to his uniqueness, arguing that the "most salient detail" about the current president is that he's a "Republican politician committed to the success of the Republican Party and its ideological vision."

"We saw this in his first term, with his signature legislative accomplishment, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Was this his promised transformation of the American economy, the populist blow for those Americans left behind by the nation's failed political and economic leadership?" he questioned. "No, it was a massive upper-income tax cut designed to pay huge benefits to the wealthiest Americans, including the president, his family and their friends."

Bouie continued, listing off actions taken by Trump during his first term, summarizing that, in short, "Trump governed like a Republican."

"And it is not a stretch to say that much of his first term was, on the domestic front, more or less indistinguishable from a hypothetical third term for the previous Republican president, George W. Bush. Trump even ended his term, as Bush did, with a rolling set of crises and disasters, each exacerbated by his mismanagement," he added.

The columnist claimed that Trump's "big, beautiful, bill" lines up with "what any Republican president would do," but has been cloaked in "the rhetoric of populism" by the president.

As far as Trump's foreign policy goes, Bouie argued that the president's recent strike on Iran's nuclear facilities was reminiscent of the foreign policy of two former Republicans.

"With one decision, Trump fulfilled the dreams of a generation of Republican hawks who have been clamoring for war with — and regime change in — Iran since President Bush proclaimed that it was a member of the ‘axis of evil' in 2002. You could, if you were so inclined, draw a straight line from that speech to John McCain's ‘bomb Iran' quips in 2007 to Trump's appointment of Mike Pompeo, a noted Iran antagonist, as secretary of state in 2018 to his airstrike last month," he claimed.

The columnist concluded that some of the "worst" aspects of the Trump administration can be chalked up to the "specific authoritarian vision" of the president and his allies — but for the most part — this is "simply what happens when you elect a Republican to the White House."

The monstrous, swift-moving flood that swept through the Hill Country of Texas on Friday, killing at least 27 people and leaving many more missing, was a flash flood, the nation's top storm-related killer. Among those missing are more than 20 girls attending a summer camp.

Authorities said about 850 people had been rescued, including some by helicopter.

According to the National Weather Service, a flash flood is flooding that begins within six hours, and often in as little as three hours, of heavy rainfall.

Waters rise so quickly that people are caught off guard, according to the weather service. Many people run into trouble while traveling. If at home or work, the water can rise so quickly people are trapped before they have time to think about escape.

That is just what happened to residents along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County and the surrounding area after at least 10 inches (25 centimeters) poured from the sky early Friday morning.

Fast-moving waters along the river rose 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes before dawn Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as more heavy rains were expected Saturday and flash flood warnings and flood watches remained in effect for parts of central Texas.




On Thursday afternoon, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch, estimating rising water of up to 7 inches (17 centimeters) in spots. A “watch” means conditions are favorable for a flood and people should be prepared, but hazardous conditions might not develop. 

But the watch was upgraded to a flood warning overnight, a notice that impacted 30,000 people. A warning is issued when flooding is imminent or occurring, the weather service says.

Lt,. Gov. Dan Patrick said the potential for heavy rain and flooding covered a large area and “everything was done to give them a heads-up that you could have heavy rain.” 

However, when asked about how people were notified in Kerr County so that they could get to safety, Judge Rob Kelly, the county's chief elected official, said: “We do not have a warning system.”

When reporters pushed on why more precautions weren't taken, Kelly responded: “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming.”

Last year, 145 people died in flash floods, according to the weather service. On average over the past 30 years, floods have claimed 127 lives annually.

Nearly half of all flood-related fatalities involve vehicles. Flood deaths affect all age groups. 

Many people don't realize that a car becomes difficult to control in just 6 inches (15 centimeters) of water and can be swept away in as little as 18 inches (46 centimeters). So instead of finding a detour, too often people try to drive through water at underpasses or other low-lying areas.

It can happen anywhere, according to the weather service, which says that “the normally tranquil streams and creeks in your neighborhood can become raging torrents if heavy rain falls overhead.”

An area can be flooded even without rain — if it's downstream of a torrential rainstorm and a swollen stream heads its way. 

Hurricanes, tropical storms, non-cyclonic weather systems carrying heavy rain and dam failures are some weather events that can cause flash flooding. They can happen in rural areas or in large cities.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick joins ‘Fox News Live' to provide an update on the deadly Texas floods, which have killed at least 27 people and left dozens, including children, still missing.

Three young girls were found dead after a devastating flood swept through Camp Mystic, an all-girls private Christian camp in Hunt, Texas. 

Anne Hunt confirmed to Fox News Digital that her daughter, Janie, was one of the campers killed in the flood. Additionally, A Voice for the Voiceless, a nonprofit that advocates for "the missing, voiceless and crime victims," identified Renee Smajstrla as the other deceased camper.

A third camper has been confirmed to be deceased, however her family has asked that her name not be released.

Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said on Friday night that between 23 and 25 campers were missing. There were 750 attendees at the camp when the flood hit.

On Saturday, Kerr County announced the flood killed 27 people, 18 of whom were adults and 9 were children.

Camp Mystic, which had approximately 750 attendees, reportedly told parents that if they had not been contacted directly it meant that their child was accounted for.

Ellen Toranzo told Fox News Digital that her daughter, Greta Toranzo, is one of the campers who went missing during the flood. Carrie Hanna also confirmed to Fox News Digital that her daughter, Hadley, is unaccounted for.

Elinor Lester, 13, told the Associated Press she was evacuated with her cabinmates by helicopter after wading through floodwaters. Lester also said that the "camp was completely destroyed" in the disastrous flood. The outlet noted that Lester was housed on higher ground at the camp, known as Senior Hill. Younger campers, who can begin attending at age 8, are housed along the riverbanks and were the first to flood, according to the Associated Press. 

The National Guard was deployed in Texas to respond after heavy rain on Friday morning caused the Guadalupe River to rise nearly 30 feet in 45 minutes. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem later said that members of the U.S. Coast Guard were deployed to assist in evacuations.

Helicopters and military vehicles were used for evacuations. As of Friday night, 237 people had been evacuated, including 167 by helicopter.

Texas deployed more than 1,000 state responders and over 800 vehicles and equipment assets, according to Gov. Greg Abbott's office. The governor also declared an emergency for 15 counties, and his office said that more could be added to the list.

"This is a time when we, as a state, need God more than ever," Abbott said in a statement. "The one thing I hear the most are the prayers that are being sent for those who are in harm's way."

President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday that the floods were "shocking" and "a terrible thing." He also said the state would receive federal aid and that his administration was working with Abbott. 

"Our nation's heart breaks for the victims in Texas and their families. Just an incomprehensible tragedy," Vice President JD Vance wrote on X. "I hope everyone affected knows they're in the prayers of my family, and of millions of Americans."

The vice president, a devout Catholic, also included the Eternal Rest Prayer in his post.

The Kerr County Sheriff's Office is encouraging those with missing loved ones to call the Red Cross at 1-800-733-2767 for information.

Immigration expert Mark Krikorian explained that the reason behind the breakout of immigration riots and protests across the country and made suggestions about what the country can do to course-correct.

Multiple people were arrested in Los Angeles on Friday as anti-ICE demonstrators clashed with law enforcement and the U.S. military after weeks of protests against deportations and ICE raids, police said.

Los Angeles police said there were "multiple arrests today during several different demonstrations" downtown.

"Most were peaceful, but once again, as the evening approached, outside agitators began to cause issues," the department wrote on X.

Earlier in the night, police wrote that demonstrators were "confronting Federal Protective Security Personnel and National Guard members."

"Less Lethal munitions have been deployed by Federal authorities," police wrote, adding that they may cause pain and discomfort.

In response to the anti-ICE protests that began last month, the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles, despite opposition from Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Demonstrators met up for the protest on Friday at around 9:30 a.m. outside City Hall on Spring Street and took a 1.5-mile route through downtown, according to local outlet KCAL.

Police said the group dispersed shortly after the incident commander authorized a dispersal order for the area on Friday night, according to a post at 7:17 p.m. local time.

Officers from the Department of Homeland Security had declared the protest an unlawful assembly, independent journalist Anthony Cabassa wrote on X, adding that Marines and federal agents were using riot gear while ordering the crowd to disperse.

EXCLUSIVE: The Trump administration is turning its attention to the Smithsonian Institution, accusing the taxpayer-funded museum complex of using federal dollars to promote what it calls "one-sided, divisive political narratives" that fail to honor the greatness of the American story.

White House official Lindsey Halligan blasted content currently on display at the National Museum of American History's Entertainment Nation exhibit in an exclusive email to Fox News Digital.The exhibit, which explores American pop culture, has drawn internal and external criticism for what some see as a politically loaded interpretation of cultural milestones.

"American taxpayers should not be funding institutions that undermine our country or promote one-sided, divisive political narratives," Halligan said. "The Smithsonian Institution should present history in a way that is accurate, balanced, and consistent with the values that make the United States of America exceptional."DONALD TRUMP FIRES NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY DIRECTOR FOR BEING 'STRONG SUPPORTER' OF DEI

The White House statement comes on the heels of several striking examples from the exhibit. 

One placard, featured alongside a 1923 circus poster, reads: "Under the big top, circuses expressed the colonial impulse to claim dominion over the world." Another, describing early American entertainment, declares: "One of the earliest defining traits of entertainment in the United States was extraordinary violence."

The exhibit reframes iconic American characters through a critical, politically-charged lens. On The Lone Ranger, the display states: "The White title character's relationship with Tonto resembled how the U.S. government imagined itself the world's Lone Ranger."

Mickey Mouse, a beloved American cultural icon, is not spared either. A display for the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie states, "Mickey challenged authority, but not everyone was in on the joke."

It continues: "Mickey Mouse debuted as the deckhand ‘Steamboat Willie' in 1928, amidst a rising anxiety felt by many that modern living and city life were eroding family and community ties and loosening moral codes… But the new character's outsized facial features, white gloves, and trickster temperament were vestiges of longstanding traditions of blackface minstrelsy."

In reference to the Indiana Jones film series, another panel reads: "His character embodied a confident righteousness that, in many ways, captured the essence of the 1980s" above another subhead referencing President Ronald Reagan's famous speech, asking, "Are you better off?"KENT STATE STUDENT'S VIOLENT ANTI-TRUMP ART DISPLAY SPURS OUTRAGE

One panel calls Magnum, P.I. a challenge to the "popular perceptions of Vietnam veterans as damaged misfits." A section on Jon Stewart's Daily Show refers to it as "the go-to for viewers who mistrusted politicians and the reporting process."

Another panel highlights the late pop star Selena Quintanilla-Pérez and frames her cultural impact through identity politics.

"Selena got us talking about identity," with a quote from the late singer reading, "I feel very proud to be Mexican."

The text goes on to say her work "cast a light on the longstanding cultural and growing political influence of Mexican American and Latinx communities within the United States."

"The examples [Fox News Digital] highlighted from the National Museum of American History are part of the problem the Trump Administration aims to fix," Halligan said. "Framing American culture as inherently violent, imperialist, or racist does not reflect the greatness of our nation or the millions of Americans who have contributed to its progress."

Halligan confirmed that a top-to-bottom content review is already underway, with input from senior Smithsonian leaders and the Board of Regents. "We are working with leadership at the Smithsonian to audit and review all content at the museums," she said, "and we are committed to ensuring that such content honors our country's founding principles, tells the stories of American heroes, and does not promote fringe or activist ideologies masquerading as history."

She added, "We will provide updates on this audit as our progress unfolds."

The Smithsonian Institution responded to Fox News Digital with the following brief written statement: "The museum is committed to continuous and rigorous scholarship and research and unbiased presentation of facts and history. As such, and as previously announced, we are assessing content in Smithsonian museums and will make any necessary changes to ensure our content meets our standards."

The Institution did not answer specific questions regarding who authored the Entertainment Nation exhibit, whether outside academic consultants or activist organizations were involved, or who made the decision to present all exhibit text bilingually in English and Spanish.

The controversy comes amid a broader push by President Donald Trump to reshape cultural institutions he says have veered too far left.

In March, Trump issued an executive order directing the Board of Regents to eliminate "improper, divisive or anti-American ideology" from Smithsonian museums. He accused the institution of embracing what he called "a revisionist movement" aimed at "undermining the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light."

The Board of Regents includes the vice president, the chief justice of the United States, six members of Congress, and nine citizen regents. 

Vice President J.D. Vance and Congressman Carlos Giménez, both recent appointees, have advocated for an expedited review of Smithsonian content. Giménez, in a prior interview with The Wall Street Journal, confirmed tensions at the board's June meeting over how quickly to proceed, though ultimately a compromise was reached.

The Smithsonian receives approximately two-thirds of its $1 billion annual budget from federal appropriations. 

The Entertainment Nation exhibit opened in December 2022 and was billed as a permanent exhibition to "celebrate the power of popular culture to shape and reflect history." It is housed in a prime space on the museum's west wing and features artifacts and media from movies, television, sports, and music.

While the museum's stated goal is to explore how entertainment intersects with American identity, the Trump administration argues that it instead uses culture to smuggle in ideology often at odds with the values most Americans hold.

"Americans deserve a Smithsonian that inspires national pride, tells the truth, and reflects the greatness of this country," Halligan said. "Not one that serves as an agent for social change and cultural subversion."

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Chelsea scored the go-ahead goal on Malo Gusto's 83rd-minute shot that went in after a pair of deflections, beating Palmeiras 2-1 on Friday night for a spot in the Club World Cup semifinals.

Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead in the 16th minute but Estêvão, an 18-year-old who will transfer to Chelsea this summer, tied the score against his future club with an angled shot in the 53rd.

Gusto's shot following a short corner kick appeared to deflect off defender Agustin Giay and goalkeeper Weverton and sent the Chelsea portion of 65,782 fans into a frenzy. FIFA credited Weverton with an own goal.

Chelsea won't travel far for its next match, facing Fluminense on Tuesday at East Rutherford, New Jersey. Hércules came off the bench and scored in the 70th minute to lift Fluminense past Al Hilal 2-1 in Friday's earlier quarterfinal.

With Chelsea's win, three of the four semifinal teams will be from Europe, with one from Brazil.

The 23-year-old Palmer scored his first goal in the Club World Cup, and showed why he's widely considered one of the top attacking midfielders. He took a pass from Trevoh Chalobah and slipped the ball inside the far post.

Fans made it to Lincoln Financial Field on a holiday weekend that included a strike by nearly 10,000 city workers in Philadelphia, competition from an earlier Phillies game, and a concert and fireworks show near the Philadelphia Museum of Art. FIFA had slashed tickets to as low as $11.15.




FIFA president Gianni Infantino attended the game, the eighth of the tournament at the home of NFL Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles.

There was a pregame pregame tribute for Liverpool player Diogo Jota and his brother, André Silva, who were found dead near Zamora in northwestern Spain after the Lamborghini they were driving crashed and burst into flames on an isolated stretch of highway.

Chelsea forward Liam Delap and defender Levi Colwill each got their second yellow cards of the tournament and will be suspended for the semifinal. Chelsea also played without captain Reece James, who was removed from the starting lineup due to injury.

Estêvão agreed to a deal with Chelsea last summer that moved him to Chelsea after he turned 18. Estêvão huddled up with his future teammates — including Palmer — and received some friendly postgame encouragement.

“It's good to be the last English team and hopefully we can win it. There was a lot of fans tonight. More than usual than we've played. So it was nice.” — Palmer.

“Tonight will be a very difficult night to sleep because we'll feel like we could've done something different.” — Weverton.

House Republicans have propelled President Donald Trump's multi-trillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill to final congressional passage.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday signed the tax and spending cut bill Republicans muscled through Congress this week, turning it into law by his own self-imposed Fourth of July deadline. 

At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. 

Democrats united against the legislation, but were powerless to stop it as long as Republicans stayed united. The Senate passed the bill Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It passed the final version Thursday 218-214.

Here's the latest on what's in the bill and when some of its provisions go into effect. 

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill, solidifying the tax cuts approved in Trump's first term.

It temporarily would add new tax deductions on tip, overtime and auto loans. There's also a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year, a nod to his pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits. 

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.




A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years. 

There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. Proponents say this will boost economic growth.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, and the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and food aid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for people below the poverty line. 

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program's work requirements.

There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services. 

More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts. 

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments.

But the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate.

Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden's 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs. 

Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America's wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.”

A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.

Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The bill creates a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump's long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There's a new excise tax on university endowments and a new tax on remittances, or transfers of money that people in the U.S. send abroad. The tax is equal to 1% of the transfer.

A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated.

One provision bars for one year Medicaid payments to family planning providers that provide abortions, namely Planned Parenthood. 

Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation's debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote.

A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals.

The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.

Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.

Democrats say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country's fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that regard. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.”

FIFA paid tribute to Liverpool player Diogo Jota and his brother, André Silva, before kickoff at the Club World Cup quarterfinal games in Orlando, Florida, and Philadelphia on Friday.

The 28-year-old Jota and 25-year-old Silva were found dead near Zamora in northwestern Spain after the Lamborghini they were driving crashed and burst into flames on an isolated stretch of highway just after midnight Thursday.

At the match between Al Hilal and Fluminense at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, players formed a circle at midfield as the video board displayed a photo of the Portuguese soccer players. The crowd participated in a moment of silence.

At Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia where Brazil's Palmeiras faced Chelsea, a black-and-white photo of the brothers was displayed and a moment of silence was observed as players on both teams wore a black band on their sleeves.

Chelsea's Pedro Neto, a friend and Portugal national teammate of Diogo Jota, made the sign of the cross as he entered the pitch with a jersey on his shoulder that had Jota's and André Silva's first names. Neto held up the jersey during the moment of silence with the help of Enzo Fernández.

Spanish police are investigating the cause of the crash, which did not involve another vehicle, they said. They said they believe it could have been caused by a blown tire.

Jota's death occurred two weeks after he married longtime partner Rute Cardoso while on vacation following a long season when he helped Liverpool win the Premier League. The couple had three children, the youngest born last year.

Silva played for the Portuguese club Penafiel in the lower divisions.

Former Democrat leader of the California State Senate Gloria Romero joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss her reaction to the cancellations and a surge in assaults targeting ICE officers. 

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Friday she expects boxer Julio Cesar Chávez Jr. to be deported to Mexico to serve a sentence for alleged arms trafficking and organized crime, after he was arrested by ICE in Los Angeles on Thursday. 

Chávez was found to be in the country illegally last week after he made fraudulent statements on a 2024 application for permanent residency based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen.

"The hope is that he will be deported and serve the sentence in Mexico," Sheinbaum said during her daily news briefing Friday, referring to charges that Chávez faces for arms and drug trafficking.

The 39-year-old boxer, according to his attorney Michael Goldstein, was picked up on Wednesday by a large number of federal agents while he was riding a scooter in front of a home where he resides in the upscale Los Angeles neighborhood of Studio City, near Hollywood.

The arrest came only days after the former middleweight champion lost a match against influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul in Anaheim, California.

Chávez split his time between both countries. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Chávez for overstaying a tourist visa that he entered the U.S. with in August 2023 and expired in February 2024, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said.

According to the department, Chávez Jr. has been charged with several crimes while in the U.S.

On Jan. 22, 2012, the California Highwaay Patrol arrested Chávez and charged him with DUI alcohol/drugs and driving without a license. On June 23, 2012, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, convicted Chávez of the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol and sentenced him to 13 days in jail and 36 months' probation.

On Jan. 14, 2023, a District Judge issued an arrest warrant for Chávez for the offense of organized crime for the purpose of committing crimes of weapons trafficking and manufacturing crimes, in the modality of those who participate in clandestinely bringing weapons, ammunition, cartridges, explosives into the country; and those who manufacture weapons, ammunition, cartridges and explosives without the corresponding permit.

On Jan. 7, 2024, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested Chávez and charged him with Illegal possession of an assault weapon and manufacture or import of a short-barreled rifle. The court convicted Chávez of these charges.'

DHS also suspects Chávez is allegedly believed to be an affiliate of the Sinaloa Cartel, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. Chávez's application was based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen, who is connected to the Sinaloa Cartel through a prior relationship with the now-deceased son of the infamous cartel leader Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, according to DHS.

According to DHS, in December 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had made a referral to ICE that Chávez was an "egregious public safety threat," but he was allowed to reenter the country on Jan. 4, 2025 after records indicated the Biden Administration had not made him an immigration enforcement priority. 

The Biden administration allowed Chávez to re-enter the country and paroled him into the country at the San Ysidro port of entry, accorrding to DHS.

Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron has had her share of romantic relationships.

Among the most famous were her relationships with Third Eye Blind frontman Stephan Jenkins and actor Sean Penn. But these days, the mother of two is choosing to be single, she recently told Alex Cooper on podcast "Call Her Daddy."

For her, building her family was about "being honest with who I am and what I can give right now," she said, adding that she realized she "was not somebody who should be having kids with another person."

Here's why Theron chose to be a single mom, and why relationship experts support her decision.

For Theron, there were two main motivations.

First, Theron's parents had a tumultuous relationship. "There was a lot of alcoholism in my family," she said, "on both sides." And she grew up seeing the repercussions of that painful dynamic and wanted to avoid repeating what she saw at home.

Second, it was a recognition of how she functioned in a romantic relationship. "I used to be someone in relationships that would lose herself," she said. She would often attract narcissists, which meant "walking on egg shells, trying to protect ego," she said. And she avoided conflict, preferring to placate to them than to fight.

Ultimately, it was about "being very honest with myself and understanding that I did not have the capability of being healthy in a relationship," she said.

Sara Nasserzadeh, sexuality and relationship expert and author of "Love by Design: 6 Ingredients to Build a Lifetime of Love," lauds Theron's decision.

"I hear a woman choosing alignment," she says. "She is not turning away from love, she is choosing not to recreate cycles that would compromise her ability to live and love truthfully."

She also sees Theron's choice as one made by an awareness of her surroundings.

Historically, women have relied on men for financial stability, for example. "For many, partnership was a necessity more than a preference," Nasserzadeh says. "Charlize has the clarity, the support, and the resources to choose otherwise, and that is powerful."

Psychotherapist and author of "13 Things Mentally Strong Women Don't Do" Amy Morin has seen many women make a similar choice.

"Some were moms who didn't want to expose their children to their dating lives," she says, adding that, "others had done a lot of work on themselves but didn't want to practice their new relationship skills while the kids were around."

Others, still, simply felt their lives were full. They didn't need the romantic relationship.

"Some have experienced backlash as others question if they're truly happy or make jokes that there must be something wrong with them," says Morin. "But choosing to stay single can certainly be a sign of strength, not weakness."

At least 27 people have died after heavy rainfall caused flash flooding in parts of central Texas on Friday.

More than 25 children are also missing from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp along the Guadalupe River, which Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said rose 26 feet in 45 minutes as torrential rain battered the region.

The Heart O' the Hills, another girls' camp based along the river, said its director, Jane Ragsdale, had died in the floods.

"We have received word that Jane Ragsdale did not make it," the camp said in a statement posted to its website. "We are mourning the loss of a woman who influenced countless lives and was the definition of strong and powerful."

It added that the camp was not in session as the flooding hit, and that "most of those who were on camp at the time have been accounted for and are on high ground."

The National Weather Service said the Guadalupe River reached the second-highest height on record on Friday. The agency said it was also monitoring potential flooding around Lake Travis, and warned of "dangerous and life-threatening flooding and heavy rain" across multiple counties.

Here are some images showing the impact of the flooding and ongoing search and rescue efforts.

Let's face it: Americans are stressed. Google searches for "how to reduce stress" are high, and 77% of U.S. adults report that the country's future is a major source of stress, according to a survey done by the American Psychological Association.

So, it's no surprise that people are looking for ways to better manage their stress. One of the latest hacks to pick up some steam online is the "cortisol cocktail."

The drink often seen prepared in a wine glass, is actually alcohol-free and combines these ingredients:

Social media users, especially on TikTok, post videos of themselves making the beverage at home. They also address the claims that it can help lower the stress hormone, cortisol and share their experiences.

But can the mocktail actually help lower cortisol? We talked to medical professionals to find out if there are any real benefits.

Cortisol is a stress hormone in the body that maintains blood pressure and electrolytes, says Dr. Marilyn Tan, endocrinologist and clinical associate professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine.

"It's necessary for function, and without it, people could have dangerous changes in their sodium and potassium levels, and also low blood sugar and very low blood pressure," Tan says.

Cortisol rises during times of emotional or physical stress. And levels of cortisol are highest early in the morning, right after people wake up, and wane throughout the day, which makes them pretty difficult to track.

"Doctors asking patients to lower their cortisol? We almost actually never do that because it's something that's actually hard to track," says Dr. Jessica R. Lee, assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

"It's more about managing stress and other things that we think can contribute to the cortisol changes."

Only when someone has consistent and severely high levels of cortisol, or Cushing's Syndrome, would doctors recommend medication for lowering levels of the hormone, Tan says.

The ability of this viral mocktail to lower cortisol is unlikely, the experts say.

"I'm not aware of any studies that looked at the effects of these individual ingredients on cortisol levels," Tan says.

And Lee agrees: "There's not great studies out about any of this."

Lee points to "internet medicine" as the reason why things like the cortisol cocktail trend online. "It's quick, easy, viral clicks, is my guess," Lee says.

"I think a lot of people do notice feeling better, but there's a number of reasons why they feel better."

One reason may be that the combination of ingredients in the cortisol cocktail can make you feel more hydrated, which most people could benefit from, Tan says.

"It's kind of like Gatorade with the orange juice, the salt and the magnesium. People often think that it may help with sleep or help with relaxation," she says.

"There aren't any large randomized, controlled trials on the effects of magnesium and sleep quality or stress levels, per se. But if it helps people sleep better, that can also help with overall well-being and health."

"None of [the ingredients], separately, are actually known to reduce stress, except maybe magnesium," Lee says. "I think it just tastes nice."

While the cortisol cocktail is harmless for most and can be great for hydration, both experts caution people with certain conditions to avoid drinking it, and advise that you speak with your doctor before you do.

The magnesium and potassium intake can be harmful for people with chronic kidney disease, and the sugar can be troublesome for people who have diabetes.

If you've been feeling stressed often, Tan and Lee have suggestions for improving your mental health.

"Once somebody figures out what works for them, it's important to try to keep it up as a part of your overall wellness routine," Tan says.

Mo Gawdat's son, Ali, was 21 years old when he died due to medical negligence during a routine appendix surgery in 2014.

Gawdat was devastated, confused and in a palpable state of shock. Then, 17 days later, he started writing a book on how to be happy, in his son's honor.

Gawdat has researched the science of happiness for over 20 years from a logical and philosophical prospective, using flow charts and formulas to get to the root of unhappiness. A while back, he learned a habit that can almost instantly help you find joy and fulfillment.

It's called the 90-second rule, Gawdat told the "High Performance" podcast on June 17. When something angering or nerve-wracking happens in your life, give yourself a minute and 30 seconds to feel upset. Then, choose to focus on other things.

The habit is based on insight Gawdat learned from Harvard-trained neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor, who found that it takes only 90 seconds for stress and anger hormones, like cortisol and adrenaline, to be flushed out of the body.

"But then what happens is, you run the thought in your head again, and you renew your 90 seconds," said Gawdat, who served as chief business officer at Google X, the company's innovation lab, from 2015 to 2018. "You run it again, unconsciously, and you renew your 90 seconds. While in reality, what you get after those 90 seconds is a buffer ... [which] allows you to say, 'Now, what am I going to do?'"

Getting cut off while driving, for example, can be really agitating. You might yell or curse from behind the wheel, or even roll your window down to give the other driver a piece of your mind. But ruminating on the situation, telling everyone what happened when you get to the office, won't change it. So, what if you took a deep breath, turned your favorite song on, and sang along instead?

To recover more quickly from life's upsets, Gawdat asks himself three questions, he said:

"Ninety percent of the things that make us unhappy are not even true. Like your [partner] says something hurtful ... your brain is telling you [they] don't love you anymore," said Gawdat "That isn't true."

If your answer to question No. 1 is "no," drop it. If it's "yes," move on to question No. 2 and do the same thing over again. If there's something you can do about it, do it, he said. If not, go into "committed acceptance" – meaning, acknowledge what's happened and accept it as your new normal.

Building new habits can be difficult, especially when you're feeling emotional. In a 2009 study, psychology researcher Phillippa Lally found that it can take anywhere between 18 to 254 days to form a habit, depending on the person and their circumstances.

But being cognizant of how you respond to tough moments in life is the first step to being happier and more fulfilled, says Gawdat.

"Life doesn't give a s--- about you," Gawdat told Simon Sinek's "A Bit of Optimism" podcast on June 24. It puts you in good and bad situations, and lets you figure out the rest. "It's your choice, how you react to every one of them ... It's your choice to set your expectations realistically."

On what should have been a festive Fourth of July, disaster struck in Central Texas.

Extreme flooding left at least 27 dead in Kerr County, and as many as 25 children are missing from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp along the Guadalupe River.

President Donald Trump said his administration is working with state and local officials to respond to the flooding. On Truth Social, Trump said Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem would arrive in Texas "shortly."

"Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy," Trump wrote on Saturday. "Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!"

Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said at a press conference on Saturday morning that there were 27 confirmed fatalities in Kerr County after torrential rains early Friday morning, but that he expected that numbers to rise.

As much as 12 inches of rain fell in the county on Friday, with additional rainfall anticipated this evening, officials said. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning at 4 a.m.

As rain continues to fall, a desperate search is underway for those who may have been swept away by the floodwaters.

Officials said Saturday during a press conference that there were more than two dozen people still missing, at least.

Camp Mystic, located in Hunt, Texas, has about 750 campers. At least 25 girls remained unaccounted for on Saturday, officials said.

"That does not mean they've been lost," Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said at an earlier press conference Friday afternoon. "They could be in a tree. They could be out of communication. We're praying for all those missing to be found alive."

In a statement posted to its website, the Heart O' the Hills, another girls' camp based in Hunt, said its director, Jane Ragsdale, had died in the floods.

"We have received word that Jane Ragsdale did not make it," it said. "We are mourning the loss of a woman who influenced countless lives and was the definition of strong and powerful."

It added that the camp was not in session as the flooding hit, and that "most of those who were on camp at the time have been accounted for and are on high ground."

Patrick said during the afternoon press conference that the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in 45 minutes.

During the Friday night news conference, which was live-streamed on Facebook, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called upon God and the community.

"It needs God, but also needs a robust response by the state and local governments, and by people who live in these communities impacted," he said. "We had a meeting with officials at the state and local level, and there is extraordinary collaboration to make sure that we are going to address everybody's concern as quickly as we possibly can."

Camp Mystic welcomes girls once they've completed second grade. In the Guadalupe River camp group, girls can enroll in one of three sessions, each lasting either two or four weeks. The sessions run from May 30 to August 10, with dates divided across the summer.

On Facebook, parents and community members have circulated flyers with contact numbers, urging the public to help locate the missing children.

An 8-year-old from Dallas is among the missing. Her mother told WFAA News on Friday evening that she was traveling to reach the camp.

Kerr County has an estimated population of about 53,900, according to a 2024 counting by the US Census Bureau. The county sits in the Hill Country region of Central Texas, which includes cities like San Antonio and Austin. Beyond the Guadalupe River, the region is home to several others, including the Colorado, Concho, and Blanco Rivers.

With the county focused on locating the missing, several local cities have canceled Independence Day events.

As some consumers pull back on spending amid economic uncertainty, fast-casual restaurant chains are leaning on rewards programs to pull them back in.

Loyalty programs, which offer discounts or added perks for returning customers, have transitioned from being a nice bonus for restaurants to a must-have. As cost-cautious diners prioritize value, brands like Chipotle, Starbucks, Cava and others are utilizing rewards to keep customers coming back and building habits that go beyond the occasional coupon.

"In tough times, loyalty programs become more essential," said Peter Fader, a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. "They become a required ingredient to building and maintaining relationships."

In the 12 months ended in May, the restaurant industry only saw monthly traffic increase once, in November, according to Black Box Intelligence data. As diners visit restaurants less frequently, sales struggle. Only 43% of restaurant brands tracked by Black Box reported same-store sales growth in May.

Consumers who join loyalty programs visit restaurants more frequently, making 22% more visits per year to eateries, according to Circana data. They also frequent the brands that they belong to at twice the rate of nonmembers, the market research firm found.

Coffee giant Starbucks reported 34.2 million active rewards members in its second quarter and said more than 59% of its U.S. company-owned transactions came from those members. Potbelly has seen similar success: In the first quarter of 2025, over 42% of its total shop sales came from digital business, which includes the loyalty program users.

Chipotle has over 20 million active rewards members. It's loyalty program makes up approximately 30% of sales on average each day and helped the burrito chain to avoid major price hikes, according to the company.

"We have really strong brand loyalty among our members," Nicole West, Chipotle's vice president of digital experiences, told CNBC. "We're really focused on engaging with our members and doing that in a way that really resonates with them."

Driving loyalty is critical for the likes of Chipotle and Starbucks. In the first quarter, Chipotle posted a same-store sales decline for the first time since 2020 and said it saw a "slowdown" in consumer spending. Meanwhile, Starbucks' same-store sales have fallen for five straight quarters.

Cava is bucking industry trends with strong sales growth, but faces Wall Street pressure to maintain its rapid expansion.

As rewards programs pick up steam, more brands are getting creative and moving beyond the value meal.

Cava revamped its rewards program in October 2024 to give customers more flexibility in how they earn and use points. Members can earn points each visit and redeem them for specific items like pita chips or full entrees. The program also includes limited-time offers and in-app challenges. In late March, the company celebrated National Pita Day by rolling out a mascot named "Peter Chip" and offering members complimentary pita chips.

"Guests like to see periodic surprises and delight moments where we can reward them with pita chips or other brand offerings," Andrew Rebhun, Cava's chief marketing officer, said

The Cava Rewards program now has more than 7 million members. A new tiered system is expected to launch soon, according to Rebhun.

Chipotle this year launched a seasonal campaign called "Summer of Extras." The campaign is giving away over $1 million in free burritos, encouraging customers to rack up visits and compete to become the top Chipotle visitor in their state.

"We continue to see activations in this program build and excitement and positive reaction across social media from our fans," West said. "We just continue to focus on delivering value to them in ways through programs where customers are given opportunities to 'plus up' their points or earn specific offers by exhibiting specific behaviors."

Salad chain Sweetgreen also retooled its loyalty program this spring, moving away from its tiered subscription program that many consumers found confusing.

"In a challenging industry environment where consumers are making more intentional choices with every dollar, SG Rewards is designed to meet the moment by delivering a meaningful value," Sweetgreen co-founder and CEO Jonathan Neman said on the company's quarterly conference call in May.

Even Starbucks, an established leader in rewards programs, has made changes. In June, the coffee chain ended its 25-star reusable cup bonus and replaced it with double stars across the full purchase. While the change was controversial among loyalists, who claimed the earning potential was reduced, the coffee chain said participation has remained steady.

Of course, giving free rewards comes with tradeoffs. Promotions cut into profits in an industry that faces tight margins in the best of times. Restaurant chains hope those freebies drive longer-term loyalty and spending on full-price items.

Brands navigating economic pressure are seeing that loyalty programs are helping to drive visits.

Potbelly revamped its loyalty system in early 2024, moving to a coin-based structure that allows customers to redeem rewards faster and across more items. Customers now have access to over 14 menu items through the rewards program. This flexibility has led to more frequent visits, Potbelly's chief marketing officer, David Daniels, said.

"We saw a lift almost immediately in terms of engagement," Daniels said. "The response has been incredibly positive."

Chicago-style eatery Portillo's joined the loyalty game in March with "Portillo's Perks." Instead of using a traditional app, the program utilizes a digital wallet system and focuses on frequency. It tracks how often a customer visits and awards badges as they go.

"It gives flexibility to change how the program is deployed," Garrett Kern, Portillo's vice president of strategy and culinary, said to CNBC. "It doesn't require a redesign and relaunch to an application. It was a great way for us to get the program out there in a branded and easy-to-use way."

The company is aiming for 1.5 million to 1.7 million sign-ups by mid-summer.

Rollbacks of clean-energy credits in Trump's tax bill add to the sector's challenges as project cancellations rise.

The vast tract of land off Route 85 was meant to be a symbol of Made-in-America manufacturing. A billion-dollar battery factory was going to rise, bringing thousands of new jobs. The business announced, “Get Ready Arizona,” the governor said the state was thrilled and even the US president gave the project a shoutout. 

But here, in the boomtown of Buckeye, less than an hour away from Phoenix, the 214-acre lot sits empty. Work on the site had started, said Shelby Lizarraga, who manages the gas station next door, “but then it went all quiet.”

The tech industry is reeling after a software engineer was exposed as working at several Silicon Valley startups at the same time — and experts say it's a lesson on hustle culture gone too far.

Soham Parekh, a software engineer from Mumbai, went viral on social media after being accused by Playground AI founder Suhail Doshi on X of working at a number of startups simultaneously.

Doshi wrote: "There's a guy named Soham Parekh (in India) who works at 3-4 startups at the same time. He's been preying on YC [Y Combinator] companies and more. Beware. I fired this guy in his first week and told him to stop lying / scamming people. He hasn't stopped a year later. No more excuses."

The post racked up 25,000 likes with more founders coming forward about hiring Parekh, including AI startup Lindy, which fired him after seeing Doshi's post. 

Doshi confirmed to CNBC Make It via email that Parekh worked at the company. "We realized he was working multiple jobs shortly after he joined, based on constant large fluctuations in his availability and the quality of his output. He also attended an off-site, where it became pretty clear," Doshi said.

Soham Parekh did not respond to CNBC Make It's request for an interview.

Matthew Parkhurst, founder of software startup Antimetal, said Parekh was the company's first engineering hire in 2022 and was smart and likable. "We realized pretty quickly that he was working at multiple companies and let him go," Parkhurst said on X.

Other founders like Haz Hubble, the co-founder of social media scheduler Pally, also came forward about offering Parekh a founding engineer role.

"Around one week ago we offered him a role as founding engineer, with a total package worth $250k per year, but withdrew after he wouldn't live with us in San Francisco — now we know why!" Hubble told CNBC via email, explaining that as the company is early-stage, the team living and working together is crucial.

"To me it seems he must be addicted to the game of getting job offers, rather than actually making money, given he never lasts more than a few weeks and rarely gets paid. It begs the question — why?"

Lindy and Antimetal did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

In an interview on tech show TBPN on Thursday, Parekh admitted that it was true he was working for multiple startups at once and wasn't proud of what he had done.

"No one really likes to work 140 hours a week, but I had to do this out of necessity," Parekh said in the show. "I was in extremely dire financial circumstances."

Parekh said he only started doing this in 2022, and the grueling lifestyle meant he became a "serial non-sleeper."

He added that he "cared about these companies" and "greed wasn't an incentive," despite his financial situation. He said he always took the lower pay, higher equity offer at companies.

The tech community on social media is divided, however, with some questioning the ethics of secretly working multiple jobs, while others wonder how Parekh pulled it off.

The tale of Parekh is not unique within the tech industry, with many tech workers covertly working multiple jobs in recent years in an effort to shield themselves from mass layoffs and job market uncertainty.

A subreddit called "r/overemployed" was created in 2021, with users sharing advice on how they manage to balance multiple jobs without being detected.

"During the peak of Covid, there was this rush from tech companies to fire talent, and there was this intense competition for talent," Alexandru Voica, head of corporate affairs and policy at AI company Synthesia, told CNBC Make It in an interview.

"It caused, in some cases, this type of behavior to be more widespread than it was during non-pandemic times."

Voica noted that the rise of remote work was instrumental in enabling this behavior amongst tech workers. "That led to obviously incredible benefits for hard-working people, but also allowed people who have maybe this type of attitude to, all of a sudden, get jobs that they wouldn't have before."

Having at least two jobs is also common within India's IT sector. There was a 25-30% increase in moonlighting seen between 2020 and 2023, according to Randstad India, with workers citing factors such as low pay and remote work.

While Parekh's grueling work hours are unusual — even in tech — it's a reminder of how deeply hustle culture is entrenched within the industry.

"Silicon Valley's obsession with productivity metrics and fast hiring has created conditions where a person can juggle five roles — and not because it's efficient, but because no one is truly looking," Dmitry Zaytsev, founder of talent management company Dandelion Civilization, said to CNBC Make It.

"What we're seeing is the extreme end of hustle culture: when work becomes performance, and identity becomes fragmented."

Zaytsev explained that Parekh essentially passed multiple rounds of technical interviews because soft skills aren't as valued in tech. Qualities like commitment, reliability and team presence "are often overlooked until there's a crisis," he said.

"Burnout is a predictable outcome when the workplace culture rewards overcommitment and treats exhaustion as a badge of honor. Soham's admission that he worked 140 hours a week is not just unhealthy, it's a reflection of a system that equates worth with output," he added.

It comes as European tech startups face pressure from some VCs to adopt a more rigorous work schedule — such as China's "996" or Silicon Valley's 24/7, always-on culture — to better compete on a global tech stage. This has been met with backlash, with founders telling CNBC Make It that overwork can lead to a crisis of productivity, burnout, and even resentment.

Suranga Chandratillake, general partner at Balderton Capital, said this debate came about due to "a fetishization of overwork" and a glorification of hustle culture in the tech and startup scene in Silicon Valley.

Synthesia's Voica warned that workers who take advantage of flexible working policies risk painting other engineers in a bad light, and could have these benefits taken away.

"Most of the engineers that I know are very hard working, very dedicated, very passionate, and then when you have this type of more cavalier behavior, it sets this tone that this is normal behavior in the community," Voica explained.

This might cause employers to second-guess whether they should keep hybrid working policies in place, he said.

"This is going to impact women. It's going to impact people with disabilities [and] the more vulnerable, who actually benefited from this [flexible] work arrangement, and now they're going to be impacted by this type of behavior," he added.

KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — Texas parents frantically posted photos of their young daughters on social media with pleas for information as at least 23 campers from an all-girls summer camp were unaccounted for Friday after floods tore through the state's south-central region overnight.

At least 24 people were dead and many missing after a storm unleashed nearly a foot of rain just before dawn Friday and sent floodwaters gushing out of the Guadalupe River, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha told reporters Friday evening. The flood-prone region known as Hill Country is dotted with century-old summer camps that draw thousands of kids annually from across the Lone Star State.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

This past week has seen a resurgence in the altcoin market, with several coins leading the charge. Humanity Protocol (H) experienced a meteoric rise of nearly 380%, driven by major listings and institutional backing. Hashflow (HFT) followed closely, with a surge of over 80% in 24 hours, thanks to its Solana integrations and the regulatory tailwinds provided by the GENIUS Act. Even meme coins like MOODENG and BONK posted solid gains, indicating a rising risk appetite in the market.

Layer-1s and Layer-2s also showed signs of strength. Sui (SUI) continues to attract institutional inflows and developer interest, while Arbitrum (ARB) made headlines with its Timeboost upgrade and Robinhood's tokenization push. XRP and ETH both stayed relatively flat but remain in strong positions due to renewed ETF activity and tokenization narratives. The data points to a clear pattern: high-momentum, real-utility altcoins are waking up, even as the majors hold the fort.

Humanity Protocol (H) saw a meteoric rise following back-to-back listings on OKX Futures and Bithumb Spot on July 3. The protocol leverages zkProofs to solve real-world identity issues, boasting millions of users across its testnet and mobile app. Backed by major VCs like Pantera Capital and Jump, it recently acquired on-chain ticketing giant Moongate and partnered with Prenetics, a NASDAQ-listed firm, which will hold H in its treasury, fueling further confidence.

Hashflow (HFT) has stolen the spotlight this week after soaring over 80% in 24 hours, thanks to Solana ecosystem integrations and renewed investor interest. Its unique RFQ model and cross-chain smart routing differentiate it in the crowded DEX space. With $25B in RFQ volume processed, over $500M in liquidity offered, and exposure via Binance Launchpool, it's seeing increased attention ahead of its next token unlock on July 7. The GENIUS Act's passage may also provide regulatory tailwinds for DeFi projects like HFT.

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) surged nearly 90% this week as the SuperTrend indicator flipped bullish. As the token tied to the Pudgy Penguins NFT ecosystem, it gained traction from rising market sentiment around NFT-backed tokens. Analysts suggest a breakout above $0.018 could propel the token toward $0.028. However, the dip in trading volume to $314M signals slight market hesitation, likely due to profit-taking.

Bonk's 33% weekly surge follows the formation of a textbook Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart. As Solana's top meme token, BONK is benefiting from increased Ethereum and Solana activity. It's now testing the 200-day moving average around $0.00001881, considered a key breakout zone. If it clears this, the next upside targets lie at $0.00002580 and eventually $0.000039.

MOODENG exploded 60% this week following its listing on Upbit (KRW, BTC, USDT pairs). The hippo-themed memecoin broke out of a falling wedge and a symmetrical triangle, with volume skyrocketing from $50M to over $320M. Technical indicators like MACD and ADX confirm bullish momentum, and sentiment remains strong across South Korean trading circles.

Arbitrum (ARB) is back in the spotlight with the success of its Timeboost feature, a transaction ordering mechanism that has already generated $2 million in fees. The innovation ensures fairness in high-frequency trading on DEXs by minimizing MEV and slippage, and 20–30% of DEX volume is already adopting it. This technical edge is now being enhanced by Robinhood's rollout of tokenized stocks on Arbitrum Orbit, with plans for a full Layer-2 deployment. As Ethereum's leading L2, ARB is now poised to benefit from both DeFi and TradFi convergence.

Sui (SUI) continues gaining traction after surpassing $500B in cumulative trading volume. With Grayscale adding SUI to its high-growth watchlist and TVL touching $1.8B, institutional sentiment remains strong. Recent launches like zkLogin and cross-chain bridges are driving retail and enterprise adoption. Despite fears around a $123M token unlock, no major sell-offs were observed. Meanwhile, its parallel execution model and over 140 live dApps continue reinforcing developer interest.

Ethereum has shown stable growth as institutional flows hit $148.21M this week, fueled by inflows into spot ETFs by BlackRock and Fidelity. On-chain activity remains robust with over 2 million daily transactions, while the Pectra upgrade and EIP-7251 are enhancing wallet flexibility and scalability. Liquid staking continues gaining momentum, with 35M ETH staked and more institutions shifting reserves into ETH. New integrations and tokenized asset offerings are solidifying ETH's leadership across DeFi and real-world applications.

XRP's settlement with the SEC and the launch of XRPL's permissioned DEX have provided XRP with regulatory clarity and functional momentum. Ripple is now pursuing a U.S. banking license while exploring custody options for RLUSD. Mercado Bitcoin's $200M tokenization initiative on XRPL and growing institutional interest in tokenized assets are building a solid case for XRP's use in real-world asset liquidity. The court's reaffirmation of XRP's non-security status is cementing its institutional appeal.

Bitcoin had a quieter week in terms of price action but not fundamentals. Spot ETF inflows exceeded $600M, while long-dormant whales moved over $4.3B worth of BTC after 14 years. BlackRock's ETF alone now holds $76B, and Fannie Mae's consideration of BTC as mortgage collateral marks a pivotal TradFi shift. Regulatory clarity from the SEC and global reserve interest like Trump's BITCOIN Act are strengthening BTC's macro legitimacy, positioning it as the top digital asset for long-term institutional holding.

This week's market action is a compelling preview of the kind of altcoin-led rallies that often foreshadow a broader market breakout. The coins showing the most momentum, H, HFT, SUI, MOODENG, are not just riding hype cycles; they're backed by infrastructure upgrades, cross-chain integrations, or mainstream adoption plays. The memecoin segment is also attracting renewed interest, particularly on Solana, where BONK and MOODENG continue to outperform—indicating that retail is slowly creeping back into the market.

DeFi infrastructure tokens like ARB and HFT are gaining both from technical upgrades and regulatory support, suggesting early accumulation by traders betting on Q3 upside. Meanwhile, BTC and ETH remain the ballast, stable, institutional, and holding ground while capital begins to rotate into mid-cap plays. Altcoin season isn't fully here yet, but it's knocking at the door, and the smart money appears to be listening.

Introduction

Imagine logging into your Amazon account or walking into a Walmart, and instead of paying with a credit card or cash, you use digital dollars issued by Amazon or Walmart themselves. This isn't sci-fi - it's the very real possibility of Amazon and Walmart launching their own stablecoins (digital currencies pegged to real money like the US dollar). Such a move could shake up the way we shop, bank, and pay, in ways that both disrupt the financial system and improve everyday customer experiences. In this blog, we'll break down what's going on in simple terms and why it matters, even if you're not into crypto or tech.

What on Earth Is a Stablecoin, Anyway?

Let's start with the basics. A stablecoin is basically a cryptocurrency that holds a steady value - usually 1 coin = 1 US dollar. Think of it like a digital dollar bill stored in an app on your phone. Unlike Bitcoin, a stablecoin's price doesn't swing wildly; it's stable (hence the name) because it's backed by real assets or currency reserves. In other words, it's the digital lovechild of crypto and cash: it lives on a blockchain (a fancy public ledger on the internet) but behaves a lot like the money in your bank account.

Why would you care about a digital dollar? Because it can make money super easy to move around. You could send a stablecoin to anyone in the world in seconds, 24/7, like sending an email - no bank scheduling needed. For example, a farmer in India could sell goods to a buyer in Brazil and get paid within minutes using stablecoins, without either of them worrying about exchange rates or a payment getting held up. Stablecoins take away the “Will $100 today be $90 tomorrow?” anxiety - $100 in a stablecoin is designed to stay $100 tomorrow. This reliability has made stablecoins hugely popular in the crypto world: by 2024, people were transacting trillions of dollars in stablecoins each year, even surpassing some major credit card networks in volume! In short, stablecoins are digital cash that's fast, global, and doesn't fluctuate in value - perfect for everyday money matters.

Retail Giants Jumping In: What's the Big Deal?

Now here's where things get interesting. Amazon and Walmart, the two retail behemoths, have reportedly been exploring launching their own stablecoins (imagine something like “Amazon Coin” or “Wal-Coin”). When companies of this size and reach delve into crypto, it sends a strong signal across industries. These two aren't niche startups; they each serve hundreds of millions of customers. If Amazon or Walmart creates a stablecoin, it could suddenly bring this digital money into the mainstream in a massive way.

Why would they bother creating their own currency? The short answer: to save money and improve your shopping experience. Today, when you buy something on Amazon or swipe your card at Walmart, banks and credit card networks (like Visa or Mastercard) take a cut (via processing fees, interchange fees, etc.). Those fees might be invisible to you, but they cost retailers billions. Reports suggest Walmart and Amazon want to use stablecoins to cut out the middlemen - no bank or card network needed - which could save them billions in credit card fees over time. In fact, the news alone of these retailers considering stablecoins sent credit card company stocks tumbling, because it's a direct threat to their fee-based business.

But it's not just about fattening Walmart's or Amazon's profit margins. Crucially, some of those savings could trickle down to shoppers. With their own stablecoin, Amazon could reduce prices or offer discounts when you pay with “Amazon Coins” - essentially rewarding you for using their currency. (They already do something similar with their store credit cards; a stablecoin could amplify that.) Likewise, Walmart might give cash-back in Wal-Coins or special deals to loyal customers who adopt its coin. The appeal for these companies lies in locking in customer loyalty and keeping you within their shopping ecosystem. A Walmart Coin, for instance, might work like a super-charged store credit: you'd be more inclined to spend it at Walmart, and in return you might get better prices or perks - a win-win for loyalty.

Let's break down the potential benefits these retail stablecoins could offer, both to the companies and to everyday people:

In essence, Amazon and Walmart see a chance to reinvent the shopping and banking experience. They've each disrupted industries before - Amazon revolutionized retail and cloud computing, Walmart mastered supply chains and logistics - and now they have their sights on finance and payments. If they pull it off, paying for your groceries or gadgets might never be the same.

Shaking Up Banks and Credit Cards (Financial System Disruption)

It's not just about tech giants playing banker - this trend could rattle the traditional financial system. Banks and credit card companies are watching these developments like hawks, and for good reason. If millions of customers start holding and spending Amazon Coins or Walmart Coins, that money isn't sitting in bank accounts anymore. In fact, banks could see an exodus of deposits if people begin to keep some of their money in retailer-issued digital wallets instead of the local bank. Banks rely on deposits (your checking and savings balances) to fund their loans and operations. So if Amazon and Walmart convince everyone to load up their apps with stablecoins, banks might have to scramble. One finance writer warned that this stablecoin shift could force banks to reevaluate their whole model, as they risk losing a key source of funding. In plain English: your bank really doesn't want to compete with your Amazon account for who holds your cash.

Then there are the credit card networks. For decades, Visa, Mastercard, and AmEx have sat in the middle of our transactions, quietly taking a cut every time you swipe or tap. Retailer stablecoins could cut these middlemen out of many transactions. If you pay Amazon directly with Amazon Coin, Visa doesn't earn a cent from that sale. Multiply that by millions of sales and you see why this is a huge threat to the card companies. In fact, accepting stablecoins could help retailers sidestep those hefty interchange fees (the fees merchants pay to card issuers) entirely. Less reliance on credit cards also means consumers might not need to run up balances on high-interest cards for everyday purchases - you could use a stablecoin that represents actual money you have, not borrow on credit. All of this could force traditional payment networks to lower fees or innovate to stay relevant. It's telling that when the news broke about Amazon and Walmart's stablecoin explorations, Visa's stock price dropped ~5% and Mastercard's ~4% - investors know this could shake up the status quo.

From a customer's perspective, these changes could be positive, but they come with new considerations. On the plus side, as we noted, shoppers could enjoy simpler and cheaper payments. Who wouldn't want a payment method that's as quick as a text message and doesn't ding you with hidden fees? Consumers are always chasing anything that saves time or money, and stablecoins promise both. You might get the same $50 value to spend, but because it's in an Amazon/Walmart coin, you skip extra charges and maybe even earn perks. It's like getting more mileage out of your dollar, with less “friction” when you spend it.

However, trust and service become crucial. If Amazon or Walmart holds some of your funds in their coin, they'll need to provide customer service and security on par with banks. People will expect that their Amazon Dollars are safe, insured, and easily refundable if something goes wrong - otherwise they won't trust it for their paycheck or savings. This is new territory for retailers: dealing with fraud claims, lost passwords, or technical glitches that affect money. As one Nasdaq analysis put it, traditional players and new stablecoin systems will be in a “collision course,” and customer trust and service will be tested in new ways as we all adjust to this hybrid of retail and finance. In other words, Amazon might need to staff up its customer support not just for late packages, but for issues like “I sent $100 in Amazon Coin to the wrong person, help!” It's a big responsibility.

Banks won't go down without a fight, either. We might see them respond by offering their own digital currencies or better deals to keep customers onboard. Some are already lobbying for clearer regulations to ensure a level playing field. Ultimately, the entry of retail giants into currency creation is blurring the lines between tech companies and financial institutions. The upside is more competition and innovation (which usually benefits consumers with better prices and services). The challenge is ensuring stability and fairness - regulators will be watching closely to make sure these new coins are safe and don't destabilize the wider economy. But make no mistake, the financial system is poised for a shake-up. As one expert noted, money might shift from bank accounts to digital wallets managed by retailers, and that changes decades-old financial norms. It's akin to a power shift: some power moving away from Wall Street and the banking sector, into the hands of Silicon Valley and Main Street retail companies.

A New Era for Everyday Shoppers (Customer Experience 2.0)

Beyond the big finance implications, what would your day-to-day experience look like in an Amazon/Walmart stablecoin world? Potentially, better than ever. Both Amazon and Walmart built their empires by obsessing over customers. Amazon, in particular, has set gold standards for convenience - remember how they made two-day shipping the norm? (Over 40% of shoppers came to expect 2-day delivery thanks to Amazon Prime's influence.) These companies know how to streamline a service once they put their minds to it. So, imagine the same kind of focus being applied to how you pay and manage your money as a customer.

For one, payments could become almost invisible. If you're using an Amazon stablecoin, it might be integrated right into your Amazon app or browser. Checkout could be one-click and done - no entering card numbers, no redirect to PayPal, etc. The payment just happens in the background, instantly. This removes a lot of the minor friction that we've just accepted up until now. Think about Uber: you get out of the car and the payment happens without you doing anything. Stablecoin payments could bring that kind of effortlessness to many more transactions. You might simply scan a code in the Walmart app at a store, and your Walmart Coin balance instantly transfers to the store for your purchase. No counting cash or waiting for chip readers; it's as fast as handing over a dollar, but digitally.

Customer service around finances might improve in some ways. For instance, refunds and returns could be processed quicker. If you return an item, rather than waiting 5-7 business days for your bank to reflect the refund, the retailer could just release your stablecoins back to you on the spot. That money is immediately spendable again. Also, consider loyalty programs: instead of juggling gift cards, coupons, and rewards points, a stablecoin could unify these. Your rewards might be in the coin itself. Starbucks had a huge success with its Starbucks card/digital app - effectively customers pre-load money and are rewarded for it. Amazon and Walmart stablecoins could work similarly but on a larger scale. Rewards could be doled out automatically in the coin, and you'd see it right in your balance. It's simpler and more tangible than points that you later convert.

There's also a potential for a more personalized shopping experience. Data from stablecoin transactions can give retailers insights into customer habits. (Amazon already excels at using data to recommend products and streamline your experience.) With their own coin, they'd know even more about how you spend, save, and even transfer money. Now, that does raise privacy questions, but it could also mean Amazon/Walmart tailor deals very closely to your needs. For example, if Walmart's data sees you often transfer money to family abroad using Walmart Coin, maybe they offer a new low-cost remittance service just for that. Or Amazon notices you spend a lot on electronics, so paying with Amazon Coin gives you an extra warranty or support plan automatically. The possibilities for innovative customer perks are wide open.

However, we should note: using a retailer's currency means you're somewhat tied to their ecosystem. Amazon might make it easy to pay other merchants with Amazon Coin via its payment gateway, but if it doesn't, you're incentivized to keep shopping on Amazon to use your balance. Some critics might say this gives companies even more control over our spending. On the other hand, if it comes with enough benefits (savings, speed, inclusion), people may be fine with that trade-off. 

Security and trust will be paramount for a good experience. These stablecoins would need to be ultra-secure (Amazon and Walmart will likely implement strong security to prevent hacks or fraud). They know that one high-profile hacking incident could sour consumers on the whole idea. And because not everyone is crypto-savvy, expect Amazon and Walmart to hide the blockchain complexity under a very user-friendly interface. You might never have to think about private keys or crypto wallets - it'll just be your Amazon account balance. This “hiding of the tech” is key for mass adoption; people will use what's convenient and trustworthy, not what's technically cool. So, a big part of the customer experience change is that using digital currency could become as easy as using a gift card or a Starbucks app, without needing to know how the underlying system works.

Lastly, think about those who have limited access to banking today. Walmart in particular serves many underbanked communities and has offered check-cashing and bill-pay services in-store for years. A Walmart stablecoin could be loaded at the store with cash and then used online or in-store, bridging a gap for people who don't have credit cards. It effectively can turn cash into a versatile digital payment. That's a significant service improvement for many customers - no bank account needed, no prepaid card fees; just convert cash to Walmart Coin and you're set to shop or even send money to others at low cost. In a way, Amazon and Walmart might compete with banks by offering a quasi-bank account experience (minus lending, for now) that lives on your phone. This could spur traditional banks to step up their customer service game (better apps, lower fees) to avoid losing customers to Big Tech and retail.

To sum up, the change in customer experience could be dramatic: faster and cheaper payments, more rewards, simpler global transactions, and greater inclusion for those left out by the current banking system. If executed well, you as a shopper might say: “Wow, paying for stuff is easier and more rewarding than it used to be!” The key will be whether Amazon and Walmart can build enough trust and demonstrate clear benefits to get everyday people on board. Given their track record of shifting consumer expectations (Amazon made free two-day shipping an expectation, Walmart made one-stop discount shopping a norm), there's a good chance they could make stablecoins the next big thing without most shoppers even batting an eye.

Wrapping It Up

You might wonder, why are we hearing about this now? Two big reasons: regulatory green lights and crypto going mainstream. For years, crypto was like the wild west - exciting but unregulated, which made big companies wary. But in 2025, something changed. The U.S. government did what many thought unlikely: it started legitimizing and embracing crypto rather than fighting it. In fact, the Senate passed a landmark bill (cheekily nicknamed the “GENIUS Act”) that basically puts stablecoins on solid legal ground in the U.S.. This law sets strict rules (like requiring stablecoin issuers to fully back coins with real reserves and be transparent), which is exactly the clarity companies like Amazon and Walmart were waiting for. As one commentator noted, with clear guidelines now in place, “what's to stop an Amazon or a Walmart from rolling out a ‘Wal-Coin' for easy shopping payments?”. Regulatory green lights tend to bring innovation out of the shadows. Suddenly, using crypto for everyday things doesn't feel like tiptoeing through a legal gray area - it can be as normal as swiping a debit card. In short, Uncle Sam gave a cautious nod to stablecoins, and that opened the floodgates for serious corporate interest.

At the same time, public perception of crypto has evolved. It's not just seen as Monopoly money or speculation anymore. Over the last five years, major cryptocurrencies proved their staying power with massive growth (from 2020 to 2025, Bitcoin and friends vastly outperformed stocks, real estate, and gold), and more importantly, the underlying technology proved useful. Stablecoins became the backbone of many online transactions and even caught the eye of central banks. A recent survey found nearly 30% of Fortune 500 companies were using or exploring stablecoins in 2025, up from only 8% the year before. That's an explosive jump in adoption by mainstream businesses, likely prompted by the new legal clarity. Companies realized they can't ignore this trend without risking being left behind. It's not just the finance geeks anymore - household-name companies are dabbling in digital dollars for things like faster payments, loyalty programs, and global commerce. So Amazon and Walmart's moves are part of a bigger momentum. Even state governments got in on the action: crypto-friendly states like Wyoming are experimenting with issuing their own stablecoins to modernize local finance. In other words, everyone from policymakers to corporations seems to be converging on the idea that digitally-native money has a place in our future.

Amazon and Walmart likely see this convergence and decided the time is right. They have the scale, the tech prowess, and now a favorable environment to launch something revolutionary. It's the same reason we're seeing other non-bank players (even companies like Uber or Starbucks) looking into financial services - technology is enabling new contenders to enter what used to be a bank-only arena. If they succeed, Amazon and Walmart could not only make shopping more convenient for customers, but also insert themselves into the financial lives of those customers in a way that increases each customer's lifetime value to the company. It's a strategic move as much as a tech move.

Of course, execution matters. There are still challenges and questions. How exactly will these coins work? Will they be on a public blockchain or a private ledger? How will they handle refunds, fraud, or mistaken transactions? How easy will it be to convert your stablecoins back to real dollars if you want to? And how will regulators ensure Amazon and Walmart don't suddenly wield too much financial power? Those details are being sorted out. Regulators globally are scrutinizing stablecoins more than ever - companies will need to navigate rules carefully, comply with anti-money-laundering checks, and make sure they have solid cybersecurity. The good news is that giants like Amazon and Walmart have the resources to address these issues seriously. If they do launch coins, you can bet they'll roll them out slowly and with a lot of safety nets (perhaps starting in a pilot program or for limited uses).

In summary, Amazon and Walmart creating stablecoins is a big deal because it marks the moment where futuristic finance meets everyday shopping. It's like two worlds colliding - techy crypto and your weekly grocery run - with potentially transformative results. It could reshape who we trust with our money, how we earn rewards and pay for things, and even who gets to participate in the financial system. And importantly, it's happening in a climate that's finally ready for it: governments are giving thumbs-ups, technology is proven, and people are open to new digital conveniences. We are looking at the early days of a retail-finance revolution that might just make your life easier (and render that leather wallet a lot less important). Buckle up - the way we think about money and shopping might be about to change in a very big way.

FAQ

How is an Amazon or Walmart stablecoin different from gift cards or store credit?

Superficially, they sound similar - all represent value you can spend at the store - but a stablecoin is more powerful. Gift cards are usually only usable at the issuing store and often can't be transferred easily or used for other purposes. An Amazon/Walmart stablecoin would be a digital token typically pegged 1:1 to the dollar, meaning 1 coin equals $1 in value. Unlike a gift card, it could potentially be used beyond just the issuer's platform (for example, to pay other merchants who accept it, or even person-to-person payments). It lives on a blockchain, so you could send it to someone else instantly as payment, which you definitely can't do with a gift card. Also, stablecoins can be reconverted to cash (depending on how they design it), whereas gift cards are usually a one-way exchange (cash → card). Importantly, Amazon/Walmart stablecoins would likely integrate with loyalty programs and possibly earn rewards or discounts, functioning as both a payment method and a rewards system in one. Think of it this way: a stablecoin combines the spendability of cash with the perks of a store loyalty program, all in digital form.

What's in it for Amazon and Walmart? Why would they give customers discounts to use the stablecoin?

For Amazon and Walmart, a stablecoin is about control and savings. Currently, they pay billions in fees to banks and credit card companies for processing payments. If they get you to use their coin, they avoid those fees and keep the money in-house. That gives them room to incentivize you - for example, giving a small discount or cash-back in stablecoin for paying with it - while still coming out ahead because they've cut out the card middleman. Also, when customers use the stablecoin, they tend to stay within that ecosystem (you're likely to spend Amazon Coins on Amazon, for instance), which boosts customer loyalty and lifetime value. They also gain valuable data on spending habits across their platform. So, offering you a 2% discount for using Amazon Coin could be totally worth it if it means they avoid a 3% card fee and lock in more of your purchases. In short, they're willing to share some of the savings with you to encourage adoption. It's similar to how credit card reward points work, but here the retailer can potentially offer even better rewards since they're gaining more efficiency on the back end.

Are these stablecoins like Bitcoin? Will the value of my Amazon Coin go up and down?

No - in fact, the whole point of a stablecoin is that it doesn't swing in value like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies do. One Amazon Coin would almost certainly be pegged to one US dollar (Amazon hasn't confirmed specifics, but that's the typical model). So it's designed to be stable in price. If you have $50 worth of Walmart Coin today, it should be $50 worth tomorrow, next week, next year, etc. Bitcoin, by contrast, can be $50 one day and $60 or $40 the next day - great for investors or traders, not so great for buying your groceries. Amazon/Walmart's stablecoins would be more like digital dollars that live in a special wallet. They will likely be fully backed by actual dollars or dollar-equivalents in a bank to maintain that peg (some stablecoins do this with reserves). So you shouldn't expect any profit or loss from just holding the retail stablecoin; it's meant for spending, not investing. In everyday use, using Amazon Coin would feel a lot like using USD, just within Amazon's system. Bottom line: it's a payment tool, not a speculative asset.

What are the risks? Is it safe to use a stablecoin from a private company?

The idea comes with several considerations. On one hand, Amazon and Walmart are huge, reputable companies that people generally trust for commerce. They would likely ensure their stablecoin is fully redeemable (you can get your dollars out) and secure. They'd also have to comply with financial regulations, which adds safeguards. However, there are a few risks to keep in mind:

Overall, if implemented carefully, using a stablecoin from these companies could be safe and convenient, but it's wise to start slow. Treat it like you would any new financial app: maybe you don't move your whole paycheck into it on day one. Try small transactions, see how it works, and get comfortable. These firms will be heavily scrutinized by both regulators and the public, so they have a strong incentive to get it right and not betray customer trust.

How would I actually use an Amazon or Walmart stablecoin? Do I need to learn about crypto wallets?

Chances are, Amazon and Walmart will make it super simple. If they launch these stablecoins, expect an update to the Amazon app or Walmart app that introduces a built-in digital wallet. You might see a balance in “Amazon Coins” alongside your usual account info. To get coins, you might convert cash or credit to stablecoin within the app (for example, spend $20 from your bank to buy 20 Amazon Coins) or simply receive them as change/rewards. For usage, at checkout there'd be a new option like “Pay with Amazon Coin” or it might even default to it. In-store at Walmart, it could be as easy as scanning your phone at the register; the app would deduct your Walmart Coin balance to pay. They will hide the blockchain stuff under the hood - you won't need to manage private keys or deal with complicated crypto addresses. It will feel like using PayPal or Apple Pay, but branded to the retailer. In fact, some experts say it might be as seamless as swiping your debit card - crypto without the crypto headache is the goal. For advanced users, there might be an option to withdraw your coins to an external crypto wallet (if it's on a public blockchain), but average users probably won't ever need to. So, no, you likely won't have to become a crypto guru. If you can use a smartphone, you'll be able to use these stablecoins. The motto will be: as easy as spending cash, but digital.

Introduction

If you had thrown a few bucks into Bitcoin or Ethereum during the market chaos of 2020, you'd be sitting on returns that make even the hottest tech stocks look tame. In fact, from their low points in 2020 to mid-2025, leading digital assets massively outperformed traditional investments. We're talking Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, Avalanche even lesser-known crypto players leaving the S&P 500, Nasdaq, gold, real estate, bonds, and star stock ETFs eating their dust. It's a bold claim, but the numbers (and the chart) don't lie. How on earth did crypto soar so high so fast, and what does that mean for everyday folks and their finances? Let's break down this five-year asset class showdown.

In 2025, blockchain technology is no longer limited to cryptocurrency transactions. While digital wallets and token transfers once dominated the conversation, today's businesses are beginning to understand the true potential of blockchain development—far beyond just crypto. To remain competitive, agile, and secure in a fast-evolving digital world, companies must move beyond surface-level tools and invest in custom blockchain solutions tailored to their specific goals and industry demands.

Oops, something went wrong

The numbers don't lie: Ethereum's blockchain just processed more transactions in a single day than ever before, hitting a staggering 24.45 million transactions according to OnchainHQ analyst for on-chain, Leon Waidmann. That translates to over 1 million transactions per hour, or roughly 17,000 transactions every minute.

For context, this represents a massive leap from Ethereum's historical averages. Cryptocurrency Ethereum would be processed over one million times per day in early 2021, a figured that stayed relatively stable in recent years. The new record of 24.45 million daily transactions represents a 24x increase from those 2021 levels.

Several factors are converging to push Ethereum's transaction volume to unprecedented heights:

Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: The growth of Layer 2 networks like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism has dramatically reduced transaction costs while maintaining security through Ethereum's main chain. These solutions bundle multiple transactions together, creating more efficient processing.

DeFi Renaissance: Ethereum's DeFi segment is surging despite anemic market conditions, with users flocking to decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and yield farming opportunities. Each swap, stake, or loan creates multiple on-chain transactions.

Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions are increasingly building on Ethereum, bringing enterprise-level transaction volumes that dwarf retail activity.

Processing 24.45 million transactions daily puts Ethereum at roughly 283 transactions per second at peak capacity. While this still lags behind traditional payment processors like Visa (NYSE:V), which can handle 65,000 TPS, it represents a quantum leap for blockchain technology.

Ethereum hit 17.4 million weekly active addresses, up 16.95% in May, indicating that the transaction surge isn't just about existing users being more active—new participants are joining the ecosystem at an accelerating pace.

Trending: New to crypto? Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying trade on Coinbase.

Network Effects in Action: Higher transaction volume typically correlates with increased demand for ETH, which is required to pay gas fees. With 24.45 million daily transactions, that's substantial consistent demand for the native token.

Revenue Generation: Ethereum operates on a fee-burning mechanism (EIP-1559), where a portion of each transaction fee is permanently removed from circulation. Higher transaction volume could create deflationary pressure on ETH supply.

Competitive Positioning: While other blockchains tout higher theoretical throughput, Ethereum's actual usage demonstrates real-world demand and developer preference. Ethereum continues to dominate the blockchain development space, with 1,695 active developers as of last month.

Congestion Concerns: Extreme transaction volume can lead to network congestion and higher gas fees, potentially pricing out smaller users and applications.

Technical Limits: Despite improvements, Ethereum still faces scalability challenges. EIP-9698 proposes increasing gas limits by 100x, but such upgrades require careful implementation to maintain network security.

Market Volatility: The price of Ethereum is $2,416 today, still well below its previous all-time highs, showing that transaction volume doesn't immediately translate to price appreciation.

Ethereum's transaction record represents more than just a technical milestone—it signals the network's evolution from experimental technology to critical financial infrastructure. For investors, this usage growth validates the long-term thesis that Ethereum could become the foundation layer for a new financial system.

However, sustainable growth requires continued innovation in scaling solutions and gas fee optimization. The real test isn't whether Ethereum can handle 24.45 million transactions once, but whether it can consistently process this volume while maintaining security and reasonable costs.

FLOKI FLOKI$0.0₄7337 traded near $0.00007417 on July 5, up 1.32% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. As for the broader memecoin sector as gauged by the CoinDesk Memecoin Index(CDMEME), it is up 1.79% during the same period.

Although FLOKI is often categorized as a meme coin, its ecosystem has long featured gaming-related functionality, including NFT-based characters, play-to-earn mechanics, and token integration for in-game rewards. But the launch of the Valhalla mainnet marks its most ambitious gaming milestone to date.

On June 30, 2025, FLOKI officially launched Valhalla, a blockchain-based game inspired by Norse mythology. The game runs on opBNB, a Layer-2 network designed to enable fast and inexpensive transactions. Players take control of Veras — customizable NFT characters — in a browser-based, turn-based tactical MMORPG that blends combat, exploration, and questing with blockchain-backed rewards. The play-to-earn economy is built around FLOKI tokens, which players earn by completing in-game tasks and winning battles.

To support the game's rollout, the FLOKI team has committed millions of dollars from its treasury to fund development, marketing campaigns, and in-game incentives. That long-term investment signals the project's intention to build a sustainable blockchain gaming ecosystem rather than a short-term promotional play.

And on June 27, FLOKI announced a partnership with Method, a well-known esports organization recognized for its World of Warcraft dominance. Method will serve as a strategic content partner, producing onboarding materials, game guides, and live coverage to help Valhalla appeal to both traditional gamers and crypto-native audiences. The partnership will include branded jerseys and appearances in gaming tournaments throughout 2025 and 2026, designed to grow Valhalla's player base and community awareness.

These developments represent a pivotal moment in FLOKI's evolution, as the project attempts to move beyond its meme origins and establish itself at the intersection of Web3 technology, entertainment, and digital asset ownership.

On July 8, 2025, the nation's top policymakers, technologists, and financial innovators will convene at the National Press Club for the U.S. Strategy for AI & Crypto (USSAIC) Congressional Exchange, a landmark event designed to shape the future of digital assets and artificial intelligence policy in the United States.

 
        WASHINGTON, July 5, 2025 (Newswire.com)
        -
    USSAIC is hosted by the Texas Blockchain Council AI Innovation Association. The conference will feature keynotes from law and policy makers that are actively defining the path forward. Additionally, USSAIC will have speakers from Lockheed Martin, the Bitcoin Policy Institute, and the Blockchain Association, as the event brings together leaders from both the public and private sectors to discuss regulatory clarity, innovation frameworks, and national competitiveness in emerging technologies.

Among the highlights will be a keynote interview with entrepreneur and Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who will discuss the need for a "pro-innovation, anti-surveillance" approach to digital asset regulation.

The USSAIC event arrives just days before the U.S. House of Representatives officially designates the week of July 14 as "Crypto Week", during which lawmakers will consider three major bills:

The CLARITY Act, establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets

The GENIUS Act, focused on stablecoin oversight and innovation

The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, aimed at blocking the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency

According to House Financial Services Committee leadership, these bills represent a coordinated effort to position the United States as the global leader in digital finance while safeguarding consumer privacy and market freedom.

"This is the most consequential week for crypto policy in U.S. history," said Lee Bratcher, President of the Texas Blockchain Council. "The USSAIC Exchange was designed to catalyze bipartisan collaboration, and we're proud to see that vision materialize in Congress." Pavan Agarwal, the Founder of AngelAi (see AngelAi.com) added "The convergence of AI and crypto demands thoughtful legislation so that innovation and decentralization fuel a competitive marketplace. We're encouraged by the House's commitment to clarity and innovation."

About USSAICThe U.S. Strategy for AI & Crypto (USSAIC) Congressional Exchange is an annual policy summit that brings together lawmakers, regulators, and industry leaders to shape the future of emerging technologies.

The Ethereum price is currently locked in a narrow trading range of around $2,500, with momentum stalling despite the market's bullish expectations. In light of this, a leading crypto analyst warns that current price action lacks the strength needed for a powerful upward move, urging traders to remain cautious. The analyst notes that without a clear breakout signal, entering the market now could expose investors to potential downside risks. 

$2,800 Breakout Key For Ethereum Price Bull Rally

A new analysis released on the X social media platform by market expert Daan Crypto Trades reveals that the Ethereum price has continued to trade within a well-defined price channel, currently holding above the $2,500 level at $2,527. The analyst emphasized that $2,800 remains the key breakout point that could trigger an Ethereum bull rally. 

The market expert shared a chart highlighting that ETH remains confined between a “range low” of $2,313 and a high of $2,736, with multiple failed attempts to break out of this tight structure. The chart also shows that the mid-range level of around $2,519 has become a critical point of control. 

Despite a brief rally that pushed the Ethereum price above $2,570 earlier this week, the cryptocurrency was still unable to sustain the upward move, slipping back below the $2,519 level before recovering to its current price of around $2,527. Daan Crypto Trades explains that the reason for Ethereum's sluggish performance is its continued struggle to establish a solid footing in the $2,500 price region. Given the clear price imbalance in this zone, the analyst advises traders to exercise caution before entering the market. 

Within this range, traders may encounter increased price volatility and potential fakeouts, both above and below the key support and resistance levels. Given the unstable market environment, Daan Crypto Trades suggests that until Ethereum breaks and holds above the $2,800 mark, traders are likely to face more sideways action and unpredictable price swings. A clean breakout above $2,800 could be the key to the start of a bullish trend, improving conditions for ETH and pushing it out of its present downtrend. 

ETH Four-Year Consolidation Sees An End

Market expert Mister Crypto has also shared insights on the current Ethereum price action. The analyst declared in a recent X post that ETH is on the verge of exiting a prolonged multi-year consolidation phase. His chart, which visualizes the cryptocurrency's historical price movements, marks two key periods—a powerful 48x rally from 2018 through 2021, followed by a four-year horizontal consolidation range that spans from the 2021 top to the present day. 

The analysis suggests that this extended period of range-bound movement could be a prelude to a potentially explosive bull trend, similar to the breakout seen in the past. In line with this, Mister Crypto marks a large open-ended “??X” label on his chart, suggesting the next breakout phase is imminent—though the precise magnitude is left speculative.

Movements of bitcoin cash BCH$483.08 took place amid the mysterious transfers of $8.5 billion worth of ‘Satoshi-era' bitcoin late Friday.



Conor Grogan, a director at Coinbase, flagged a suspicious BCH transaction of over 10,000 tokens (worth nearly $5 million at current prices) tied to one of the whale wallets hours before the main transfers began.



The move raised the possibility that someone may have gained access to legacy private keys and quietly tested them before initiating the massive BTC movements.



“There is a possibility that the owner was testing the private key in a way that wouldn't get noticed,” Grogan posted on X. “BCH isn't monitored heavily by whale-watching services.”

Eight wallets that had been dormant since 2011 each transferred 10,000 BTC to new SegWit addresses on Friday, over 14 years after initially receiving bitcoin in what is now colloquially known as the network's “Satoshi era.”None of the wallets have, so far, been linked to any known entity or company, but the timing, scale, and manual nature of the transfers have set off alarm bells.



Grogan pointed out that only one BCH address associated with the BTC cluster was touched. “Why not sweep the others?” he asked. “It implies the actor may not have full access.”



But the timing is uncanny: just one hour after the BCH test transfer, the first of the 80,000 BTC started to move — triggering the largest Satoshi-era bitcoin movements ever recorded.



So far, the new bitcoin addresses haven't forwarded funds further or deposited them on exchanges. But the BCH test could indicate someone was probing before executing a coordinated transfer, possibly to avoid triggering whale alerts or spooking the market.



Other theories extend from a private key leak to even a quantum computing attack.



Bitcoin's early addresses, especially Pay‑to‑Public‑Key (P2PK) formats, expose public keys after their first transaction — once available, they become theoretically crackable using Shor's algorithm if large-scale quantum hardware materializes.



(Dormant wallets that have never revealed their public key are safe even in a quantum future as no public key exists to reverse-engineer.)



As such, the fact that only one associated BCH wallet moved during testing while the others remained untouched suggests limited access.

 JPMorgan's blockchain lead says merging TradFi with DeFi is accelerating, as the bank's pilot with Chainlink and Base shows traditional institutions moving onchain. 

The divide between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) could disappear within the next few years, according to Nelli Zaltsman, head of blockchain payments innovation at JPMorgan's Kinexys.

Speaking alongside Chainlink Labs co-founder Sergey Nazarov at the RWA Summit Cannes 2025, Zaltsman said JPMorgan is pushing to merge institutional-grade payments infrastructure with emerging onchain assets, signaling what could be a tipping point for mainstream blockchain adoption.

“Our goal has always been to find the best way to work with the public blockchain, regulatory environment permitting,” said Zaltsman. She described JPMorgan's blockchain strategy as “asset agnostic,” aiming to give clients real-time access to multiple networks while minimizing friction.

The banking giant recently piloted synchronized settlement technology with Chainlink, allowing JPMorgan's blockchain-based deposits to orchestrate transactions across different blockchains. Nazarov called the milestone a “very early sign” of how major banks can connect traditional capital with digital asset markets.

Zaltsman predicted that the artificial boundaries separating traditional and decentralized finance would dissolve faster than many expected, driven by improved infrastructure and growing industry willingness to work together.

She noted that even a decade ago, JPMorgan had to build its own private blockchain due to the absence of suitable solutions. “Thankfully, that's not the case today,” Zaltsman said. “It took many years for there to be tools that are kind of underpriced and in support,” she added.

“I hope that this convergence happens sooner rather than later… we start looking at tech for what it is and how we can help different users and not… having these artificial boundaries,” Zaltsmann said.

Last month, JPMorgan expanded its blockchain efforts by piloting its new deposit token, JPMD, on Coinbase's Base network. Zaltsman called the launch “an exciting milestone for the team and I think kind of the Northstar moment for us.”

Unlike stablecoins, these deposit tokens stay within the bank's deposit system while offering clients direct access to blockchain-based markets, effectively bridging onchain liquidity with institutional cash management.

Meanwhile, Nazarov highlighted the industry-wide impact of JPMorgan's participation. “What JPMorgan does is that it can drive a lot of the other banking institutions in the world to take notice,” he said.

Nazarov also pointed out that cryptographic proofs and smart contracts can now give smaller counterparties the same reliability as top-tier banks, unlocking new opportunities in capital markets.

“They can prove that solvency, you know, by cryptographic means. They can prove through smart contracts or oracle networks, through compliance engines verifying things,” he said, adding that this dynamic could boost competition and product innovation across financial services.

Robinhood‘s plan to tokenize stocks and offer around-the-clock trading is raising alarms for traditional exchanges like the NYSE.

Robinhood is taking a bold leap into the future of equity trading with its new blockchain-powered tokenization platform. This move enables users to trade tokenized versions of stocks at any time, challenging the dominance of traditional exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange.

The initiative could reshape how financial markets operate, offering faster settlements, expanded hours, and programmable financial assets but not without serious implications for market stability and regulatory oversight.

At the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC), Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev introduced “Robinhood Chain,” an Ethereum-compatible layer-2 solution built on Arbitrum Orbit. This new chain will allow users to trade tokenized derivatives of stocks, initially on a 24/5 basis with plans for full 24/7 access.

The tokens represent wrappers of real-world stocks held by a US broker-dealer, enabling onchain activity without detaching from actual equity ownership. This could offer near-instant settlement, direct self-custody of assets, and decentralized application integration.

According to a detailed analysis by Galaxy Digital, Robinhood's blockchain model could erode the NYSE's competitive advantage, which is built on concentrated liquidity and market data revenue.

Galaxy stated, “This directly challenges the deep concentration of liquidity and activity that gives major TradFi exchanges (e.g., NYSE) their competitive advantage.”

By capturing both trading fees and downstream blockchain use cases, Robinhood is positioning itself to profit from every stage of the trading lifecycle.

Robinhood's strategy also includes tokenizing private equity assets, such as investments in OpenAI and SpaceX, and offering fractional ownership. This could open access to traditionally exclusive markets.

A 2023 Journal of Financial Economics study found that tokenized securities can reduce trading costs by 30 percent compared to traditional methods.

While Robinhood's tokenized trading is currently available only in the EU, the U.S. regulatory landscape is starting to shift. The recently passed GENIUS Act by the U.S. Senate may pave the way for broader cryptocurrency regulation, potentially supporting innovations like Robinhood Chain.

Still, regulatory clarity is lacking. The SEC has not commented, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) urged the agency to reject trading models that fall outside Regulation NMS.

While 24/7 trading increases accessibility, it also brings the risk of significant overnight price swings. Retail investors, in particular, may face heightened exposure without proper safeguards or education.

Galaxy Digital cautions that unless legacy exchanges adapt to this evolving landscape, they could be relegated to managing less versatile versions of the same assets now made dynamic on blockchain networks.

Robinhood's blockchain-based trading model represents a disruptive shift in how assets are bought and sold. By offering around-the-clock trading and advanced token features, it challenges the longstanding dominance of exchanges like the NYSE. However, this innovation also introduces serious volatility and regulatory risks that must be managed. The success of this approach hinges on whether Robinhood can balance innovation with investor protection and whether regulators will support or stifle this emerging model.

Bitcoin has rocketed higher over the last 10 years, confounding its critics and making its mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto potentially one of the world's richest people.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

Bitcoin's rise, which some think could be just getting started, has sparked huge interest in the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, who has remained anonymous despite multiple attempts to unmask them.

Now, as a perfect storm is heading toward bitcoin, a $8.6 billion anonymous bitcoin transfer just weeks after Arthur Britto, a cofounder of Ripple's XRP, broke a 14-year silence has sparked wild speculation he could be Satoshi Nakamoto.

Satoshi Nakamoto, the mystery creator of bitcoin, could be worth over $100 billion. 

Last month, Arthur Britto, the mysterious cofounder of Ripple's XRP Ledger who created it along with Jed McCaleb and David Schwartz in 2012, posted to X for the first time since creating his account in August 2011—a message consisting of just an emoji of a face without a mouth.

Britto's reappearance after over a decade of obscurity was seized on by holders of Ripple's XRP, who speculated about what the timing of his return might mean just as the XRP price has soared to levels not seen since 2017 over the last year.

Britto—in contrast to McCaleb and Schwartz who are both public figures in the world of bitcoin and crypto—has no verified photographs online and has never given an interview, cultivating a degree of mystery to rival Satoshi Nakamoto.

"Satoshi's last known message was in April 2011," one XRP fan account posted to X, going on to suggest bitcoin was merely a precursor to XRP. “May 2011: David Schwartz starts building the XRP Ledger. August 2011: Arthur Britto joins Twitter. Now, 14 years later Britto reappears… and 14 years old dormant bitcoin wallets just moved.”

On Friday, bitcoin saw its largest transfer on record, with more than $8 billion worth of bitcoin that were mined during the network's earliest days that's sometimes called the “Satoshi era” moving for the first time.

Eight wallets were spotted moving 10,000 bitcoin each to new addresses, with the identity of the wallets' owner remaining unknown—though one researcher speculated they might belong to Roger Ver, an early bitcoin investor known as bitcoin Jesus before backing a bitcoin fork called bitcoin cash and running afoul of the U.S. IRS over $48 million of tax it claims is owed.

The 80,000 bitcoin are now in new wallets using a modern address format, something that could have been done to prevent against future quantum computing attacks.

"Sure would be interesting if someone like Arthur Britto happened to control Satoshi's BTC wallet," another X user posted, while others also fanned the flames of the theory that included speculation David Schwartz might be Satoshi Nakamoto.

“What if I told you Satoshi has been hidden in plain sight this entire time,” another XRP fan account posted alongside a photo of Schwartz apparently taken in 2012, in which he's sporting a bitcoin miner t-shirt.

Schwartz has previously denied he's Satoshi Nakamoto, posting to X that theories suggesting he developed bitcoin with former Ripple executive and engineer Nik Bougalis are, "not true, but it's plausible."

The bitcoin price has hit a record high this year, making bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin ... More believed to be worth over $100 billion.

Satoshi Nakamoto has been linked to dozens of different people over the the years by internet sleuths, researchers and reporters, from an obscure, now deceased computer scientist called Hal Finney all the way through to Tesla billionaire Elon Musk and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey (one crypto exchange executive has claimed Satoshi Nakamoto's identity might already be known by some).

Just last year, HBO documentary film maker Cullen Hoback named Peter Todd, a bitcoin core developer who has been involved with bitcoin since 2010, as who he believes to be the real-world identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, though he failed to produce proof.

Almost all of the most likely names associated with the Satoshi Nakamoto name have denied they are Satoshi Nakamoto, except for Australian computer scientist Craig Wright, who fought a multi-year legal campaign to be recognised as bitcoin's creator despite being unable to produce evidence.

A renowned cryptocurrency tycoon has unveiled a list of five little-known altcoins that form the backbone of his multimillion-dollar investment plan. With a surprising focus on popular meme-based tokens, this revelation is set to shake up the digital currency market. Readers are eager to discover which coins could potentially offer significant returns.

XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it's a growing community built around passion for the game.

With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project.

What sets $XYZ apart? It's not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth.

Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto.

The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.

Launch Price: $0.0001

Price Now: $0.003333

Next Stage: $0.005

Final Presale Price: $0.02

Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries.

So far, over $14 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch.

Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns.

AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain that's making waves in the crypto world. Avalanche stands out for its low fees and lightning-fast transactions, processing up to 4,500 transactions per second. One of its unique features is the ability for users to launch customizable Subnets, allowing developers to create their own blockchains. With a hybrid consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto principles, Avalanche aims to finalize transactions in less than two seconds.

The platform consists of three interoperable chains—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that handle different tasks like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX plays a crucial role in this ecosystem. It's used for transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and operating multiple Subnets. Given its strong utility in payments, staking, and enabling custom tokens, AVAX holds potential in the current market cycle. Compared to other coins, Avalanche's eco-friendly approach and rapid processing capabilities may appeal to those looking for scalable and sustainable blockchain solutions.

Chainlink is a network that helps smart contracts talk to the real world. Smart contracts are like digital agreements on the blockchain, but they usually can't access data outside their network. Chainlink solves this problem using oracles, which bring data from external sources to the blockchain. This allows smart contracts to use real-world data, like prices or events. Chainlink ensures this data is accurate by checking it through multiple sources and using a reputation system.

The potential of Chainlink is huge. By connecting blockchains to real-world data, it makes smart contracts much more useful. This is important for industries like finance, insurance, and supply chains. The LINK token is key in this system. It's used to pay for data services and rewards those who provide accurate data. In the current market, LINK stands out because it offers real utility. While many other coins are just speculative, Chainlink has a working product used by many projects. With growing interest in decentralized finance, Chainlink's technology could be very attractive to investors.

The Polygon Ecosystem Token, or POL, is a key player in the Polygon network. It powers operations and services across the ecosystem. By staking POL, token holders support the network's security and participate in consensus processes. This involvement not only strengthens the system but also rewards participants with additional tokens. POL also gives holders a voice in the network's governance. They can vote on proposals that shape the future of Polygon, ensuring the community's interests are considered.

POL's diverse uses make it stand out in today's market. It provides access to exclusive services within Polygon, offering benefits beyond trading. As the Polygon ecosystem grows and adds more applications, the demand for POL may rise. Compared to tokens with a single purpose, POL's multiple functions could make it attractive to those watching market trends. While the crypto market can be volatile, tokens linked to active and expanding networks like Polygon are gaining attention. POL's potential is tied to the growth and success of its ecosystem, positioning it as an interesting token in the current market cycle.

Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency known as DOT. It enables secure communication between different blockchains, allowing data and value to be shared across platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin without middlemen. Using parachains, Polkadot boosts speed and scalability, processing transactions much faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking within the network, letting holders participate in decisions and transaction verification. Launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot was developed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood and is maintained by the Web3 Foundation. It promises a future where blockchains are more interconnected and efficient.

Polkadot's technology holds significant potential in the evolving blockchain landscape. Its unique ability to connect multiple blockchains positions it well in a market that values interoperability. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Polkadot offers solutions to scalability issues that have challenged platforms like Ethereum. With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the need for faster, more efficient networks, Polkadot's approach is timely. The current market cycle has seen increased interest in blockchain technologies that can handle more transactions at lower costs. While market conditions can be unpredictable, Polkadot's innovative framework makes it a project worth watching as the blockchain ecosystem continues to grow.

While AVAX, LINK, POL, and DOT are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, blending meme culture with sports enthusiasm.

 Hong Kong prepares third batch of tokenized bonds and unveils a sweeping digital asset strategy to solidify its role as Asia's crypto finance leader. 

Hong Kong plans to expand its tokenized bond program, as the government prepares a third batch of tokenized green bonds and signals intentions to make such issuances a regular feature of its debt strategy.

Speaking at the Hong Kong Digital Finance Awards 2025, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui confirmed that the government's upcoming tokenized bond sale builds on the success of two earlier rounds of tokenized green bonds issued in 2023 and 2024.

The bonds were recorded and settled on distributed ledger technology, according to a Thursday report from Beijing state-owned newspaper Wen wei Po.

Hui said authorities aim to normalize tokenized government bonds in the future. To encourage wider adoption, the government is considering tax incentives, including exemptions on stamp duty for transfers of tokenized exchange-traded funds.

Hong Kong's embrace of tokenization comes as part of its broader digital asset strategy outlined in the newly released Digital Asset Development Policy Declaration 2.0.

Last week, the region announced that the new digital asset plan centers on regulating stablecoins and promoting asset tokenization through its “LEAP” framework, aiming for legal clarity, ecosystem growth, real-world adoption and talent development.

As part of the new framework, the government will implement a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers starting Aug. 1, which “will facilitate the development of real-world use cases.”

Meanwhile, the government is consulting the public on proposed licensing rules for digital asset trading platforms and custodians, with the consultation period open until the end of August.

Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) has also launched the city's first digital asset indexes, offering price benchmarks for Bitcoin and Ethereum during Asian trading hours. The effort aims to attract institutional investors by providing reliable onshore reference prices.

Last month, Hong Kong's financial regulators announced plans to roll out digital asset derivatives trading aimed at professional investors.

The move builds on recent approvals for spot cryptocurrency ETFs, futures products, and staking services. In April, HashKey received authorization to provide staking, underscoring the city's push to establish itself as a top digital finance center.

In May, Hong Kong's Legislative Council passed the Stablecoin Bill, setting the stage for a regulated environment that could cement the city's role as a global hub for digital assets and Web3 innovation.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum is vulnerable in a handful of important growth sectors.

Solana stands to steal Ethereum's capital share in those sectors.

Ethereum's problems are not getting better fast enough.

10 stocks we like better than Ethereum ›

Sometimes having a lot of capital doesn't guarantee lasting dominance. In fast-evolving ecosystems like crypto, today's winners can end up looking clunky pretty quickly. And that's the risk facing Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) today. While it remains the largest and most versatile smart contract platform, Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) is rapidly undermining Ethereum's edge in three key areas, each of which poses a long-term threat to Ethereum's upside.

Investors who still see Ethereum as the default smart contract play need to ask a hard question. What happens to the coin's upside if its positions in some of the most lucrative future niches are already starting to erode today? Let's take a peek at the three fault lines where Solana's encroachment looks most dangerous to see why the answer to that question justifies considering selling Ethereum.

Tokenizing off‑chain assets like bonds, stocks, and even real estate could be a $16 trillion market by 2030.

Today, Ethereum hosts about $7.5 billion of those assets, equal to almost 59% of the on‑chain total. Solana's share is just $361 million, or 2.8%, but that sliver is growing.

This is important because asset management flows are sticky. Once a custodian integrates with a chain, it rarely moves its capital elsewhere unless there's a major problem. Every point of market share Solana siphons from Ethereum is not only capital Ethereum likely loses forever, it is also capital that earns Solana nonstop transaction fees.

But why is capital likely to migrate to Solana in the first place? In short, Ethereum's high gas (user) fees and slow transaction times.

Ethereum's defenders point to the Dencun upgrade, which slashed average gas fees to roughly $0.39 for a swap, as well as its latest upgrade called Pectra, which is meant to cut fees even more. But as of midafternoon on July 2, gas fees were more than $1.15 for a simple token swap, and transaction times took roughly 30 seconds from end to end. Solana's typical fee is about $0.0001.

An enterprise moving hundreds of thousands of securities will notice and be inconvenienced by the difference between $1.15 and fractions of a cent.

If nothing changes, Solana's lower operating cost will keep nibbling away at Ethereum's tokenized capital year after year. And given the many years that Ethereum has tried and failed to reduce transaction costs to negligible levels, it makes more sense to bet on Solana here, though it's still an underdog.

In case you're not familiar, DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) aims to settle real‑world services such as Wifi, mapping, and sensor data directly on‑chain, using cryptocurrency as the medium of exchange.

Picture this: You walk into a cafe and try to pay $1 for internet access through a DePIN protocol. If that service ran on Ethereum, a congestion spike could tack on as much as $14 in gas fees, discouraging you from surfing the web at the cafe.

No one would build that product, and that's the point. Ethereum's base layer economics disqualify whole categories of microtransaction services before they even launch. Gas for smart contract calls has run well above $1 many times.

Projects that need predictable, minuscule fees look elsewhere. Solana fits the bill, and that's why its DePIN sector is alive and well. It's also why new capital is going to build DePIN projects there rather than on Ethereum. And that's bearish, even if there are many other segments that it could compete in successfully.

Always‑on artificial intelligence (AI) bots will soon buy coins, process data, sell services, and react in real time, firing off thousands of microtransactions daily. Even a penny per transaction could render them uneconomical.

Solana is courting that future directly. In May 2023 the Solana Foundation launched an open‑source ChatGPT plugin and expanded its AI grants pool to $10 million. Developers now get a toolkit that speaks AI natively, running atop a chain that can process 65,000 transactions per second.

Ethereum has nothing comparable baked into its Layer 1. Layer 2 rollups may eventually match Solana's throughput, but every extra hop from a Layer 1 to a Layer 2 adds latency, which is the very thing real‑time AI will need to eliminate to perform smoothly. If agents migrate to the cheapest, fastest venue, Solana's network effects could snowball while Ethereum's demand curve plateaus.

For long‑term Ethereum holders, this is a troubling situation.

Even if Solana never outright wins any of these segments, its capacity to siphon incremental growth can cap Ethereum's upside. And in a world where capital is impatient, "capped upside" is investment‑speak for a mounting need to start trimming the position. Ethereum is far from dead, but it will still need a handful of wins to be worth retaining in the long run.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

El Salvador has recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring an additional 8 Bitcoins, bringing the total to 6,228.18 BTC. This latest purchase values the country's Bitcoin reserves at approximately $674 million, reinforcing its commitment to blockchain technology and digital currencies. El Salvador made history in 2021 as the first nation to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, and its continued investment in the cryptocurrency reflects a strategic approach to financial liberalization and independence from the U.S. dollar.

The timing of El Salvador's Bitcoin purchase is noteworthy, as it coincides with a period of market resistance and consolidation, with prices stabilizing around $108,000 to $109,000. This suggests that the country is leveraging market stability to increase its holdings, a trend supported by recent data. By strategically acquiring Bitcoin during this phase, El Salvador aims to position itself as a global leader in blockchain adoption, potentially setting a precedent for other nations considering the integration of digital currencies into their economies.

However, the path to widespread Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador is fraught with challenges. Despite the government's efforts, only 20% of Salvadorans actively use the Chivo app, the government-sponsored digital wallet. Additionally, the Chivo wallet has faced security issues, including a hack that further eroded public trust in the system. These obstacles highlight the complexities of transitioning to a digital currency and the need for robust security measures and public education initiatives.

Despite local skepticism, El Salvador's Bitcoin initiative has garnered international interest. Other countries are closely observing how Bitcoin can be incorporated into national economies. If El Salvador's experiment proves successful, it could pave the way for broader adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal tender globally. The future of Bitcoin in El Salvador holds promise, with the potential for increased adoption rates as more Salvadorans become familiar with the technology. The country's Bitcoin reserves may also grow in response to market trends and global economic conditions, further solidifying its position as a pioneer in the digital currency landscape.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has surged by 83.77% over the past week, reaching a price of $0.01684. With a market cap exceeding $1.06 billion, this meme-NFT token is gaining significant attention. The current ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart suggests mounting buying pressure, with a potential breakout to $0.025. This pattern, marked by rising lows and flat highs, indicates that PENGU could reach $0.044 if it breaks past the key resistance near $0.018. On-chain trackers show rising institutional and mid-tier wallet accumulation, suggesting belief in further upside.

Arctic Pablo Coin is another meme coin making waves, with a potential 1,804.76% ROI in presale and staking rewards offering 66% APY. As it powers through its 30th location, Subzero Springs, investors are flocking to its frosty narrative, making it one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. The coin has raised over $2.89 million in presale funds, with early supporters potentially seeing a 2,700% return. Arctic Pablo offers a practical 66% APY staking mechanism for those looking to lock tokens for two months post-launch, providing passive income. Its immersive world-building and gamified narrative structure make it a unique investment opportunity.

Crypto analysts have pointed out that PENGU's pattern mirrors pre-breakout setups from tokens like PEPE, which delivered big gains. Rising volume at resistance, a crucial signal, confirms the pattern's validity. With RSI in neutral territory and moving averages tightening, the chart is building a case for a breakout. Technical models suggest first resistance near $0.018, then a more ambitious $0.025. If PENGU breaks that, the next pull is toward $0.044, giving bulls more than double gains from today's levels. Still, support around $0.012–$0.013 remains crucial. If that cracks, a pullback could follow.

Pudgy Penguins faces risks around liquidity, regulatory pressure on NFTs, and technical breakdowns below $0.012. A proposed PENGU-based NFT ETF may also signal overexposure. True, the pattern supports bullish momentum. But disruptions in DeFi, NFT stalling, or a marketwide dip could put pressure on PENGU's thesis. Based on the current ascending triangle pattern and visible resistance zones, analysts believe a breakout above the $0.018 level could push Pudgy Penguins toward $0.025—an potential upside of roughly 50%. If bullish momentum continues to build, the next key level sits around $0.044, which would mark a significant extension of the rally. However, the near-term downside risk remains. A failure to hold support around $0.012 could trigger a pullback before any major upside resumes. Still, with increasing on-chain activity and strengthening volume trends, many experts suggest that hitting the $0.025 target is plausible within the next few weeks.

Pudgy Penguins is earning its spot as one of the top meme coins to invest in now. The blend of a powerful technical setup, whale backing, and ecosystem strength makes a strong case. If the ascending triangle plays out, a 50% bump to $0.025 could be in sight. That said, serious investors should know that volatility could turn fast. For financial students, analysts, and blockchain builders, this makes PENGU a fascinating case study—not just because of its chart, but as a hybrid of NFT culture, token utility, and community fervor. Whether this icy expedition hits $0.025 or slides back, it's a narrative worth watching closely.

Arctic Pablo Coin stands colder and bolder with its current presale price at $0.00042 and a launch target of $0.008, early backers are already sitting on a 2,700% ROI potential. Pair that with 66% APY staking, deflationary tokenomics, and a gamified narrative that evolves across mythical locations—and you've got a presale that's more than hype. It's strategy, story, and serious upside. Get in before the next chapter opens—your crypto journey starts in Subzero Springs.

XRP showed signs of consolidation over the past 24 hours as the cryptocurrency pulled back slightly from recent highs, shedding 1.07% amid ongoing global economic uncertainty. Despite the dip, price action remains constructive with higher lows forming above $2.20 — a level that has emerged as key short-term support. While macro headwinds continue to pressure digital assets broadly, XRP's bullish structure and rising institutional narrative, including Ripple's U.S. bank license application and ETF speculation, are keeping long-term sentiment intact.

• XRP experienced a notable downtrend over the last 24 hours from 4 July 03:00 to 5 July 02:00, declining from $2.243 to $2.219, representing a 1.07% decrease with a trading range of $0.052 (2.32%).

• The asset encountered strong selling pressure during the 07:00 and 14:00 hours, with volume spikes exceeding 56 million units, establishing key support at $2.209 where buyers consistently emerged.

• A temporary recovery attempt occurred between 21:00-22:00 with price climbing to $2.230 on above-average volume, but momentum failed to sustain, suggesting continued bearish sentiment.

• In the last 60 minutes from 5 July 01:06 to 02:05, XRP experienced a notable decline of 0.35%, dropping from $2.225 to $2.217.

• A significant sell-off occurred at 01:12 where price fell to $2.221 on volume exceeding 418,000 units.

• The asset found temporary support at $2.216 around 01:29 before staging a recovery attempt at 01:59 with the highest volume spike of nearly 249,000 units, pushing price to $2.219.

 The Coinbase executive says he is “speculating on straws,” but if it is true, it would be “by far the largest heist in human history.” 

Conor Grogan, Coinbase's head of product, says there's a slight chance the $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin moved on Thursday — from eight wallets that had held the Bitcoin for over 14 years — was caused by a hack, and if so, it could be the largest robbery ever.

“If true (again, I'm speculating on straws here), this would be by far the largest heist in human history,” Grogan said in an X post on Friday, after raising the slim chance that the $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) moved from eight separate wallets was the work of bad actors.

“There is a small possibility that the $8B in BTC that recently woke up were hacked or compromised private keys,” Grogan said, pointing out a suspicious Bitcoin Cash (BCH) transaction made before the significant transfers on Thursday involving 10,000 Bitcoin at a time.

“I found a single BCH test transaction from one of the BTC whale clusters 14 hours ago, followed by the full amount. An hour later, the BTC wallets began to move,” he said.

Grogan said it is possible that the wallet owner may have been quietly testing the private key, since Bitcoin Cash transactions don't attract as much attention from whale tracking services. However, he reiterated he found the behavior unusual:

In a post on the same day, blockchain intelligence firm Arkham said it was a single entity that moved $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin from eight separate wallets. 

Arkham said that all the Bitcoin was transferred into the original wallets on either April 2 or May 4, 2011, and had remained on the wallets for more than 14 years.

Arkham said the Bitcoin is now stored in eight new wallets and hasn't been moved since.

Despite the uncertainty, Bitcoin's price has stayed relatively stable, dipping 1.02% in the last 24 hours and trading at $108,150 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

A closely followed crypto analyst is revealing bullish targets for Bitcoin (BTC) while updating his outlook on a handful of prominent altcoins.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 139,200 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap looks poised to push to the $118,000 price level – a new all-time high – if it can finish with a daily close above $109,000.

 “Despite the broader quarterly outlook shared in this video, the daily chart for Bitcoin. BTC looks promising. A daily close above $109,000 could open the door to a rally toward $118,000!”

BTC is trading for $109,644 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

Moving on to smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH), Martinez says he expects more choppiness until the top altcoin closes outside the $2,227-$3,385 range.

“Heard a company added an inflationary asset like ETH to its balance sheet, and suddenly everyone's bullish again. But let's be real: I expect more chop until we get a sustained close outside the $2,227-$3,385 range.”

ETH is valued at $2,579 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

Turning his attention toward the meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE), Martinez notes that the popular dog-themed token appears ready to ascend to $0.19, potentially up to $0.26, after bouncing off a low.

“Dogecoin bounced from the lower boundary of this channel. Now targeting $0.19, with potential upside to the upper boundary near $0.26.”

DOGE is trading for $0.17 at time of writing.

Concluding his analysis with ETH competitor Solana (SOL), the trader says the smart contract platform looks poised to benefit if the crypto markets break out.

SOL is trading for $151 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours.

The incredible relics hail from before the Revolutionary War.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When archaeologists poured the liquid out of two European-manufactured bottles found under a brick floor at George Washington's Mount Vernon mansion, they enjoyed the scent of cherry blossoms. The once-forgotten and now-found bottles were likely filled with cherries before the Revolutionary War in the mid-1770s and have sat sealed—and preserved—ever since. 

As part of a privately funded revitalization project at the Virginia mansion, a brick floor originally laid in the 1770s was torn up, revealing a small pit and the two side-by-side dark green glass bottles, both upright and sealed.

“Not only did we recover intact, sealed bottles, but they contained organic material that can provide us with valuable insight and perspective into 18th-century lives at Mount Vernon,” Jason Boroughs, Mount Vernon principal archaeologist, says in a statement. “These bottles have the potential to enrich the historic narrative, and we're excited to have the contents analyzed so we can share this discovery with fellow researchers and the visiting public.” 

Once the bottles were discovered, each was moved to the Mount Vernon archaeology lab. Experts determined removing the liquid content could help stabilize the glass that hadn't been directly exposed to the atmosphere for approximately two centuries. Full cherries, including stems and pits, were part of the liquid content, giving off the signature scent of the region, a “blockbuster find of two fully intact glass bottles containing liquid that have not been seen since before the war for American independence,” Doug Bradburn, Mount Vernon president and CEO, says in a statement. 

The glass bottles are from a European manufacturer and archaeologists say, based on shape and style, likely from the 1740s or 1750s, which fits the timeline of needing to be placed in the pit prior to the 1770s floor installation. That makes the cherries likely pre-Revolutionary War fruit.

While the Washingtons were known fans of cherries, the picking and storage of the two bottles likely never touched their hands as the site was known to have over 300 enslaved individuals at the time of George Washington's death. 

The archaeological team plans to ship the bottles off for conservation efforts and the contents will be sent to a laboratory for scientific analysis and testing. 

Boroughs tells the Washington Post that the bottles likely held only cherries when they were originally placed in their location and that amber-colored liquid could be groundwater that got in the bottles once the corks sealing the bottles started to fail as the decades wore on. Despite the liquid and a sort of goo being inside the bottles, early analyses support the only cherry theory, likely stored away to help preserve the fruit for later use in cooking or baking. 

“There are 18th century accounts that talk about proper ways of preserving fruits and vegetables,” Boroughs tells the newspaper. “One of the most common, especially for berries, is to dry them as much as possible … put them in a dry bottle, cork it … and then bury them.” 

That advice may still hold true today, as the cherries held their shape and scent 250 years later.

Hearing loss doesn't just affect how people hear the world -- it can also change how they connect with it.

A new study from the USC Caruso Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, part of Keck Medicine of USC, published today in JAMA Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery, is the first to link hearing aids and cochlear implants, surgically implanted devices that help those with profound hearing loss perceive sound, to improved social lives among adults with hearing loss.

"We found that adults with hearing loss who used hearing aids or cochlear implants were more socially engaged and felt less isolated compared to those who didn't use them," said Janet Choi, MD, MPH, an otolaryngologist with Keck Medicine and lead researcher of the study. "This suggests that hearing devices may help prevent the social disconnection and broader health consequences that can follow untreated hearing loss."

Hearing loss affects an estimated 40 million American adults, yet many go untreated. When left unaddressed, hearing loss can make communication difficult, leading people to withdraw from conversations and social activities, according to Choi.

Previous research has shown that over time, social withdrawal can reduce mental stimulation and increase the risk of loneliness, anxiety, depression, cognitive decline and dementia. It has also linked chronic social isolation to biological and neurological changes, including increased brain inflammation and alterations in brain structure.

"Understanding the link between hearing loss, hearing device use and social isolation is crucial," said Choi. "Until this study, it has been unclear whether hearing devices could help reverse the isolation."

Choi and her fellow researchers conducted a comprehensive, systematic review and meta-analysis of 65 previously published studies, encompassing over five thousand participants, on how hearing aids and cochlear implants affect three key measures: social quality of life, perceived social handicap, which refers to the limitations and frustrations hearing loss can create in social situations, and loneliness.

The researchers found that adults using hearing devices feel more socially connected and less limited in social situations. They are better able to engage in group conversations and feel more at ease in noisy or challenging listening environments. Participants also reported feeling less socially handicapped by their hearing loss, with fewer barriers and frustrations during interactions and an improved ability to stay engaged without feeling excluded. This increased confidence can help users connect more easily with family, friends and colleagues, leading to stronger feelings of belonging and reduced social anxiety. The study also suggested hearing devices may reduce loneliness, although further research is needed in this area, according to Choi.

Those with cochlear implants reported the most improvement in their social quality of life. This is likely because cochlear implants offer greater hearing restoration than hearing aids, especially for individuals with more severe hearing loss. As a result, they may experience more noticeable improvements in social engagement once their hearing is restored.

While it was outside the scope of the study to measure how better social lives relate to improved cognitive outcomes, Choi believes there may be a connection, as previous research has found managing hearing loss may be key to reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. "While our study didn't directly measure cognitive outcomes, the improvements we saw in communication and social engagement suggest that by restoring clearer communication, hearing devices may help preserve cognitive health by keeping the brain more actively involved and people more connected," Choi said.

This research follows a January 2024 study by Choi showing that adults with hearing loss who use hearing aids have an almost 25% lower risk of mortality, suggesting that treating hearing loss can improve lifespan as well as social quality of life.

"These new findings add to a growing body of research showing that hearing health is deeply connected to overall well-being," said Choi. "We hope this encourages more people to seek treatment and helps clinicians start conversations with patients about how hearing devices can improve their quality of life."

For years, scientists have debated whether a giant thick ice shelf once covered the entire Arctic Ocean during the coldest ice ages. Now a new study published in Science Advances, challenges this idea as the research team found no evidence for the presence of a massive ~1km ice shelf. Instead, the Arctic Ocean appears to have been covered by seasonal sea ice -- leaving open water and life-sustaining conditions even during the harshest periods of cold periods during the last 750,000 years. This discovery gives insights crucial for our understanding of how the Arctic has responded to climate change in the past -- and how it might behave in the future.

Tiny traces of life in ancient mud

Led by the European Research Council Synergy Grant project Into the Blue -- i2B, the research team studied sediment cores collected from the seafloor of the central Nordic Seas and Yermak Plateau, north of Svalbard. These cores hold tiny chemical fingerprints from algae that lived in the ocean long ago. Some of these algae only grow in open water, while others thrive under seasonal sea ice that forms and melts each year.

"Our sediment cores show that marine life was active even during the coldest times," said Jochen Knies, lead author of the study, based at UiT The Arctic University of Norway and co-lead of the Into The Blue -- i2B project. "That tells us there must have been light and open water at the surface. You wouldn't see that if the entire Arctic was locked under a kilometre-thick slab of ice."

One of the key indicators the team looked for was a molecule called IP25, which is produced by algae that live in seasonal sea ice. Its regular appearance in the sediments shows that sea ice came and went with the seasons, rather than staying frozen solid all year round.

Simulating ancient Arctic climates

To test the findings based on the geological records, the research team used the AWI Earth System Model -- a high-resolution computer model -- to simulate Arctic conditions during two especially cold periods: the Last Glacial Maximum around 21,000 years ago, and a deeper freeze about 140,000 years ago when large ice sheets covered a lot of the Arctic.

"The models support what we found in the sediments," said Knies. "Even during these extreme glaciations, warm Atlantic water still flowed into the Arctic gateway. This helped keep some parts of the ocean from freezing over completely."

The models also showed that the ice wasn't static. Instead, it shifted with the seasons, creating openings in the ice where light could reach the water -- and where life could continue to thrive. This research not only reshapes our view of past Arctic climates but also has implications for future climate predictions. Understanding how sea ice and ocean circulation responded to past climate extremes can improve models that project future changes in a warming world.

"These reconstructions help us understand what's possible -- and what's not -- when it comes to ice cover and ocean dynamics," said Gerrit Lohmann, co-author of this study, based at Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) and co-lead of Into The Blue -- i2B. "That matters when trying to anticipate how ice sheets and sea ice might behave in the future."

Re-thinking the giant ice shelf theory

Some scientists have argued that features on the Arctic seafloor suggest that a huge, grounded ice shelf once covered the entire ocean. But this new study offers another explanation.

"There may have been short-lived ice shelves in some parts of the Arctic during especially severe cold phases," said Knies. "But we don't see any sign of a single, massive ice shelf that covered everything for thousands of years."

One possible exception could have occurred about 650,000 years ago, when biological activity in the sediment record dropped sharply. But even then, the evidence points to a temporary event, not a long-lasting frozen lid over the Arctic.

Understanding the Arctic's future

The study sheds new light on how the Arctic has behaved under extreme conditions in the past. This matters because the Arctic is changing rapidly today. Knowing how sea ice and ocean circulation responded to past climate shifts helps scientists understand what might lie ahead.

"These past patterns help us understand what's possible in future scenarios," said Knies. "We need to know how the Arctic behaves under stress -- and what tipping points to watch for -- as the Arctic responds to a warming world."

The full paper, "Seasonal sea ice characterized the glacial Arctic-Atlantic gateway over the past 750,000 years," is available in Science Advances.

This research is part of the European Research Council Synergy Grant project Into the Blue -- i2B and the Research Council of Norway Centre of Excellence, iC3: Centre for ice, Cryosphere, Carbon, and Climate.

Imagine the magnificent glaciers of Greenland, the eternal snow of the Tibetan high mountains, and the permanently ice-cold groundwater in Finland. As cold and beautiful these are, for the structural biologist Kirill Kovalev, they are more importantly home to unusual molecules that could control brain cells' activity.

Kovalev, EIPOD Postdoctoral Fellow at EMBL Hamburg's Schneider Group and EMBL-EBI's Bateman Group, is a physicist passionate about solving biological problems. He is particularly hooked by rhodopsins, a group of colorful proteins that enable aquatic microorganisms to harness sunlight for energy.

"In my work, I search for unusual rhodopsins and try to understand what they do," said Kovalev. "Such molecules could have undiscovered functions that we could benefit from."

Some rhodopsins have already been modified to serve as light-operated switches for electrical activity in cells. This technique, called optogenetics, is used by neuroscientists to selectively control neuronal activity during experiments. Rhodopsins with other abilities, such as enzymatic activity, could be used to control chemical reactions with light, for example.

Having studied rhodopsins for years, Kovalev thought he knew them inside out - until he discovered a new, obscure group of rhodopsins that were unlike anything he had seen before.

As it often happens in science, it started serendipitously. While browsing online protein databases, Kovalev spotted an unusual feature common to microbial rhodopsins found exclusively in very cold environments, such as glaciers and high mountains. "That's weird," he thought. After all, rhodopsins are something you typically find in seas and lakes.

These cold-climate rhodopsins were almost identical to each other, even though they evolved thousands of kilometres apart. This couldn't be a coincidence. They must be essential for surviving in the cold, concluded Kovalev, and to acknowledge this, he named them 'cryorhodopsins'.

Rhodopsins out of the blue 

Kovalev wanted to know more: what these rhodopsins look like, how they work, and, in particular, what color they are.

Color is the key feature of each rhodopsin. Most are pink-orange - they reflect pink and orange light, and absorb green and blue light, which activates them. Scientists strive to create a palette of different colored rhodopsins, so they could control neuronal activity with more precision. Blue rhodopsins have been especially sought-after because they are activated by red light, which penetrates tissues more deeply and non-invasively.

To Kovalev's amazement, the cryorhodopsins he examined in the lab revealed an unexpected diversity of colors, and, most importantly, some were blue.

The color of each rhodopsin is determined by its molecular structure, which dictates the wavelengths of light it absorbs and reflects. Any changes in this structure can alter the color.

"I can actually tell what's going on with cryorhodopsin simply by looking at its color," laughed Kovalev.

Applying advanced structural biology techniques, he figured out that the secret to the blue color is the same rare structural feature that he originally spotted in the protein databases.

"Now that we understand what makes them blue, we can design synthetic blue rhodopsins tailored to different applications," said Kovalev.

Next, Kovalev's collaborators examined cryorhodopsins in cultured brain cells. When cells expressing cryorhodopsins were exposed to UV light, it induced electric currents inside them. Interestingly, if the researchers illuminated the cells right afterwards with green light, the cells became more excitable, whereas if they used UV/red light instead, it reduced the cells' excitability.

"New optogenetic tools to efficiently switch the cell's electric activity both 'on' and 'off' would be incredibly useful in research, biotechnology and medicine," said Tobias Moser, Group Leader at the University Medical Center Göttingen who participated in the study. "For example, in my group, we develop new optical cochlear implants for patients that can optogenetically restore hearing in patients. Developing the utility of such a multi-purpose rhodopsin for future applications is an important task for the next studies."

"Our cryorhodopsins aren't ready to be used as tools yet, but they're an excellent prototype. They have all the key features that, based on our findings, could be engineered to become more effective for optogenetics," said Kovalev.

Evolution's UV light protector

When exposed to sunlight even on a rainy winter day in Hamburg, cryorhodopsins can sense UV light, as shown using advanced spectroscopy by Kovalev's collaborators from Goethe University Frankfurt led by Josef Wachtveitl. Wachtveitl's team showed that cryorhodopsins are in fact the slowest among all rhodopsins in their response to light. This made the scientists suspect that those cryorhodopsins might act like photosensors letting the microbes 'see' UV light - a property unheard of among other cryorhodopsins.

"Can they really do that?" Kovalev kept asking himself. A typical sensor protein teams up with a messenger molecule that passes information from the cell membrane to the cell's inside.

Kovalev grew more convinced, when together with his collaborators from Alicante, Spain, and his EIPOD co-supervisor, Alex Bateman from EMBL-EBI, they noticed that the cryorhodopsin gene is always accompanied by a gene encoding a tiny protein of unknown function - likely inherited together, and possibly functionally linked.

Kovalev wondered if this might be the missing messenger. Using the AI tool AlphaFold, the team were able to show that five copies of the small protein would form a ring and interact with the cryorhodopsin. According to their predictions, the small protein sits poised against the cryorhodopsin inside the cell. They believe that when cryorhodopsin detects UV light, the small protein could depart to carry this information into the cell.

"It was fascinating to uncover a new mechanism via which the light-sensitive signal from cryorhodopsins could be passed on to other parts of the cell. It is always a thrill to learn what the functions are for uncharacterised proteins. In fact, we find these proteins also in organisms that do not contain cryorhodopsin, perhaps hinting at a much wider range of jobs for these proteins."

Why cryorhodopsins evolved their astonishing dual function - and why only in cold environments - remains a mystery.

"We suspect that cryorhodopsins evolved their unique features not because of the cold, but rather to let microbes sense UV light, which can be harmful to them," said Kovalev. "In cold environments, such as the top of a mountain, bacteria face intense UV radiation. Cryorhodopsins might help them sense it, so they could protect themselves. This hypothesis aligns well with our findings."

"Discovering extraordinary molecules like these wouldn't be possible without scientific expeditions to often remote locations, to study the adaptations of the organisms living there," added Kovalev. "We can learn so much from that!"

Unique approach to unique molecules

To reveal the fascinating biology of cryorhodopsins, Kovalev and his collaborators had to overcome several technical challenges.

One was that cryorhodopsins are nearly identical in structure, and even a slight change in the position of a single atom can result in different properties. Studying molecules at this level of detail requires going beyond standard experimental methods. Kovalev applied a 4D structural biology approach, combining X-ray crystallography at EMBL Hamburg beamline P14 and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in the group of Albert Guskov in Groningen, Netherlands, with protein activation by light.

"I actually chose to do my postdoc at EMBL Hamburg, because of the unique beamline setup that made my project possible," said Kovalev. "The whole P14 beamline team worked together to tailor the setup to my experiments - I'm very grateful for their help."

Another challenge was that cryorhodopsins are extremely sensitive to light. For this reason, Kovalev's collaborators had to learn to work with the samples in almost complete darkness.

C(sp3)-C(sp3) amination represents a promising approach for synthesizing various amines, facilitating applications from late-stage scaffold hopping to the degradation of polymers and biomass. However, it remains challenging due to the inertness of the C-C bond and difficulties in controlling regio- and chemo-selectivity. Herein, we report an electro-oxidative benzylic C(sp3)-C(sp3) amination reaction of aromatic hydrocarbons using nitriles, amides, and sulfonamides as nucleophiles. This process occurs under mild conditions with hydrogen evolution, eliminating the need for external oxidants or transition metal catalysts. Mechanism involves successive anodic oxidative cleavage of the benzylic C(sp3)-C(sp3) bond to generate two carbocation fragments, which are subsequently captured by nucleophiles to form two C-N bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest that HFIP is critical as additive in adjusting the oxidation potentials of alkylbenzene substrates and amine products, effectively preventing overoxidation of products.

Aliphatic C–H and C–C bonds are most fundamental chemical bonds that are widely present in organic compounds1,2. Direct functionalization of these inert aliphatic bonds represents a cornerstone in modern organicchemistry. In particular, the functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)–H bonds to construct new carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds has been extensively studied3. In contrast, the functionalization of ubiquitous benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds has been much less explored4, despite their prevalence and significant potential for enabling late-stage scaffold hopping and facilitating the degradation of persistent polymers and biomass (Fig. 1a). To date, several primary strategies have been developed for C(sp³)–C(sp³) bond cleavage. The first involves ring strain-releasing in a strained system via oxidative addition of low-valent transition metals into C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond5,6, or single-electron transfer (SET) processes to generate cationic or anionic radicals that drive C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond cleavage and enable difunctionalization7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. Another strategy relies on SET or hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)-mediated activation of redox-active groups, generating transient oxygen or nitrogen radicals that undergo rapid β-scission16,17,18,19,20,21. Nevertheless, employing such strategies to cleave and functionalize C(sp³)–C(sp³) bonds in acyclic, ubiquitous aromatic hydrocarbons, such as ethane derivatives, still remains a challenging and highly desirable goal due to inherent thermodynamic stability of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond and low polarization of such substrates. An early example by Alnibi's group demonstrated C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond cleavage of multi-aryl ethanes via arene radical cation intermediates to form C-O bond under photooxidation conditions22. Recently, Huang and Chen's group described the elegant photooxidative cleavage of acyclic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons to form new C–C bond23. More recently, Yu's group made significant breakthroughs in the electro-reductive carboxylation of acyclic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2, enabling reductive C–C bond cleavage through radical anion intervention24. These advancements have significantly expanded the toolbox for C–C and C-O bond formation. Despite this progress, the direct benzylic (sp3)–C(sp3) amination in aromatic hydrocarbons to form C–N bonds remains elusive for several challenges (Fig. 1b). Firstly, benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds are among the most abundant yet the most difficult to cleavage. Secondly, achieving high selectivity is complicated by the coexistence of similar surrounding C–H and C–C bonds. Finally, the risk of overoxidation presents a major challenge in C–C amination chemistry, particularly when the introduced nitrogen lacks sufficient deactivation (e.g., through tosyl protection). Addressing these challenges would open new avenues in C–N bond-forming methodologies and significantly expand the scope of amination chemistry.

Recently, electrochemical25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43 amination of benzylic C(sp3)–H have been established44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53, providing green approaches for C–N bond formation. For example, Xu's group developed a site-selective electrochemical amination reaction that efficiently converts benzylic C–H bonds into C–N linkages52. Lambert's group described a method for benzylic C–H bond amination via an electrophotocatalytic Ritter-type reaction53. In both cases, the electrochemical single-electron oxidation of the arene substrate to generate an arene radical cation was identified as the key initial step. Building on these previous reports, and given the prevalence and biological significance of amines, we hypothesized that an electro-oxidative method could be developed to induce the amination of widely available benzylic C–C bonds via arene radical cation induced C–C bond cleavage. Herein, we report an electro-oxidative amination of benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons via HFIP-mediated oxidation potential sorting (Fig. 1c). Notable features of this strategy include: (a) amination of both carbon fragments, dual C–N bond formation from a single C–C cleavage with 200% atom utilization, both resulting carbocationic fragments are efficiently captured via nucleophilic amination, maximizing molecular efficiency and avoiding wasteful byproducts; (b) oxidants free, with hydrogen evolution as the byproduct; (c) highly selective cleavage of benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds; (d) broad substrate scope, robustness, air tolerance, insensitivity to water, large-scale synthesis; and (e) highly valuable products were formed.

Initially, butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (S1) was selected as the model substrate, and various reaction conditions were tested under a constant voltage for the electro-oxidative amination of benzylic C–C bonds. After thorough optimization, the Ritter-type amination product 1 was obtained in 26% 1H NMR yield under constant voltage (2.4 V) in MeCN, using Et4NBF4 as the supporting electrolyte, carbon cloth as the anode, and a Pt plate as the cathode (Table 1, entry 1). Several electrolytes were tested (entries 2 and 3), with LiClO4 and Et4NOTs yielding only trace amounts of product. We attribute this observation to the critical role played by the electrolyte anion in stabilizing key ionic intermediates and modulating the overall reaction environment. Control experiments revealed that the cell voltage played a critical role, as higher voltages (2.6 V and 2.8 V) resulted in lower yields due to overoxidation of the amide product (entries 4 and 5). The presence of an acid was essential for the transformation, as the yield improved to 33% and 53% with HOTf and MsOH, respectively (entries 6 and 7). This enhancement is likely due to the stabilizing effect of the strong acid on the benzylic cation intermediates. Notably, the yield increased to 79% when HFIP was added as an additive (entry 8), possibly due to its ability to prevent product overoxidation. For comparison, the use of other alcohol additives, such as TFE and EtOH, led to a significant decrease in yield (see Table S2). When the reaction time was shortened to 11 h, the yield further increased to 83%, with a total charge consumption of approximately 260 C (entry 9, Eanode = 1.8 V vs SCE, 4.36 mA.cm−2 current density). A control reaction conducted in the absence of electricity produced no product (entry 10), confirming that the transformation proceeds via electrochemical oxidation rather than aerobic oxidation. Regarding the electrode materials, several commonly used combinations were evaluated (entries 11–13). Stainless steel (SS) and nickel (Ni) as cathodes gave inferior results, with lower conversions and diminished selectivity, likely due to inefficient electron transfer and/or competing surface reactions. Among carbon-based anodes, carbon cloth consistently outperformed carbon felt (GF020), affording higher yields under otherwise identical conditions. The relatively poor performance of carbon felt may stem from its higher surface resistance and less uniform current distribution, which can impair reaction efficiency. In addition, conducting the reaction under constant current (10 mA, 6.6 mA/cm² current density) condition resulted in lower yields (entry 14), potentially due to uncontrolled fluctuations in electrode potential that promote undesired oxidative side processes. Finally, we demonstrated that MeCN could function as a reagent (40 equiv.) rather than the reaction solvent, although this modification led to a slight decrease in yield (entry 15). See Table S1 and Table S2 for further details on condition optimization.

After establishing the optimized reaction conditions, we proceeded to investigate the scope and general applicability of the reaction, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Initially, symmetric butane-2,3-diyldibenzene substrates were tested. Both butane-2,3-diyldibenzene and 4,4'-dihalogenated butane-2,3-diyldibenzene gave rise to the corresponding benzylacetamides (1–4) in good yields. A range of butane-2,3-diyldibenzene derivatives with various electron-withdrawing substituents on the benzene rings were also found to be suitable, yielding the corresponding amination products in moderate yields (2–6, 12–17). Notably, the aldehyde functional group, despite its well-known sensitivity to oxidative conditions, was well tolerated under our electrochemical protocol (14), although a significant amount of starting material was recovered, likely due to its limited reactivity under the current conditions. When examining substrates designed to probe the competition between benzylic C–H and benzylic C–C bonds, we observed that the C–C amination products (7, 8, and 11) were preferentially formed, rather than the alternative benzylic methyl or ethyl-functionalized sites. However, the linear para-n-butyl substrate afforded product 10 in 29% yield, along with 9% competing C–H amination byproduct. Notably, no benzylic C–H amination products were observed at the same benzylic position in branched substrates where C–C bond amination occurred. This strongly supports our hypothesis that C–C cleavage is the kinetically and thermodynamically favored pathway at the benzylic position under the reaction conditions. The main reason for the moderate yields observed with electron-rich substrates is product overoxidation and decomposition. In addition, the competitive formation of ketone side products via C–C bond oxidation (for 9, 40% yield of ketone formed), promoted by trace amounts of water in the system, also contributes to the reduced efficiency (See Section 2.6 ‘Side product analysis' in the Supplementary Information.). We propose that for electron-rich substrates, the high reactivity facilitates rapid C–C bond cleavage, generating highly reactive radical or carbocation intermediates. While these intermediates can undergo competitive side reactions with trace amounts of water present in the system, resulting in the formation of ketone byproducts. For a substrate bearing more electron-donating methoxy groups S18 underwent selective amination to provide the corresponding products in 62% yields (18). The influence of alkyl chain length was also assessed, and all substrates proceeded smoothly under the standard conditions, producing the corresponding amination products in moderate to good yields (19 to 26). For asymmetric substrates with different substituents on the benzene ring or various alkyl groups, two distinct benzylic amination products were obtained (27–29, 31). Unfortunately, the thiophene-substituted amide (30) was not observed due to the degradation of the desired product, as well as substrates bearing a furan moiety (see Fig. S7), likely caused by the low oxidative potential of the thiophene and furan groups. Similarly, substrate 31 underwent smooth carbon-carbon bond cleavage to afford the ketone 32 in 27% yield instead of C–C amination product, suggesting that the electron-rich nature of thiophene may render the intermediate species more susceptible to overoxidation. Finally, the average Faradaic efficiency under the optimized conditions is approximately 30%, calculated based on the total charge passed and the amount of product formed (see Fig. S9).

Unsuccessful examples are provided in the Supplementary Information. The total consumed charge and Faradaic efficiency for representative substrates were included in the Supplementary information.

In addition to dibenzyl-substituted substrates, inert, unactivated substrates with bulky alkyl groups can also successfully yield two target products (Fig. 3). Such bulky groups can decrease the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the C–C bond by stabilizing the formed fragments, thus exerting a thermodynamic and steric effect54,55,56. We examined a series of homobenzylic and neopentylic substrates featuring inert, unactivated aliphatic C(sp³)–C(sp³) bonds. For instance, α-methyl neopentylbenzene (compound 33) underwent efficient cleavage and amination, affording two products in moderate yields. Furthermore, various α-branched neopentylbenzenes (compounds 35–38) bearing chains of differing lengths were well tolerated, consistently affording cleaved and aminated products in moderate to good yields. Importantly, increasing steric bulk (e.g., products 1, 41) did not impede the reaction, suggesting that steric hindrance does not critically limit the method's applicability. Notably, the cleavage selectively occurred at the more hindered tertiary center (tert-butyl), while another benzylic C–C bond remained intact, highlighting the excellent regioselectivity of the transformation. In terms of functional group compatibility, our method tolerated a range of oxidatively sensitive groups, including primary alcohols (43), methyl ethers (45), alkyl chlorides (47), and bromides (49). These examples further support the mildness and chemoselectivity of the electrochemical conditions. Mildly electron-deficient alkylbenzenes underwent successful oxidation. Notably, neopentylbenzene bearing a para-tert-butyl substituent afforded the aminated product 34 in 61% yield. In contrast, product 9 was obtained in only a 22% yield, likely due to competing oxidative side reactions leading to ketone formation.

The total consumed charge and Faradaic efficiency for representative substrates were included in the Supplementary Information. HFIP 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, TFA trifluoroacetic acid, Me methyl, Et ethyl, Ac acetyl, tBu tert-butyl, nBu n-butyl, nPr n-propyl, nHex n-hexyl.

Using this strategy, we successfully synthesized cycloheptylacetamide 52 and cyclooctylacetamide 54 (Fig. 3). Due to the stability of the dibenzyl radical, the cleavage of such substrates demonstrates excellent regioselectivity. However, it is important to note that the low yield is attributed to the formation of benzophenone ( ~ 20% yield), likely due to trace amounts of water present during the reaction. For unbranched substrate 55, the benzylic C–H amination was the predominant pathway and only 8% C–C cleavage product was detected. Beyond simple hydrocarbons, substrates containing heteroatom substitutions were also tested under standard conditions. For instance, epoxy-containing substrate 58 underwent C–C bond cleavage to generate amide 1 and C–O bond cleaved product 59. It is well known that oxygen and nitrogen atom can initiate β–C–C bond cleavage (61–63) by through-bond delocalization and electron apportionment to the fragments (via cation and radical-stabilizing effects)16,17,18,19,20,21. Under standard reaction conditions, these substrates underwent β–C–C bond cleavage to form the corresponding amides, although the yield was lower for the unbranched substrate 64. We hypothesize that the cleavage of these substrates involves two contributions: (1) the formation of nitrogen or oxygen radicals via electrochemical oxidation, leading to β–C–C bond cleavage; and (2) β–C–C cleavage initiated by aryl cation radicals. For comparison, when using 1,2-diphenylethane 55 as a substrate, only an 8% yield was obtained, suggesting that the formation of oxygen radicals may be involved for the cleavage of primary (1°) alcohol substrates. Lastly, strained ring substrate 64 smoothly underwent ring-opening 1, 3-difunctionalization to yield β-amino ketones 65.

Additionally, further investigation of various nitriles revealed a wide compatibility with Cl (66, 68), Br (67), Pr (69), and Ph (70) (Fig. 4). Other suitable nitrogen nucleophiles included methanesulfonamide (71), ethanesulfonamide (72), oxazolidin-2-one (73), and carbamate (74). Of particular interest is the functionalization of the benzylic C–C bond with oxygen nucleophiles, including acetates (75–80). Notably, a strong electron-withdrawing group, nitro, proved compatible, affording products 78 in 34% yields.

aReaction conditions: For 66–70 and 75–80: S1 (0.3 mmol), Et4NBF4 (0.2 M), corresponding nitrile solvent (3 mL) or acid solvent (3 mL), HFIP (1.0 mL), MeSO3H (0.1 mL), graphite felt (2 mm) anode, Pt cathode at rt, in an undivided cell with constant voltage (2.4 V), under air atmosphere. Isolated yield. bReactions performed with 3.6 mmol nucleophile (71: MsNH2, 72: EtSO2NH2, 73: 2-oxazolidone, 74: urethane) in 3 mL DCM. c0.8 mL TFA was used. dGraphite felt (6.5 mm) was used as anode. e0.1 mmol of substrate. HFIP 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, TFA trifluoroacetic acid, DCM dichloromethane, Ac acetyl, Ms methanesulfonyl, nPr n-propyl.

The electrochemical C–C amination reaction was successfully carried out on a gram scale, as illustrated by the synthesis of 1 (Fig. 5), where larger electrodes were used over an extended reaction time. Note that DCM was added as a co-solvent to improve the solubility of the starting material thereby ensuring a homogeneous reaction mixture and maintaining efficient mass and electron transfer throughout the electrolysis process.

HFIP 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, DCM dichloromethane, Me methyl, Ac acetyl.

Several mechanistic experiments were carried out to gain insight into the mechanism. Firstly, control experiments were performed to investigate the influence of water and oxygen in the air on the reaction. Under a strictly nitrogen atmosphere, the reaction yield remained stable at around 80%, while no significant promotional effect was observed under oxygen conditions, suggesting that the reaction likely does not involve dioxygen-induced C–C bond cleavage. Furthermore, the impact of varying the amount of water additive was carefully examined, with equivalents ranging from 0.5 to 2.0. The results showed little effect on the yield, indicating that the presence of water does not significantly promote the formation of the target product (Fig. 6a). Additionally, no benzylic alcohol intermediate was detected during the reaction. Besides, when the synthesized benzylic alcohol substrate 81 was subjected to the standard conditions, no product was formed. On the contrary, the substrate almost completely degraded under these conditions (Fig. 6b). These experiments suggest that benzylic tertiary (3°) alcohol is likely not a key intermediate in the reaction, despite numerous reports on C–C bond cleavage initiated by benzylic alcohol-derived oxygen radicals16,17,18,19,20,21.

Furthermore, the electrode voltage was continuously recorded throughout the electrolysis of the model reaction. Anodic oxidation was maintained at approximately 2.16 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 6c). These results are consistent with the oxidative potential of substrates. Furthermore, cyclic voltammograms of butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (S1) and it's aminated product (1) were recorded in MeCN (Fig. 6d). The results revealed that butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (Ep/2 = 2.30 V vs SCE) was oxidized at higher potential than product 1 (Ep/2 = 2.15 V vs SCE), indicating that the aminated product exhibits a greater tendency for over-oxidation in MeCN. In contrast, cyclic voltammograms of S1 and 1 in a MeCN/HFIP (3/1) solvent mixture showed that butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (Ep/2 = 1.97 V vs SCE) was oxidized at a bit lower potential than product 1 (Ep/2 = 2.00 V vs SCE) (Fig. 6d). Although the oxidation potentials of butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (S1) and product (1) differ only slightly, they were effectively distinguished during the preparative electrolysis performed in MeCN/HFIP. The significance of HFIP lies in its ability to stabilize radical cation intermediates, facilitating substrate oxidation while preventing overoxidation of the product52.

Based on these experiments, a plausible mechanism was proposed (Fig. 6e). During the anode phase, single-electron oxidation of the aromatic hydrocarbons A generates the radical cation B, which undergoes homolytic β–C–C bond cleavage to form a benzylic cation C and a radical species E at another position or heterolytic mode of cleavage to generate benzylic radical C′ and species E′, depending on the relative oxidation potentials of the two fragments formed23,57,58. For example, heterolytic cleavage to generate tBu cation is preferred due to the lower oxidation potential of tBu radical (Eox 1/2(tBu·) = 0.41 V vs SCE, Eox 1/2(MeCH2·Ph) = 0.82 V vs SCE, ΔΔG = −23.06 × (0.82–0.41) = −9.5 kcal/mol)59. The process may be reversible, and due to the small intrinsic barrier (0.1–0.2 eV), fragment diffusion from the solvent cage could be the rate-limiting step in endergonic cleavages60,61. The lower intrinsic barrier for C–C bond cleavage compared to deprotonation may account for the observation that C–C bond cleavage effectively competes with C–H bond cleavage. It is worth noting that the oxidation potentials of the generated benzyl and alkyl radical intermediates are typically below 1.0 V vs SCE57. As a result, under the present electrooxidation conditions (Eanode = 2.1 V vs Ag/AgCl), their lifetimes are extremely short, making them difficult to capture and prone to direct oxidation at the anode. Regardless of β–C–C bond cleavage model, above radical intermediates C′ and E undergoes a second, rapid oxidation event directly at the anode, resulting in the formation of final carbocations C and E′. Both carbocations subsequently proceed through the classic Ritter reaction steps to yield the amide product D and F. When nucleophiles such as sulfonamides, amides, or carboxylic acids were employed, the corresponding cross-coupling products were formed. Meanwhile, the redox reaction is balanced by cathodic proton reduction, leading to the production of hydrogen. Notably, due to the extensive use of bulky alkyl substituents and biaryl substrates in this work, in most cases, benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) cleavage competes effectively with C–H bond cleavage. Thus, the formation of benzyl tertiary (3°) alcohols or benzyl hydroperoxide species is unfavorable under these conditions.

In summary, we have developed an electro-oxidative benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) amination reaction that operates under mild conditions with H2 evolution, eliminating the need for external oxidants or transition metal catalysts. This method is not only suitable for the efficient and scalable synthesis of benzylic amines but also demonstrates excellent compatibility with various nucleophiles, demonstrating significant potential for advancing sustainable C–C functionalization reactions using simple materials.

An oven-dried, undivided three-necked cell (20 mL) equipped with a magnetic stir bar, carbon cloth anode (15 mm × 15 mm × 0.3 mm) and Pt plate cathode (15 mm × 15 mm × 0.3 mm). To the cell was added Et4NBF4 (95.9 mg, 0.41 mmol, 0.1 M), MeCN (3 mL), HFIP (1 mL) and butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (63.0 mg, 0.3 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 1 min, and then MsOH (0.1 mL) was carefully added. The solution was then stirred at room temperature and electrolysis was initiated at a control voltage of 2.4 V for the specified amount of time. After completion of the reaction as monitored by TLC (usually 8–18 h), the reaction mixture was poured into a saturated sodium carbonate solution (ca. 20 mL). The carbon cloth anode was washed with EtOAc (3 × 10 mL) and these washes were added to the reaction mixture. The aqueous layer was separated and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 15 mL), and the combined organic layers were washed with brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Following concentration in vacuo, the crude product was purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography (PTLC) (eluent: petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 2:1 to 1:1) to afford pure product.

The solution was then stirred at room temperature under and electrolysis was initiated at a control voltage of 2.4 V for the specified amount of time. After completion of the reaction as monitored by TLC (usually 8–20 h), the reaction mixture was poured into a saturated sodium carbonate solution (ca. 20 mL). The carbon cloth anode was washed with EtOAc (3 × 10 mL), and these washes were added to the reaction mixture. The aqueous layer was separated and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 15 mL), and the combined organic layers were washed with brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Following concentration in vacuo, the crude product was purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography (PTLC) (eluent: petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 5:1 to 1:1) to afford pure product.

Key takeaways

In physics, there are two great pillars of thought that don't quite fit together. The Standard Model of particle physics describes all known fundamental particles and three forces: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. Meanwhile, Einstein's general relativity describes gravity and the fabric of spacetime.

However, these frameworks are fundamentally incompatible in many ways, says Jonathan Heckman, a theoretical physicist at the University of Pennsylvania. The Standard Model treats forces as dynamic fields of particles, while general relativity treats gravity as the smooth geometry of spacetime, so gravity "doesn't fit into physics' Standard Model," he explains.

In a recent paper, Heckman; Rebecca Hicks, a Ph.D. student at Penn's School of Arts & Sciences; and their collaborators turn that critique on its head. Instead of asking what string theory predicts, the authors ask what it definitively cannot create. Their answer points to a single exotic particle that could show up at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). If that particle appears, the entire string-theory edifice would be, in Heckman's words, "in enormous trouble."

 String theory: the good, the bad, the energy-hungry 

For decades, physicists have sought a unified theory that can reconcile quantum mechanics,and, by extension, the behavior of subatomic particles, with gravity -- which is described as a dynamic force in general relativity but is not fully understood within quantum contexts, Heckman says. A good contender for marrying gravity and quantum phenomena is string theory, which posits that all particles, including a hypothetical one representing gravity, are tiny vibrating strings and which promises a single framework encompassing all forces and matter. "But one of the drawbacks of string theory is that it operates in high-dimensional math and a vast 'landscape' of possible universes, making it fiendishly difficult to test experimentally," Heckman says, pointing to how string theory necessitates more than the familiar four dimensions -- x, y, z, and time -- to be mathematically consistent.

"Most versions of string theory require a total of 10 or 11 spacetime dimensions, with the extra dimensions being sort of 'curled up' or folding in on one another to extremely small scales," Hicks says.

To make matters even trickier, string theory's distinctive behaviors only clearly reveal themselves at enormous energies, "those far beyond what we typically encounter or even generate in current colliders," Heckman says.

Hicks likens it to zooming in on a distant object: at everyday, lower energies, strings look like regular point-like particles, just as a faraway rope might appear to be a single line. "But when you crank the energy way up, you start seeing the interactions as they truly are -- strings vibrating and colliding," she explains. "At lower energies, the details get lost, and we just see the familiar particles again. It's like how from far away, you can't make out the individual fibers in the rope. You just see a single, smooth line."

That's why physicists hunting for signatures of string theory must push their colliders -- like the LHC -- to ever-higher energies, hoping to catch glimpses of fundamental strings rather than just their lower-energy disguises as ordinary particles.

 Why serve string theory a particle it likely won't be able to return? 

Testing a theory often means searching for predictions that confirm its validity. But a more powerful test, Heckman says, is finding exactly where a theory fails. If scientists discover that something a theory forbids actually exists, the theory is fundamentally incomplete or flawed. Because string theory's predictions are vast and varied, the researchers instead asked if there's a simple particle scenario that string theory just can't accommodate.

They zeroed in on how string theory deals with particle "families," groups of related particles bound together by the rules of the weak nuclear force, responsible for radioactive decay. Typically, particle families are small packages, like the electron and its neutrino sibling, that form a tidy two-member package called a doublet. String theory handles these modest particle families fairly well, without issue.

However, Heckman and Hicks identified a family that is conspicuously absent from any known string-based calculation: a five-member particle package, or a 5-plet. Heckman likens this to trying to order a Whopper meal from McDonald's, "no matter how creatively you search the menu, it never materializes."

"We scoured every toolbox we have, and this five-member package just never shows up," Heckman says. But what exactly is this elusive 5-plet?

Hicks explains it as an expanded version of the doublet, "the 5-plet is its supersized cousin, packing five related particles together." Physicists encapsulate this particle family in a concise mathematical formula known as the Lagrangian, essentially the particle-physics cookbook. The particle itself is called a Majorana fermion, meaning it acts as its own antiparticle, akin to a coin that has heads on both sides. Identifying such a particle would directly contradict what current string theory models predict is possible, making the detection of this specific particle family at the LHC a high-stakes test, one that could potentially snap string theory.

 Why a 5-plet hasn't been spotted and the vanishing-Track clue 

Hicks cites two major hurdles for spotting these 5-plet structures: "production and subtlety." In a collider, energy can literally turn into mass; Einstein's E = mc² says that enough kinetic oomph (E) can be converted into the heft (m) of brand-new particles, so the heavier the quarry the rarer the creation event.

"The LHC has to slam protons together hard enough to conjure these hefty particles out of pure energy," Hicks explains, citing Einstein's E = mc², which directly links energy (E) to mass (m). "As the masses of these particles climb toward a trillion electron volts, the chance of creating them drops dramatically."

Even if produced, detection is challenging. The charged particles in the 5-plet decay very quickly into nearly invisible products. "The heavier states decay into a soft pion and an invisible neutral particle, zero (X0)," Hicks says. "The pion is so low-energy it's basically invisible, and X0 passes straight through. The result is a track that vanishes mid-detector, like footprints in snow suddenly stopping."

Those signature tracks get picked up by LHC's ATLAS (short for A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) and CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid), house-sized "digital cameras" wrapped around the collision center. They sit at opposite collision points and operate independently, giving the physics community two sets of eyes on every big discovery. Penn physicists like Hicks are part of the ATLAS Collaboration, helping perform the searches that look for quirky signals like disappearing tracks.

Why a 5-plet matters for dark matter 

Hicks says finding the 5-plet isn't only important for testing string theory, pointing to another exciting possibility: "The neutral member of the 5-plet could explain dark matter, the mysterious mass shaping up most of our universe's matter."

Dark matter constitutes roughly 85 percent of all matter in the universe, yet scientists still don't know what exactly it is. "If the 5-plet weighs around 10 TeV -- about 10,000 proton masses -- it neatly fits theories about dark matter's formation after the Big Bang," Hicks says. "Even lighter 5-plets could still play a role as part of a broader dark matter landscape."

"If we detect a 5-plet, it's a double win," says Hicks. "We'd have disproven key predictions of string theory and simultaneously uncovered new clues about dark matter."

 What the LHC has already ruled out 

Using existing ATLAS data from collider runs, the team searched specifically for 5-plet signals."We reinterpreted searches originally designed for 'charginos' -- hypothetical charged particles predicted by supersymmetry -- and looked for 5-plet signatures," Hicks says of the team's search through the repurposed ATLAS disappearing-track data. "We found no evidence yet, which means any 5-plet particle must weigh at least 650-700 GeV, five times heavier than the Higgs boson."

For context, Heckman says, "this early result is already a strong statement; it means lighter 5-plets don't exist. But heavier ones are still very much on the table."

Future searches with upgraded LHC experiments promise even sharper tests. "We're not rooting for string theory to fail," Hicks says. "We're stress-testing it, applying more pressure to see if it holds up."

"If string theory survives, fantastic," Heckman says. "If it snaps, we'll learn something profound about nature."

Removing the human crew reduces the risk for drug cartels.

The Colombian Navy announced earlier this week that it had seized a makeshift semi-submersible off the Caribbean coast. Drug cartels have already been using this technique for several years now to smuggle drugs into the United States and other countries, but this is the first time that a vessel has been discovered that was plying the illicit route with no one inside. According to France 24, authorities stated that it was equipped with a Starlink User Terminal, enabling the boat to remain connected to the internet even in high seas and be controlled remotely. Nevertheless, the narco-sub was empty during the interdiction, meaning it was likely a test run for future smuggling operations.

This isn't the first time that authorities have caught a remotely operated low-profile vessel. The first recorded incident happened in November 2024, when Indian police seized a makeshift drone vessel using Starlink near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands — more than 700 miles from the Indian subcontinent. Drug cartels are becoming more sophisticated when it comes to shipping contraband. These boats were initially designed for routes between North and South America, but they've recently been spotted sailing across the Atlantic and the Pacific.

Equipping Starlink to these vessels is the logical next step for these operations. After all, these drug-running missions are inherently hazardous, with reports of boats getting intercepted with dead crews onboard. Furthermore, the human factor introduces additional risk because individuals can be bribed and, if apprehended, may even turn against the organization as witnesses. On the other hand, international high-speed wireless internet allows these boats to be remotely operated, so even if the authorities intercept them, there would be no person onboard to interrogate.

Starlink plans that allow for oceanic and global land use can get expensive, with prices ranging from $250 (50GB) to $2,150 (2TB) per month. However, you really don't need that much data to control a boat, and the value of the carried cargo — ranging between millions and billions of dollars — makes the cost of setting up satellite internet communications negligible.

This new way of using Starlink will make it harder for governments to catch drug runners sailing the seas, mainly as a single crew can remotely operate multiple drone boats. But even though the removal of onboard crews on these narco-subs reduces the human factor risk, each Starlink dish is still tied to a specific account. So, if intelligence agencies can determine the entities that sign up for these accounts, and if SpaceX cooperates, they can track these user terminals on these narco-subs and then capture them as the land-side of the operation is unloading its drug cargo.

No smoke without fire, or an unsubstantiated rumor?

TSMC has responded to a report that it is delaying its Japan fab in favor of faster buildouts in the United States. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter, TSMC is slowing its spending on chipmaking facilities in Japan to accelerate the buildout of its Fab 21 site in Arizona, in anticipation of potential tariffs imposed on chips made in Taiwan by the U.S. government. In a statement sent to Tom's Hardware, TSMC indicated that its major investments in its Arizona site will not impact plans for its Germany and Japan chipmaking plants. 

"TSMC does not comment on market rumor," a TSMC spokesperson told Tom's Hardware. "TSMC's global manufacturing expansion strategy is based on customers' needs, business opportunities, operating efficiency, the level of government support and cost economic considerations. Our investment plans in the U.S. will not impact our existing investment plans in other regions."

The first rumors about TSMC slowing down spending on its Fab 23 phase 2 (JASM phase 2) near Kumamoto, Japan, and Fab 24 phase 1 (ESMC phase 1) near Dresden, Germany, to prioritize spending on its Fab 21 site in Arizona as well as speed up Fab 21 phase 2 equipment, emerged several weeks ago. 

Earlier this week, we heard that TSMC was bringing its N3-capable Fab 21 Phase 2 online in 2027 (several quarters ahead of schedule), while slowing down its projects in Germany and Japan. 

While plans tend to change, these changes are not always interconnected, especially given the different stages of these projects, as well as TSMC's vast capital expenditure (CapEx) budget of $32 billion to $42 billion and its massive capacity buildout plans. 

Let's take a look at TSMC's most recent updates on its projects in the U.S., Germany, and Japan, starting with the U.S.

TSMC had already confirmed earlier this year that it was speeding up the start of high-volume production at Fab 21 Phase 2 due to demand from its clients. The plan is to pull in the HVM start date from the original schedule in 2028 by several quarters, which could mean 2027.

TSMC has reached the 'topping milestone', currently outfitting the fab with various mechanical, electrical, plumbing, air filtration, air conditioning, and other systems. The next major stage for this project will be the installation of actual semiconductor production equipment. Equipment procurement and installation is the most capital-intensive (expensive) stage of every fab project.

"The construction of our second fab, which will utilize the 3nm process technologies, is already complete, and we are working on speeding up the volume production schedule, based on the strong AI-related demand from our customers," said C.C. Wei, chief executive and chairman of TSMC, in the company's Q1 2025 conference call. 

The company also intended to start constructing shells for Fab 21 phase 3 and phase 4 later in 2025, with the aim of starting production there later this decade. 

"Our third and fourth fab will utilize N2 and A16 process technologies, and with the expectation of receiving all the necessary permits, is scheduled to begin construction later this year," said Wei. 

In fact, Bloomberg reported in late April that the company indeed began to build its 'third fab in Arizona,' though it is unclear whether it began to prep land, or actually broke ground (e.g., poured in the foundation), though considering that TSMC did not have all the necessary permits as of April 17, it looks like it only started prepping the land for the facility.

TSMC's first fab in Japan — Fab 23 phase 1 — started mass production of chips in late December 2024. The company intended to start construction of its Fab 23 phase 2 earlier this year, but the schedule slipped due to a lack of proper local infrastructure. 

"The construction of our second specialty fab is scheduled to start later this year, subject to the readiness of the local infrastructure," Wei said at the conference call with analysts and investors. 

The WSJ report cites local traffic as a reason for the setback. A representative from the Japanese government stated that officials had not received direct communication from TSMC, citing local traffic as the reason for the delay. The spokesperson also expressed skepticism that such conditions were the reason. Nevertheless, the government believes that the fab's production timeline and output goals will remain generally unchanged. 

Land preparation and shell construction are the least capital-intensive stages of building semiconductor production facilities, meaning this phase is comparatively low-cost. Therefore, it does not make sense to slow down any of this in a bid to speed up another project, unless a company lacks funds, which is not the case with TSMC.

The same applies to TSMC's project in Germany — a joint project with Bosch, Infineon, and NXP, called Fab 24, which is set to come online in late 2027. The company officially started to prepare land for the fab in August 2024. So far, the company has not officially begun building the shell, but constructing a fab building is less expensive than equipping it, so it is unlikely that TSMC would delay the construction start of Fab 24 due to its vast investment project in America. 

"We are on track with our plan to build a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany," Wei said during the call. "[…] So again, I would emphasize, no, we are not going to slow down our plan in Japan or in Germany."

TSMC itself declined to comment on rumors about changes to its buildout plans, the company stressed that its fabs come online based on customers' needs and that its expanded investment in the U.S.-based site would not impact its intentions in other countries. 

"TSMC does not comment on market rumor," a TSMC spokesperson told Tom's Hardware. "TSMC's global manufacturing expansion strategy is based on customers' needs, business opportunities, operating efficiency, the level of government support and cost economic considerations. Our investment plans in the U.S. will not impact our existing investment plans in other regions."

Do not resell to China?

The U.S. government is preparing a new set of export rules that would tighten control over the exports of advanced Nvidia AI GPUs to Malaysia and Thailand, in a bid to prevent the re-export of these components to China amid existing bans, according to Bloomberg.

A preliminary version of the new export rule, reported by Bloomberg, states that the U.S. Commerce Department would require companies to obtain a U.S. government export license before sending AI GPUs to the two Southeast Asian nations. The plan has not been finalized and may change, yet it may represent another step towards limiting Chinese entities' access to high-performance Nvidia AI GPUs.

Malaysia and Thailand are not major suspected hubs for the smuggling of Nvidia's GPUs, unlike Singapore, which is officially listed as one of Nvidia's primary sources of revenue, raising questions about whether the products sold to Singapore-based entities eventually end up in China. Indeed, Nvidia denies that its AI GPUs formally sold to Singapore-based entities could end up in China, arguing that they are sold to entities officially based in Singapore, but they are destined elsewhere. Nonetheless, it is widely believed that Singapore is a hub for smuggling high-end Nvidia GPUs to China and other sanctioned countries.

Yet, Malaysia seems like a different thing. The country is not listed as one of Nvidia's primary sources of revenue, so we do not know how much the company earns selling products to the country. However, Malaysia has emerged as a significant destination for computing equipment and components — including CPUs and GPUs essential for AI applications — sourced from Taiwan in recent quarters. Moreover, Malaysia is reportedly used to avoid U.S. import tariffs for China-made goods, which might be a concern for the U.S. Commerce Department.

Thailand is among the countries suspected of being a hub for smuggling Nvidia's AI GPUs to China. However, without formal data, we can only wonder whether the suspicion has merit.

Aren't pets such a drag? I mean, really. They're all furry, and cute, and innocent. And you have to feed them and love them, and respect their autonomy and basic needs. For what? Borderline unconditional love? Who's got time for all that? Certainly not me. My job is computer, and I need efficiency—a practical companion that's alive when I want it to be and shutting the f**k up when I need to have the TPS report filed by EOD so corporate can circle back on the EOY roadmap. You got all that? Me neither; I'll just have AI summarize it for me. Alright, sorry, I'm done joking now. It's time to get serious—or should I say… Sirius.

Sirius is a $1,200 robot dog made by a company you've never heard of called Hengbot. It's part of a long lineage of robot dogs punctuated by the likes of tech titans like Sony, Xiaomi, Fisher-Price, and, uh, Ideal Toy Company's impeccably named mechanical dog from 1960, Gaylord the Pup (you can't make this shit up, folks). But this isn't just another Gaylord. It's a robot dog with—say it with me now—AI. Using large language models (LLMs) like the ones that power ChatGPT, Sirius comes equipped with the ability to understand voice commands. What can you ask Sirius? Some stuff.

Hengbot Sirius Robot Dog

Pros

Cons

In a demo with Sirius, I saw the dog take voice commands like “sit,” “shake,” and “pee,” though I wouldn't want to train your real dog to do that last one. They're activated pretty much how you'd think they would be. Just blurt out, “Hey, Sirius,” and then talk away. The dog has to be connected to Wi-Fi to do all of this stuff, FYI—there's no onboard processing, but this ain't an iPhone after all. Speaking of iPhones, be careful when yelling “Hey, Sirius” because “Sirius” sounds an awful lot like another voice assistant, who's had a bit of trouble with AI lately. I don't know what happens when you ask your iPhone to pee, but frankly, I'd rather not find out.

I wasn't able to test the voice commands with my review unit of Sirius because I had trouble connecting it to Wi-Fi, but I did get to see them in a live demo, and Sirius's voice assistant looks about as good as Apple's, which is to say… pretty mid. It recognized some commands right away, and others not so much. However mid Sirius is at processing and understanding voice commands, it's much worse at (sigh) walking. This thing falls kind of a lot, and unlike a dog made of flesh and blood, it cannot figure out how to get up after taking said spill. Lots of my time testing Sirius was spent extricating it from the insufferable foibles of its own clumsiness. I have my own foibles to suffer, thank you very much. I don't need a robot dog to add to the pile.

(Note: you may not have the same Wi-Fi headache as the one I encountered. My unit was a demo version and didn't have the same OTA update as the ones shipping after. We'll be updating this post if and when I can get Sirus online.)

Using a game controller provided with my review unit, I tried parading Sirius around the Gizmodo office for shits and giggles but found that (especially when it's in autonomous mode) it would often get tripped up when I sent in an input to walk forward or move side-to-side and then flop to the ground harder than Cristiano Ronaldo when his team is down 2-1. Say what you will about dogs, but they're pretty good at locomotion most of the time. When Sirius isn't falling over, you can use a game controller to do some fun stuff manually, like directing it to jump in four directions (left, right, forward, or back) and also activate some silly commands like making it sit and meow like a cat. Cute!

I think if I'm going to give Sirius any credit, it's that the actuators used to move the dog around are pretty cool and can actually simulate the movements of a real dog fairly well. I suppose, depending on your feelings toward robots, that could also be a point against it, too. There's something vaguely uncanny valley about Sirius, and the weird, single robot eye on the dog's face probably doesn't help.

Despite the fact that Sirius, with its onboard camera, can actually track your face, it cannot follow you around like other robot dogs like Xiaomi's Cyberdog. That's a bummer. I think going for a walk is probably high on the list of things people would want to do with their new $1,200 pet, or toy, or AI companion, or… wait a second, what is this thing, actually? If you're reading these words (and I'm sorry if you are), please send me your coordinates so I can tell the police to save you from the evil villain Clockwork Oranging robot dog reviews into your eyeballs—then you may also be curious who Sirius is meant for. The short answer is I have no freaking clue.

Is it a toy for serious adults who want an AI-programmable companion? Is it supposed to be cute? Like, I don't know, Furby cute? Or Sony Aibo robot dog cute? I'm not positive, but if it's the latter, then I would venture to say that it's not really hitting the mark. Superficially, it looks like a cross between Boston Dynamics' Spot and a DJI drone, and functionally, it can do a little bit more than the robot dogs of yore, I guess. But in practice, it's just not very, I don't know… fun. There's a sort of binary that exists in gadgets, robot dogs included. There are toys—things that aren't meant to do much, but they're fun to use. And then there are tools. Things that do a thing that you need or very much want done. As it stands, I don't think Sirius is hitting either of those marks, but in the end, the stakes are kind of low. I don't know who this robot dog is for, but some dogs have no master, right? Then again, those dogs, sooner or later, often get sent to the pound…

With so many Bluetooth speakers out there, and more arriving almost daily, it can be easy to underestimate one that dwells in the middle ground. Sandwiched between the packable Soundlink Flex and the beefy Soundlink Max (9/10, WIRED Recommends), Bose's new midsize Soundlink Plus (no, these aren't streaming services) carves out its own niche thanks largely to winning sound with equal parts nuance and bravado.

Like its siblings, the Plus looks and feels like a premium speaker with an accordingly premium price; it's dressed to the nines, especially fetching in the Citrus Yellow color I reviewed, but bears commensurate dust- and waterproofing for good defense against the elements. Medium build notwithstanding, this is still a hefty package, but if you're after a good compromise between boombox might and breezy portability, the Soundlink Plus abides.

There's style in the Sound Plus's minimalism, with a sleek yet strong powder-coated steel grille, supple touch keys along its rubberized topside, and a hearty checkered nylon handle at the side that makes it easier to haul (or hang).

At the back are vents for its four bass radiators and an open USB-C port. A point of note there: the Plus is fine to dunk given its IP67 rating, and it even floats, but you'll need to wait for the port to dry before charging. That's further notable given that, like the Max, the Plus takes a sluggish five hours to charge its 20-hour battery from zero. That said, it didn't take long for the orange-and-white flashing LED to return to solid white following a bath in my laundry sink, signaling a clear and ready port.

Measuring 9.1 x 3.94 x 3.4 inches (WxHxD) and weighing over 3 pounds, this is not the most packable speaker, but it's still game for the open road. It took me a while to get used to its heft, but it fared well on its first task after unboxing, a camping trip in the Columbia River Gorge. If it seems risky taking a shiny new lemon-meringue speaker into the dusty woods, you're not wrong, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well the speaker cleans up. You'll inevitably attract some marks, though, and the Dusk Blue and Black should age better.

Whatever the color, I dig the Plus' aesthetic, and so did most people I showed it to (though they mostly remarked on the great sound). It feels nice to the touch, and both the look and build quality seem a step above flack-jacketed rivals like the JBL Charge 6 and UE MegaBoom 4. I'd still prefer either of those speakers for a hard fall—not because the Bose wouldn't survive, it's just more likely to get nicks or dents. The Charge 6's IP68 rating theoretically gives it bragging rights for water resistance, but all three are dunkable, like most speakers we test.

Soundlink Plus features seem a little austere at first glance, but there's enough here to keep away feature envy. The unified Bose app's compact interface will be familiar to anyone with Bose headphones, with options like the ability to connect to two devices over Bluetooth multipoint, a three-band EQ and presets, and monitoring for battery and volume.

A single point of customization lets you swap one of the Plus' topside control keys from linking with other Bose speakers like the Flex and Max to become a Spotify quick key. You can stereo pair two Soundlink Plus speakers, and Android users will get handy extras like Google Fast Pair and aptX Adaptive support for high-quality Bluetooth streaming.

Another nice touch is the ability to send the speaker to Bose to swap out the battery down the line. At full charge, it lasts pretty dead-on with Bose's 20-hour claim at midrange volume or below. It falls to around 15 hours (or less) if you crank it above that, so it would have been nice to get a full 24 hours like you'll get with some cheaper competitors, including the Charge 6 and Beats' latest Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends), especially since it's designed to charge other devices via the USB port.

Options you don't get include a speaker phone, an Aux input/USB-C playback, or future-proofing features like Auracast audio sharing, something JBL's latest speakers already employ. Admittedly, Aurcast isn't very useful yet since most source devices don't support it, but it would be nice as an option at this price. That said, it could be something Bose plans to add later.

I spent multiple weeks with the Soundlink Plus accompanying me to backyard barbecues and events. It's been a while since I got so many compliments from friends and neighbors on a simple speaker. People really seemed to dig its blend of punch and poise, providing more full-throttle power and bass than you'd expect for its size and some lovely moments of lyricism and detail, especially in the upper midrange and treble.

Bose doesn't list driver specs, but the Plus' dual-driver system is talented, especially the tweeter tasked with carrying much of the load when it comes to detail and instrumental timbres. Multiple times during my review, I was struck by the delicacy and touch with which it handles instruments, delighting in crisp acoustic guitars, rich vocals, crunchy woodwinds, and pillowy brass across registers.

The woofer adds plenty of bass for the size, and while it doesn't dig deep into the lowest Hz, it supports the topside with a robust foundation that makes the speaker feel bigger and bolder than its profile. At one point, I swapped it for the SVS Prime Wireless Pro currently in my living room, and was surprised how well it filled the room in relief with clear, full sound. Bass can sometimes feel boomy or sluggish, but it's mostly a welcome addition, and you can always adjust it in the EQ.

Going back to the oft-mentioned Charge 6 for some A/B testing, the Charge feels a bit more confident and punchy in the mids with raucous tracks like Supergrass' messy rocker “Caught By the Fuzz,” while the Plus showed more presence and precision, especially notable in more acoustic-based songs like Kris Kristofferson's “Border Lord.”

In general, the Plus offers better detail and can still let things loose at high volume. Occasionally, the little tweeter feels like it's trying to do too much, adding some extra sizzle and brashness and/or distortion if you really punch it. It would have been nice to get two tweeters for some stereo separation. Overall, this is a lovely sounding speaker that's equally at home playing low-volume grooves or filling a room.

There's certainly an abundance of choice for portable Bluetooth speakers, but the Soundlink Plus stakes its ground with a premium build and impressive sound. If you can handle its price (and Bose fans are pretty used to doing so), the Plus is a worthy sonic companion.

Saeed Ismail is a real person. But no matter how much proof he posts online, people keep calling him fake.

The 22-year-old has endured almost two years of war in Gaza, as Israel continues an assault that has killed at least 57,000 people and left the territory of 2 million on the brink of starvation. Saeed has been raising money online to feed his family. But many people on social media have been convinced that he isn't real at all. They believe he's an AI-generated creation, used by scammers to get donations through crowdfunding platforms from well-meaning people. And in a world where AI videos and images have flooded our digital spaces, it's easy to understand why some people are so skeptical.

The controversy started with a photo posted in May that features Saeed asking for help. Users of the social media platform Bluesky started accusing him of being fake. A pseudonymous account called Rev. Howard Arson led the charges against Saeed, pointing out his blanket had some odd words woven within it.

Arson pointed to two words on the blanket: “pealistic” and “spfcation,” which seemed to be misspellings of “realistic” and “specification.” Arson suspected that it was evidence the image was made with AI, a result of someone asking an artificial intelligence tool to make a realistic blanket and spitting this out:

Saeed posted several photos and a video showing the blanket to prove it was real, but that didn't put the accusations to rest. He told Gizmodo his mother purchased the blanket from a market near where he lived in northern Gaza before the war: “When I left the house during the evacuation, I took it with me.”

People were convinced that AI video has become advanced enough that Saeed could be a completely artificial being—an AI agent, as Arson told Gizmodo over direct messages. Arson, who has over 20,000 followers on Bluesky, was getting a lot of attention for his claims, helping them spread across the relatively niche social network. Saeed didn't know what he could do, as the account seemed to have more influence than he could ever attain.

“When I went on Bluesky, I saw that many people had started to believe I was a fraud, mainly because of the status of the person who posted about me,” Saeed told Gizmodo over WhatsApp. “He's seen as a trustworthy figure by many, while unfortunately, I don't have the same following or credibility.”

Gizmodo verified Saeed's existence as a real person through a variety of means, including a video call where he walked around the room and showed us the view out of his window. He provided us with his Palestinian ID as well as photos and videos of his location. Saeed told Gizmodo he previously raiseed money on PayPal but now fundraises on GoFundMe through a campaign run by a person he trusts in France who sends him the money. After it gets to France, the money is sent through wire transfers into Gaza, which he says is “reliable and secure,” explaining, “We rely on these channels because we simply have no other options available.”

GoFundMe doesn't operate in Gaza but allows people in countries where it does operate to host fundraisers for people in other countries. It has a tutorial on its website for how to do that safely. The GoFundMe team collects documentation like IDs, receipts for expenses, and other proof to make sure funds are delivered to the beneficiary. A spokesperson from GoFundMe told Gizmodo it has verified Saeed's campaign.

“During humanitarian disasters and other crises, our team proactively monitors and verifies fundraisers to help ensure funds raised on our platform are delivered quickly and safely,” a GoFundMe spokesperson told Gizmodo in a statement. 

“When a GoFundMe fundraiser is created, we prioritize distributing funds while also helping ensure compliance with relevant international laws, global regulations, and requirements dictated by our payment processors,” the spokesperson continued. “We're working around the clock to help ensure humanitarian relief funds are delivered safely and quickly to those in need, helping families access essentials, rebuild, and recover through the generosity of their communities.”

Whoever runs the Arson account declined to provide their real name, let alone jump through the same hoops as Saeed to prove his identity to Gizmodo and GoFundMe. “Unfortunately i don't want a claim i can't prove connected to my name, which is why—even though i'm very skeptical still—i took down the actual claim and any references directly to the guy in question,” Arson told Gizmodo over Bluesky.

Arson told Gizmodo he's an American and recognized his country was helping Israel flatten Gaza and kill tens of thousands of people. But he remained unconvinced that Saeed was a real person and seemed frustrated that AI had become so advanced he wasn't sure what to believe. Arson, who seems to have great familiarity with AI systems, struggles with what to believe, especially when it comes to whether giving money is a good thing.

“I have no idea whatsoever what it is like to be there. i know i would do or say literally anything to eat,” Arson wrote. “But this is why it is absolutely impossible to evaluate whether you are actually doing any good! on one end you have people with money and on the other you have people paying $300 for a bag of lentils in a manufactured and intentional famine.”

Arson acknowledged that his perspective could be warped by seeing so many fake images created with AI.

“The way people get this stuff wrong, and the way I possibly have, is that they end up in a world where half the stuff they look at is synthetic and half of it is real, and presume that 50/50 is the distriubtion [sic] everywhere they look,” Arson told Gizmodo.

Arson pointed to another example of a photo that he previously thought was fake but is actually real. The image shows a woman and two kids sitting in the rubble of Gaza. All three people are wearing sandals, though the boy's left leg has a white plaster cast. But it was the woman's sandal that raised suspicions.

The sandal has a panda head logo, along with an odd mix of words: “HAPPY LUCKY rlorE DNUI.” It's the kind of thing that would immediately raise red flags for anyone on the lookout for AI images being circulated online. The strange thing is that the sandals are real.

Arson found the same sandals being sold on Facebook in a listing from an online shop in Benghazi, Libya back in June 2022. Not only were the sandals seen in the photo from Gaza available for purchase, proving they existed in the real world, but they even came in a variety of colors.

Gizmodo spoke with the woman in the photo, Sahar AlAjrami, over video call to verify she was a real person in Gaza. Her English is not great, so her younger brother, Ahmed, worked as a translator for us, showing the sandals lit by cellphone light in the middle of the night. GoFundMe told Gizmodo that the fundraising campaigns for both Sahar, who's trying to raise money to feed her children, and Ahmed have been verified as authentic.

It's not clear who designed the sandals bearing such mangled English, but they are absolutely real. And it's perhaps notable that June 2022 predates the first widely available AI image generators, which didn't really open up to the public until late 2022. ChatGPT, which officially kicked off the consumer-facing generative-AI race, was launched to the public in November 2022.

Sahar is most concerned for her 10-year-old son Odai, who was shot in the foot by an Israeli quadcopter drone. While amateur sleuths on the internet were fixated on her sandals, it was her son's foot in that photo that should've been drawing the attention. Sahar says painkillers and other medicines aren't being allowed into Gaza and she hopes she can get him to Egypt for treatment. That's an impossibility at the moment, as Israel has shut down all of the crossings.

Gazans like Sahar and Saeed are far from the only people having a hard time proving their identities in a skeptical social media environment. Bluesky has received criticism from activists in recent months as Palestinians in Gaza struggle to survive but are getting banned left and right for allegedly being scammers or bots. Hany Abu Hilal is an English teacher in Gaza with three young kids that Gizmodo also verified as a real person through his Palestinian ID and a video call. He started a crowdfunding campaign on Chuffed, but he keeps getting his accounts deleted on Bluesky for spam.

“My flat was completely burnt and then completely destroyed,” he told Gizmodo, explaining that he lives in a tent in Khan Younis which can't shield them properly from the heat or the cold. Hany said he was banned from Bluesky without a clear explanation and he's desperate because he can't ask for help online in spaces that keep deleting Palestinian accounts.

“Basic food prices are skyrocket here in Gaza. Can't even bring a loaf of bread for my three kids because I am jobless and I do not have money,” Hany told Gizmodo. The Israeli government has total control of what goes in and out of Gaza and recently had a two-month total blockade of food and supplies into the territory. That blockade has been loosened, but only a minimal amount as people struggle to find the basic necessities to live. At least 549 people in Gaza have been killed in recent weeks near aid sites, according to the CBC, and more than 4,000 have been injured trying to access food from the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.-based group registered to an empty office in Delaware. Reporting from the Associated Press suggests it's not just the Israeli military but U.S. contractors who have fired on crowds of Palestinians trying to get aid.

Hany says he's had to evacuate 12 times since the start of the war, a common story for people who have been internally displaced by Israel's invasion of Gaza. The vast majority of Gaza's population have had to leave their homes, and Israel has announced plans to completely “conquer” the territory, with many politicians talking openly about ethnically cleansing the area. While we've verified Hany is a real person, we were unable to reach Chuffed, a fundraising site based in Australia, to get more information about their processes for verifying campaigns.

Hany has struggled on Bluesky, which has exploded in popularity ever since Elon Musk bought Twitter and renamed it X. And perhaps no English-language account on Bluesky has done more to raise awareness of the Palestinian plight on the platform than Molly Shah, a 45-year-old American activist based in Berlin. Shah is originally from Kentucky, and she tells Gizmodo that she moved to Germany in 2017 and has previously worked as a lawyer fighting eviction cases. Molly says the people she talks to in Gaza struggle with social media users calling them fake.

“I talk to people every single day who have seen and faced some of the worst things you can possibly imagine, and the most distressing conversations I have are often around losing their accounts or being called scammers,” Molly said. “I think that is because people in Gaza have lost almost everything, but the one thing they do have left is their identities, and being banned or called fake attacks even that.”

Molly has spotted fakes on Bluesky and acknowledges that there are scammers trying to take advantage of the situation. But they are the minority, and she's shared things to look out for, including people who only use news photos for their fundraising campaigns.

Bluesky told Gizmodo that it understands people in Gaza need platforms to share their experiences and seek support, saying the company is “committed to ensuring they can be heard on Bluesky.” But the platform said that its moderation teams have to “distinguish between genuine advocacy and coordinated inauthentic behavior.”

“In some cases, our investigations have revealed networks where single individuals operate hundreds of accounts engaging in bulk messaging, identical replies across unrelated conversations, and mass following—behaviors that disrupt the platform experience for all users regardless of the underlying cause,” Aaron Rodericks, Bluesky's Head of Trust & Safety, told Gizmodo over email.

“When we identify these patterns, we provide warnings and opportunities for users to adjust their approach before any suspensions occur. In other cases, malicious actors create bulk networks of accounts to target users on Bluesky and exploit goodwill towards crises,” Rodericks continued.

The social media company told Gizmodo that its moderation decisions “aren't always perfect, which is why we maintain an appeals process,” but said users need to focus on operating a single account that follows community guidelines. Rodericks said it would be “publishing more guidance in the near-term to help advocacy accounts stay within our rules while sharing their messages,” but didn't respond to Gizmodo's follow-up questions about when that guidance would be coming.

Even if Americans do find a fundraising campaign they trust, some folks are worried about what the U.S. government will do to them if they donate to people in Gaza, given the authoritarian and anti-Muslim tendencies of the Trump administration. Trump has previously said all of Gaza should be purged of Palestinians and that the U.S. should take ownership of the territory. And that has translated to terrifying actions in the U.S. domestically.

Trump has been enacting racist and often illegal policies targeting foreign students, with a special emphasis on attacking people protesting against Israel's war on Gaza. Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old Turkish citizen and graduate student at Tufts University, was picked up off the street in Massachusetts by masked agents in an infamous video that went viral back in March. Ozturk's “crime” was co-authoring an op-ed in the student newspaper defending the principles of free speech. But it's not illegal for Americans to donate to fundraising campaigns for the average person just trying to survive in Gaza. At least, not yet.

The problem, which we always return to, is that it's getting really hard to tell when someone is a scammer. Google's latest AI video creation tool, Veo 3, has been a game-changer that further muddies the waters. When Time magazine published a report on the tool recently, the news outlet created a video of fake Gazans receiving aid from USAID—which brings us to the people accused of being fake on the other side of this war.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, backed by Israel and the U.S., has been accused of running an unsafe and ineffective aid organization that's getting hundreds of people killed. But it's also been accused of making fake videos. One video created by the GHF and distributed to right-wing news outlets like the Daily Wire was understandably called fake when it was published on social media in late May. Anyone looking at it can see that it does have that kind of unusual AI-style quality that's hard to define.

A source at one of the Gaza distribution sites tells me that Hamas set up a roadblock to prevent Gazans from getting aid.

Reached for comment over email, an unnamed spokesperson for GHF told Gizmodo the video is real, sending along a screenshot of metadata from an iPhone 15 Pro showing where it was taken in Gaza. GHF initially offered to let Gizmodo speak with the cameraman but didn't send us the raw video file we asked for and never connected us with the cameraman who was “on a plane back to America.” GHF has given contradictory statements publicly about its activities, with the head of the organization Johnnie Moore recently telling the BBC that no one had died near their aid distribution sites before saying he wasn't contesting that people had died just a few minutes later.

How does anyone know what's real in that kind of environment? It was a difficult question for people on the internet, even before the invention of generative AI image creators. Gizmodo has been debunking viral photos for over a decade, and many viral fakes even predate the invention of Photoshop by decades. But AI has changed the game in so many ways. And AI images and videos will only get more sophisticated.

Another problem in deciphering what's real in Gaza is that Israel doesn't allow foreign journalists into the territory. The IDF has sometimes escorted TV journalists in for brief periods of time, without allowing communication between the journalists and average Palestinians on the ground, but that obviously amounts to a highly controlled media event. Even if the average American has the budget to fly halfway around the world to go check out Gaza for themselves, they're simply not allowed to do that. So people are forced to either figure out their own ways of determining what's real or just throwing up their hands and deciding it's too hard to authenticate.

But people in Gaza continue to suffer, with no end in sight. The health infrastructure in Gaza has been obliterated, with hospitals becoming “battlegrounds,” as experts at the United Nations have put it. The toll has been immense, with children getting hit particularly hard. Over 50,000 kids have been killed or injured since October 2023, according to figures from UNICEF. And researchers estimate the actual death toll is much higher than the official number that currently stands at over 58,000.

Yet people continue to call the atrocities fake. There are entire accounts on X, which became an extremist far-right platform after it was purchased by Elon Musk in late 2022, that are dedicated to so-called “Pallywood,” a play on the name Hollywood, which allege the people of Gaza are faking the war crimes being committed against them.

At the end of the day, there are no easy solutions. Avoiding scams can be hard as AI infects every corner of the internet. But surviving a genocide is much, much harder.

Trinity College Dublin now has Ireland's first and only BioBrillouin microscope, which will enable researchers to make giant strides in the fields of inflammation, cancer, developmental biology and biomedical materials, among others.

Cellular and tissue mechanics are potent regulators of disease, dysfunction and regeneration, and understanding them is thus a major focus of biomedical researchers. But existing methods are invasive and limited in the information that they can provide. 

However, the incredible new Brillouin microscope can map and quantify the compressibility, viscoelasticity and the detailed mechanics of materials and biological tissues, using non-invasive light. This enables researchers to assess the mechanical properties of live systems (such as cells and tissues) without interfering with them, allowing them to monitor a system and how it changes over time. It is based on light scattering from the result of interactions between a photon of light and the acoustic phonons of a material, which are impacted by the material's mechanical properties. 

With the support of the European Research Council (ERC) and Research Ireland, the Brillouin microscopy system has been installed in the lab of Prof. Michael Monaghan in the School of Engineering at Trinity, where it is housed in the Trinity Centre for Biomedical Engineering at the Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute. 

''Being the first commercial system in the world, we have tremendous technical support from the vendor, CellSense Technologies GmbH, with whom we have worked closely with to get the system on the ground. Our success is their success," said Prof. Monaghan, who is a contributor to an expert consensus paper published today in leading international journal Nature Photonics.

This statement gathers the expertise of international experts in the application of Brillouin microscopy in biomedical applications. 

Studying the mechanical properties of live systems is hugely relevant in myriad fields, and promises to enable leaps forward in our understanding of the ways in which inflammation and cancer develop, for example.

However, it's also important to understand its use is not limited to biomedical research and related applications – it will help scientists push boundaries even further in fields such as materials science, ICT, energy storage, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices and diagnostics. This groundbreaking equipment will help us advance frontier science, and we anticipate scientists will travel from all over the world to use it – we have welcomed some already."

Updated 2m ago

Club World Cup quarter-final action concludes at MetLife Stadium where Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund meet later today.

It is a repeat of the 2024 Champions League final with a place in the semi-final against PSG on the line.

Madrid are the record winners of this tournament with five titles. Dortmund, meanwhile, have never won it.

You can sign up to DAZN to watch every FIFA Club World Cup game for free.

As you may imagine, Real Madrid are favoured by many to advance to the semi-final.

The eggheads over at Opta give the Spanish side a 60 per cent likelihood of progressing today, leaving 40 per cent for Borussia Dortmund's chances. Those figures are based on 10,000 match simulations. 

When considering the result inside 90 minutes, Opta assesses the likelihood of a Madrid win at 47 per cent, a Dortmund win at 27 per cent, and extra time at 26 per cent.

Madrid and Dortmund met in the Champions League this past season, with the Spaniards winning 5-2 at the Bernabeu behind Vinicius Junior's hat-trick in the second half. They also met in the 2024 final of the UCL, with Madrid prevailing 2-0 thanks to goals from Dani Carvajal and Vini Jr as seen above. 

In fact, Madrid have won four straight matches against Dortmund. 

The Guirassy-Adeyemi duo has shown their potential, but Dortmund have also shown defensive weaknesses today that Los Blancos should know how to exploit. 

Real Madrid's Gonzalo Garcia and Dortmund's Serhou Guirassy are in the mix for the Golden Boot at this tournament, trailing the co-leaders by just one goal. 

Players on teams that are still in the tournament are indicated in bold below.

Niko Kovac makes two changes from Dortmund's starting line-up against Monterrey in the round of 16, one by choice and one by necessity. 

Julian Brandt and Marcel Sabitzer come in for Felix Nmecha and the suspended Jobe Bellingham. 

Starting XI: Kobel, Bensebaini, Anton, Sule, Sabitzer, Brandt, Gross, Svensson, Ryerson, Adeyemi, Guirassy 

Subs: Ostrzinski, Meyer, Couto, Reyna, Nmecha, Beier, Duranville, Chukwuemeka, Campbell, Mane, Inacio, Albert, Azhil, Benkara

Kylian Mbappe on the bench again, despite making his tournament debut against Juventus last time out. This suggests that he is nowhere near 100% fitness and that Xabi Alonso's confidence in Gonzalo García is very high. And no wonder: the academy product has scored three goals and provided one assist in four games in the United States.

Starting XI: Courtois, Alexander-Arnold, Rudiger, Huijsen, Fran Garcia, Valverde, Tchouameni, Guler, Bellingham, Vinicius Jr, Gonzalo Garcia

In the end, this has proven a good deal for Dortmund. Despite Gittens' drop in form in the second half of last season, they have still managed to secure a big fee, at a time when they are looking to rebuild their squad and finance a new era.

For context, only four times since the start of the 2019 season have BVB sold a player for a fee larger than €50m. Jadon Sancho, Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham were the first three, now Gittens is the fourth.

Politically, it has its significance, too. This is the first major sale to occur under the watch of Lars Ricken, who became the CEO for football in May 2024. Ricken was actually head of the Dortmund academy when Gittens arrived from Manchester City in 2020, so — on a personal level — he has overseen the player's growth from free transfer, to one of the bigger sales in the club's recent history.

They are losing an excellent player and the hope had been that Gittens would stay longer than he has and grow into a true Bundesliga. That has not happened, but this will be some consolation.

Chelsea and Dortmund have confirmed the transfer of Jamie Gittens for a fee of £48.5million with a potential £3.5m in add-ons.

The 20-year-old has signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge through to 2032, after The Athletic reported that the clubs had reached an agreement in principle last week.

Dortmund had been open to a sale of the former Manchester City youth player, who had moved to the German club in 2020, to help fund a summer rebuild of Niko Kovac's side, who sealed Champions League qualification on the final day of the Bundesliga season.

Lars Ricken, Dortmund's managing director for sport, said the transfer would prove “extremely valuable” to the Bundesliga club.

Gittens recorded 12 goals and five assists in 48 matches during 2024-25.

No one would have expected it a year ago, but this clash will be an interesting battle of the back threes. Niko Kovac has made Dortmund far more defensively solid since arriving in January, but the tactical tweak has meant that Karim Adeyemi is now playing a more central role alongside striker Serhou Guirassy. 

A back-three system is also an attacking ploy from Xabi Alonso, allowing him to keep his best players in advanced positions and create more combinations through the heart of the pitch. The early iterations have had some teething issues, but it will be interesting to see how Alonso continues to tweak his system. 

Goalkeeper Gregor Kobel has been magnificent. He chose to stay at the club despite interest elsewhere and has had a tournament full of excellent saves, especially his double-stop against Fluminense in the first game. That form will need to continue today. 

Gonzalo Garcia. The academy striker had only played 61 minutes with the first team this season before the Club World Cup, but he has taken advantage of the absences of Endrick (injured) and Kylian Mbappe (illness) to surprise everyone. He has three goals, including the winner in the last 16, and one assist, and has been compared by Xabi Alonso to club legend Raul.

Not bad. Dortmund were pilloried in Germany for their goalless draw with Fluminense in the opening match, but the Brazilians then showed what a good side they are. There was more good than bad in the 2-1 win against Monterrey, which should have been far more comfortable. If there is a criticism, it's that slight carelessness which could yet cost them.

Xabi Alonso has restored enthusiasm at all levels (staff, players and fans) after a year of internal tensions and a notable lack of trophies in Madrid. Beyond the three consecutive victories at the Club World Cup, with eight goals scored and two conceded at the tournament, Alonso is showing a real tactical richness and a flair for intervening successfully during matches.

Borussia Dortmund booked their place in today's quarter-final place with a 2-1 win against Monterrey. 

Serhou Guirassy got the goals for the Bundesliga side with two well-taken first-half finishes. German Berterame headed Monterrey back into the game straight after half-time but they could not find an equaliser. A late Sergio Ramos header flew agonisingly close to the top corner as Dortmund held on for the victory. 

Real Madrid met Juventus in Miami in the round of 16, running out 1-0 winners thanks to Gonzalo Garcia's headed goal from close range in the 54th minute. Garcia's strike was his third of the tournament as he continued to impress in his deputy role while Kylian Mbappe recovered from acute gastroenteritis. Mbappe made his first appearance in this match, coming off the bench in the second half. 

Borussia Dortmund opened their Club World Cup campaign with a dour 0-0 draw against Fluminense in New Jersey. Dortmund managed only seven shots on 0.24 expected goals. 

They improved on Matchday 2, offensively at least, with a 4-3 victory over Mamelodi Sundowns in Cincinnati. Felix Nmecha, Serhou Guirassy, Jobe Bellingham and an own goal were responsible for Dortmund's tally. 

First place in Group F was up for grabs heading into the finale, and Dortmund benefitted from a goalless draw between Fluminense and Mamelodi Sundowns to take top spot after beating Ulsan 1-0 on Daniel Svensson's goal.

Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham and his younger brother Jobe, who plays for Borussia Dortmund

When Jobe Bellingham moved from Sunderland to Borussia Dortmund last month there was a possibility he would have to play against older brother Jude in this tournament.

Well, Dortmund are playing Real, but the two siblings won't go head-to-head as Jobe picked up a booking in the 2-1 victory over Monterrey, his second yellow card of the tournament, and that means he is suspended for today's game.

Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund will meet in the last FIFA Club World Cup quarterfinal on Saturday, July 5, in a rematch of a recent Champions League final.

Plenty has changed for both sides since Real Madrid beat Dortmund 2-0 on June 1, 2024, in the Champions League final.

FIFA Club World Cup

Updated 6m ago

Club World Cup quarter-final action concludes at MetLife Stadium where Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund meet later today.

It is a repeat of the 2024 Champions League final with a place in the semi-final against either PSG or Bayern Munich on the line.

Madrid are the record winners of this tournament with five titles. Dortmund, meanwhile, have never won it.

You can sign up to DAZN to watch every FIFA Club World Cup game for free.

Gonzalo Garcia. The academy striker had only played 61 minutes with the first team this season before the Club World Cup, but he has taken advantage of the absences of Endrick (injured) and Kylian Mbappe (illness) to surprise everyone. He has three goals, including the winner in the last 16, and one assist, and has been compared by Xabi Alonso to club legend Raul.

Not bad. Dortmund were pilloried in Germany for their goalless draw with Fluminense in the opening match, but the Brazilians then showed what a good side they are. There was more good than bad in the 2-1 win against Monterrey, which should have been far more comfortable. If there is a criticism, it's that slight carelessness which could yet cost them.

Xabi Alonso has restored enthusiasm at all levels (staff, players and fans) after a year of internal tensions and a notable lack of trophies in Madrid. Beyond the three consecutive victories at the Club World Cup, with eight goals scored and two conceded at the tournament, Alonso is showing a real tactical richness and a flair for intervening successfully during matches.

Borussia Dortmund booked their place in today's quarter-final place with a 2-1 win against Monterrey. 

Serhou Guirassy got the goals for the Bundesliga side with two well-taken first-half finishes. German Berterame headed Monterrey back into the game straight after half-time but they could not find an equaliser. A late Sergio Ramos header flew agonisingly close to the top corner as Dortmund held on for the victory. 

Real Madrid met Juventus in Miami in the round of 16, running out 1-0 winners thanks to Gonzalo Garcia's headed goal from close range in the 54th minute. Garcia's strike was his third of the tournament as he continued to impress in his deputy role while Kylian Mbappe recovered from acute gastroenteritis. Mbappe made his first appearance in this match, coming off the bench in the second half. 

Borussia Dortmund opened their Club World Cup campaign with a dour 0-0 draw against Fluminense in New Jersey. Dortmund managed only seven shots on 0.24 expected goals. 

They improved on Matchday 2, offensively at least, with a 4-3 victory over Mamelodi Sundowns in Cincinnati. Felix Nmecha, Serhou Guirassy, Jobe Bellingham and an own goal were responsible for Dortmund's tally. 

First place in Group F was up for grabs heading into the finale, and Dortmund benefitted from a goalless draw between Fluminense and Mamelodi Sundowns to take top spot after beating Ulsan 1-0 on Daniel Svensson's goal.

Real Madrid began their Club World Cup campaign with a 1-1 draw against Al Hilal in Miami. It was a performance that raised a few questions at the time, though Al Hilal went on to have an impressive tournament. Fede Valverde had the opportunity to steal a win for Madrid in the closing minutes, but his weak penalty attempt was saved. 

Madrid moved to Charlotte next and posted a comfortable 3-1 win over Pachuca, with Jude Bellingham, Arda Guler and Valverde the scorers. Heading into the group finale in first place but not assured of finishing there, Madrid put all doubts to rest with a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Red Bull Salzburg. Vinicius Junior, Valverde and Gonzalo Garcia were the scorers in that one. 

The Club World Cup could just as easily be considered the Confederation World Cup, given the legacy of each football continent sending its best team into global battle.

And generally, the European team has come out on top. 

The above shows how 20 years of the tournament breaks down in terms of geography and performance, with a UEFA club in the final in all bar the first running of the competition — when Real Madrid finished fourth and Manchester United were knocked out in the group stage of the 2000 edition in Brazil. 

That is why CONMEBOL has more top-three finishes in total.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is a little different with 32 teams competing — when the previous 20 editions never brought together more than eight clubs each.

Still, the legacy of those early years will continue and a host of famous names will be looking to add to their previous victories.

Here are the most successful clubs in this competition's history:

We've got a couple surprise packages left in this tournament, as well as some of the pre-tournament favourites.

Manchester City were among the sides best fancied to go all the way but will play no further part. According to the Opta supercomputer, it is another English side that are now favourites.

After yesterday's results, here is how they have ranked the remaining teams based on probability of winning the tournament:

As you can imagine, up first on the agenda in Jude Bellingham's pre-match chat was was his brother's suspension.

💬 “Hopefully we will have another chance at some point in the future to play against each other. It would be a nice moment for our family.”

And then he spoke more generally about Jobe following the same path as him to Germany.

“It's beautiful, I'm really happy for my brother. There was kind of big discussions for him about the decision he could made and I think, looking now from my perspective, I'm really happy with the decision he had.

“I know people at Dortmund will look after him, I know fans will look after him, will support him, and I know he will deliver as well. Now it's about him. I'm really proud.”

When everyone realised that there was a good chance Real Madrid and Dortmund would meet in the quarter-final, there was a lot of excitement for a potential Bellingham derby — Jude at Madrid and Jobe newly signed for Dortmund.

But the prospect of that intriguing match-up went up in smoke midway through the first half of Dortmund's last-16 win against Monterrey. Jobe Bellingham had already been booked at the tournament so, when he picked up another yellow in that game, it meant he would be suspended for the potential showdown.

And he looked absolutely gutted about it. 

It was no surprise to hear such a mature answer from Bellingham who has already established a reputation as a player who speaks well in the media.

AndI can't imagine it was a coincidence that he was put forward by Real Madrid to speak ahead of a game against his former team.

Bellingham played 132 times for Dortmund between 2020 and 2023, helping them to DFB Pokal success in his first season before his big-money move to Real Madrid.

It is actually the third time he has faced the German club since leaving; first in the 2024 Champions League final and then earlier this season in the Champions League — Madrid won both of those matches.

And here is that thoughtful answer from Jude Bellingham when asked about the news regarding Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva.

💬 “As a player I think this comes at the back of my mind. You think about the person, the family, the brothers. It's really hearthbreaking news to be honest.

“It's a reminder on how precious life is, how important is every time you have given the chance to wake up in the morning and that you shoul be greatful, and checking on your loved ones because you never know when it's going to be the last time you get to spend time with them. One of the first things I did was message my brother.”

Jude Bellingham spoke to the media and after a thoughtful message of his own, more on that shortly, he was asked how Trent Alexander-Arnold was feeling.

💬 “It was a really tough day for him to process. I think they were team-mates for five years. As a team we were there to support him. It's a terrible shame, I'm sure everyone, every player, every club send the condolences and love to his family. Horrible bad news.”

While Trent Alexander-Arnold has moved to Real Madrid, he was at Liverpool for the entirety of Jota's time there.

The England right-back put out a lovely message for his late friend on his social media accounts on Thursday — as you can see below.

At the start, you hope it cannot be true, that it has all been a terrible misunderstanding and that something will pop up online to let us know that the internet is a wicked place when it comes to the distribution of fake news.

But then the reports start to accelerate and, waking up to the news about Diogo Jota, you realise there has been nothing on his social media accounts since the wedding photographs that he posted, lovingly, heartbreakingly, just a few hours before his life was taken away.

“A day we will never forget,” Jota had written alongside a video montage from the ceremony in Porto, the Portuguese city where he and his childhood sweetheart, Rute Cardoso, fell in love.

The football world is in mourning after the desperately sad news of Diogo Jota's passing on Thursday.

The Liverpool forward and his brother Andre Silva, a professional player for Portuguese side Penafiel, died after being involved in a car crash in Spain.

Local police confirmed to The Athletic the incident occurred at 00:30 local time on Thursday morning on the A-52 — a 400km carriageway running from Madrid to the Spanish region of Galicia, north of Portugal — in the province of Zamora, in north-west Spain.

The Lamborghini car, which was occupied by 28-year-old Jota and Silva, 25, went off the road and suffered an impact, causing the vehicle to catch fire, local authorities confirmed. It is yet to be confirmed which of the two were driving the vehicle at the time of the incident.

A moment of silence was held before yesterday's quarter-finals and will be held before today's games.

It all started at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida where Al Hilal — the conquerors of Manchester City in the last 16 — were eliminated by Fluminense. The hero for the Brazilians was, once again, the appropriately named Hercules as he came off the bench to score the winner.

Then Chelsea made it past Palmeiras. Cole Palmer's first-half opener was cancelled out by a brilliant finish from Estevao, who is joining Chelsea after the conclusion of this tournament, before a late own goal sealed the Premier League side's place in the semi-final.

Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund will meet in the last FIFA Club World Cup quarterfinal on Saturday, July 5, in a rematch of a recent Champions League final.

Plenty has changed for both sides since Real Madrid beat Dortmund 2-0 on June 1, 2024, in the Champions League final.

French World Cup champion Kylian Mbappé joined Real Madrid, while both feature new coaches.

It will be the fifth match for Xabi Alonso as Real Madrid's coach, taking over during their Club World Cup run after leading Bayer Leverkusen in Germany.

“It will be an intense game, and we need to perform at a high level. We're looking forward to it,” Alonso told reporters before the match.

					Philadelphia local news: Neighborhoods, politics, food, and fun				

Philly hosted its last FIFA Club World Cup game Friday night and it had all the thrills, noise and literal fireworks that any Fourth of July event deserves.

English side Chelsea returned to Lincoln Financial Field for the third time this summer and defeated Brazilian side Palmeiras, 2-1, in front of 65,782 fans, the stadium's best attendance this tournament.

Before the game, soccer fans let the city know they were here. Palmerias rallied outside City Hall Friday afternoon, while Chelsea fans took over the official supporters club's home bar Tir nA Nog on Thursday and Friday, as they did in previous games this summer.

Leading up to the game, Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira tried to leverage the Fourth of July vibes to build support for his underdog side against British opposition.

Ticket prices dipped to as low as $15 Friday, and when it filled out, the blue team from London appeared to have the numbers in the stands, while the São Paulo-based side in green brought the flags, banners and organized noise that has charged the stadium since its opening game.

The Linc added patriotic spectacle to proceedings by moving the singing of the national anthem closer to the start  of the game, with volleys of fireworks “at the rockets red glare” and “the home of the brave.” There was also a live DJ set and fireworks show during halftime. Thirty minutes into the game the fireworks at the Ben Franklin Bridge peaked over a corner of the stadium, and footage of that show was played briefly on the stadium's big screens.

Before kickoff, there were moments of silence to pay tribute to Liverpool star Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva, who both died in a car accident in Spain on Thursday. Their Portuguese compatriot, Chelsea's Pedro Neto, entered the field holding a shirt in honor of them.

Chelsea opened the scoring in the 16th minute through their English star Cole Palmer, who turned deftly with the pass from Trevoh Chalobah, ran across the goal and two defenders before slotting the ball into the bottom corner and performing his trademark “shiver” celebration.

Palmeiras' 18-year-old star Estêvão is set to become a Chelsea player next season, but still received a rough treatment from the Blues defenders like Marc Cucurella. He showed why Chelsea paid a reported $40 million for him, though, by scoring Palmeiras' equalizer from an improbably tight angle in the 53rd minute.

The game remained closely contested, but Chelsea found its winning goal rather fortunately in the 83rd minute, when Malo Gusto's cross deflected off Palmeiras defender Agustín Giay's foot and then the hip of the wrong-footed goalkeeper Weverton.

Despite being on the losing side, Estêvão's performance earned him the player of the match award. 

Chelsea will now go on to face yet another Brazilian side, Rio de Janeiro's Fluminense, on Tuesday at 3 p.m. Palmer said he expects another tough game against strong opposition.

“I feel like they're more physical, more rough,” he said when asked how they compared to Chelsea's usual opposition in the English Premier League. “We know that they're good teams, so it's difficult to play against them.”

Palmer also shared some words with Estêvão on the field after the final whistle, despite a language barrier.

“I just said we look forward to seeing you, but he didn't understand a word I said,” Palmer revealed.

The other semifinal still has to be decided, with the remaining quarterfinal matches playing out today between Paris Saint Germain and Bayern Munich at noon, followed by Real Madrid against Borussia Dortmund at 4 p.m. The tournament semifinals and final will all be held at nearby Metlife Stadium.

For those who are disappointed that the soccer at the Linc is over until next year's six FIFA World Cup matches, just a friendly reminder that the Philadelphia Union currently have the best record in Major League Soccer and are playing away at Nashville SC at 8:30 p.m. tonight. The team next plays at Subaru Park in Chester on July 9, taking on rivals New York Red Bulls in the quarterfinal of the U.S. Open Cup.

FIFA Club World Cup

The Athletic has live coverage of PSG vs. Bayern Munich and Real Madrid vs. Dortmund from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

Prices for FIFA's Club World Cup have been slashed for the quarter-finals of the competition, with some tickets as low as $11.15 (£8.17) available as standard admission entry.

According to Ticketmaster, FIFA's official ticket-selling portal for the competition, tickets for the quarter-final between Brazil's Fluminense and Saudi Arabia's Al-Hilal were available on Wednesday for $11.15 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, while tickets for Premier League power Chelsea's clash against Brazilian club Palmeiras at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field could be bought for $22.30. This is cheaper than had been showing for any group stage game before the start of the competition.

The heavyweight clash between Bayern Munich and European champions Paris Saint-Germain at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta came in higher at $44.60 but still a substantial reduction of FIFA's original pricing for the tournament.

FIFA have applied a dynamic pricing model for Club World Cup tickets, which has sometimes worked in the interests of the consumer during this tournament as prices have tumbled down from FIFA's original expectations following their initial release in December. It's also possible that some fans may have bought tickets at higher prices only for them now to be available at a much lower rate.

Tickets in the lower bowl of the stadiums for the quarter-final were priced at nearly $500 in January, according to a now deleted post on Bayern Munich's website, but lower bowl tickets were available for $22 in the Chelsea-Palmeiras game and $27.90 in the Fluminense-Al Hilal match-up as of Thursday. The demand appears higher at the Bayern game against PSG, where the lower bowl is commanding over $140 in the resale market, but in the upper rings standard admission tickets can now be bought for $44, which is substantially below the original pricing.

Spanish giants Real Madrid have been the most popular team in the tournament, commanding over 60,000 in attendance at all four of their games, and their game against German team Borussia Dortmund at MetLife Stadium on Saturday is proving more resilient in demand and pricing. The cheapest standard admission seats remain $128 in the upper ring, while the lower bowl prices are showing at over $300 via verified resale.

FIFA have publicly lauded the expanded Club World Cup and claim that over two million supporters have attended matches over the 56 games of the competition so far. This represents an average of over 35,000 fans per game, but many games have seen tens of thousands of empty seats as FIFA plumped for NFL venues for many of the matches. The round of 16 attracted an average of 42,750 fans, as attendances dramatically varied. Less than 26,000 attended Chelsea vs. Benfica and Inter vs. Monterrey, but over 60,000 turned out for games such as Real Madrid vs. Juventus, PSG vs. Inter Miami and Bayern Munich vs. Flamengo. FIFA have been donating some for veterans and community soccer groups within cities over the past fortnight.

FIFA's hope had been that demand for the tournament would increase as it goes on, but the lower pricing for the quarter-finals may be owed partly to the small runway between the rounds in which to market to fans, while the cost for loyal club fans to traverse U.S. cities is also burdensome.

FIFA did not respond when approached for comment by The Athletic.

FIFA had concerns before the tournament that attendances may fall below the organization's expectations. The Athletic has previously reported how the organization has committed substantially more than $50m in marketing the competition, including a vast spend on social media promotion and influencers. Their attempts to fill Hard Rock Stadium for the Club World Cup opening match between Inter Miami and Egyptian team Al-Ahly involved offering students at an affiliated local college (with a network of 100,000 students) a single ticket for $20 — but with the promise of up to four complimentary tickets.

The cheapest entry for Inter Miami's game against Al-Ahly dropped to $55 the week before the tournament — half of what they were available for in May. Tickets were $230 for the cheapest seat in January and $349 after the draw in December.

Despite this, FIFA are holding the cheapest standard admission prices at $978 for the second of the semi-finals of the Club World Cup on Wednesday. Both semi-finals will take place at MetLife Stadium, but the second game will see the winner of Real Madrid's game against Dortmund take on the winner of PSG's match against Bayern. Verified resale tickets are available for $426. Standard admission for the first semi-final, between the winners of Chelsea vs. Palmeiras and Al-Hilal vs. Fluminense, has standard admission pricing of $473.90.

The cheapest standard admission ticket remaining for the final on July 13 remains $892. All these tickets remain subject to the dynamic market and may fluctuate.

The higher pricing of the games involving Europe's largest teams underlines that these teams still appear to hold the greatest demand in the U.S. market, with Real Madrid a particular draw.

This tournament has represented an attempt by FIFA to diversify interest in the global game. FIFA President Gianni Infantino claimed “the new era of club football has truly started” after Al-Hilal knocked out English side Manchester City in the round of 16, but within the marketplace, it appears it will still take time to catch up.

Saudi Pro League giants Al-Nassr are determined to sign Rodrygo as they look for support for Cristiano Ronaldo in the attack. The Saudi side are reportedly ready to offer a blank cheque to the Brazilian and have already approached the player's representatives. The 25-year-old, however, would prefer to move to the Premier League instead of heading to the Middle East.

PSG may be the favorite to win the Club World Cup, but the Bavarians have won each of their last four meetings between these teams. They clean-sheeted PSG in each of those matchups, so the Bundesliga titans could have a psychological advantage heading into Saturday's game.

Bayern are undefeated in eight of their last nine matches across all competition and have outscored their opponents 16-4 over four Club World Cup games. The expert adds that Bayern is the toughest opponent PSG have faced so far in the tournament, so they shouldn't be taken lightly. See which team to back at SportsLine.

Eimer is impressed with how PSG have played in the Club World Cup since star striker Ousmane Dembele has been sidelined due to a quadriceps injury. A front line including Desire Doue, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Bradley Barcola has helped PSG outscore opponents 10-1 in this competition, and Eimer is banking on Doue to be particularly stealthy on Saturday.

"All eyes will be on Dembele's return as Bayern try to mark the PSG striker, and Doue tends to shine the most when the focus shifts to his teammates," he told SportsLine. See which team to back at SportsLine. 

Eimer is leaning Over on the goal toals, and has broken down Bayern vs. PSG match from every angle. He has identified three picks for Saturday's match, including one that offers a plus-money payout. Head to SportsLine to see his analysis and top picks.

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — Tobin Heath might know something about what makes soccer resonate within the U.S.

Her resume, in part: She won NCAA titles in college at North Carolina, then went on to win two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. women's national team and two World Cup titles as well, all of that coming after she was inspired by the 1999 Women's World Cup.

And so far, she thinks the Club World Cup could have a similar effect.



Heath — who is working as part of FIFA's technical study group for the tournament, alongside the likes of former Arsenal coach Arsène Wenger, former German star and U.S. men's national coach Jurgen Klinsmann and others — said last weekend that a match she attended earlier this month between Bayern Munich and Boca Juniors, with a full and jammed stadium in South Florida playing host to that matchup, shows what could be possible in this country.

“As an American, it was one of the coolest experiences of my life to witness that passion and energy,” Heath — during a FIFA briefing with the technical group — said. “It's something I never believed I could see in my own country. And the stadium was literally shaking. You could feel it, and the fans were absolutely incredible. So, I know the power of these home competitions. ... I know the power of these games in our country, to change the landscape of this game in our country.”

The attendance for the games in the Club World Cup has varied widely; some stadiums are jammed, some pretty much empty. With the tournament entering the knockout round and some strong matchups ahead — including Lionel Messi and Inter Miami taking on his former team, Paris Saint-Germain, on Sunday in Atlanta — there should be plenty of good crowds throughout the remainder of the event, as FIFA looks to build momentum toward the World Cup that's coming to North America next year.

“This is a fantastic dress rehearsal for us,” Heath said.

Only one U.S.-based team made the knockout stage: Messi's Inter Miami, though some wonder if that's a club that will have a true pronounced effect on soccer in this country. Messi is the biggest name in the sport and has an enormous following everywhere, one that obviously existed long before he came to Miami two years ago.

“Messi has not the best data of this tournament, but he's certainly the most influential player of this tournament — because without him Inter Miami would never qualify,” Wenger said.

The job of the technical study group is simple: watch all the matches, either live or on television (with the benefit of many screens and angles), assess style of play and determine what is making teams successful.

FIFA is promising that fields for next year's World Cup will be in better condition than some used in this tournament.

There have been comments — and in some cases, complaints — about conditions from European clubs, particularly fields in Charlotte and Orlando, Wenger said.

Even the field at MetLife Stadium, which will play host to the Club World Cup final in two weeks, has been the source of discussion.

“The pitch is different turf, different grass than in Europe. In my opinion, the pitch was a little bit soft and not dry, but the ball was not traveling as fast as we are used to. This is my feeling,” Borussia Dortmund coach Niko Kovac said after his team played a scoreless draw there earlier in the tournament against Fluminense.

After Donald Trump banned Iranians from entering the US, one of the co-hosts, there are different views on what should be done

“It's offensive for any football fan to be prevented from participating in the World Cup, not just Iranians,” Ali Rezaei of Tehran's Borna news agency says. In March, the national team became the second to qualify for the 2026 World Cup that will be hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States. In June, Donald Trump authorised the dropping of bombs on Iran and hit the country with a travel ban. As things stand, while the national team will be able to enter the US next summer, fans – and perhaps media – will not.

Residents of Tehran and other cities may have had enough to deal with of late, but still, being barred from entry stings, even if Iranians have long found it difficult to get into the US. “If the US government has issues with the Iranian regime for any reason, it should not result in discrimination against Iranian citizens,” Behnam Jafarzadeh, a writer for the leading sports site Varzesh3, says. “If someone hasn't committed any illegal activity, why should they be punished? It's not just about the World Cup – the policy needs to change in general.”

What can Iran do? “Boycotting the World Cup is not a solution,” Siavash Pakdaman, a Tehran-based fan, says. “Refusing to play on US soil would be a dangerous precedent – any host country could start excluding teams it has issues with. Just as the Iranian delegation can and should be present at the United Nations in the US, the Iranian team should also play on American soil if the draw requires it – without relocation.”

There is a feeling that staying away would not make much difference anyway. “It would only deprive the national team of the opportunity to participate in a major tournament and would ultimately hurt Iran more,” Jafarzadeh says. “It might even be welcomed by some American officials. It could make headlines briefly, but once the tournament starts, it will be forgotten and will have achieved nothing.”

Questions have been asked – including in Iran, whose supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has long banned competing against Israeli athletes – about what the international reaction would have been if Qatar had banned citizens from certain nations from attending the 2022 World Cup.

“If the USA makes it difficult for football fans to attend, then changing the host country is necessary,” Rezaei says. “Doing so would harm the USA's reputation, not the World Cup's. If strict entry rules remain, we should focus on protecting football. This is supposed to be a celebration of sport.”

Jafarzadeh is not confident that the competition could be taken away from the busiest of the three hosts. “It is not a challenge Fifa and [its president Gianni] Infantino would want to take on.” Perhaps there is another way. “Fifa should use all of its influence to push for a suspension of this policy at least during the World Cup.”

Fifa may find it easier to place Iran in Canada or Mexico and hope that Iran don't make it to the latter stages, when there would have to be a game in the US. “Playing in Mexico or Canada is not a real solution – it just ignores the actual problem,” Rezaei says.

Many expect it to happen anyway. “Canada has a large Iranian immigrant population, although some of them are opponents of the Iranian regime and the national team can't count on their support,” Jafarzadeh says. “Mexico is probably a more attractive and less controversial destination for the team.”

That is another question. The Iranian-American community is more than a million strong yet many of these headed west before, or in response to, the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

“It seems that many Iranians who oppose the government consider the national team to be a representation of the regime – which I believe is wrong,” Pakdaman says. “And since a larger number of these opponents live in the US, the team may face pressure from the audience during the matches. Of course, I hope my analysis is wrong.”

Jafarzadeh, who went to the World Cups in Russia and Qatar and would love to go to the United States, says: “Some see the team as one that represents the regime, and this sentiment is even stronger among Iranians living abroad. Of course, the war with Israel has stirred feelings of patriotism among many Iranians, but I'm not sure if this will translate into support for the national team. We'll have to wait and see how things unfold in the coming months.”

That there is time is perhaps a small reason for optimism that things could change. Iran is one of 19 countries subject to a full or partial US entry ban. Several of the others retain hope of qualifying for the first 48-team World Cup, including Sudan, Sierra Leone, Venezuela and Haiti.

“Considering that there is almost a year left until the 2026 World Cup, there is a possibility that the situation may stabilise,” says Isa Azimi, a columnist and translator, regarding Iran's situation, though he is not confident. “Despite claims of separating politics from football, Fifa has shown that it is not particularly independent when facing major political powers.”

Especially when Infantino appears to prize his close relationship with President Trump. “If Fifa considers itself a global body independent of governments, it must stand up to such laws and not allow politics to contaminate the world of sports,” Pakdaman says. “Of course, we all know that, unfortunately, such contamination exists – especially when one side of the issue is a superpower that answers to no one. It is Fifa's duty to treat all member countries equally, but will that actually happen?”

Former Liverpool and Barcelona midfielder Philippe Coutinho has left Aston Villa to complete a permanent transfer to Vasco da Gama. Coutinho left the Villans last summer to return to his homeland and join the Brazilian Serie A side on loan and he has now made his move permanent. The 33-year-old made 26 appearances last season where he scored five goals and provided three assists.

You ask former U.S. men's national soccer team standouts Marcelo Balboa and Stu Holden about the Concacaf Gold Cup final, and the competitive spirit just oozes from their soul.

Especially since USMNT will face its biggest rival, Mexico, in the Sunday, July 6 match at NRG Stadium in Houston.

“Listen, you never want to lose to Mexico,” Balboa, 57, told USA TODAY Sports, before he joins the Gold Cup's Spanish-language broadcast on Univision, TUDN and ViX. “I'm retired. I haven't played against Mexico a long time. Even when I play in the old legends games, I don't want to lose to Mexico.”

Holden – who will be on the Gold Cup call alongside play-by-play announcer John Strong on FOX – still remembers how humiliated he felt after playing in USMNT's 5-0 loss to Mexico in the 2009 Gold Cup final.

“Man, I would give anything to step on that field on Sunday,” Holden said. “And I'm going to step on the field – I just won't be allowed to kick a ball.”

Coach Mauricio Pochettino, breakout star Diego Luna and the USMNT have a golden opportunity to rewrite the team's narrative ahead of next summer's FIFA World Cup.

They could end a tumultuous summer on a high note by lifting a trophy, setting the stage for a World Cup where they could at least be competitive against some of the best national teams in the world.

A loss, however?

Well, here's where it's important to maintain some perspective.

USMNT has been a club on the fly before the World Cup – hiring Pochettino last September, and trying to field a capable roster that won't embarrass itself when the U.S. co-hosts the tournament next summer with Canada and Mexico.

By no means are they ready for the World Cup just yet. But they'll have to be when next summer rolls around.

Star Christian Pulisic is one of several players not with USMNT during the Gold Cup this summer – his decision to rest upsetting several former players turned analysts, especially after the U.S. lost friendlies to Turkey (2-1 on June 7) and Switzerland (4-0 on June 10) before the tournament.

During the Gold Cup, the U.S. beat Trinidad and Tobago 5-0 on June 7, beat Saudi Arabia 1-0 on June 19, beat Haiti 2-1 on June 22, advanced past Costa Rica 2-2 (4-3 on penalty kicks) on June 29 and topped Guatemala 2-1 on July 2 to reach the final.

Pochettino has 10 wins in 15 matches since taking the job, a run that included a four-game losing streak going into the Gold Cup. Would another loss to Mexico – in the Gold Cup final – be a failure for Pochettino and USMNT?

“No, not at all. The fact that this team got there, I think it's very valuable for Pochettino and his coaching staff,” Balboa said, adding it's a prime opportunity for the players pushing for a roster spot to play for USMNT in the World Cup.

“Listen, nobody wants to lose. Is it a failure? I wouldn't think it's a failure at all. I think it's just one of those games that it could go either way. One mistake could cost you the game. But at the end of the day, you can't say one game that you lose to Mexico in the final, the tournament was a failure.”

Holden said he's cautious to put a label like “failure” if this group of USMNT players fall to Mexico because “it would be me getting a little bit lost in the moment.”

This Gold Cup experience is about Pochettino finding his way as the USMNT coach.

It's about players like Luna, who scored both goals against Guatemala, making a name for themselves.

It's about others like forwards Brian White and Patrick Agyemang, midfielders Max Arfsten, Jack McGlynn and Sebastian Berhalter, defenders Chris Richards and Alex Freeman, and goalkeeper Matt Freese solidifying their chances to make the World Cup roster.

Holden believes a Gold Cup win could solidify USMNT's belief in itself, and send a message to its pool of players that the club is heading in a clear direction under Pochettino's leadership.

“That means: You fight like hell on Sunday, and you beat your fiercest rival, and you cap off a great month, and we have a great storyline to tell for the next year,” Holden said.

Palmeiras 1-2 Chelsea: (Estêvão 53); Palmer (16), Weverton (83og)

Malo Gusto's cross deflected past Palmeiras goalkeeper

Their place in the last four of the Club World Cup in the bag and the prospect of a £97m windfall still up for grabs, Chelsea found themselves in an unusual position: relieved to have survived a taxing second half, hailing Malo Gusto's unlikely role as match-winner and able to delight in the opposition's goalscorer being named superior player of the match.

For a while the story of this entertaining quarter-final looked like it was going to be about Enzo Maresca finding it within himself to forgive Estêvão. Everything had changed when the Brazilian sensation, who joins Chelsea after this tournament, cancelled out an early goal from Cole Palmer and hauled Palmeiras level at the start of the second half.

Quiet during the first half, Estêvão threatened to take over and send his next team back to England. The consolation for Chelsea was likely to be seeing exactly why they have paid £52m to sign a talent tipped by many good judges to win the Ballon d'Or one day.

Yet that uncomfortable conversation between Estêvão and Maresca was averted thanks to a horrendous error from Weverton seven minutes from time, a deflected cross from Gusto somehow deceiving the Palmeiras goalkeeper and bobbling in. Palmeiras, who have never won this competition, could not believe their misfortune. They lost late to Chelsea in the final three years ago; now they were out thanks to an own goal from their goalkeeper.

Not that Chelsea cared. The future looks bright. Palmer and Estêvão working in tandem after this tournament? It is a delicious prospect and Chelsea's owners will have loved the symbolism of the duo embracing at half-time. As for the present, the focus is on reaching next Sunday's final in New Jersey. Next up are Fluminese, who beat Al-Hilal in the day's other quarter-final, and that means a reunion with a Brazilian from a different era: the former Chelsea centre-back Thiago Silva.

There was also rare positive PR for Fifa given that its dynamic pricing model pulled in a bigger crowd than expected and quelled any debate over scheduling this tie on Independence Day. This, after all, was far from the biggest show in town on Friday. Fourth of July festivities tend to be quite a big deal in Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy, and anyone looking for ways to mark the holiday could choose from Major League Baseball at nearby Citizens Bank Park, free concerts and a fireworks show in the city centre.

But prices dropping as low as $11.15 (£8.17) ensured there was a decent attendance at Lincoln Financial Field, where attention was on the weirdness of Estêvão playing his future employers. What to do? In Marc Cucurella's case it was to stick tight to the teenager and kick him at every opportunity. It was as if the left-back was determined to show Estêvão what it will be like in the Premier League. The challenges were physical and there was even a blast of fury from Cucurella after Estêvão had a nibble at Levi Colwill midway through the first half.

Chelsea were aggressive. The worry for Maresca was how his midfield would function without the suspended Moisés Caicedo and the injured Roméo Lavia. Enzo Fernández moved deeper but there was another rejig when Reece James suffered an injury during the warmup, forcing Maresca to hand a first start to Andrey Santos.

In that context, perhaps it was not a surprise when Chelsea grew a little ragged in the second half. Making up for the absence of Caicedo's power and Lavia's elegance was not easy for Santos. The 21-year-old Brazilian is still adjusting to Maresca's system after an impressive loan spell at Strasbourg, although this was still an encouraging first step. Playing in a deeper role, Santos asked for the ball, got stuck in and did not hide when the game got tough after half-time.

Palmeiras, who were without key figures in defence, had struggled at first. Maresca had left it up to Pedro Neto to decide if he wanted to play after the death of his friend and Portugal teammate Diogo Jota. Neto was excused from training on Thursday and it would not have been a surprise if the winger had accepted the offer of compassionate leave.

Instead, though, the 25-year-old lined up on the right wing and was soon giving Micael the runaround. Palmer, playing as a No 10, was just as elusive. Sixteen minutes in, he moved to the right, took a pass from Trevoh Chalobah and turned. The outcome was inevitable. Palmer swerved on to his left foot, held off a couple of challenges and threaded a low shot into the bottom corner.

Chelsea remained on top. They should have scored again, only for Christopher Nkunku to shoot over. There was a lull as half-time approached. Richard Ríos had an opening for Palmeiras. Liam Delap ruled himself out of the semi-final after picking up a booking.

The mind went back to Chelsea blowing a half-time lead against Flamengo during the group stage. The Brazilian teams are not to be underestimated. Palmeiras emerged with more intensity at the start of the second half. The narrative turned in the 53rd minute. There was a clever pass from the right from Ríos. Estêvão nipped in, stepping past Colwill, and then came the demonstration of his unique talent: the daring to shoot from such a tight angle, the bravery to take it with his weaker right foot, and the technique to catch Robert Sánchez out at his near post, the ball flying past the Chelsea goalkeeper and going in off the bar.

Maresca responded by removing Delap for the debutant João Pedro and bringing Noni Madueke on for the disappointing Nkunku. Chelsea rallied. João Pedro, who has only had a couple of training sessions since joining from Brighton this week, looked bright. Madueke brought more drive on the left.

The game flew from end to end. Palmeiras were too open. Chelsea kept working themselves into promising positions, although the nature of the winning goal owed more to luck than judgment, Gusto squeezing in a cross, the ball changing course and Weverton not reacting in time.

Enzo Maresca's side were given a scare, but relied on their main man and a fortunate own goal to secure a semi-final berth

Chelsea overcame a scare from their soon-to-be new signing Estevao as Cole Palmer's fine finish and a fortunate late winner secured a 2-1 victory over Palmeiras on Friday night, with the English side progressing to the Club World Cup semi-finals. The Blues took an early lead before being pegged back by the wonderkid's wonder strike, but made their dominance pay in the end.

Palmer opened the scoring with a classy piece of individual play. The attacking midfielder rolled his man, found half-a-yard of space and slotted home after just 16 minutes. But Palmeiras enjoyed their moments, too. Estevao - who will join Chelsea after the tournament - caused problems on the right and was instrumental in setting up their best chance of the first half, with left-back Vanderlan planting a free header into the arms of Robert Sanchez.

Estevao made his mark eight minutes after half-time, though, and showed in a brief flash why Chelsea were so eager to bring him in. The 18-year-old beat his man before lashing a vicious strike in off the crossbar from a near-impossible angle and wheeling away in celebration.

However, the Brazilian underdogs were unable to hold on, as the Blues eked out a fortunate winner with just seven minutes left on the clock. They worked the ball down the left to Malo Gusto, whose mishit cross was diverted into the back of the net by the hapless Agustin Giay.

Chelsea were relatively comfortable after that. Palmeiras offered little on the break, while Enzo Maresca's side largely controlled play to cruise into the semi-finals - albeit with a stroke of luck. Another Brazilian side, Fluminense, are next - and you'd back the Blues to grind out a result there, too.

The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner won't be much use to his country next year if he continues to play at a lower level

"Peace has cost you your strength; victory has defeated you," the muscle-bound, arch-villain Bane tells Batman after catching one of his punches in the hit movie 'The Dark Knight Rises'. The time-worn caped crusader continues to fight as hard as he can, but is ultimately left with a broken back at the end of the scene, having succumbed to the most dangerous pitfall of all: complacency.

There was a similar feeling of futility generated by watching Lionel Messi toil in the second half of Inter Miami's Club World Cup last-16 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain last weekend. Even at the ripe old age of 38, Messi was still able to produce dazzling moments of genius, including a beautiful first-time pass for Luis Suarez that should have earned him an assist, but it was nowhere near enough to lay a glove on an opponent operating at the highest possible technical and physical level.

It was sad to see perhaps the greatest player in the history of the sport fighting a battle he was never going to win. "The match was what was expected," Messi admitted to DSports after the 4-0 thrashing. "They're a great team, winners of the last Champions League, and they're in really good shape. We tried to do our best, and I think we left a good impression at the Club World Cup."

Is simply leaving a "good impression" the goal now for Messi at this stage of his illustrious career? The diminutive wizard has found peace in Miami, but he's also become complacent, and that's bad news for Argentina one year out from their World Cup defence. However, fresh rumours of a potential return to Barcelona have also surfaced in recent days, which would change everything for Messi and the Albiceleste...

Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca has revealed that new signing Joao Pedro will get some game time during the FIFA Club World Cup quarterfinal vs. Palmerias. (1:41)

PHILADELPHIA -- It's never easy to make sense of Chelsea, a club that doesn't do "normal," so why should it be any different when they seal a place in the FIFA Club World Cup semifinals with an own goal by a Palmeiras player and their new wonderkid Estêvão scoring against them?

Chelsea's 2-1 win against Palmeiras, which earned them £15 million in prize money, also happened to come on the day that the Premier League team was hit with a £27 million fine by UEFA for breaching financial regulations. If Enzo Maresca's side beats Fluminense in Tuesday's semifinal in East Rutherford, New Jersey, it will bank another £21.8 million and wipe out the UEFA sanction before the ink has even dried on the rap sheet.

Chelsea will go into their last-four encounter as strong favorites even without center forward Liam Delap and defender Levi Colwill, who both picked up yellow cards against Palmeiras that mean they will be suspended for the next game. Midfielder Moisés Caicedo will return from suspension, and new signing Joao Pedro, who made his debut in Philadelphia as a substitute just three days after completing a transfer from Brighton worth an initial £50 million, will replace Delap.

That's how it works at Chelsea. They have so many players that no injury or suspension seems to make a difference, because the carousel just turns and another player steps off to fill the void.

Estêvão will be the next one to join Maresca's ever-growing squad. The 18-year-old completed a £33.8 million transfer from Palmeiras in June 2024, but at age 17 at the time was too young to make the move directly to Stamford Bridge, so he remained in Brazil to continue his development with Palmeiras. Chelsea could have called Estêvão into their squad for this tournament this month but decided to allow the teenager to remain with Palmeiras and assess his readiness for Maresca's squad by monitoring his performances in the competition.

There was always a chance the two clubs would meet and pose a difficult scenario for the player, but in what turned out to be his final game for the Sao Paulo team before heading to Chelsea, Estêvão dazzled and scored a stunning goal that will hugely excite his new club's supporters. With Chelsea leading 1-0 after a first-half Cole Palmer goal, Palmeiras struggled to land a blow on the English team until Estêvão raced onto a ball into the penalty area and beat Colwill to it before scoring with a right-footed strike that went in off the underside of the crossbar. It was a goal that showcased audacity, confidence and supreme skill, and it sparked Palmeiras into a period that could have, and maybe should have, delivered a second goal to put them in the lead.

Craig Burley discusses Xabi Alonso's selection headache ahead of Real Madrid's quarterfinal clash vs. Borussia Dortmund.

Estêvão was part of that revival, tormenting the Chelsea back line with his blistering pace and linking well with impressive No. 9 Vitor Roque. But the Brazilian team was unable to make its dominance pay, and Chelsea fortuitously regained the lead on 83 minutes when Malo Gusto's cross was diverted into the net after two deflections, off Agustin Giay and goalkeeper Weverton. It was a goal worth £15 million in prize money, so it probably deserved to be a little more spectacular, but Chelsea won't mind how it went in because it secured a place in the semis.

Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).

How Chelsea have made it this far is down to luck rather than good planning. Maresca's team was mediocre during the group stage, when it was comfortably beaten by Flamengo, but reached the quarterfinal after a farcical round-of-16 tie against Benfica in Charlotte that was hit by a two-hour weather delay and saw the Portuguese side create chances to win the game. But despite it all, including the off-field noise that often accompanies the club, Chelsea have made it to the semis, and they will face arguably the weakest of the four Brazilian teams -- Botafogo being the other in contention -- in Fluminense, who overcame Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal in the quarterfinals.

Less than two months ago, Chelsea were facing a failure to qualify for the Champions League and the prospect of their £1 billion spending spree amounting to little more than a Conference League success. But all of a sudden, they are 90 minutes away from the Club World Cup final, having already bagged Champions League qualification and the Conference League.

Just don't try to make sense of it all, because this is Chelsea, and chaos seems to be the driving force behind the club and Maresca's team.

Kamil Majchrzak is enjoying the week of his life at Wimbledon, where he is into the fourth round at a major for the first time. Cheering him on courtside in south west London is Marta Majchrzak, who is not only the World No. 109's wife but also his physiotherapist and fitness trainer.

“She's everything in this team for me,” Majchrzak told ATPTour.com in London. “We do physiotherapy together sometimes, she helps me with fitness programs, monitors me when I need her. She can feed balls for me on the court. She's a former player, and she's doing an amazing job for me. She's able to sacrifice herself 100 per cent for me.”

Their story began more than a decade ago when they began dating and the couple married in November 2022. Marta, a former junior tennis player herself, has transitioned into a vital role supporting Kamil on and off the court. When not traveling, she works with the Polish Tennis Association in their home country.
“She can't travel with me all the year with her physio work at home but when she is with me, like this week, those weeks are fantastic. Regardless of results, she helps me be on Tour and be happy on Tour," Majchrzak said. "This life is demanding. I like having her next to me. Anytime she can come, I take her with me because I know it'll be a great time. I am proud of achieving the results I do for the both of us.
“She gives me advice for on court, helps me physically, pushes me and I can practise with her as she can feed and hit. We have spent a lot of time together during the years, so it is nice to have her by my side.”

Majchrzak's Wimbledon campaign started on a challenging note. Facing former finalist Matteo Berrettini in the first round, and coming off three straight losses on grass, expectations were low. But the 29-year-old played with nothing to lose and everything to gain, advancing in five sets to earn his first win on the surface since 2022.
“I had a pretty difficult draw. I played against Matteo, one of the best grass court players in the world. I came on court with no expectation, just to show some good tennis and be competitive,” Majchrzak said. “Then we started and I was in a good position and my game grew during the match. I was getting more confident. Believing more and then I did it.”
The last time Majchrzak had reached the third round at a major prior to this week came at the US Open in 2019. However, the Pole backed up his big win against Berrettini with straight-set victories against Ethan Quinn and Arthur Rinderknech to advance to the fourth round at a major for the first time.
“It's a great achievement. It feels incredible. I'm super happy to be here,” Majchrzak said on his run. “I was really fighting last year and the beginning of this year to be in the main draw, to maybe avoid qualifying and to get back to this legendary and magical club. I managed to do it and here I am now, being in the fourth round. I look forward to competing in the best tournament in the world.”

Away from the grass courts, Majchrzak enjoys watching Manchester United and going for walks with his dog. They are the little moments that help balance the demands of the Tour and keep him grounded.
On Tour, Majchrzak is part of a tight-knit Polish group, sharing a special bond with countryman Hubert Hurkacz and former WTA World No. 1 Iga Swiatek.
Majchrzak is a year older than 2021 Wimbledon semi-finalist Hurkacz and has known the former Top 10 star since childhood.
“I have a very good relationship with Hurkacz,” Majchrzak said. “We've known each other almost forever. We played matches against each other when I was 12 and he was 11. We have a long history together. We competed in a very healthy way, motivating each other to push harder so we could both grow, not to sabotage but to support. Hubi is such a nice guy, the most professional person I know. I was and am very happy about his success.”
About Swiatek, he added: “Iga has an amazing personality. She's a very nice person and an amazing tennis player, one of the best in the world over the past few years. From my perspective, she's won everything, even if not literally. It's inspiring to have both of them from my country. Like I said, with other Polish players, we're like a group. We're very connected, and we push each other to the limits. That's how it works.”
Majchrzak won an ATP Challenger Tour title in Madrid earlier this year and is back in the Top 100 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his run in London. Currently at No. 79, four spots off his career high, the 29-year-old will next face Karen Khachanov for a place in the quarter-finals.
For Majchrzak, the stakes couldn't be higher.
“I'm incredibly happy but I have more to come I think, I hope my story will keep going," the Pole concluded.

Jannik Sinner is into the fourth round at Wimbledon for a fourth straight year, and has done so at a canter.

The 23-year-old returned to the All-England Club shrouded in a veil of pity, as many expected the three-time Grand Slam champion to be reeling after his French Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz.

Everyone knows the story now of how he squandered three championship points and a two-set lead to eventually lose the match and the title.

However, there has been no indication that he has let this impact him, despite what some reporters might try to infer.

Asked if he felt negative coming into Wimbledon after his crushing French Open final, the Italian was left a little surprised by the nature of this question.

After all, he has looked flawless at the All-England Club thus far, showing no signs of dwelling on such a defeat.

His response was one of bewilderment, as Jannik Sinner began: ‘Why negative feelings? Because I lost in the final? No. Look, it's a new tournament. New grand slam. New surface. 

‘I'm not concerned about my level I can play at times. I'm not concerned that one loss can influence you for such a long time. 

‘I believe that here is a new chance that I can do something good from my side. If I play some good tennis, I know that I can go far potentially. Maybe I lose the next round. I don't know. But I'm not concerned. 

‘I'm honestly very happy to be here. I'm happy I have the chance to play on such special courts here at Wimbledon. There is no better place to play tennis at this moment. Everything is going well. 

‘I had a good preparation to prepare for this tournament. Now let's see how I do here and how far I can go.'

As noted earlier, failing to drop a set on his way into the fourth round of Wimbledon hardly suggests a mental deficiency.

In fact, he's arguably never looked so assured and secure on the grass, poised to stroll into the final, especially with how the draw has opened up.

Of course, the prospect of facing Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals is daunting, before Carlos Alcaraz will likely await in the final.

Sinner spoke about how it felt to face Djokovic for the first time recently, but he has come a long way since then.

However, to win these elite titles, there are going to be some huge obstacles in your path, both of whom Sinner has beaten in the past.

There is no suggestion that he's suffering after his French Open final loss; if anything, it's fuelling him onto record-breaking greatness.

Tennis Fans Want Wimbledon Reporter Banned For 'Unprofessional' Question originally appeared on The Spun.

For the second time in the past week, the media has made a truly bizarre remark about Emma Raducanu.

Following a straight-sets victory over Matteo Bellucci on Friday, Cam Norrie spoke to the media about his performance. He seems fairly comfortable on the grass, which isn't a surprise considering he made the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2022.

Unfortunately for Norrie, his press conference was overshadowed by a ridiculous question from an unidentified reporter.

"Apart from everyone here loving tennis, some of the gossip has been about who Emma Raducanu is dating," a reporter asked Norrie. "Can I ask if you're dating her? Can we get to the bottom of this please?"

Norrie initially replied, "Sorry?" Instead of getting the hint, the reporter once again asked him about Raducanu's love life.

"I'm trying to find out who's dating Emma Raducanu," the reporter continued. "It seems to be going around all the men's singles. I was wondering if you're dating her, please?"

Norrie, who is in a relationship with Louise Jacobi, handled that awful question like a total pro.

"I'm not [dating Raducanu]. No. You can ask her though," Norrie said.

Tennis fans were understandably disturbed by this reporter's question. Some fans are calling for this reporter to receive a lifetime ban from Wimbledon.

"This is so absurd that not even 'Tennis Centel' could come up with it," one fan said. "Embarrassing that this is what an actual journalist would think of let alone come up with for a question in a press conference."

"That reporter needs to be banned," a second fan declared.

"What an absolutely disgusting question! The private lives of players are none of our business. Why do sports journalists continue to humiliate themselves," a third fan wrote.

"Whoever asked that question should be banned for life from the Tournament," another fan commented.

Just a week ago, Raducanu was basically asked if she's dating two-time Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz.

"There's been lots of chatter online about your friendship with Carlos," a reporter asked. "Is there any truth behind the rumors?"

Raducanu replied, "We're just good friends."

While we understand there's plenty of hype surrounding Raducanu, reporters shouldn't be asking about her personal life. There's no place for that type of behavior.

No Bull, no Fluff, No Smudges

WIMBLEDON, England — I was taller than Reilly Opelka when I first met him.

I tell this to people all the time and they either laugh right away or throw an incredulous look at me.

But it's true. I was 5-foot-5 then, in 2009, and I'm still 5-foot-5 (OK fine, since my hair is mostly gone I'm probably 5'4”). He was around 5-3.

Of course, he was also only 11 years old.

In the 16 years I've known the 7-foot professional tennis player and former Indian Trails Middle School student, I've seen him in all kinds of mental states.

I've seen him joyous, such as when he qualified for the U.S. Open Juniors in 2013, as a 15-year-old, and his parents (George and Lynne) and I stood on a walkway inside Arthur Ashe Stadium and looked at each other and said “Can you believe we're actually here?”

Or when he won his first ATP Tour title, on Long Island at the New York Open in 2019. I was fortunate to be in attendance that whole week, and afterwards he couldn't stop grinning as we reminisced about his first coach, former tennis star Tom Gullikson, and their practice sessions at Grand Haven and elsewhere.

I've seen him surprised, and a little shell-shocked, such as when he won the Junior Boys title at Wimbledon in 2015, and he insisted to me on the phone after the match that it wasn't that big a deal, even though it of course very much was.

I've seen him angry, such as when things weren't going his way during his slow and steady climb up the ladder of the ATP Tour. Like all tennis players (except maybe Jannik Sinner, who never seems to get angry), Opelka has sometimes snapped at lines judges and chair umpires, because this tennis thing is a very frustrating sport.

So yeah, I've seen Opelka in just about every mood there is. But Thursday afternoon, in Interview Room 5 in the Media Pavilion here at Wimbledon, I saw a guy who looked defeated.

Depressed, frustrated and at a loss as to what's going on with his career.

Opelka has worked so hard these last few years to come back from injury; he endured a horrific botched wrist surgery, had another operation to fix it, and was off the pro tour for more two years, until returning last July.

When Opelka finally made it back, he was thrilled just to be healthy again, and knew that he'd need a few months to shake the rust off and start moving back up the tennis ladder.

This is a guy who was No. 17 in the world just a few years ago, and on the verge of making a major Grand Slam breakthrough. Many, including John McEnroe, said he'd win Wimbledon one day, what with his rocketship of a serve that goes above 140 miles per hour and zooms past hapless opponents after hitting the perfectly manicured green grass here.

But it's been eight months, and Thursday at Wimbledon brought another second-round loss, this time to American Brandon Nakashima, in four sets.

“I got dominated,” Opelka told me. “It sucks. I lose second round every week, and it sucks. Something has to change.”

The big 28-year-old, who has lost in the second round of his last four events, said his tough defeats lately aren't physical. He said his body feels “really good” after ramping up and playing a regular schedule of tournaments in 2025. He entered Wimbledon ranked No. 70.

The problem, ironically, is his serve. What has long been his most dangerous weapon is betraying him. When things are going well, Opelka gets 70-75 percent of his first serves in play, and wins 90 percent of those points.

These last few months, Opelka said, he's getting 60 percent of his first serves in, and winning only 75 percent of those points.

“Those are the only numbers that matter,” he said. “Right now my serve is just really really bad.”

Denis Kudla, a former pro who's been a traveling coach for Opelka for the past year, is more optimistic about how his player is doing.

“There's a long way to go but he's getting there,” Kudla said. “Sometimes we all want fast results. Reilly understands the process, and he's a professional. Slow and steady, he's getting there.”

Opelka isn't so sure.

“I'll quit,” he said. “You don't make any money losing second round every week. If I keep losing, I'll just wait until my ranking drops to the point where it's really bad, and then I'll quit.”

I hope this was just frustration talking, because after all the work and effort he's put in, I'd hate to see him quit.

Then again, Opelka has always been a different cat, as they say, who was never totally single-minded about tennis. He's a lover of art, going to galleries in all the European cities he's been to while playing, and has struck up friendships with gallery owners like Tim van Laere in Belgium.

Some players, you wonder what they'd do with themselves all day if they didn't have tennis. Opelka isn't like that. He's got plenty of outside interests. He's smart, well-spoken and could be a great broadcaster if he wanted to be.

If he's not happy and struggling with tennis, then maybe it's good he's thinking of leaving. He's still young, after all.

But I hope that's not the case. He deserves to come all the way back and have the kind of success he was having a few years ago, the kind that seemed preordained all those years ago on the courts of the Palm Coast Tennis Center, the courts that now bear his name.

It would only be fitting for the tallest tennis player in history to reach new heights before he's through.

Barbora Krejcikova's Wimbledon title defence ended in distressing scenes as she broke down in tears and required a medical timeout during her third-round defeat by Emma Navarro.

The Czech star looked uncomfortable on Court 1 during the deciding set, calling for medical assistance while trailing.

Officials were seen taking her blood pressure and checking her vitals as concerns grew among the crowd, with Krejcikova appearing emotional and hunched over between points as she struggled to continue.

Despite bravely playing on, Krejcikova was unable to rediscover her rhythm, with Navarro sealing a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory to reach the last 16 at SW19 for the first time.

Krejcikova received a warm ovation as she left the court in tears, cutting a dejected figure after her hopes of defending the title she won last year came to an end in difficult circumstances.

The 29-year-old had lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish for the first time in 2024, adding to her 2021 French Open triumph, but was unable to build on that success this summer following the concerning medical episode.

Navarro, who will now face teenage talent Mirra Andreeva for a place in the quarter-finals, showed composure in the closing stages, breaking Krejcikova five times and winning 68 per cent of points behind her first serve.

Krejcikova's struggles echoed similar scenes earlier in the tournament when Ons Jabeur had her blood pressure and vitals checked on court before retiring in tears from her opening match.

All of Krejcikova's matches at Wimbledon this summer had gone to three sets.

She lost the first set against Alexandra Eala of the Philippines in round one before rallying to win 3-6, 6-2, 6-1.

Krejcikova then overcame American Caroline Dolehide 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 before losing to Navarro. 

Struggling with her serve, Krejcikova faced 18 break points against Navarro, although she saved 13 of them. She hit eight double faults as well as four aces.

Jannik Sinner advanced to the fourth round at Wimbledon for a fourth consecutive year on Saturday by overcoming a physically hampered Pedro Martinez 6-1, 6-3, 6-1.

Having dropped just 17 games in his campaign so far, Sinner has equalled the Open Era record for fewest games dropped into the men's singles fourth round at Wimbledon, held by Jan Kodes in 1972. The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has also yet to drop his serve this week. He has won all 37 service games he has played, fending off all eight break points he has faced.

Sinner led Martinez 5-0 in the first set before the Spaniard took a medical timeout to receive treatment on his right shoulder. Martinez struggled to serve at full capacity — often firing first serves at 80 mph – while the Italian remained typically dominant from the back of the court.

“I'm very happy to be in the second week, but I think we all saw he was struggling with the shoulder,” said Sinner. “He couldn't serve very well, and especially on this surface, if you can't serve well, it's not easy to play. But huge credit to him for coming out. From my side, I tried to stay solid from the back of the court.”

Martinez grew in confidence in a free-hitting display in the second set, carving out four break points in the eighth game. Yet Sinner saved all of them with a mix of bruising ballstriking and pinpoint serving to reassert his dominance on the encounter before racing to a one-hour, 55-minute victory.

Smooooth from Sinner 😮‍💨He strolls past Martinez in straight sets to advance…@wimbledon | #wimbledon pic.twitter.com/XB4ra0TKE5

By reaching the fourth round at a Grand Slam tournament for the 17th time, Sinner overtook Nicola Pietrangeli (16) to claim the all-time Italian record. It marks his fourth consecutive appearance in the last 16 at Wimbledon in just his fifth foray at the grass-court major.

After improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Martinez, Sinner set a clash with Grigor Dimitrov, who moved past Sebastian Ofner 6-3, 6-4, 7-6(0). The 23-year-old Sinner is chasing his fourth major trophy and first at Wimbledon, where he reached the semi-finals in 2023 before falling to Novak Djokovic.

While Sinner cannot lose his World No. 1 spot during the tournament, he is still aiming to make ground in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, which determines who will claim ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. Two-time defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz currently leads second-placed Sinner by 2,240 points atop the Live Race.



In contrast to rivals Alcaraz and seven-time winner Djokovic, who have each squandered sets during their campaigns at SW19 thus far, Sinner has not faltered. He remains the only player in the men's singles draw not to have dropped a set, and is also yet to drop serve across his first three matches.

If Lorenzo Sonego can join Sinner and Flavio Cobolli, who earlier defeated Jakub Mensik, in the fourth round, it will mark the first time in history that three Italians reach that stage at WImbledon.

The opening Saturday at Wimbledon is a day the All England Club traditionally invites a range of sporting superstars into the Royal Box. Those watching Sinner score his 22nd win of the season included Tennis Hall of Famers Andy Roddick and Vijay Amritraj, among other sporting legends from across the board.

“I feel like I haven't won anything compared to you,” Sinner said to the Royal Box crowd. “For us athletes, it's very nice when we see new faces because we are not used to playing in front of such special guests, so thank you for watching.”

There were moments of magic for Martinez, who flicked an expertly-measured lob over Sinner in the sixth game of the second set. Yet these were few and far between as Sinner took control of the Centre Court occasion.

Aryna Sabalenka has once again been asked about her reaction to losing the French Open final, after reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon.

Facing Emma Raducanu, the Belarusian will have been well aware of the atmosphere she was walking into on Centre Court.

And, as someone who has wilted when facing the scrutiny of an opposing crowd, there was every chance that the 27-year-old could have buckled under the pressure.

Alas, she composed herself to twice come from a break down in both sets, winning the match in straight sets to reach the Wimbledon fourth round. Sabalenka was actually compared to Novak Djokovic with what she did during this impressive win.

Arguably more impressively, she also showed so much maturity in claiming such a hard-fought victory; and yet was brought right back to arguably her toughest moment in the post-match press conference.

She was first asked about that British-supporting atmosphere, and the way she dealt with it compared to the French Open final, where her emotions got the better of her.

This is especially pertinent given how Sabalenka's comments about Gauff went viral, with the reaction particularly volatile.

But, the world number one has now actually admitted that she is ‘happy' about that moment, despite the backlash she received.

Aryna Sabalenka told reporters: ‘Yeah, as I said, I'm kind of happy for what happened to me at the French Open, because I had a chance to sit back and to look at everything in perspective and realise a lot of things about myself and I kind of like feel that I'm a different person and I learned from that difficult lesson.

‘And yeah, as you said, you know, because of the recent experience, I was just like, keep telling myself, like, no, you you just cannot let it happen again. 

‘You just have to whatever happens on the court, you just have to be respectful, you have to you have to be calm, and you just have to keep trying and keep fighting and and I was just reminding myself that I was strong enough and I can handle this pressure.'

It has been 28 days since Sabalenka lost the French Open final to Coco Gauff, and yet just last night, the topic of her comments arose again.

The 2024 US and Australian Open champion made an ill-advised and emotional statement after one of the most crushing losses of her career, and the regret was instantly apparent in the aftermath.

To be fair to the young American, she was incredibly mature, and handled the situation with such poise and grace. She should be proud of her ability to defuse such a high-profile situation.

And, the way in which she went about accepting one of Sabalenka's many apologies also deserves credit.

But the three-time Grand Slam winner has apologised, on numerous occasions, with the two clearly having already rebuilt their relationship.

It's about time that this topic stopped cropping up, as it just makes Sabalenka relive a real low point in her career that she has already atoned for.

By HOWARD FENDRICHAP Tennis Writer

LONDON (AP) — As well as Jannik Sinner is playing at Wimbledon, he doesn't appear to need much in the way of help. Still, he got some Saturday when his opponent, Pedro Martinez, was dealing with a problematic shoulder and often put in first serves at so-so speeds.

The No. 1-ranked Sinner has dropped a record-tying total of only 17 games so far, made his way to the fourth round for the seventh consecutive Grand Slam tournament — he's collected three such trophies in that span — and never was truly in trouble during a 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 victory over No. 52 Martinez.

“We all saw that he was struggling,” Sinner said, then noted about his own form: “First week couldn't have gone better.”

Sinner is the second man in the Open era, which began in 1968, to cede just 17 games through three completed matches at the All England Club. The other player to do that, Jan Kodes, ended up losing in the semifinals in 1972.

For Sinner, there's been zero sign of any sort of inability to move past last month's French Open final, which he lost to Carlos Alcaraz in five sets despite taking the first two and holding three championship points.

Against Martinez, Sinner — who returned in May from a three-month doping suspension — went up 5-0 after 20 minutes. During that stretch of 29 points, Martinez managed just one winner, while Sinner accumulated 10.

That's when Martinez took a medical timeout, and a trainer massaged the back of his right shoulder. The Spaniard was delivering first serves as slow as 76 mph, compared with Sinner's high of 133 mph.

That aspect of Martinez's game improved incrementally, but the only, ever-so-brief, moment of intrigue at Centre Court came in the second set, about 75 minutes in, with Sinner up a break and serving at 4-3. That's where Martinez managed to accrue his first four break points of the match.

Sinner stayed as calm as can be — “I don't think Sinner's changed expressions once in this match,” John McEnroe observed on BBC's telecast — and erased all four of those chances, held for 5-3, then broke to end the set.

Soon enough, Sinner — twice an Australian Open champion, once a U.S. Open champion and a 2023 semifinalist at Wimbledon — was headed into a contest Monday against No. 19 Grigor Dimitrov.

A ninth woman in the past nine editions of the tournament will leave the All England Club with the trophy. That's because defending champion Barbora Krejcikova was eliminated by No. 10 Emma Navarro of the United States 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, and 2022 champion Elena Rybakina lost to No. 23 Clara Tauson by a 7-6 (6), 6-3 score. Krejcikova had her blood pressure checked during a medical timeout in the last set. No. 7 Mirra Andreeva, an 18-year-old Russian, moved into Week 2 with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Hailey Baptiste of the United States, and five-time major title winner Iga Swiatek overwhelmed Danielle Collins 6-2, 6-3. Another fourth-round matchup was set up when No. 19 Liudmila Samsonova and Jessica Bouzas Maneiro advanced. Men's winners included No. 11 Alex de Minaur and No. 22 Flavio Cobolli, with Novak Djokovic in action later.

No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, coming off a riveting win against Emma Raducanu, returns to Centre Court to face No. 24 Elise Mertens as the fourth round begins. Sunday's last scheduled match in the main stadium features two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz against No. 14 Andrey Rublev. Over at No. 1 Court, 2024 U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz of the United States, the No. 5 seed, begins play at 1 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET) against unseeded Jordan Thompson of Australia.

Osaka fell in the third round of Wimbledon on Saturday.ByDavid KanePublished Jul 05, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 05, 2025

Naomi Osaka's seventh Grand Slam outing since returning from maternity leave ended in another disappointment, the Wimbledon Primetime panel breaking down her third-round loss to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Saturday.“She seems a little bit lost,” said Prakash Amritraj following the former world No. 1's 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 defeat. “When she's playing great tennis, it's so beautiful to watch that she brings non-tennis eyeballs to the game. We're all such big fans of that. But she needs to start feeling a bit better about herself before it can translate into good tennis. That has to come first before the good striking. She said [in press], ‘I'm just going to be a negative person today, because that's how I feel' and I don't know how she gets through that, but she has to.”A four-time Grand Slam champion, Osaka is yet to reach the second week of a major tournament since giving birth to daughter Shai in 2023. Her comeback began the following year at the Australian Open, where she lost in the first round to Caroline Garcia. Though she avenged that defeat earlier this year, subsequent losses have made the 27-year-old question how much longer her career will last.

“Once that thought gets in your mind, it's hard to get it out of your mind,” said Lindsay Davenport, a fellow former No. 1 who mounted her own comeback from maternity leave back in 2007. “She's been back on tour for about 18 months now since her maternity break and she's been playing full time, no real injuries. Yes, it's hard to come back. I get it; I did it. But she's not even in a position to be seeded, hasn't really been able to break into that Top 30, which, if you've won four Grand Slams and been No. 1 in the world, that's what you're shooting for.“This is probably a really good time for her to take some time, figure out why she's playing and struggling in these close matches. Once you lose your confidence at 4-4 or 5-5 in sets, it's tough to get it back. She's just got to figure out if this is what she wants to be doing out here.”Amritraj argued Osaka was unlikely to step away and, despite disappointments at Grand Slam tournaments, has trended up in 2025 by winning her first title on clay in Saint-Malo.

Osaka made the third round of Wimbledon for the first time since 2018 but was unable to convert a one-set lead against Pavlyuchenkova on Saturday.

“The only puzzling thing for me is that, for someone who has had that much success, sometimes when I listen to her it's like she's never been there before. As cliché as it sounds, you've got to remember who you are here. When she was playing at her best, she was trouncing people on hard courts, winning Grand Slams back-to-back.“She's put the work in, clearly,” added former No. 1 Jim Courier. “She's fitter than I've seen her in a long, long time.”Both Courier and Davenport raised Osaka's current coaching partnership with Patrick Mouratoglou, who worked with Serena Williams through the final decade of her career. Following a Roland Garros defeat last month, Osaka opened up about feeling like she was disappointing Mouratoglou with her results.

Something has to give there, whether it's playing a little less or bringing her daughter on the road with her a bit more, maybe try a new coaching set-up...It just seems like something's got to change for her to have a little bit more success. Lindsay Davenport

“I was thinking this just now, but he goes from working with, like, the greatest player ever to, like, ‘What the fuck this is?'” a frustrated Osaka said at the time.“That's not a thought that should be in a player's mind,” said Courier.“Something has to give there,” agreed Davenport, “whether it's playing a little less or bringing her daughter on the road with her a bit more, maybe try a new coaching set-up. Who knows? It just seems like something's got to change for her to have a little bit more success.”Osaka will likely play her next tournament on a hard court, the surface on which she has achieved her greatest successes with four Grand Slam victories (two US Open, two Australian Open).

The Athletic has live coverage from Day 6 at Wimbledon 2025.

THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB, LONDON — There is a mysterious storm brewing in the bottom half of the women's draw at Wimbledon. At its center is a player that much of the field is trying to figure out, as she too tries to figure out who she is on this grass.

It's not a surprise qualifier, or a player who has directly benefited from so many seeds making an early exit.

It's Iga Świątek, the five-time Grand Slam champion who spent 125 weeks as the world No. 1 between early 2022 and late 2024. She's the No. 8 seed at Wimbledon, but she's actually the world No. 4. Only three of the top seven players in the world are left in the draw.

That version of Świątek can appear on the Wimbledon grass, but to make it happen, she will have to win a battle between her two tennis selves that she has been conducting since late last year.

Świątek won the girls' singles title at the All England Club in 2018. Two years later, she won her first Grand Slam at the French Open. Two years after that, she won the 2022 U.S. Open, as well as the first of three consecutive French Opens.

But she also hasn't won a tournament since she won the last of those three, 13 months ago. She has only been to the second week of Wimbledon twice in five tries. But going off her first two matches here so far and her run to the finals at a warm-up event in Bad Homburg, Germany, Świątek has shown signs that she might be getting inside the tennis time machine she has been building the past few months. She is going back toward the player she was when she won the junior title here, the player she was during her ensuing climb to the top of the game.

That player floated up and down and all across court with a preternatural ease that veterans long for. She played with variety and spin, and happily worked her way through points instead of taking the biggest swing she could at first chance. She won points with cute angles and deft stop volleys. And when swinging hard wasn't working, her fallback plan was something other than swinging even harder.

That became eminently clear Thursday, after Świątek dropped the opening set to Caty McNally, an American qualifier and the world No. 125, on Centre Court. She ran away with the next two and the match, 5-7, 6-2, 6-1. She didn't do that by landing more first-strike bullets an inch in rather than a foot wide. She did it by firing fewer bullets.

Her first serve slowed down. When she was returning, she focused more on putting the ball back in play, often with a chip, rather than trying to crush it across the the court. During the first set she won just 12 of 25 points that stretched longer than four shots. During the next two sets she won 25 of 40. The same pattern occurred in her first match against Polina Kudermetova, when she won just five of 18 points longer than four shots during a tight first set, and seven of eight in the second. Her first serve slowed down slightly but became more effective in that match, too.

Perhaps more importantly, she had played that way to go 4-1 up against McNally in the set that she lost. Then she did what she has done in her worst losses in recent times: she reverted to the all-out aggressiveness that became ingrained in her tennis between 2022 and 2024. It made her the dominant player in the world and won her Grand Slam titles. It also stayed some of her development, largely hid the finesse that had helped to carry her to the top of the sport, and created a psychological problem.

When things get tight, players do what they know. What Świątek knew became hitting every ball as hard as possible. But when things get tight, things go wrong, and hitting a ball hard when things go wrong means missing, a lot.

Against McNally, she found that often elusive balance between raising her intensity while playing more methodical and patient tennis, as diametrically opposite as those two goals might appear at first glance.

“You can still raise your intensity and be patient and make smart decisions,” Świątek said after she prevailed.

“It just means that you're going to play these shots really 100 percent. But it doesn't mean that they need to be like crazy.”

Then, it appeared that Wimbledon would get real for Świątek. A matchup that would test whether she can stick with something closer to the older version of herself, the one that Wim Fissette, the well-regarded coach who has worked with her since the end of last year, has tried to bring back to the court.

In Danielle Collins, Świątek faced the player who took her apart in Rome on the red clay, her best surface, just two months ago. She pushed Świątek to the edge of her emotional danger zone, a place where she has spent a lot of time the past few months.

Collins hits a big ball, the kind that can send Świątek backpedaling, rushing her forehand. And there's some history, too. Collins, seemingly unjustifiably, ripped into Świątek for what she referred to as phoney sincerity when Collins had to retire during the third set of their quarterfinal at the Paris Olympics last summer.

Świątek said she had no idea what Collins was talking about, because they had barely spoken previously.

She was also desperate to hang around this tournament, which she loves more than any other.

“For a landscaper's daughter, you know, and coming from humble beginnings, I cherish it,” Collins said after her 6-4, 6-1 win over Veronika Erjavec, the Slovenian qualifier.

“It makes it even that more special. And you can see it when I'm out on court. Wimbledon is the happiest time of the year for me. I can barely sleep at night. I'm so excited to get in the car each morning and come here.”

Świątek did not let Collins hang around. She played the role of counterpuncher when it was the right thing to do, and played on the front foot when that was the right thing to do. She jammed Collins with fast body serves and started sliding second serves to her forehand, after the American pounced on a couple that didn't jump high enough. She moved the ball up and down and left and right, with the mastery that has defined her dominance on clay. The scoreline was 6-2, 6-3. It didn't really feel that close.

“I had some practices where the ball was listening to me … It's a new experience on grass,” she said in her on-court interview.

Świątek has never looked comfortable on the grass. That felt especially true the past three years when she won the French Open, which robbed her of time to prepare for the grass. Low sliding shots do make it hard for her to get her racket under the ball on her topspin-heavy forehand — just as Coco Gauff found out when she went out in the first round.

Last year, Świątek's first match on grass following her Roland Garros title was also her first match at Wimbledon. She only got to play three, losing in the third round to a redlining Yulia Putintseva. Then she lost in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open. Out went Tomasz Wiktorowski, who preached aggression from the baseline for three years. In came Fissette. He has steadily helped her to add more shape and patience to her tennis, which has in turn, at least at this tournament, started to reverse the notion that she is fundamentally not good on grass.

That notion already felt misplaced. Her win percentage is 72. That's hardly poor form. Her defeats as a seasoned tour player have come to a grass master of the upset (Alizé Cornet) a player playing the tournament of their life (Elina Svitolina) and Putintseva, who at one point hit one unforced error in 13 games.

But resisting a reversion to the baseline aggression when matches get stressful has remained a big challenge for Świątek. Its effect also gets magnified on grass, where sets can disappear in minutes and errors rack up more easily and quickly.  It's early days at Wimbledon and there are hard matches ahead even if she beats Collins. Elena Rybakina, the 2022 champion who has troubled her in the past, is out of the way, but her conqueror, No. 23 seed Clara Tauson, can also tee off.

It's still clear Świątek is thinking differently on the grass this time round, especially after her success in Germany, where she beat Jasmine Paolini, last year's Wimbledon finalist, and Ekaterina Alexandrova, a big hitter capable of causing problems, on her way to the final.

“You just have to get through some situations on the court, and it gives you the extra experience and kind of the momentum to go forward,” She said ahead of Wimbledon.

For Świątek, her game on the grass is a work in progress, as it is everywhere. Each year, she learns a few things through experience. But she is one of the best players in the world, an all-time great already, playing at a tournament where the all-time greats usually figure out a way to win. It's the tournament where historically the best players generally do the best, because they figure out how to play aggressively, but with control, because often controlling points can be more important than trying to win them at the first chance.

“It's still tricky,” she said.

“You really have to trust your shots on grass. You can't really pull back. Any shot that will give your opponent more time to go in is probably the shot that will make you lose the rally.”

Emma Raducanu may have sidestepped drama at last year's Wimbledon if the new U.S. Open rule had been in effect there.

The young British sensation faced criticism on the iconic grass courts for choosing to concentrate on her singles matches rather than team up with Andy Murray, the three-time Grand Slam champ, in what could have been his final shot at major success in the mixed doubles.

Murray was ousted from the men's singles by Stefanos Tsitsipas in round two and was beaten in the men's doubles with his brother Jamie, thanks to Australian pair Rinky Hijikata and John Peers. With Murray suggesting that it would be his last Wimbledon appearance, the mixed doubles with Raducanu represented his last hope of competing and winning.

Yet Raducanu, not fully fit, opted to focus solely on her singles campaign, bowing out from the partnership with Murray. Reflecting on her decision back then, Raducanu said: "It was a very difficult decision.

"Of course, I didn't want to take his last match away from him. But at the end of the day I think a lot of the players in a similar situation would have done the same thing, prioritising their body.

"I still stand by making the right call. Obviously he was disappointed because it's his last match. But, yeah, what a champion. I think that hopefully he'll play in the Olympics and have another farewell there."

Raducanu, who reached the fourth round of the tournament last year only to be defeated by Lulu Sun, has since extended an apology to Murray for any unintended tension, seeking to avoid any "bad blood." She said in January (via the Express): "Afterwards I sent him a long message basically apologising if I caused any trouble, I guess, at Wimbledon, that's definitely the last thing I want.

"He's someone that I've grown up looking up to and I don't want any bad blood or harsh feelings with him. I sent him a long message and he took it really well and responded saying he was disappointed but he understood."

Yet, had the new mixed doubles format introduced at this year's U.S. Open been available in London last summer, the entire situation may have been avoided. It was recently revealed that the mixed doubles competition at the final Grand Slam of the season will now occur separately from the main tournament.

While the U.S. Open is scheduled from August 25 to September 7, the mixed doubles portion of the Grand Slam will take place between August 19 and August 20, providing players ample time to recharge for the singles and doubles competitions. Had a similar timetable been implemented at Wimbledon 2024, Raducanu and Murray might have teamed up.

Murray ultimately bowed out at last year's Wimbledon following his doubles departure with Jamie, before competing in the Paris Olympics and officially retiring from the sport.

Meanwhile, Raducanu returned to the courts at SW19 this summer, defeating Mingge Xu and Marketa Vondrousova before falling to WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the third round on Friday.

Next month, she'll compete in the mixed doubles at the U.S. Open alongside ATP world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, with whom the British player shares a close friendship.

Emma Raducanu and Aryna Sabalenka put on a tennis clinic on Friday night as they battled it out for a place in the Wimbledon fourth round.

With the roof closed on Centre Court, Raducanu and Sabalenka provided two hours of relentless entertainment.

Saving seven set points in the first, Raducanu pushed the world number one to a tiebreaker, missing a set point of her own, as Sabalenka eventually took the lead 7-6 [8-6].

Not willing to let the opportunity slip through her fingers, Raducanu, spurred on by the passionate British fans, broke early in the second, as she looked to send the tie into a deciding set.

It wasn't to be, however, as the experience of Sabalenka prevailed, breaking twice late on to secure the win 7-6, 6-4.

The fans on Centre Court were disappointed to see their favorite, Raducanu, exit the tournament, but were more than satisfied with the action they saw.

Perhaps another Grand Slam tournament should take note, as the women put on a show on Friday evening.

One of the biggest stories at the French Open last month was the tournament organisers' refusal to schedule women's matches for the night session on Court Philippe Chatrier.

Despite having plenty of opportunities to let the stars of the WTA Tour shine, they insisted on having the men play instead.

Raducanu and Sabalenka's Wimbledon thriller arguably proved the French Open organisers wrong, as there's no doubt everyone departing Centre Court will have said they got their money's worth on Friday night.

However, while Wimbledon deserves credit for scheduling the women's match last, that's not to say there's been an even split at this year's Championships.

Just two women's matches (both featuring Raducanu) have been scheduled as the last match of the day on Centre Court in 2025.

With Novak Djokovic and Miomir Kecmanovic set to headline day six, the women will have been last on in just 33% of the matches at Wimbledon as the first week nears its end.

There is no doubt, however, that Wimbledon has done a better job than Roland Garros at sharing the spotlight.

But why don't the French Open organisers schedule women's matches for the Chatrier night sessions?

Roland Garros is unique in how they format their day and night sessions, compared to the other three Grand Slams.

Not only does their night session start later than the others, but it also features just one match, whereas the Australian Open, for example, often hosts two.

Therefore, the big worry for Roland Garros organisers is that if they schedule a women's match for the night session on Chatrier, it could finish quickly, leaving fans without a full evening's entertainment.

As the men play best-of-five sets, compared to the women playing best-of-three, their matches often last longer.

That isn't always the case, of course, as there have been several occasions where three-set women's matches outlast men's three-set matches.

If the French Open were to simply add another match to the night session, surely their problems would be solved, as they could rotate between scheduling a men's match one night and two women's matches the next.

However, it doesn't look like they'll be making a change anytime soon, as the men continue to get the nod at Roland Garros.

Emma Raducanu could have potentially avoided controversy after ditching Andy Murray in last year's mixed doubles at Wimbledon had a new US Open ruling have been in place at the time. The 22-year-old Briton found herself under fire on the courts of SW19 last year, when she opted to focus on the singles game rather than pairing up with three-time Grand Slam winner Murray in what was his final chance at major glory.

Murray had been knocked out of the men's singles by Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second round, and was omitted from the men's doubles alongside his brother, Jamie Murray, by Australian duo Rinky Hijikata and John Peers. Given that Murray had announced ahead of play that it would be his final outing at Wimbledon, the mixed doubles alongside Raducanu came as his last hope of redemption. However, Raducanu – whose fitness wasn't at 100 per cent – decided that she would rather put all of her attention into her own singles tournament than use energy elsewhere, withdrawing from participation alongside Murray.

Speaking about her choice at the time, Raducanu said: "It was a very difficult decision. Of course, I didn't want to take his last match away from him.

"But at the end of the day I think a lot of the players in a similar situation would have done the same thing, prioritising their body. I still stand by making the right call.

"Obviously he was disappointed because it's his last match. But, yeah, what a champion. I think that hopefully he'll play in the Olympics and have another farewell there."



Raducanu made it through to the fourth round of the tournament last year, where she was bested by Lulu Sun, and she has since apologised to Murray for her decision to avoid any "bad blood." She later explained in January this year: "Afterwards I sent him a long message basically apologising if I caused any trouble, I guess, at Wimbledon, that's definitely the last thing I want.

"He's someone that I've grown up looking up to and I don't want any bad blood or harsh feelings with him. I sent him a long message and he took it really well and responded saying he was disappointed but he understood."

However, controversy could have been avoided completely had a new format for the mixed doubles game at this year's US Open been in place in London last summer. That's because it was recently announced that the mixed pairs at the final Grand Slam of the year will take place away from the main event.

While the US Open will run between August 25 and September 7, the mixed doubles of the Grand Slam will run between August 19 and August 20, giving players plenty of time to re-energise for the singles and doubles events. And should a similar schedule have taken place at Wimbledon 2024, Raducanu and Murray may well have played alongside one another.

Murray ultimately bowed out of last year's Wimbledon after his doubles exit alongside Jamie, playing at the Paris Olympics before officially retiring from the sport.

Raducanu, meanwhile, was back in action at SW19 this summer, dispatching of Mingge Xu and Marketa Vondrousova before she was bested by WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in Friday's third round.

She'll be battling at the mixed doubles next month in the US alongside world No.2 Carlos Alcaraz, who the Brit has a strong friendship with.

Aryna Sabalenka continues to impress at Wimbledon as she looks to win her maiden title in 2025.

The Belarusian beat Carson Branstine and Marie Bouzkova to advance to the third round at Wimbledon, where she met home favorite Emma Raducanu.

Playing some of the best tennis of her life, Raducanu pushed Sabalenka close on Centre Court, narrowly falling to defeat 6-7 [6-8], 4-6.

After the match, Sabalenka thanked the crowd for their support, admitting she tried to convince herself that they were cheering for her.

Going into further detail, Sabalenka compared the crowds at Wimbledon to those at the US Open during her post-match press conference.

Speaking to the media, Sabalenka gave her verdict on the crowds at Wimbledon and the US Open.

“The crowd. I mean, I played enough in the [United] States against Americans, and there it's like super crazy,” she said.

“Honestly, I'm super grateful that people were respectful and really polite during the points, and even though they were cheering for her between the points, during the point, I was able to focus, and they were really polite once again.

“So I think that really helped me to stay in the game and to be there, to fight for every point, and I'm super happy that I was able to be that focused.”

Sabalenka needed to stay focused as she fought off Raducanu, who was inspired by the fans on Centre Court.

Taking the time to praise Raducanu, Sabalenka assessed her performance in their third-round match.

“She played an incredible level,” said Sabalenka.

There was little to separate the pair on Friday evening, as the Belarusian picked up the victory, having won just seven more points than her British opponent.

Sabalenka will now turn her attention to the fourth round and a clash with Elise Mertens, her former doubles partner.

The US Open and Australian Open-winning teammates will battle it out for a place in the quarterfinals on Sunday, July 6.

Sabalenka highlighted the role a home crowd can play at Grand Slam tournaments for ‘away' players, but how has she fared at the four majors?

In total, Sabalenka has played 13 matches against players at their home Grand Slam events, winning 11.

Aryna Sabalenka's record: 7-1 (88%)

Sabalenka may have experienced some ‘crazy' atmospheres over the years, but she rarely lets them get the better of her.

On just two occasions has Sabalenka lost to a player competing at their home Grand Slam, to Ash Barty at the 2018 Australian Open and to Coco Gauff in the 2023 US Open final.

Only time will tell if Sabalenka can keep up her impressive record, but it will certainly be worth looking out for when the 2025 US Open begins on Sunday, August 24.

Day 5 at Wimbledon—the July 4th holiday in the States—looked a lot like the tournament's first four days.The sun kept shining. At least one fan needed medical attention, and a helpful bottle of water from a player. A top-tier contender—in this case, No. 6 seed Madison Keys—was sent packing. And Taylor Fritz played tennis. The American's fourth straight day on court resulted in his third win, and the first that didn't require five sets.There was a lot more, of course; we're not halfway home yet, and singles matches are still strewn around the grounds. Here are three takeaways from the first Friday.

There was a lot more, of course; we're not halfway home yet, and singles matches are still strewn around the grounds. Here are three takeaways from the first Friday.

It's been a weird year for the WTA's No. 1 player.In some ways, it has been Sabalenka's best and most consistent season. She's 45-8, has won three titles, reached both Slam finals, and put herself 4,000 points ahead of everyone else.In other ways, it has been her most disappointing. Despite leaving everyone else in the rankings dust, she has lost the two matches that mattered most, in the Australian Open and Roland Garros finals, to opponents she was heavily favored to beat, Madison Keys and Coco Gauff, 6-4 in the third set each time.On Friday, Sabalenka was faced with another dangerous moment at a major, against another player she was favored to beat. The match wasn't a final, and the opponent, Emma Raducanu, was only ranked 40th. But it wasn't her ranking that struck fear into Sabalenka's heart. It was the fact that she was the home favorite.“Facing British at Wimbledon, I'm not sure I prefer that,” Sabalenka admitted, when she was asked about the prospect of playing Raducanu.

Sabalenka has had her issues with partisan crowds before, and she was right to worry about this one. Raducanu came out revved up and firing, and the Centre Court fans responded, their roars bouncing off the roof above. The Brit broke early, served for the first set, and reached set point in the tiebreaker. Sabalenka was again playing rattled, trying for too much, missing balls she would never miss in any other situation. As always, her exasperated facial expressions told the story of the match.So what did Sabalenka do then? She tried, and made, two difficult drop shots.Serving at 5-6 in the tiebreaker, she seemed to be reeling. She had just lost two points, and failed to capitalize on other easy chances. Was she going to let her surroundings unravel her again? At 5-6, when she went for a backhand drop, it looked like a panic move, and the ball seemed to be heading for the net. But when it cleared it by an inch, and bounced twice before a stunned Raducanu, Sabalenka looked like a genius.Two points later, up 7-6, with her own set point, Sabalenka repeated herself. Reaching high for a forehand volley at net, she dropped it jut over the net for another touch winner. The crowd was quieted at last.Sabalenka said she had found a way—possibly borrowed from Novak Djokovic—to use the audience to her advantage.“I was trying to trick my brain, and I was pretending that people were cheering for me,” she said. “Sometimes when they were screaming ‘Emma,' it sounded like ‘Aryna.'”“I think that's why I wasn't really getting, like, annoyed by that.”

Hall of Famer Analysis + Match Highlights: It's Wimbledon Primetime, on Tennis Channel.

The second set followed the same pattern. Again, Raducanu broke early. Again, the audience backed her. Again, she threatened to run away with it, this time earning a break point for 5-1. But again, Sabalenka found a way back.The shot that stuck out for me came with Raducanu serving at 4-2, down break point. Sabalenka had missed numerous returns on break points. This time she aimed her backhand down the line with pace, but also with plenty of margin, and finished the point from there. Unlike at Roland Garros, she found the balance of power and control when she needed to.Afterward, Sabalenka referenced her meltdown in Paris.“I was just keep telling myself, ‘No, you just cannot let it happen again. Whatever happens on the court, you just have to be respectful, you have to be calm.'”“I'm super happy that I was able to be that focused.”This time she faced the fans, the moment, the crowd, and found her best.

Say hello to the second week 👋🤩Anisimova books her spot in the fourth round with a 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 win over Dalma Galfi.#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/rHUxY4RIax

Each time Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova set up to serve, she—along with everyone else inside Court 2—could hear a pair of loud smacks coming from the other side of the court. That was the sound of Naomi Osaka's left hand slapping her left thigh, hard. This would have been distracting to most players, but Pavlyuchenkova seemed too dialed in to let it bother her.At the same time over on Court 3, Amanda Anisimova was also making a noise that could have been bothersome to an opponent: After hitting a winning shot, she would emit a higher-pitched shriek than I'd ever heard from her; something in the ear-splitting range of the “Pojd!” that Petra Kvitova made famous. Anisimova's foe, Dalma Galfi, gestured across the net after a couple of these shrieks. It was hard to tell if she was annoyed by them, but it wouldn't have been a surprise.Anisimova and Osaka, as anyone could hear, were playing with a little bit of extra desperation. That's because both of them were in the second quarter of the women's draw, a section that had already lost its three highest seeds. That means there's a major opportunity for a surprise player to make the semifinals; before Friday, Anisimova and Osaka were the best-known of the bunch that remained.

But as their results showed, desperation will only get you so far.Anisimova and Osaka are both among the streakiest players in tennis. When they connect, it's a winner; when they don't, it's an error. And you never know which is going to happen from one match—or set, or game, or swing—to the next. Not surprisingly, each won one the first set and lost the second.In the end, their results may have come down to who they were playing.Anisimova's opponent, Dalma Galfi, has never been ranked higher than No. 79; Osaka's opponent, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, has been in the Top 10 and reached a major final.In the final set of Anisimova's match, Galfi's mid-pace shots were feeding into the American's more powerful strokes. Credit to Anisimova for finding her range at the right time.

Pavlyuchenkova, by contrast, was strong enough to create her own winning shots when she needed them. Serving at 4-4 in the second set, Pavlyuchenkova went down double break point—possibly one point from defeat. She responded with an ace and a service winner. At 3-3 in the third, Pavlyuchenkova faced another break point; Osaka had just won three straight games, and was threatening to pull ahead. This time, Pavlyuchenkova took a full swing at the first backhand she saw and fired it into the far corner for a winner. It was enough to make Osaka look across at her in disbelief and anguish.“I feel a little bit of pressure because obviously you feel like the opportunity is there,” said Anisimova, who will play Linda Noskova in the round of 16. “I keep reminding myself to just focus on the present, just take it one match at a time.”For Osaka, whose chance was gone, the emotions were obviously very different—or even non-existent.“I'm just going to be a negative human being today,” she said. “[After losing] in Paris I was very emotional. Now I don't feel anything, so I guess I'd prefer to feel nothing than everything.”

Tennis players have to deal with all sorts of injuries and ailments, from their knees to their backs to their hips to their minds. But their ears?You only have to ask Nicolas Jarry how brutal an ear issue can be. Last year he was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, an inner ear inflammation that causes vertigo and balance problems.“I had the issue which affected my perception, my balance, and I've been trying to come back and recover," an emotional Jarry said after his four-set win over Joao Fonseca. “It's been physically, emotionally and psychologically very tough.”

“I had the issue which affected my perception, my balance, and I've been trying to come back and recover," an emotional Jarry said after his four-set win over Joao Fonseca. “It's been physically, emotionally and psychologically very tough.”

If his six wins at this year's Wimbledon—three in qualifying, three in the main draw—are any evidence, the ordeal has only made the 6-foot-7 Chilean tougher and hungrier at 29.He came from two sets down to beat No. 8 seed Holger Rune in the first round. He made quick work of a potentially tricky opponent in Learner Tien. And he held off a fierce comeback bid from Fonseca and his Brazilian faithful on Friday.In the fourth set, Jarry saved three break points in two different service games. In the tiebreaker, he went down 2-4, before blazing through the last five points with a string of brilliant shots, including a second serve ace.

The win puts Jarry, who is the grandson of former player Jaime Fillol, into the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time.“I came here with him when I was 10 years old and 11,” he says of Fillol. “Since then, I'm in love with this tournament. Every match that I win here makes me stay a couple more days in the tournament, and that makes me very happy.”Jarry, with his strong serve and forehand, could be a tough out going forward. Next for him is Cam Norrie, and after that, possibly, Carlos Alcaraz.

Leclerc left fuming after qualifying P6 at Silverstone

Watch Verstappen struggle in FP1 to claim pole position in qualifying

Max Verstappen claimed an impressive pole position in Qualifying for the British Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver getting the better of the McLaren pair.

Max Verstappen has clinched pole position at the British Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver storming through with a stunning lap to put himself at the front of the grid ahead of the McLarens of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris.

While Piastri had secured provisional pole during the first runs of Q3, the Australian made a mistake on his final effort and could not improve. But Verstappen put his lap together perfectly to go fastest on an effort of 1m 24.892s, putting himself 0.103s clear of Piastri's McLaren.

The other papaya car of Lando Norris will start from third, the Briton also unable to better his previous time on his last flying lap. George Russell followed for Mercedes in fourth, while Lewis Hamilton wound up in fifth, despite the Ferrari driver being Piastri's closest challenger in the first runs.

Hamilton's team mate Charles Leclerc claimed sixth, with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli taking seventh ahead of Ollie Bearman in eighth, though the Haas driver will start near the back of the field thanks to a 10-place grid penalty for a red flag infringement in third practice.

Fernando Alonso put his Aston Martin in ninth place, while Pierre Gasly was an impressive 10th at the wheel of the Alpine.

Qualifying results

FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2025

Williams had a disappointing day, with Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon both exiting Q2 in P11 and P14 respectively. It was also another tough outing for Yuki Tsunoda, who found himself down in P12 for Red Bull.

Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar took 13th place, with the Haas of Esteban Ocon the final car to miss out on the top 10 shootout in 15th.

There was drama in Q1 when Alpine's Franco Colapinto spun off into the barriers at the final corner, bringing out the red flags and leaving the Argentinian driver down in P20.

Also eliminated in the first segment of Qualifying – which saw the whole field barring Colapinto covered by just six-tenths – were Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson in 16th, the Kick Sauber duo of Gabriel Bortoleto and Nico Hulkenberg in 17th and 19th respectively and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll between them in 18th.

After three busy practice sessions – each featuring a different driver at the top of the timesheets – it was time for Saturday's highly-anticipated Qualifying session. Russell clinched pole at home in 2024, but who would put themselves at the front of the grid this time around?

Bortoleto was the first to hit the track as the green light signalled the start of Q1, the Kick Sauber team having repaired the car in time following the Brazilian's spin into the gravel during FP3. Conditions looked to be dry, but Gasly hinted at a change as he radioed in to report “some drizzle”.

As the rest of the pack started to emerge – all sporting the C4 soft tyres – Piastri went fastest during the early runs, his lap of 1m 26.002s putting him 0.039s clear of Verstappen in second and Alonso in third.

There was drama with just over eight minutes remaining as Colapinto had a moment at the final corner and spun into the barriers, bringing out the yellow flags. The Alpine driver initially got going again before then pulling off the track again near the pit exit, resulting in a red flag being thrown to allow for the Argentine's car to be recovered.

When the session resumed with six minutes and 49 seconds remaining, the drivers at risk were Bortoleto, Ocon, Hulkenberg, the stricken Colapinto and Gasly, with Tsunoda on the bubble in 15th place – while leader Piastri stated that the drops of rain seemed “worse than before”.

Albon improved to climb up to third, while Verstappen and Piastri swapped fastest laps at the top of the timesheets. Elsewhere Hamilton and Leclerc looked to potentially be at risk in P11 and P13, with Hamilton told that he did not have enough fuel remaining for another lap.

Leclerc went on to move himself up to ninth, while Hamilton was pushed to 14th but stayed out of the elimination zone and Sainz climbed to eighth. Others were not so lucky, however; Lawson exited in 16th, a contrast from his sixth place on the grid last time out in Austria.

The Kick Saubers of Bortoleto and Hulkenberg exited in P17 and P19 respectively, with Stroll sandwiched between them in P18 while the aforementioned Colapinto ended the segment in P20 following his accident. Colapinto aside, the entire field was covered by just six-tenths in an incredibly close Q1.

Knocked out: Lawson, Bortoleto, Stroll, Hulkenberg, Colapinto

After an initially quiet start, Verstappen led the field out as Q2 got underway at Silverstone. The Dutchman soon went fastest on a 1m 25.316s – before Piastri incredibly set the exact same time, going into P2 given that he set his time after Verstappen.

More was to come though from Norris, who beat both drivers by 0.085s to go to the top, a welcome sight to the fans watching on in his grandstand. Further back, Hamilton, Antonelli, Leclerc, Gasly and Tsunoda were the names at risk in the bottom five, all of whom had sported used tyres on their first runs.

Alonso, meanwhile, was left unimpressed after encountering a slow-moving Antonelli, the two-time World Champion calling the incident “crazy” before suggesting that the Italian – who already has a three-place grid drop from his Lap 1 crash in Austria – would receive a penalty.

As the segment entered its final minutes, everybody was back out on track in an effort to improve and get themselves into the top 10 shootout. The Scuderia cars bolted on fresh rubber for this run, enabling Leclerc to initially go fastest but Hamilton stormed to the head of the timesheets on a 1m 25.084s, just under five-hundredths clear of his team mate.

Despite moving up to 10th, Tsunoda found himself pushed down the order as others bettered their times, dropping the Red Bull driver down to 12th. Williams also faced disappointment as Sainz and Albon exited in 11th and 14th respectively, with a downbeat Albon reporting: “We made it difficult for ourselves.” Also out were Hadjar in P13 and Ocon in P15.

Knocked out: Sainz, Tsunoda, Hadjar, Albon, Ocon

After an action-packed build-up, attentions turned to the top 10 shootout at Silverstone, with the Ferrari, McLaren and Mercedes duos joined by Verstappen, Alonso, Gasly and Bearman, though the latter would drop down the order thanks to a 10-place grid penalty from a red flag infringement in FP3.

As the first laps went on the board, Piastri secured provisional pole position by pumping in a 1m 24.995s, while Hamilton proved to be his nearest challenger on a lap 0.135s adrift of the Australian. The other McLaren of Norris was third, with Verstappen and Leclerc following behind.

With the clock ticking down, the time arrived for the decisive final runs. Could Piastri hold on to score his fifth P1 grid slot of the year, or might Hamilton add a record eighth pole position at Silverstone to his name – and his first in general since the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix?

Piastri looked to be improving, but a mistake on his lap meant that the Australian could not better his previous lap. The likes of Norris, Hamilton and Leclerc were also unable to make improvements – but Verstappen put together a sublime lap to grab pole position, the Red Bull man going quickest thanks to his effort of 1m 24.892s.

This put him 0.103s clear of Piastri, while Norris had to settle for third. Russell moved up the order to take fourth, pushing Hamilton and Leclerc down to fifth and sixth respectively, while Antonelli claimed seventh, though the Italian will drop down three places after receiving a penalty last time out in Austria.

Bearman slotted into eighth but, like Antonelli, will not keep his original position owing to a grid drop, the Haas driver moving down 10 places. Alonso and Gasly, meanwhile, rounded out the top 10.

"It was tricky out there with the wind," said Verstappen. "Throughout the whole of Qualifying it was shifting around a bit, and around here with these cars they are extremely sensitive to it. Just tried to tidy it up throughout Qualifying and that final lap was good enough. This is a proper track in Qualifying, where you have to go flat-out on all these corners, you have to be really committed and that's really enjoyable."

The 2025 British Grand Prix is set to begin at 1500 local time on Sunday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action from Silverstone.

Charles Leclerc topped the third and final practice session ahead of the British Grand Prix, which was disrupted by two red flags.

Charles Leclerc topped the third and final practice session ahead of the British Grand Prix, as the top three drivers were covered by less than one-tenth of a second.

The Ferrari driver posted a 1m 25.498s in much cooler conditions than Friday, which left him just 0.068s clear of Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen a further 0.019s back.

Drivers were unable to improve in the final moments at Silverstone following two red flags in quick succession, the first due to debris heading into Stowe that thwarted Lewis Hamilton's best effort as the Ferrari driver finished outside the top 10.

The second stoppage came at the very end of the one-hour session, Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto losing control through Maggotts and Becketts and finishing in the gravel with suspension damage, while Haas' Ollie Bearman hit the barrier on the entry to the pits.

Ollie Bearman has been hit with a grid penalty following a red flag infringement during third and final practice at Silverstone.

Ollie Bearman has been handed a 10-place grid penalty for the British Grand Prix following a red flag infringement during the weekend's third and final practice hour.

The session had already proven eventful for Bearman, the Haas driver earlier sparking a red flag after losing a piece of bodywork from his car out on track which resulted in the marshals having to retrieve the part.

But there was worse to come for the Briton when a second red flag was thrown in the latter stages owing to Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto spinning off and becoming beached in the gravel.

As he headed into the pit lane, Bearman had a spin of his own and hit the barriers, losing the front wing from his VF-25 in the process.

With the incident happening under red flag conditions, it was subsequently investigated by the stewards who opted to hand the 20-year-old a grid drop of 10 places for Sunday's race.

A document released following the stewards' hearing reads: “Car 87 had slowed down for the red flag and as he was approaching Turn 15 accelerated significantly to race pace and entered the pit entry road at 260kph. He lost control of the car in the pit entry road and crashed into the barriers.

“Art. 37.6 (a) of the Formula One Sporting Regulations and Art. 2.5.4.1(b) of Appendix H of the International Sporting Code require that when a red flag is shown ‘all cars must immediately reduce speed and proceed slowly back to the pit lane'.

“It is beyond doubt that the driver of Car 87 did not proceed slowly back to the pit lane when he accelerated to simulate entering into the pit entry road under race conditions.

“In fact, we looked at a previous in-lap under normal racing conditions and found that he was faster in this lap, under a red flag.

“To make matters worse, he lost control of the car and crashed into the barriers while at speed. The driver informed us that he misjudged the fact that his brakes were not warm because the lap was done slowly, due to the red flag.

“While this may have been a factor contributing to the crash, we did not consider it to be a mitigating factor.”

As well as the grid penalty, Bearman has also received four penalty points, bringing the total on his licence up to eight.

The British driver is competing in his first home Grand Prix as an F1 driver, with last year's event at Silverstone being where the youngster's deal to race for Haas in 2025 was announced.

							By 

	Naomi LaChance



	President Donald Trump's administration deported eight immigrants to South Sudan, a dangerous country where most of the men have no ties, the Department of Homeland Security said Saturday. 


	The Friday night deportations come after two federal judges refused to block the move, citing recent rulings by the Supreme Court. The State Department warns Americans not to visit South Sudan “due to continued security threats.” 


	“These sickos will be in South Sudan by Independence Day,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement on Thursday, calling it a “win for the rule of law, safety and security of the American people.”


	Some of the immigrants, who were shown in a photo shackled by their hands and feet and surrounded by guards in an airplane, are from Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam. One of the men, Dian Peter Domach, is a citizen of South Sudan, according to DHS. The agency says the immigrants were convicted of crimes including murder, kidnapping, and sexual assault. The men had been held in a shipping container at a military base in Djibouti since May as they awaited court decisions. ABC News reported the news of their deportations to South Sudan Saturday morning. 

	











	The deportations are a major win for Trump, who has made cruel treatment of immigrants a hallmark of his administration. He previously deported hundreds of Venezuelan men to a notorious prison in El Salvador without due process, and illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia there as well. The Trump administration complied with a Supreme Court order to bring Abrego Garcia back to America last month to face new criminal charges in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia recently described experiencing severe beatings and psychological torture, including sleep deprivation, while he was incarcerated in El Salvador. 

	











	While the Supreme Court issued rulings demanding the Trump administration respect immigrants' right to due process and undo Abrego Garcia's unlawful deportation to El Salvador, the court's conservative supermajority recently greenlit the president's efforts to send immigrants to third countries, or countries that are not their own.

	The State Department tells Americans not to visit South Sudan “due to crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.” It adds: “Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings are common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.” 


	However, the Supreme Court, with little explanation, lifted an injunction from Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts that had prohibited the administration from deporting the men to South Sudan. The court clarified its previous decision on the matter Thursday. 


	“What the government wants to do, concretely, is send the eight noncitizens it illegally removed from the United States from Djibouti to South Sudan, where they will be turned over to the local authorities without regard for the likelihood that they will face torture or death,” liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent. “Because ‘“the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law” in the context of removal proceedings,' the government's no-notice removals are undoubtedly illegal. In simple terms, the government requests that the court remove an obstacle to its achieving those unlawful ends.”


	On Friday, Murphy denied an emergency appeal from the men's lawyers to block their deportations. They argued the deportations were “impermissibly punitive” and their clients are likely to face torture.

	Murphy wrote that the Supreme Court's second ruling on this topic tied his hands. “This court interprets these Supreme Court orders as binding on this new petition,” he wrote.


	“It is deeply troubling that the Supreme Court's procedural ruling prevented a court from addressing the real fact that these deportations are unconstitutionally punitive,” Trina Realmuto, an attorney for the National Immigration Litigation Alliance who represented the men, told The New York Times. 


	U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss in Washington, D.C. had ordered the deportation to be temporarily paused earlier on Friday afternoon while transferring the case to Murphy.

	“It seems to me almost self-evident that the United States government cannot take human beings and send them to circumstances in which their physical wellbeing is at risk simply either to punish them or send a signal to others,” Moss said at the hearing.


	This should, indeed, be self-evident — but that's not the America we live in now.

He started his law career later in life after serving in the Coast Guard for ten years. As he looks toward making partner, his proximity to Jax becomes imperative to his success.

			Watch on Deadline		







Reasonable Doubt centers on Los Angeles-based high-powered criminal defense attorney Jacqueline “Jax” Stewart (Emayatzy Corinealdi) as she deals with past traumas, a struggling marriage, motherhood and a murder case while trying to keep her life together.


	After a tumultuous season of fighting to save her best friend from a life sentence while healing from her own deadly affair, Jax Stewart has finally earned some peace in her life … even if she sees it all as a little boring. So, when Ozzie (Bary), a former child star, finds himself in a heap of trouble, Jax seizes the opportunity to spice up her daily routine. 


	But when Ozzie's personal life turns out to have all the drama and danger of a Hollywood movie and Jax's professional future comes under threat from a charismatic associate at her firm, can she clear her client's name without losing the personal and professional successes she's worked so hard for?


	The returning series regular cast also includes McKinley Freeman, Tim Jo, Victor Rasuk and Angela Grovey. Morris Chestnut will come back as Corey Cash, alongside Rumer Willis, Brandee Evans, Richard Brooks, April Parker Jones, Keith Arthur Bolden and Arkeisha “Kash Doll” Knight.

	











Reasonable Doubt is created, written and executive produced by Raamla Mohamed. Kerry Washington executive-produces alongside Pilar Savone for Simpson Street, Larry Wilmore via Wilmore Films, Anton Cropper and Lena Cordina. Shawn Holley, Jon Leshay, Tamara Gregory, Erika Harrison and Zahir McGhee serve as co-executive producers. The series hails from Onyx Collective and is produced by 20th Television, a part of Disney Television Studios.

Kelly Clarkson postponed her Las Vegas residency hours before its first show Friday as the singer revealed that preparing for the shows has “taken a toll on my voice.”


	The singer and daytime talk show host was scheduled to begin her Studio Sessions residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on July 4th. However, hours before showtime Friday, Clarkson posted on social media that both of this weekend's opening gigs were off.


	“We have been working 24/7 to make Studio Sessions the most intimate and extraordinary experience with and for my incredible fans. I am beyond grateful that you always show up for me and I am devastated to have to postpone tonight and tomorrow's opening at Caesars,” Clarkson wrote.  

A post shared by Kelly Clarkson (@kellyclarkson)


	“The prep and rehearsals have taken a toll on my voice. I want the shows to be perfect for y'all and I need to protect myself from doing serious damage so I am taking this weekend and next week to rest up so that we can deliver what you all deserve. The show is truly incredible.   The musicians and singers are outstanding, and I want us all to start out strong.”

	











	Clarkson is hopeful that the vocal issues are only temporary, as she's already aiming to open the residency next weekend. “I can't wait to be back next weekend and show y'all what we've been working on,” she added.

	Clarkson is no stranger to Vegas, having previously held a residency at PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. That show ran from 2023 to 2024. The singer has not gone on a proper tour since 2019, which was in support of her 2017 album Meaning of Life.

	











	“We're bringing the studio to the stage this time with ‘Studio Sessions,'” Clarkson previously said of the residency when it was announced back in February. The residency is slated to run through August 16, with encore dates scheduled for November; it's unclear when the postponed dates will be rescheduled.

Kelly Clarkson has postponed the holiday weekend opener of her Las Vegas residency, titled Kelly Clarkson: Studio Sessions, at the Colosseum Theater at Caesars Palace hours before the show was scheduled as a safeguard measure against “serious damage” to her vocal cords.


	“We have been working 24/7 to make Studio Sessions the most intimate and extraordinary experience with and for my incredible fans,” the powerhouse vocalist began in an Instagram post shared yesterday. “I am beyond grateful that you always show up for me and I am devastated to have to postpone tonight and tomorrow's opening at Caesars.”

	“The prep and rehearsals have taken a toll on my voice,” the three-time Grammy winner continued. “I want the shows to be perfect for y'all and I need to protect myself from doing serious damage so I am taking this weekend and next week to rest up so that we can deliver what you all deserve. The show is truly incredible. The musicians and singers are outstanding, and I want us all to start out strong.”


	She concluded, “I can't wait to be back next weekend and show y'all what we've been working on.”


	Aside from her residency, The Kelly Clarkson Show host will soon debut four-episode specials Songs & Stories with Kelly Clarkson, set to arrive on NBC in the late summer, featuring conversations with Gloria Estefan, Jonas Brothers, Lizzo and Teddy Swims.

Sorry doesn't cut it cancelling just hours before show. Fans have invested a lot of money to come to Vegas to see the show, and will have to do that again for make up performances.  These VERY highly paid artists should have to compensate their fans with far more than an apology. There should be some kind of insurance for these last minute cancellations.

Cancelling on the day of the first show in Vegas is becoming a common thing with the younger generation of singers (Mariah Carey, Adele, and now Kelly).

Celine Dion postponed the opening of her new show at Resort World, so there goes your theory.

Mariah Carey is almost 60. What are you talking about.

	The AI band The Velvet Sundown, who currently have over 900,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, have officially admitted — in a new revision to their Spotify bio — what was obvious to experts and non-experts alike: their music is, in fact, AI-generated. 


	“The Velvet Sundown is a synthetic music project guided by human creative direction, and composed, voiced, and visualized with the support of artificial intelligence,” the band bio now reads. “This isn't a trick — it's a mirror. An ongoing artistic provocation designed to challenge the boundaries of authorship, identity, and the future of music itself in the age of AI.”The “band” went viral and attracted extensive media coverage after emerging out of nowhere in June and appearing on popular Spotify playlists. They also inspired an apparent hoaxer, using the name Andrew Frelon, who now says he impersonated the band on X and falsely claimed to be a spokesperson for the band in interactions with the media, including a phone interview with Rolling Stone. His elaborate, days-long hoax was aimed at testing the media, he claimed in a lengthy Medium post.

	The Spotify bio goes on to say, “All characters, stories, music, voices and lyrics are original creations generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence tools employed as creative instruments. Any resemblance to actual places, events or persons – living or deceased – is purely coincidental and unintentional. Not quite human. Not quite machine. The Velvet Sundown lives somewhere in between.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Glenn McDonald, a former “data alchemist” for Spotify, told Rolling Stone earlier this week that The Velvet Sundown's popularity there is likely because the streaming service now accepts payments to boost playlist placement, while also increasingly moving away from human-driven playlist selections toward algorithms that “can pick songs for recommendations based on characteristics of their audio.”

Alyssa Milano shared a moving remembrance to Julian McMahon following his death, writing in a lengthy tribute post that he was “more than my TV husband” and a “dear friend” who supported her professionally and personally throughout their time on The WB's long-running fantasy drama Charmed.


	“I'm heartbroken,” she began. “Julian McMahon was magic. That smile. That laugh. That talent. That presence. He walked into a room and lit it up—not just with charisma, but with kindness. With mischief. With soulful understanding.”


	Milano portrayed one of three powerful witchy Halliwell sisters alongside co-stars Holly Marie Combs and the late Shannen Doherty throughout the series' run from 1998-2006, and in Seasons 3 through 5, her character Phoebe has a turbulent relationship with McMahon's Cole Turner, a half-human and half-demon.

					Julian McMahon Dies: 'Nip/Tuck', 'Fantastic Four', 'FBI: Most Wanted' Star Was 56		
			








	“We spent years together on Charmed—years of scenes, stories, and so many in-between moments. He made me feel safe as an actor. Seen as a woman. He challenged me, teased me, supported me. We were so different, and yet somehow we always understood each other,” she wrote, alongside photos and selfies of the two throughout the years.


	“Julian was more than my TV husband. He was a dear friend. The kind who checks in. The kind who remembers. The kind who shares. The kind who tells you the truth, even when it's uncomfortable—but always with love,” Milano continued.


	The actress concluded that her thoughts are with McMahon's family.

	











	“My heart is with Kelly, with Madison, and with Iliana—his girls, his world. He adored them. You could feel it in every conversation, every story, every text. He was a family man above all, and he loved deeply. Losing him feels unreal. Too soon. Too unfair. Rest, my friend. I'll carry your laugh with me. Forever Cole. Forever Julian. 🕊️💔”


	Aside from Charmed, McMahon is known for his starring roles in Nip/Tuck, FBI: Most Wanted and the 2000s Fantastic Four movies. He died July 2 in Clearwater, Fla. from a private battle with cancer. Following the news of his death, tributes poured in from loved ones and co-stars, including fellow Charmed actors Marie Combs and Rose McGowan.

	More to come throughout the weekend.


PREVIOUS, THURSDAY: Universal/Amblin Entertainment's Jurassic World Rebirth delivered a strong overseas start on Wednesday with $26M from 38 international box office markets, including some previews. Combined with domestic's $30.5M Wednesday, the global running total is $56.5M through Day One.


	In total, JWR will be out in 82 offshore markets this weekend with Japan joining in August. 


	International rollout began on Tuesday in Hong Kong to capitalize on the Special Administrative Region Establishment Day holiday, coming in with $600K — the single biggest day for a studio title since Deadpool & Wolverine‘s opening Saturday, and the biggest MPA opening of the year to-date. The Scarlett Johansson-starrer ranked as a clear No. 1 for the day, with a 44% market share.


	On Wednesday, China delivered the biggest launch day for a studio movie in the market this year at $9.9M. Opening on 65,000 screens in the market, including 760 Imax, the Gareth Edwards-directed adventure took a massive 64% share at No. 1. This is also the biggest studio opening day since Godzilla x Kong's Friday debut in March 2024 and the 2nd biggest MPA single-day gross of 2025, only behind Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning‘s first Sunday, which fell during the Dragon Boat Festival national holidays at release.


	On Thursday, China added a further $5.6M (not included in the offshore/global totals above), reaching $15.5M so far and continuing to dominate in a competitive market with a 50% market share at No. 1. 


	The Jurassic movies have been popular in China, with the recent titles grossing nearly $650M combined (unadjusted). The Rebirth team including Edwards, Johansson, Rupert Friend and Jonathan Bailey visited Shanghai for a premiere last Sunday – a promotional move that's become far less frequent since the pandemic. Jurassic also has a dedicated section at the Universal Beijing Resort.


	Meanwhile, Korea also opened yesterday, scoring the biggest Wednesday debut of the year at $1M and the 2nd biggest non-holiday opening day of 2025 after Bong Joon-ho's Mickey 17. The market grossed another $700K today (early estimate, not included in overall international and global totals above) and still a clear No. 1 with $1.7M through today.


	Other Wednesday debuts include the UK & Ireland with $2.7M, accounting for 56% of the market at No. 1. The performance is just off Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom‘s opening Wednesday, above Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and above Spider-Man: Homecoming. Relative to other 2025 tentpoles, this is more than double Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning and 72% above F1. 












Mexico debuted to $2.1M in wide Wednesday previews, taking a 67% market share for the day. Comparing to like-for-like wide Wednesday previews, this is above Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and aligned with Thor: Love and Thunder. 


Spain grossed $1.6M on Wednesday at a clear No. 1 with a 41% share. The launch is the second best opening day for any installment of the Jurassic World saga: above Fallen Kingdom and Dominion and just below Jurassic World, which opened on a standard Friday. This result was also the highest-grossing Wednesday of the year and the 3rd highest grossing day of 2025 (only behind Lilo & Stitch and Minecraft). 


Germany grossed $1.1M on Wednesday, taking a 52% market share at No.1, on what was the hottest day of the year so far. This is the biggest opening day of 2025, ahead of Lilo and Minecraft.


Italy is also off to a $1.1M start from Wednesday previews at a huge 60% market share for the day. Compared to standard Thursday openings for Jurassic titles, this is above Fallen Kingdom and in-line with Jurassic World.  


Thailand, the production home for the film, opened on Wednesday to $700K, dominating close to 75% market share in the key cities at No. 1 and delivering the biggest non-holiday opening day of the year in the market. 


Taiwan grossed $600K on Wednesday, marking the biggest opening day of 2025, and accounting for 50% of the market at No. 1.


Indonesia opened on Wednesday at No. 1 to $600K, best of the year so far in the market and the 2nd biggest opening day of the Jurassic franchise, coming in above Dominion and Jurassic World, and just below Fallen Kingdom. This is also Universal's second biggest opening of the last 5 years, only behind Fast X.


	As for other early Thursday results not included in the international and global totals above, Australia grossed $1.2M on opening day with JWR ranking as a clear No. 1 with a 54% share of the Top 10.  This is the biggest opening day of 2025, surpassing A Minecraft Movie.


Malaysia entered the fray with $400K, the biggest non-holiday opening day for an MPA title this year, more than double Lilo & Stitch and 48% above Minecraft.


	Other major Thursday openers include Brazil and Netherlands while France and India join on Friday.


	We'll have updates throughout the weekend.

Here comes Part 8.

At least JWR looks like it will be profitable worldwide.

Nobody will have to PRETEND it's a hit like some people are doing for F1(op)

It's fascinating that it's been over 30 years since the last great Jurassic Park movie, over 25 years since the last Spielberg-directed Jurassic Park movie, and yet audiences still flock to these unnecessary franchise-extension sequels, hoping that ‘maybe this one will be great.' 

So now we have one perfect Jurassic Park movie and six ‘it's like Jurassic Park but nowhere near as good' movies, each one more resigned-shrug than the last. Jurassic Park, as a franchise, is the perfect example of diminishing returns. The CGI gets better but everything else gets so much worse.

There have been dozens of original movies this year, but people like you just didn't go see them in theaters, so they flopped.

So why would studios even try originals anymore? 

Oh, that's right, because even the sequels, prequels and remakes are now flopping…hahaha

Time for something new. So many sequels, prequels and cinematic worlds. 

Gone are the days when filmmakers came up with something original like The Matrix. Wish Hollywood would return to pre-2008, before Marvel, and make something unique.

Was Matrix really that original or was it just a mismatch of previous stuff.

They all have tons of original stuff they want to do. Studios no longer want to make any of it. Financiers no longer want to back it.

Following the death of journeyman actor Julian McMahon — known for his roles in “Nip/Tuck,” “Charmed,” and “Fantastic Four” — tributes poured in from co-stars, colleagues, and fans, including Rosie O'Donnell, Rose McGowan, Kelly Carlson, and Dick Wolf.

His death was announced on July 4 by his wife, Kelly, who told Deadline, “With an open heart, I wish to share with the world that my beloved husband, Julian McMahon, died peacefully this week after a valiant effort to overcome cancer.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






McMahon had most recently appeared in “FBI: Most Wanted,” which he left suddenly in 2022, saying in a statement to Deadline, “I'm extremely proud of the work we have done together and put the development of this show, and my character Jess, at the top of my professional experience list. I wish the show, and its cast & crew, the greatest success in the future. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to play Jess; he is a good man.”

Wolf, who served as the executive producer of the series, said of McMahon's death to Deadline, “What shocking news. All of us at Wolf Entertainment are deeply saddened by Julian's passing and our condolences go out to his entire family.”

 










Rose McGowan, who appeared with McMahon on “Charmed,” posted an Instagram story reading, “Oh Julian you force of brilliance, wild talent and humour. For you, your family and loving fans all over the world, I pray comfort.” 

Her on-screen sister Holly Marie Combs posted, “One of a kind is an understatement. Your unyielding zest for life and crazy-making sense of humor will be sorely missed. The joy and laughter you were the direct cause of will always be remembered. I hope you find our lady friend and dance in those rose petals.”

“Julian McMahon was magic. That smile. That laugh. That talent. That presence,” fellow “Charmed” co-star Alyssa Milano wrote in a lengthy post. “He walked into a room and lit it up — not just with charisma, but with kindness. With mischief. With soulful understanding. Her tribute concluded with, “Losing him feels unreal. Too soon. Too unfair. Rest, my friend. I'll carry your laugh with me.”

“Sad day for our ‘Charmed' family!” Brian Krause wrote. “Julian was one of the funniest, devilishly handsome and kind souls! Prayers to his family and close friends! He will surely be missed!”

“This is terribly sad news about Julian,” Ioan Gruffudd wrote, who starred alongside McMahon in a pair of “Fantastic Four” films. “Even though we played each other's nemeses, there was always so much lightness and laughter working together. Every encounter with him was a joy.”

 










Carlson, who co-starred with McMahon on “Nip/Tuck,” described him as “the energy, the charisma, the humor, the looks and everything of ‘Nip/Tuck.' […] I hope he had a peaceful journey. I wish him a peaceful journey. And I know he had a full, great life, so that's a good thing.”

Rosie O'Donnell, who guest-starred on “Nip/Tuck,” also posted on Instagram, writing that she was “heartbroken over the death of Julian McMahon — what a beautiful man — so kind loving funny and gifted — i loved working with him on nip/tuck — my love to his wife n children.”

Ruth Williamson, who played the eccentric Hedda Grubman on “Nip/Tuck,” described to IndieWire the infectious spirit of McMahon, including doing “his best Elvis” in the makeup trailer, lip-syncing to “A Little Less Conversation.”

“I am so very sad,” she said. “Julian was a clown disguised as a matinee idol. He loved to play. That's why he was such a good actor. When I worked with him on ‘Nip/Tuck' we had instant chemistry. And we genuinely liked each other. I will miss seeing his beautiful face on screen.”

Drake has released a new song called “What Did I Miss?” On the track—co-produced by DJ Lewis, Elyas, FNZ, Gyz, London Cyr, O Lil Angel, Oz, Patron, and Tay Keith—the Toronto musician reflects on his beef with Kendrick Lamar and the people who did and did not stand by him in the feud. Listen to the song below.

Drake opens “What Did I Miss?” by reflecting on the beef and the way it affected those around him: “Askin' me, ‘How did it feel?' Can't say it didn't surprise me/Last time I looked to my right, you n****s was standing beside me/How can some people I love hang around pussies who try me?” Later, in his first verse, Drake raps, “It's love for my brothers and death to a traitor, let's go.”

In his second verse, Drake references Kendrick Lamar's massive Drake-taunting Pop Out concert, in Inglewood, California, that featured performances and appearances from former Drake collaborators, such as YG, Mustard, and Ty Dolla $ign. “I saw bro went to Pop Out with them, but been dick-riding gang since ‘Headlines,'” he raps.

The beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar was reignited when Lamar took some subtle shots at Drake on Future and Metro Boomin's “Like That.” Importantly, Future and Metro Boomin were both, at one point in time, prominent Drake collaborators, and their turn against the Canadian artist led to other former friends taking sides in the feud. The Weeknd, for example, appeared on Future and Metro Boomin's We Still Don't Trust You—a potential sign of where his loyalties lied—and Rick Ross shared his own diss track against Drake, “Champagne Moments.”

“What Did I Miss?” is a rare solo single from Drake, since he shared his suite of anti-Lamar tracks in 2024. The new song is released via Drake's OVO Sound. Like all of Drake's recent solo music, it is licensed to Republic Records, a label owned by Universal Music Group (UMG). Drake is federally suing UMG for defamation, claiming that the corporation “waged an unrelenting campaign” to promote “Not Like Us,” Kendrick Lamar's mega-hit that Drake believes is filled with falsities.

	Throughout President Donald Trump's second term, he's used every means possible to promote himself and prop up his agenda in unprecedented ways — even as he pulls apart the government brick by brick.


	Now, it's happening at the embattled Social Security Administration, which manages America's core safety-net program. On Thursday, after Republicans passed Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” — legislation that will slash taxes for the rich, rob millions of poor people of their health insurance, and turbocharge the president's militarized deportations — the Social Security Administration sent out an email to an untold number of Americans claiming the bill “reaffirms President Trump's promise to protect Social Security” while offering a range of misinformation about what the new law does. 


	For one thing, the Big Beautiful Bill does not protect Social Security. It will actually “hasten Social Security insolvency by a year,” according to Kathleen Romig, the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. This is one of several claims in the Social Security Administration email that Romig flagged as “highly misleading” in a thread on Bluesky.

	











	However, the bizarre email is just one small part of a sprawling, government-wide project that is already costing American taxpayers well upwards of a billion dollars, as Trump officials prioritize the mass distribution of MAGA propaganda in ways that would likely make many veterans of Trump's first term blush. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	According to a current administration official and another Trump adviser, various offices at different federal departments and agencies spend inordinate amounts of time finding ways to sell even small developments as massive, earth-shaking Trump accomplishments. “Put his name on everything,” is how the administration official characterized the ongoing trend across the federal government, the national Republican Party, and elsewhere.

	The other Trump adviser, who has spoken to the president about this topic, tells Rolling Stone that Trump and his appointees' drive to do this — at the Social Security Administration and beyond — was influenced by the propaganda success that Trump saw during his first administration, when he demanded his name be printed on the Covid-19 stimulus checks sent out at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.


	Less than six months into his second term, we've already seen the Trump administration pour $200 million into ads, at the president's request, thanking him for his immigration crackdown; spend up to $45 million on a military parade that took place on Trump's birthday; and fly B-2 Bombers and other fighter jets over the White House during the signing ceremony for the Big Beautiful Bill on Friday. 


	The move to turn the Social Security Administration into yet another Trump propaganda organ comes as the agency's services degrade — thanks in large part to Trump and Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which gutted its workforce, moved to shutter local offices, and sought to implement major technical changes due to baseless concerns about fraud. As a result of DOGE's changes, Social Security recipients in need of assistance may now find themselves stuck on the phone for more than three hours, if their calls aren't disconnected without warning. 


	Amid that ongoing crisis, the Trump administration now has the Social Security Administration touting the Big Beautiful Bill as benefiting seniors in ways it does not.


	“The bill ensures that nearly 90 percent of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits, providing meaningful and immediate relief to seniors who have spent a lifetime contributing to our nation's economy,” the email claimed. It added, “The new law includes a provision that eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries, providing relief to individuals and couples. Additionally, it provides an enhanced deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older, ensuring that retirees can keep more of what they have earned.”

	Trump put it more succinctly during the White House signing ceremony for the legislation, claiming that the bill achieves “no tax on Social Security for our great seniors.”


	Romig, at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, wrote in a thread on Bluesky that the Big Beautiful Bill “did NOT repeal taxation of Social Security” benefits, and that its so-called “senior deduction” has literally “nothing to do with getting Social Security.”

	“Most beneficiaries are NOT affected by the bill,” she added. “For ex: Beneficiaries who don't pay taxes on Social Security now (and most don't!). Beneficiaries under age 65. Beneficiaries w/ incomes above the bill's phase-out.”


	“Donald Trump has created a massive customer service crisis at Social Security,” Alex Lawson, executive director at the liberal advocacy group Social Security Works, tells Rolling Stone. Now, “instead of addressing the very real crisis people are facing,” he says, the agency is “sending a piece of political propaganda filled with lies.”

Before screening the restored 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' the nephew of the late Saul Zaentz, producer of the film with Michael Douglas, said "we shall overcome," lauding the "movie about rebellion."


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Producer Paul Zaentz, nephew of the late Saul Zaentz, who co-produced with Michael Douglas the Oscar-winning Miloš Forman drama One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, sharply criticized U.S. President Donald Trump during an appearance at the 59th edition of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF) in the Czech Republic on Saturday.


	Appearing before a screening of a newly restored version of the 1975 classic, which became only the second movie to win all five major Academy Award categories – best picture (Douglas and Zaentz), best director (Forman), best actor (Jack Nicholson), best actress (Louise Fletcher), and best adapted screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman), Zaentz called Cuckoo's Nest “a movie about rebellion” and bashed financial support for the poor and other Trump policies.

	“It's ironic that … Cuckoo's Nest has been honored here on its 50th anniversary, and I am afraid that Ken Kesey's brilliant book may be banned in the USA,” he said in comments made a few minutes before Douglas appeared on stage to a huge ovation.


	Zaentz continued: “Yesterday, July 4, the malignant narcissist, wannabe dictator that occupies the White House signed a bill that was passed by his cruel, heartless followers to make the rich richer and take food and health care away from the people who need it – a very sad July 4 for the USA.” The remark drew applause from the jam-packed auditorium at the Czech festival.

	











	The producer concluded by asking people outside the U.S. for patience. “Don't give up on America,” Zaentz said. “We shall overcome the totally corrupt, morally bankrupt, treasonous, evil thing and his cronies and minions. I am certain that Miloš would agree with me that Trump is a stain on my country, and his presidency will be looked upon as the greatest moral failure in the history of the United States.”

	I have approximately the time it takes for I'm With Her to pile into a sprinter van backstage at Colorado's Telluride Bluegrass Festival and drive to their late-night show at the nearby Sheridan Opera House to conduct a fast-paced interview.


	But, in truth, three and a half minutes of listening to songs like “Ancient Light,” “Year After Year,” or “Mother Eagle (Sing Me Alive)” is all you need to grasp the appeal of the supergroup trio. Their innate gifts for harmony, melody, and songwriting make their songs, especially those on the new album Wild and Clear and Blue, all but irresistible.


	“We've just lived so much life together, much more life together than we had on our first record,” the band's Sarah Jarosz tells Rolling Stone. “This [album], we know what our sound is, and now what do we want to say?”


	At 11:30 p.m., the group emerged behind a lone microphone at the intimate 1913 opera house on North Oak Street. The gorgeous “Year After Year” hushed the audience, focusing them squarely on members Jarosz, Aoife O'Donovan, and Sara Watkins.

	











	“Things will never be the same/as they were when we were young,” Watkins sang. “Let's welcome the change/no song unsung.”


	“I love singing with them so much,” Watkins says of her bandmates. “One of the main things I remember from that first meetup was just how easy it was to communicate.”


	The initial meetup occurred right around the corner from the opera house in nearby Elks Park. It was during the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival. The three musicians were each performing at the gathering with various projects and were asked to host a workshop in the park.

	











	“It just happened that the three of us were the ones who could work something up beforehand,” Jarosz recalls. “We met up behind the main stage earlier that day and that was the first time we sang together. That harmony was so magical.”


	“The thing I like most about our band is that it's not always the same blend. Who's singing high? Who's singing low? Who's singing harmony?” O'Donovan says. “So, you end up having all these color combinations. It's like we have this whole box of paints and we're constantly thinking of new colors to make.”

	The seamless blend of ancient tones and soaring voices is what elevates I'm With Her, and Wild and Clear and Blue, in the roots-music world. The members are well-aware of their chemistry.


	“There's this ease of working together,” Watkins says. “It's just a very natural working environment.”


	While I'm With Her may have some elements in common with other harmony-based bands, like Crosby, Stills & Nash, there's none of the rock & roll baggage and expectations that plagued some of the greats.


	“Once we decided to become a band, it's kind of what we always hoped it could be,” Jarosz says. “This band we could return to when we wanted to, and not something we had to do. I think that's why it's so enjoyable, because it's this bonus musical experience.”


	The day before the opera house gig, O'Donovan is sitting in the lobby of the Camel's Garden Hotel in downtown Telluride. Later that afternoon, the trio will hop onto the festival's large main stage, their melodies radiating out into the towering box canyon surrounding the town. But, for now, O'Donovan is reflecting on the origins of the group.

	“We'd all been friends for many years,” O'Donovan says. “We sang through a couple of songs and it was so cool. And right after the workshop, Chris Thile texted.”


	Thile, frontman for the Punch Brothers, asked the group if they wanted to open for him at the opera house that night. It was the Sunday evening sendoff for the festival, a tradition Thile and his bandmates have held for several years. (To note, Watkins is part of Nickel Creek with Thile, and O'Donovan and Jarosz were regular performers on Thile's radio variety show Live From Here.)


	“We didn't have any repertoire,” O'Donovan chuckles. “We got to the gig early. We went into the bathroom and worked up a bunch of songs.” Among them, Bill Monroe's “Blue Moon of Kentucky” and Watkin's “Long Hot Summer Days.”

	











	“It was electric,” O'Donovan says. “The next day, Sara Watkins texted, ‘I feel like this should be a thing.'”


	The group released their debut album, See You Around, in 2018. They won the Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song for “Call My Name” in 2020. All the while, they played strings of rapturous gigs.


	“I'm constantly surprised by how it still feels so creative,” O'Donovan says. “And we're still thinking of new ways to change up older songs, play with dynamics, add little sections, little fills here and there.”

	Back in the lobby, O'Donovan's cell phone vibrates. Jarosz and Watkins are in front of the hotel, ready to go for a quick hike together before their set. Exiting the hotel, the group disappears down San Juan Avenue toward the mountains cradling the community.


	“People have passed on. New lives have come into this world. Families have grown,” Jarosz says. “And we've all kind of experienced that together. That richness of life and grief and all of the above — all of that fed these songs.”

The people that know me are enjoying the peace and quiet since I never shut up. But I'm sooooo annoyed! LOL! No sore throat. Barely congested. What is going on!”

A post shared by Sophia Hutchins (@hutchins_sophia)

Regarding Kathy Hilton's comment, she said, “Rip Sophia.” Kathy also included four white hearts, a red one, and the praying hands emoji. Kathy doesn't seem to have any ties to Sophia Hutchins or Caitlyn Jenner. 

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Sophia Hutchins and Caitlyn Jenner met in 2015. Notably, they met via Sophia's makeup artist at a photoshoot. Sophia said about their connection to the “Times,” “Having a similar sense of humor, we spent the entire time laughing and ended up meeting for brunch, and we've been great friends ever since.”

She also spoke about becoming Jenner's manager, saying, “I saw nobody was managing her, and there were all these people taking massive advantage. And I was saying, ‘Caitlyn, if I don't step in here and start managing you, you're going to go broke.'”

It's also important to note that Sophia Hutchins was a senior at Pepperdine at the time. She also moved into Caitlyn Jenner's home. Caitlyn spoke about Hutchins in 2019, saying she was her “best friend, family, and confidant.” 

Caitlyn added, “She is one of the top minds in her field. Her value in my life is undeniable. The sky is the limit with her entrepreneurial spirit.”

Australian born actor, Julian McMahon never played it safe, no matter how big (or small) the screen. Whether he was casting spells, cutting into bodies, or chasing down fugitives, McMahon made a habit of picking bold, often unpredictable roles. And while he might've first hit American screens with soap opera good looks and a brooding charm, the Australian actor quickly proved he had staying power far beyond daytime TV.

McMahon passed away on July 2, 2025, at just 56 years old, according to statements released on July 4. 

“With an open heart, I wish to share with the world that my beloved husband, Julian McMahon, died peacefully this week after a valiant effort to overcome cancer. Julian loved life. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his work, and he loved his fans. His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible. We ask for support during this time to allow our family to grieve in privacy. And we wish for all of those to whom Julian brought joy, to continue to find joy in life. We are grateful for the memories.”

But what about his legacy? It's a genre-hopping, fan-favorite catalog of some of the most wildly entertaining TV of the last few decades. And those fans flocked to the internet (as one does in today's society) to share their thoughts on the tragic news. Here's how this legend will be remembered.

McMahon got his U.S. start as Ian Rain on “Another World,” but his big breakthrough came in 2000 as Cole Turner on “Charmed,” a half-demon, half-lawyer who fell hard for Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano). Let's be real: that storyline should've been a disaster. But McMahon somehow turned Cole into a tortured icon; equal parts villain, romantic lead, and chaotic wildcard. Fans still argue about whether he was misunderstood or straight-up toxic (it's both), but either way, he made it memorable.

Then came “Nip/Tuck.” If “Charmed” made him a household name, “Nip/Tuck” made him a TV rebel. As Dr. Christian Troy, McMahon dove headfirst into the twisted, often unhinged world of plastic surgery, vanity, and identity. The FX drama was scandalous, no question; but McMahon grounded it with unexpected vulnerability beneath all that designer smugness. It earned him a Golden Globe nomination and cemented him as a risk-taker.

And let's not forget his run as the Marvel comic character Victor Von Doom in the Fox produced, “Fantastic Four” films (“Fantastic Four” and “Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer”). While the movies didn't exactly win over critics, McMahon leaned into the arrogance and menace of the iconic villain with just the right level of comic book flair. It's not easy going toe-to-toe with superheroes, but he made Doom deliciously watchable.

In the 2010s and beyond, McMahon shifted gears into more procedural fare. He joined “Runaways” as Jonah, a mysterious, powerful alien with deep ties to the show's family drama, before stepping into a G-man role for “FBI: Most Wanted.” As Jess LaCroix, he led the Fugitive Task Force with steely precision and quiet empathy… a surprisingly restrained performance that added depth to the franchise.

When he exited “FBI: Most Wanted” in 2022, McMahon told TheWrap it was time to “pursue additional creative pursuits.” And while we didn't know it then, that chapter would be one of his last big moments on screen.

McMahon remained a steady presence in entertainment for over three decades, lending his acting talents to over 40 projects (per IMDB), including films like “Premonition,” “Paranoia,” “Faces in the Crowd,” “Bait,” and more recently, “The Surfer.” His net worth was estimated at $16 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, but his real value came from his versatility; he was never just “the hot guy” or “the bad guy.” He was both, and more; always willing to explore the messy, human gray area in between.

      this is a very deep dive into the soft-release of UAP info via movies and media. Split into 3 sections, the first showsa examples ( which i sadly had to cut about 20 minutes out of due to copywrite), the second is an interview with my very good friend, and subject expert Mark A. Pritchard and part three gets into some really dark examples of the government and IC doing exactly what we're talking about. I hope you enjoy it.

Bonnie Blue is accused of secretly being a man.

July 5 2025, Published 1:00 p.m. ET

Adult star Bonnie Blue has found herself at the center of a truly wild internet rumor claiming she is secretly a 26-year-old man who once went by the name "Tom". 

However, this sensational storyline isn't fazing the adult film icon, who boldly stated she "will take anyone" who questions her gender, RadarOnline.com can reveal.

Bonnie Blue has broken her silence on rumors she is a man.

The actress, born Tia Billinger, has been making headlines lately — not just for her adult film career but also for planning a public sex stunt in London.

Despite keeping a low profile initially, Bonnie has finally decided to address the odd rumor that has captured the interest of social media users far and wide. 

During an appearance on Stand Out TV, host PK Humble opened the conversation with the awkward inquiry, saying: "I read somewhere that someone said you're a man." 

Without missing a beat, Bonnie responded: "I read that too; apparently, my name was Tom."

When pressed about whether she'd be open to "getting down and dirty" with trans individuals, she shrugged off the controversy, joking: "Yeah, I don't have a problem with it. There's nothing I can't handle; I will take anyone and everyone."



A TikTok channel titled "Celebquotesdaily" claimed "Bonnie Blue is definitely a man" and shared a number of images in an attempt to back their allegation.

In the video, an AI voice claimed: "It all started just a couple of months ago when photos began circulating in a private Discord group. Pictures that were never meant to be public. They showed Bonnie as a teenager with short hair wearing a high school sports jersey with a male name printed across the chest.

"At first, no one knew if the photos were real, but the internet did what it always does: dug deeper. Before long, someone unearthed old local newspaper clippings from 2011 about a boy from Alabama who won a statewide debate competition. The name didn't match, but the face did.

"Bonnie stayed silent; she kept posting as if nothing was happening, sharing videos of the old southern house she was restoring. A grand, creaky place passed down from her grandmother, full of pillars, peeling wallpaper and secrets, but the pressure kept building. The comments grew more aggressive, the speculation more relentless, and when the leak finally made it to major TikTok channels and Reddit threads, she knew there was no way to stay quiet."

The adult star seemed unphased by the online speculation.

The comments on TikTok highlighted how the quick flashes of the images in the video appeared to be "clearly AI-generated".

One user commented: "My fear is that I cannot become too funny or famous bc someone will find a picture of my brother and start this rumor."

Another wrote: "So we're just using Grok and OpenAI images to back our conspiracy theories now? We're cooked."

A third person said: "I do appreciate how this trans fearmongering TikTok theory video, which claims with complete certainty that Bonnie is a man, still opts to use her correct pronouns. She/Her."

Bonnie Blue garnered almost a million followers on OnlyFans.

Blue, who had nearly 900,000 subscribers on OnlyFans, was banned from the X-rated platform after she promoted her "petting zoo" stunt.

The 26-year-old planned to sleep with 2,000 people while tied up in a glass box before the platform kicked her off their site.

Blue told news outlets that she thought her permanent ban was unwarranted, saying: "It's clearly unfair, and it's frustrating because I've been singled out, and it's just because I get more press and more views."

In the past fifteen years, five missions have returned samples of extraterrestrial material to Earth for analysis. These included missions that rendezvoused with Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), like the Hayabusa 1 and 2 and the OSIRIS-REx missions, and the Chang'e-5 and 
-6 missions, which brought back samples from the far side of the Moon. In the coming years, 
China plans to return samples from 469219 Kamoʻoalewa with its Tianwen-2 mission. With all the extraterrestrial materials being returned to Earth for analysis, one could argue that we are entering a "golden age of sample-return missions." 

As a result, efforts are underway to create facilities where scientists can safely contain, curate, and analyze these samples. At the University of Leicester's Leicester Space Park, scientists are working on a Double-Walled Isolator (DWI) to store and analyze extraterrestrial materials safely. This could include future samples returned from Mars, which NASA and other space agencies are planning to do through crewed or robotic missions expected to happen during the late 2020s or early 2030s. 

The DWI is essentially a miniature version of a clean room and is designed to keep materials at a high level of containment and cleanliness. This is ensured by an inert gas environment and state-of-the-art robotics (an arm and other manipulator technologies) to move samples between containment, an optical microscope, and a Raman spectrometer. These measures minimize interactions between scientists, prevent cross-contamination, and preserve sample integrity so scientists can obtain accurate results when conducting analyses. 

As Andrew Cheney, DWI QM Project Manager at Space Park Leicester, said in a University of Leicester press release: 

The SRR is a major milestone for the project that shows that we've fully understood the customer need, and translated that into a set of requirements to proceed with confidence into the design phase. Generating a good set of requirements is arguably the hardest part of any project and takes a lot of research, analysis, and industry expertise. 

Now [that] we have that agreed baseline, we look forward to the design phase and the many, many challenges it will bring for this unique piece of equipment. We have a relatively compressed period now to push a concept through to detail design and manufacture. The dedicated qualification phase will involve simulating end-to-end curatorial and scientific processing of martian analogue samples at SPL.

This €5 million ($5.89 million) project was initially developed for the NASA/ESA Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission and builds on previous work where the Leicester team created a design for a prototype DWI. In the new phase, the Leicester team will be collaborating with experts from several British universities and institutes, including the Open University, the Francis Crick Institute, Imperial College London, and the Natural History Museum. They've also partnered with Extract Technologies, a UK-based manufacturer of advanced isolator technologies, to provide a detailed design for the main isolator and manufacture it. Said John Holt, DWI QM Principal Investigator at Space Park Leicester:

Whether or not an astronaut or a robotic spacecraft brings samples back from Mars, the Double Walled Isolator (DWI) is a key UK technology that enables planetary scientists to scrutinise returned rocks to understand the Martian environment and if there is microscopic evidence for life on the red planet. The milestone review [SRR] we have just conducted carefully looked at the complex needs of scientists to ensure we design an ultra-clean system that allows them to handle the precious samples and use a wide range of analytical techniques to unlock the secrets within each piece of rock. 

The facility recently passed its System Requirements Review (SSR) with the European Space Agency (ESA) and is now proceeding to the Design and Qualification phase. Currently, there are four missions in the works to return samples from Mars, including NASA's proposed crewed missions to Mars, China's Tianwen-3, JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX), and Russia's Mars-Grunt mission.
