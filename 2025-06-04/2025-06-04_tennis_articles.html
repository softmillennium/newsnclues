                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Keys beat Aryna Sabalenka to win the Australian Open back in January, and also had to save a match point in her semi-final against Iga Swiatek. This is something that the American had been expected to achieve from a young age, with Keys looking to win more Grand Slams now. Her bid to achieve that at the French Open has now come to an end, with Keys being beaten by Coco Gauff in the quarter-finals. While winning the Australian Open is still the biggest achievement of Keys' career so far, 18-time Grand Slam champion Chris Evert believes it has also come with its downsides. Keys is someone whom Evert knows well, having trained at her academy from 10 years of age. During her quarter-final match against Gauff, seven-time French Open champion Evert was on commentary for TNT Sports and spoke about how Keys' profile has changed in America. “She's definitely being more recognised, I've already seen two new advertisements on American TV so she's getting a few more endorsements and I know tournaments want her to play,” said Evert. After her three set defeat to Gauff in the French Open quarter-finals, Keys will now switch her attention to the grass court season. Keys' grass court season ended in heartbreak last year, as she was forced to retire at Wimbledon with a hamstring injury. The world number eight will be hoping for a different outcome this year, and is scheduled to play her first grass court tournament at Queen's Club.</p>

But you also have to see the other side of it: pressure, tension, fear, difficulties, opponents, types of players, a tournament you want to win more than others, the importance we all put on it... all these things also come into play.” Ferrero was talking about Alcaraz's flawless performance in his win over Tommy Paul. 2 brushed aside the American with a dazzling display of tennis. “I don't think you can call it perfect because nobody is perfect, but it's true that he's getting close to a level that is very rare on Tour,” said Ferrero. I've told him so many times and that's what we're doing. “Yesterday he went at practically everything and everything went in, but some days there will be more mistakes and it becomes 30 unforced errors. Then he won't be so brilliant, but the intention is there.” With his charge having just turned 22, Ferrero is in no doubt that it is time for Alcaraz to make key decisions about his game, highlighting the importance of stepping up to the plate. “It's a question of him also choosing how he wants to play,” explained the Murcia native's coach. “You can step out in the semi-finals with the tension of having to win or really try and go out and play every point and look for his A-game... so that it's the consequence of being able to win and playing well. I think Carlos is starting to focus more on himself and not on others, and really finding his maximum level. The consequence will be that exceptionally high level he has.” On top of this, progressing mentally — based on the work he has been carrying out for some time — is currently key for Alcaraz. “The mental side is something we've tried to work on with him for a long time,” explained Ferrero. “Routines, ways of behaving on court, how to pick himself up when he's in trouble, pre-match chats, chats the day before, preparations for matches... All these kinds of situations that arise with a player, we've been working on them for some time. “If he needs to talk about something, if he needs to talk about the match or anything else, he knows that we're there and we always try to do so in the same way.” No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS (AP) — Top-ranked Jannik Sinner's overpowering run through the French Open moved into the semifinals with a 6-1, 7-5, 6-0 victory over No. Sinner, who lost to champion Carlos Alcaraz in the final four at Roland-Garros a year ago, needed just 1 hour, 49 minutes to advance against Bublik, who upset No. 5 Jack Draper in the previous round. Not only hasn't Sinner ceded a set yet, he only has dropped a total of 36 games through five matches over the past 1 1/2 weeks. And he played clean-as-can-be tennis against Bublik — who was making his major quarterfinal debut — with 31 winners to just 13 unforced errors. Next for Sinner is a semifinal Friday against either 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic or No. The other men's semifinal will be No. Sinner, 23, is a three-time Grand Slam champion. That includes last year's U.S. Open and this year's Australian Open, so his winning streak at majors is now at 19 matches. He is the first man from Italy to reach six Slam semifinals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff showed tremendous determination to come back from a set down to beat her fellow American Madison Keys and reach the French Open semifinals on Wednesday. Gauff, 21, lost the opening set at Roland Garros in a nervy tiebreaker to Keys but bounced back emphatically to eventually win 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-1, ending Keys' 11-match grand slam win streak. “I changed something at 4-1 in that first set and after that I had chances to win the set,” Gauff said on court afterwards. I was just trying to fight for every point. “She is obviously a very great player and her forehand is probably one of the best, if not the best, on tour. I was just trying my best to get it on the other side of the court, but she has a great inside-out and inside-in forehand. Gauff, a losing finalist at the French Open three years ago, needed to show all her mettle to overcome the 2025 Australian Open champion. It was Keys who raced into an early lead in the first set and, although Gauff was able to fight back, the 30-year-old found the necessary edge to take an early lead with her opponent missing a set point. But this time, it was Keys who came back, leveling the scores in the second set before Gauff broke once more and held serve to tie it at 1-1. And in the deciding set, Gauff had finally found her stride, looking much more comfortable as she romped to a comfortable 6-1 set victory to take the match. It was far from Gauff's most complete performance at Roland Garros – where she won the French Open doubles title last year – but she won't care as it books her spot in the semifinals. “It means a lot, especially after getting through this tough match today,” the No. “I'm just very excited to be back in the semifinals here again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zverev won their previous meeting when Djokovic retired from the Australian Open semi-final At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Novak Djokovic faces Alexander Zverev in a blockbuster French Open quarter-final as the Serbian continues his bid for a record-extending 25th grand slam singles title. Djokovic is yet to drop a set at this year's tournament and defeated Cameron Norrie on Monday to claim his 100th career win at Roland Garros, as well as his 19th French Open quarter-final. Zverev, the third seed, will be the toughest test Djokovic has faced by far, with the German having reached last year's final in Paris where he lost in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz. Zverev won his last meeting with Djokovic, but that came when the 38-year-old retired from their Australian Open semi-final after losing the opening set on a tiebreak. It could start later than that if the previous matches run over. Djokovic defeated Norrie in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2, to extend his winning streak on clay after winning the title in Geneva before the French Open began. “I can always expect myself to play better,” he said. Zverev progressed to his fifth consecutive French Open quarter-final after his opponent Tallon Griekspoor retired while trailing 6-3 4-0, having struggled with an injury during the match. Zverev has won his last four French Open quarter-finals but trails the head-to-head against Djokovic 8-5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner eased into the last four, Lois Boisson's unlikely run continued and Coco Gauff overcame Madison Keys in an edgy contest We'll be back for those semi-finals tomorrow – and we'll have a report on the site on Sinner's win and Zverev v Djokovic. Still no order of play for tomorrow's women's semi-finals, with Lois Boisson, the story of the tournament, taking on Gauff, and Swiatek and Sabalenka facing off in part XIII. I guess organisers are debating whether they'd rather have a guaranteed full crowd for Boisson if they put her on first, which would be at 3pm Paris time/2pm UK, or whether they'd rather have her in a potentially more TV-friendly early evening slot. If you want to catch up on today: It's staggering when you consider he didn't even play tennis for three months up until a few weeks ago. With Sinner in this form – he's on a 19-match winning streak in grand slams, it's like early Roger Federer, before Rafa rocked the boat – I think he'll have too much for Zverev or Djokovic. But Alcaraz, most likely, in the final is too tough to call. Sinner blazed a path to the Italian Open final last month, his first event back from his ban, before running into Alcaraz, who beat him in straight sets. “He can have some ups and downs,” says Sinner, making something of an understatement. It was a good performance from my side, as things were very windy and breezy. Against these types of players you have to be very consistent. The fans want a high-quality match, we'll try to make it happen.” Bublik is grinning; he's had fun despite the defeat and third-set rout. For Sinner, it's a second consecutive French Open semi-final, where he'll face either Alexander Zverev or Novak Djokovic, who play this evening. Sinner breaks: Sinner* 6-1, 7-5, 5-0 Bublik (*denotes next server)It's been entertaining, and he'll always have those wins over Jack Draper and Alex De Minaur, but Bublik's run in Paris is about to end, as Sinner, from 40-30 down on Bublik's serve, skips through the next three points with his usual efficiency. And Bublik almost congratulates Sinner at the changeover; he's already accepted his fate. Third set: Sinner 6-1, 7-5, 4-0 Bublik* (*denotes next server)It's remarkable given how little tennis Sinner had under his belt coming into Roland Garros, after that three-month doping ban, how at ease he's been this fortnight. Close out this set and it'll be a fifth consecutive win in straight sets. From 40-15, Sinner does the business with an easy putaway at the net, and Bublik needs a miracle, or at least to summon several of his trademark jaw-dropping winners, to inconvenience the Italian winning machine for much longer. Bublik is shaking his head; the crowd are almost silent. A lovely pick-up from Bublik at the net … Sinner lobs … but it's long! Bublik has a game point, which may do little more at this stage than prevent a third-set whitewash, but he doesn't capitalise. He allows himself a little smile, while also wincing at the pain Sinner is putting him through. Third set: Sinner 6-1, 7-5, 2-0 Bublik* (*denotes next server)Bublik said he hated the sport “with all my heart” back in 2020. The enigmatic Kazakh is Kyrgios-like when it comes to his wavering focus, combustible temperament and his natural but unfulfilled talent. Sinner breaks: Sinner* 6-1, 7-5, 1-0 Bublik (*denotes next server)Alas, as so often happens in tennis, Bublik, having pushed so hard in that second set, quickly surrenders at the start of the next. And that's the break, when Bublik can't dig a volley out from his feet. It's hard to see a way back for Bublik from here, as hard as seeing a French wildcard ranked 361 in the world on their grand slam debut making … er wait … OK, it's not impossible, but highly implausible. Bublik could probably do with a restorative mid-match Hangover-style trip to Vegas, which is what he did to reignite his career when he felt like jacking it all in during the spring, but instead he'll have to make do with a quick drink and rub of his towel. *Sinner 6-1 7-5 Bublik As we said earlier, it's close until it isn't; offer someone like Sinner a finger, he'll take your whole hand. He serves out to love and it's a long way back for Bublik from here. As for me, I'm off to see Tina Knowles; here's Katy to croon you through the rest of this match, Sinner 6-1 6-5 Bublik* A terrific backhand return, on the stretch, gives Sinner 0-15, then another sets up a forehand winner down the line for 15-30. I fear I can see where this is going and, shonuff, he gets low to carve a forehand winner that raises two break points. Bublik, though, has put so much into this set and he's not keen that it be for nothing, a fine point ended with two massive forehands to the corner. And I hate to say it, but you can probably guess what happens next: a double fault that hands over the break and that's the difference between good players and the best. Sinner will now serve for a two-set lead. *Sinner 6-1 5-5 Bublik Serving to stay in the set, Sinner finds himself passed by a backhand winner, lazily annihilated cross-court; a netted return restores parity. And from there, the game disappears, Sinner making 5-5, but this is an even contest and if Bublik could nab the set, we'd really be talking. Sinner 6-1 4-5 Bublik* Bublik has lovely hands, another cunning drop making 30-0 and an ace behind it raising three game points. The Kazakh, though, fancies the task, a disguised drop bringing us to deuce … so Sinner closes out in short order. He's not playing as well, though, and Bublik is serving better while making more of an impression on the return. Sinner 6-1 3-4 Bublik* At 30-all, Bublik marches in only to put an inside-out forehand just wide … then lets go a decent drop, cleaning up at the net for deuce. It's hard to see him breaking, but in a breaker his serve and one-shot kill power would make him a live dog. His only hope really is to do what Wawrinka did in winning his three major finals against Djokovic and Nadal, just going for everything. He's not going to outlast Sinner from the back, but he does have big shots and a fine eye; the world no 1 holds easily once more. This is much more enjoyable now, the Kazakh, in his first grand slam quarter, playing like he belongs. But can he get something going on the Sinner serve? *Sinner 6-1 2-2 Bublik On Lenglen,Sander Arends and Luke Johnson have levelled at a set apiece in their men's doubles quarter against Huge Nys and Edouard Roger-Vasselin; I note this because Luke is, like Henry Patten – the Wimbledon and Aussie Open champ – coached by Calvin Betton, our resident expert. From there, a service-winner down the T underlines the underdog's improvement … then a double reminds us of his nature. *Sinner 6-1 1-1 Bublik Bublik is, I guess, an example of just how much the very best sportsfolk are defined by their mentality. It's easy for the likes of us to say if we were blessed with talent, we'd give everything while staying calm under pressure, but actually doing that is almost impossible. Sinner holds easily and the match might just have settled into a pattern. He holds to 15 and, in comms, Mac – told his coach is behind his decision to put effort in – chuckles at the apparently revelatory nature of this advice. At 27, he's still got time to explore its full extent. more so than his neck-beard, I guess and, as I type, Sinner overhits a forehand at 30-all; the comeback is on. And soon, the world no 1 is break point down, a big serve averting immediate danger, likewise one to the body. Then, when up advantage himself, he's passed by Bublik's backhand … but closes out thereafter. Sinner leads by a set and it's impossible to even conceive of a way in which he loses this. Sinner 5-1 Bublik* Sinner makes 0-30 and Bublik, your streaky and occasional wonder-shot feel-merchant just cant cope ; understandably so. he's good enough to beat almost everyone when playing well, but the best are impervious to purple patches from his ilk. Still, a big serve digs him out of a set point at 30-40, then on advantage, Sinner overhits a putaway, and Bublik salutes the crowd upon winning his first game. *Sinner 5-0 Bublik Better from Bublik, who stops in a long rally, playing four or five superb shots to win one point when he guess correctly and blocks back a pick-up into space; 015. From there, we wind up at deuce and this is better from the underdog – for all the good it does him. Only Jack Draper is improving in any kind of meaningful way and he's still a way off, especially on the red stuff. Sinner 4-0 Bublik* At 15-30, Bublik telegraphs a drop, it sits up, and Sinner lanks in to stick it away. He's so comfy out there, and though i'm not sure his best level is the best around, his modal level is stratospheric and he quickly swats a backhand pass down the line for the double break. My internet decided to forsake me, but we're back now and Sinner is already a break to the good at 3-0. It's open as Jannik Sinner and Alexander Bublik take to the court. Boisson had won just one match on the WTA Tour before this tournament. Her ranking will jump from 361 to around 65 after this win. If Gauff is as error-strewn as she was today against Keys, Boisson really has a chance of taking one of the craziest stories in tennis history all the way to Saturday's final. Yes, Andreeva fell apart in the eye of a Parisian storm, but the way Boisson was able to hold her nerve, and do what so many French players have struggled to do in front of a demanding home crowd, suggests she will be very much up for the challenge of facing the world No 2. I don't think Gauff will let the crowd get to her in the way Andreeva did though. It was amazing to feel supported like this. There are no words to describe that feeling. Whatever the situation for me last year, it's unbelievable to come from there. I was so tense, I fought hard, the first set was very intense and at the beginning of the second set I was very tired. Maybe a money-spinning Dove collab is happening. Andreeva appears as if she wants to be put out of her misery. Points that Andreeva lost more than Boisson won. 15,000 fans in Chatrier are once again losing their minds. The French world No 361 wildcard is improbably into the semi-finals, having never even played a grand slam before! Second set: Andreeva* 6-7, 3-5 Boisson (*denotes next server)Andreeva is usually able to problem solve so well on court, thinking on her feet, putting the pieces of the puzzle together, coming up with plan A, B, C, D and even E if needed. But having to fight against 15,000 French fans, she can't think straight. She's shaking at 15-30, even more so at 30-40 … a long rally plays out, Boisson suddenly ups the ante with an injection of pace and Andreeva nets! A second break point for Andreeva at her advantage. And Boisson backs up the break with her fifth straight game when Andreeva's meek drop shot is nowhere near to clearing the net! Boisson breaks: Andreeva 6-7, 3-4 Boisson* (*denotes next server)Andreeva's mind is gone when she whacks a ball into row Z after falling 0-30 down. Which in Andreeva's current state of mind may as well be match points. Her latest French revolution is almost complete! Second set: Andreeva* 6-7, 3-3 Boisson (*denotes next server)With Boisson serving at 30-15, Martinez is absolutely screaming at Andreeva to “TAKE THE BALL EARLY”. Martinez doesn't listen and is still barking instructions to her charge when the game goes to deuce. It does the trick, though, because here's a break point! Boisson saves it with a sliding serve out wide. Boisson puffs out her cheeks; she perhaps looks a little tired. But still calm, unlike Andreeva, who can't believe it when Boisson takes the next two points to hold! But Andreeva is still shaky, and her feet aren't quite moving quickly enough, as she drops 15-40 behind. This jerking drama has another sudden twist! Second set: Andreeva 6-7, 3-0 Boisson* (*denotes next server)Boisson taking that first set means the wildcard has remarkably won three consecutive sets against top-six players on her grand slam debut. Her ranking of 361 is slightly misleading, though, given she had an extended period out with an ACL injury, which she suffered just before Roland Garros last year; she couldn't even face watching the tournament from home, so upset she was at not being able to take the wildcard she'd been offered. But she looks as if she believes she belongs out there, pushing Andreeva to deuce, but the Russian shakes her off on the next two points to hold. And she gets it with a deep strike to Boisson's backhand, which isn't coming back into play. After all the tension and tumult of that first-set finale, the atmosphere has calmed and Andreeva is working her way back into this. Second set: Andreeva 6-7, 1-0 Boisson* (*denotes next server)This is a wonderful, improbable story for Boisson – who knows it could be turning into a Raducanu at the 2021 US Open one – but I do feel for the 18-year-old Andreeva right now, fighting against the crowd. And so many of her doubles have come at crucial moments. Now it's Boisson with set point at 7-6 … and Andreeva hoiks wide! … make that 4-3, and a ripper of an inside-out forehand gets her to 5-3! She's hit 15 winners off that wing already. But Andreeva wrests back the mini-break and takes the two points on her serve, and suddenly it's the Russian with a set point at 6-5 … about 30 minutes after her first. Boisson is serving .. and Andreeva prods out!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ROLAND GARROS, PARIS — It is the sort of fairytale run that French tennis officials dream about. All the host nation's players, men and women, are usually long gone by this stage of their Grand Slam tournament. But by the middle of the second set, when Pegula began to falter and Boisson started her charge, numbing the American with a seductive mix of spins and deep, looping balls before a shock of power across the net, the French had found their new hero — and their voice. At the end, during those nervy last four games when Boisson scrambled Pegula's brain for the final time, there might not have been a soul across Roland Garros, either in the stadium itself or the plazas outside it, who wasn't all in on this woman who had played just one top-tier WTA Tour match ahead of this tournament. “In the beginning, even though there weren't many, you can still hear them on center court,” Boisson said with a combination of shyness and emotional exhaustion during her post-match news conference. “But for the third set, it was full. It was quiet to begin, as Andreeva's singeing backhand down the line and court coverage kept Boisson's weaponry at bay. But late in a first set that looked lost, Boisson started to find the patterns that had taken her past Pegula. Camping in her backhand corner, Boisson can hit inside-out forehands that rise and dip all day. But what's more important is her ability to lace them down the line, keeping her opponent honest in those diagonal exchanges. She burned Andreeva again and again and again as the set wore on, dragging the Russian into a tiebreak and stealing it away to win the first set. 361, Boisson was only playing in this tournament thanks to the generosity and desperation of France's tennis federation. Boisson, who hails from Dijon, 200 miles southeast of Paris in Burgundy, is just four months into a comeback from surgery to repair an ACL knee ligament tear. 513 then, before winning 16 of 21 lower-tier matches in the run-up to Roland Garros. When her injury happened, she was supposed to be preparing for her French Open debut, having received a wild card on the back of winning four tournaments in the first four months of 2024 and 31 matches of 38 played. Even in a week that Paris Saint-Germain became kings of European soccer, Boisson has landed on the cover of the dailies and at the top end of news programs. She is the most famous French sportswoman, if only for a fortnight. 1 and French Open tournament director — said they most likely could not: roughly two-and-a-half hours of scintillating competition worthy of the biggest stage at the event. In the round of 16, Iga Świątek, the four-time Roland Garros champion, and Elena Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon winner, went the distance in a match that saw Swiatek rise from a coffin of red clay to outlast one of her staunchest rivals. On Saturday, Boisson and her compatriot, Elsa Jacquemot, another French wild card, had wowed a packed stadium on Court Simonne-Mathieu. The triptych of banner matches for women's tennis followed a week of Moretton and Mauresmo insisting that putting a women's match in the Philippe-Chatrier night session would be bad for spectators. It would risk, they said, not giving fans the sort of entertainment for which they had plunked down hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of euros. Five days later, Mauresmo insisted that the issue wasn't about women's matches not being “worthy to play at night” but about their length. Several of the most prominent women in the tournament have had serious issues with Mauresmo's and Moretton's interpretation of what would be “better for spectators.” “I do think that women's matches are worthy of a night spot,” said Gauff, who often plays then at the U.S. Open in front of 24,000 people at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Ons Jabeur, the three-time major finalist who has been sidelined by injuries for much of the past year, targeted organizers after her first-round loss. “I hope whoever is making the decision, I don't think they have daughters, because I don't think they want to treat their daughters like this,” she said in a news conference Tuesday. Jabeur also wrote on social media: “A lot of amazing athletes have been told the same things over and over. Judgment comes quickly, often from those who've never even watched a full match. One empty stadium is held up as proof. Madison Keys, the reigning Australian Open champion, lost to Gauff in the quarterfinal before Boisson and Andreeva took the court, was characteristically understated but no less pointed in her criticism. “I think women typically have night matches everywhere else,” said Keys, whose final four matches in Melbourne, against Elina Svitolina, Rybakina, Świątek and Aryna Sabalenka, the world No. “I think women's matches are very entertaining and they have great value, and they deserve to be the feature match.” Swiatek was matter-of-fact in saying that “they should be equal”. In more than half of the night sessions in 2025, patrons have witnessed lopsided wins from the top men that didn't last as long as those missed opportunities to feature the women. Jannik Sinner (twice), Novak Djokovic and Holger Rune all dispatched their opponents in just over two hours, with the outcome of the match all but certain long before the conclusion. Carlos Alcaraz needed 94 minutes of thunderclap tennis to overwhelm an injured Tommy Paul. Richard Gasquet, a French favorite-son now ranked No. 124, and countryman Pierre-Hugues Herbert, a wild card doubles specialist, were deemed worthy of the bright lights in their mismatches against Sinner and Djokovic. And so it was for Boisson as she took on Andreeva, the brightest of new lights in the women's top 10. No other player, man or woman, has accomplished that this season. Andreeva looked like that player in the second set, moving up 3-0 with a combination of quality and mental strength. But the intriguing relationship between youth and experience at the heart of this match had not fully blossomed. With Boisson serving down 3-2, Andreeva gestured up at her box as if telling someone to leave. At 3-3, Andreeva missed a volley on top of the net and rocketed a ball into the top tier of Court Philippe-Chatrier. When Andreeva double-faulted to give Boisson the break, the match felt like it was over, and so it was. Boisson streaked her back with the red clay, celebrating the most unlikely 7-6(6), 6-3 win and semifinal berth in a match that lasted 128 minutes, 34 more than Alcaraz's beatdown of Paul. The tournament can point to tangible reasons on this occasion. Andreeva's presence in the women's doubles event means she has to play earlier because she has another match later in the day. The women's semifinals are the day after their quarterfinal, so playing earlier gives them more time to rest. But that is a necessity because the women's semifinals are played as a one-day session, straight through from 3 p.m. The men's semis are split across two sessions: 3 p.m. and “not before” 7 p.m. A similar arrangement for the women's matches would have permitted a later slot for one of their quarterfinals. Boisson, a seemingly cool cat who walked onto Chatrier for her morning hit on Monday with a sense of awe and determination, was ready for the challenge. That makes her the number one women's tennis player in France. She will get another chance to tell herself things are OK Thursday, against Coco Gauff, the world No. He is currently writing a book about tennis, "The Cruelest Game: Agony, Ecstasy and Near Death Experiences on the Pro Tennis Tour," to be published by Doubleday in 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France's Lois Boisson celebrates as she won the quarterfinal match of the French Tennis Open against Russia's Mirra Andreeva at the Roland-Garros stadium in Paris, Wednesday, June 4, 2025. France's Lois Boisson celebrates as she won the quarterfinal match of the French Tennis Open against Russia's Mirra Andreeva at the Roland-Garros stadium in Paris, Wednesday, June 4, 2025. She kept missing plenty of other strokes. She kept losing games in bunches. And all the while, she would let out a sigh or bow her head or look generally uncomfortable. What the 21-year-old Gauff never did Wednesday during a tense and topsy-turvy French Open quarterfinal against another American woman with a Grand Slam title, Madison Keys, was give up hope or go away. And, in a contest filled with plenty of mistakes, it was Gauff who emerged to grab eight of the last nine games for a 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-1 victory over Keys and a third trip to the semifinals at Roland-Garros. “I have had that in me from a young age," said the No. “When times become more difficult, knowing that I can dig deep in those tough moments.” It's not something that's taught or anything. I'm a very competitive person,” she said. “My philosophy is if I can just leave it all out there, then the loss will hurt a lot less than regrets of maybe not giving it your all.” 7 seed, who entered with an 11-match Grand Slam winning streak after her title at the Australian Open in January. They combined for 101 unforced errors and just 40 winners across more than two hours under a closed roof at Court Philippe-Chatrier on a drizzly, chilly day. But from 4-all in the second set, Gauff held four times in a row while pulling away. She made two unforced errors in the last set, including just one double-fault. After falling behind 4-1 at the start, and twice being a single point from trailing 5-1, Gauff switched to a racket with a different tension in the strings to see if that would help. I'd like to think that it helped a little bit," she said. "Sometimes that stuff could just be mental. Maybe you're thinking, 'Oh, I changed my racket, I'm going to play better, and you start doing it. She'll play Thursday for a berth in another major final, facing 361st-ranked French wild-card entry Loïs Boisson, who is on one of the most stunning runs in tennis history. 6 Mirra Andreeva 7-6 (6), 6-3 in the quarterfinals to follow up her upset of No. Boisson, 22, is the first woman to reach the semifinals in her Grand Slam debut since 1989, when Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati both did it at the French Open. A crowd that offered support to Gauff against Keys via shouts of “Allez, Coco!” was raucous as can be behind Boisson, rattling the 18-year-old Andreeva. The other women's semifinal is quite a matchup: three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek vs. No. They advanced with quarterfinal victories Tuesday. It was Swiatek who stopped Gauff at Roland-Garros in the semifinals last year and in the final three years ago. “I have a lot more work left to do,” said Gauff, who raised her arms overhead then spread them wide apart after the last point against Keys, “but I'm going to savor this one today.” Repeatedly, Gauff scrambled this way or that to get her racket on a shot from Keys and send it back, often leading to a miss. “The court being a little bit slower, coupled with the fact that she covers the court so well, just put a little bit of pressure on me to go a little bit more for my shots and maybe press a little bit too much, too soon,” said Keys, who occasionally admonished herself with a slap on her right leg. “There were a lot of points where I felt like, playing someone else," Keys said, “I would have won the point.” This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I don't know how much people paid for their night session tickets, but I certainly would have felt [cheated] to have paid for a less-than-fascinating match between [Jannik] Sinner & [Andrey] Rublev. Meanwhile, there were [four] competitive women's matches played during the day including the surprise upset of [Jessica] Pegula by a French woman, [Loïs] Boisson. That would have been a great night match. I get that there is a risk of a late night if the day session runs long and both women's matches are three sets. But, it seems [tournament director Amélie] Mauresmo et al are simply afraid to take a chance that the French crowd might be displeased. • I was going to write more about this at the end of the event, but we had so many questions this week about the absence of women … some quick thoughts: But you can't have night sessions that feature only men, as was the case this year. And Ons Jabeur raised the best point: The lack of exposure is not just an insult; it is self-perpetuating. Tell fans that women's tennis is (literally) unworthy of prime time at a major, and is it a surprise that women's matches throughout the year are not as prioritized (or attended or televised) throughout the year? The message this scheduling sends is corrosive. The message this scheduling sends is untenable. 2) Yes, women's matches tend to be shorter than men's. Yes, you run the risk of a 57-minute blowout that might make ticket holders feel shortchanged. Tell them, you are a television partner and partners help each other out and operate as a good faith relationship. This has created a PR crisis that needs addressing, even if that means amending a contract. 4) As I write this, Alexander Zverev just won his fourth round match in 52 minutes, with his opponent, Tallon Griekspoor, retiring with an injury. It is midafternoon, but this could easily have been a night match. Are you not tempting fate by staging only one match, men's or women's? 5) Mauresmo—known as something of a progressive blazer of trails in her playing days—either believes the men's only night matches is acceptable policy, or she has been trotted out as the front-facing figure to take the slings and arrows. In either case, this is a profound pity. 6) For all the challenges that bedevil tennis, this one seems exceedingly solvable. In a worst-case scenario, put on women's matches and hope you get Boisson-Pegula, not a match ending in less than an hour. Novak Djokovic's path to the second week at RG:R1: McDonald (98) R2: Moutet  (73) R3: Misolic (153)R4: Norrie (81)Watch this space. No doubt the draw fates smiled on him in Week 1. As I write this he conceivably could have to go through Zverev (his next opponent), Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz to win. I'm curious where players stay during the French Open? • First, I'm curious to hear from you how the French Open vs. Roland Garros bit is going? To digress further … imagine pulling Roland Garros, World War I pilot, aside more than 100 years ago and saying, Check this out, in 100 years your name will figure prominently in a branding exercise for a tennis tournament. One that pays the winner 2.55 million euros. Anyway, I know of one player who has an Airbnb. The men frequently embrace warmly, exchange a few words, many times more than a few, smile, pat each other on the shoulder/belly/chest, and all that. On the women's side, however, whilst there is the occasional double cheek peck to be seen, more often than not it's just the briefest of handshakes, then they turn away from each other and walk off. There is, of course, the occasional contentious match on the men's side which doesn't end so warmly, but by and large they seem a very convivial bunch, full of bonhomie in a way that seems to be missing from the ladies side. • There's a gender studies dissertation in here somewhere. My take is that it's very case-by-case. Yes, there are some WTA handshakes that come with a layer of permafrost. But then you see Daria Kasatkina and Mirra Andreeva joking with each other or Madison Keys hugging most opponents. And, yes, you have these bromances in men's tennis. We talked recently about Sinner-Alcaraz following the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivals-need-not-be-enemies model. But you also have Arthur Fils–Jaume Munar or Ben Shelton–Andrea Vavassori or matches requiring the chair umpire to double as a bouncer and break up a fight. Note I am trying to avoid a gendered conversation. But here's my take: For most players this is partially about likes and dislikes and friendships. But it is also a matter of optimizing performance. Friction and aggro is fun for fans. But for most players, the less distraction and tension and build-up, the better for their game. I have been a fan of Iga [Świątek]'s for many years now. But, in the Round of 16, [third] set at 4–4, [Elena] Rybakina double faults on a second serve for Świątek to go up 5–4. Iga says “I didn't ask you to check the mark.” Wow. I think Lindsay Davenport even said that it's the chair's job to make sure the calls are accurate (and not only if a player asks for a check). It was a great match up to that point and I was enjoying seeing Iga fight and come back, but it was hard to root for Świątek from that point forward. I know there have been other complaints about Iga's sportsmanship. Rybakina “double-faulted” and walked to the chair dejectedly, without issuing a protest. Świątek was, understandably, less than pleased that chair umpire Kader Nouni took it upon himself to examine the mark. When he ruled the serve “in,” Świątek didn't protest much. It would have been disastrous if replay had contradicted his judgment. D) This will not happen next year when robots replace people at the final major. F) Świątek won the match so any controversy was minimal. Long time tennis fan—a big fan of your mailbag as well! So … how about we start a movement to have Americans move away from pronouncing Roland Gow-ros to the correct Roland Gah-ros? Surely it can't be too difficult? A librarian who cringes at our pronunciations, Ani Both as a matter of professionalism and respect we should strive to make correct pronunciation. But at what point do we make concessions? Jasmine Paolini won last month's event in Roma? And of course there's the whole Bar-THEL-ona thing … ENJOY THESE LAST FEW DAYS of the French Open, EVERYONE!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2, came from a set down to defeat fellow American and Australian Open champion Madison Keys 6-7(6), 6-4, 6-1 on Wednesday, advancing to her third French Open semi-final in four years at Roland-Garros 2, qualified for her third semi-final in four years at the French Open, defeating Australian Open champion Madison Keys in the opening match of the day on Court Philippe-Chatrier at Roland-Garros on Wednesday (6-7, 6-4, 6-1). Gauff, runner-up in 2022, dropped her first set of the 2025 tournament against a player she had every reason to be wary of — she hadn't beaten Keys since Dubai in 2023. The loss ends Madison Keys' 11-match Grand Slam winning streak and evens her head-to-head record with Gauff at 3-3. “It means a lot, especially getting through this tough match today,” Coco said. I'm so excited to be in the semi-finals back here again. With 14 double faults and 101 unforced errors combined, the match was filled with tension — only broken by a dominant third set from Gauff, now 21 years old. In the first set, nerves were evident as both players lost their serve three times. Gauff (21 unforced errors) failed to convert a set point while leading 5-4 and eventually lost the tiebreak 8-6. After racing to a 4-1 lead with two breaks, she let the advantage slip (4-4) but fought back with aggressive play to seal the set 6-4. Serving brilliantly — not losing a single point on her first serve and hitting 71% of first serves in — Gauff didn't face a break point and broke Keys three times to close out the match in dominant fashion. “I think the court being a little bit slower coupled with the fact that she covers the court so well, it just put a little bit of pressure on me to go a little bit more for my shots and maybe press a little bit too much too soon”, said Keys. “I think also there were a lot of points where I felt like playing someone else I would have won the point, but having to reset two and three times, it makes it harder, where even if you win six of those but if you're losing three or four, they could be important points.” Gauff, ranked No 2, will face the winner of the match between Russian Mirra Andreeva, the No 6 seed, and French wildcard Lois Boisson next, to chase a spot in her third major final against Aryna Sabalenka (N.1) or triple defending champion Iga Swiatek (N.5).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The highlight of a tennis fan's summer is almost here, with the 138th edition of Wimbledon ready to get started this month. Carlos Alcaraz successfully defended his title at SW19 last year after beating rival Novak Djokovic in straight sets on Centre Court. That came after the Spaniard overcame Djokovic in 2023 in a thriller, and now the pair are going for glory yet again this time around in what could be the tennis legend's last appearance. Jannik Sinner is sure to be involved in the battle for a Grand Slam along with in-form British No.1 Jack Draper, who will aim to emulate Andy Murray. In the women's singles, No.31 seed Barbora Krejcíkova beat Jasmine Paolini to surprisingly win her first title at Wimbledon last year. But World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka will be out to end her wait for a Grand Slam title at SW19, while Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff will surely challenge too. The tournament will be played over 14 days, with it coming to a close on Sunday, July 13. Meanwhile, the women's singles final will be held a day earlier on Saturday, July 12. Start times for each day will be confirmed closer to the tournament. But last year, action got started at 11am on outer courts and 1pm on show courts, so things are expected to be similar this time around. talkSPORT will have live updates from SW19 throughout the tournament too. You can also listen via the talkSPORT app, on DAB digital radio, through your smart speaker and on 1089 or 1053 AM. A public ballot is run each year, which sees fans sign up to find out whether they have been successful or unsuccessful. However, there is still a way for members of the public to get into Wimbledon. And it is, of course, via The Queue, which is an iconic part of the event and sees fans line up in their thousands outside the venue. Each day, a queue will form and you can buy either show court tickets or ground tickets - but they are sold on a best available, first-come-first-served, one-per-person basis. Once the capacity has reached its limit, entry will only be possible if someone exits, meaning you are not guaranteed to get in. More details can be found on the Wimbledon website here.

The order in which these eight tennis players will be structured in the top ranks of the ATP ranking still needs to be determined, but what is already clear is that there is no one with the chance to break into that club. The biggest beneficiary is Tommy Paul, who will make his debut in the top 8, achieving his personal best ranking. Jack Draper could also achieve that, as long as Musetti loses in the semifinals and Djokovic doesn't reach the final. The Italian will be in the top 5 if Novak loses in the quarters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu made tennis history when she won the 2021 US Open as a qualifier. Aged 18 and playing her fourth professional tournament, the Brit stormed through the draw without dropping a set to be crowned a Grand Slam champion. But Chris Evert has issued a reminder that Raducanu had a very different path to the final than that of her opponent, Leylah Fernandez, who beat four top-20 seeds en route to the championship match before running out of gas. Although Raducanu completed an unprecedented achievement, the highest-ranked player she faced on her run was 11th seed Belinda Bencic, and Evert has reflected on the 22-year-old's campaign. “You have to remember a lot of people [top players] lost when she won that US Open and the player Emma beat in the final, Leylah Fernandez, had nothing left,” the 18-time Grand Slam champion told Tennis365. Emma didn't beat anyone in the top ten. I remember commenting on the match and you could see that. “If Leylah had won, her life may have changed forever, but Emma is the one who had to live through that experience. We will never see a qualifier come through and do what she did again, but it was tough for her after that.” 10 and Evert believes she could still get back there. If there is a solid commitment from her, I think top 10 can happen again.” This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. After a promising clay swing, which ended with a disappointing second-round thrashing at the hands of Iga Swiatek in Paris, Raducanu will be hoping to build more momentum on the grass. The 22-year-old is set to play in Queen's, Berlin and Eastbourne before Wimbledon. “I do feel comfortable obviously being at home and having that environment around me. Last year I had a great season, and I'm looking forward to kind of being in the same environment, being at home, having the home support,” she said after her French Open loss.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A little over two years ago, Emma Raducanu underwent three surgeries in just 10 days to fix issues in both wrists and one of her ankles. We were overtraining, a lot of repetition, and I carried on even through pain because I didn't want to be perceived as weak,” she admitted. Caroline Garcia, a former world No 4, recently shared a lengthy post on social media about how the idea of playing through pain is drilled into an athlete's mindset from a young age and that they're “conditioned” to believe that competing while injured is “somehow honourable or necessary”. Two weeks ago, Garcia, 31, announced she will be retiring from tennis this season. Welfare is increasingly under the spotlight with many top players airing complaints to the press about what they believe has become a gruelling and dangerous tour schedule. Those pressures might stem from an outdated coaching culture of playing through the pain barrier as Garcia suggested, but they also come from a ranking system Casper Ruud describes as a “rat race”, with potentially dire consequences for those unable to engage in the ceaseless pursuit or defence of points. Pressure also comes from sponsors, whose expectations will undoubtedly influence scheduling and vital equipment choices. Raducanu told The National in Abu Dhabi last year that the pressure to keep playing before she eventually had her multiple surgeries came “from various sources”. Still 22 and gaining experience on the WTA Tour, Raducanu confessed that taking full ownership of the major decisions affecting her career remains a work in progress. Tunisia's Ons Jabeur has wrestled with similar quandaries and finally decided to follow her gut when she pulled out of last year's US Open to repair her injured shoulder. “That decision came very late because I was suffering with my shoulder a lot. Yeah, pushing through injury, I've been doing that my whole life,” Jabeur told reporters at Roland Garros last week. Three-time major finalist Ruud had been managing a knee problem throughout the entire clay season before he suffered his earliest French Open exit since 2018, losing to Nuno Borges in the second round last week. “Of course, if my leg is broken, I won't play. But it's tough anyway, especially when there's a time with mandatory events to skip them because the punishments are quite hard, in terms of everyone else will play, gain points, and you won't. It is subject to the player fulfilling certain mandatory tournament participations. Every missed commitment could see a player's bonus compensation reduced by 25 per cent, which in some cases can be avoided by fulfilling on-site promotional activities. American Taylor Fritz said he once missed out on the bonus pool because he had a fractured foot and didn't play Madrid and Rome. You're kind of forcing players to show up injured or sick, or whatever, when that is not what I think is very fair,” he said. Skipping mandatory tournaments doesn't just affect those vying for bonus pool compensation. “As much as we have to adjust to the schedule of what we're doing and try to comply with all these tournaments and all these mandatory things that we need to attend and do, I feel like there are a few things that leave us not very flexible, such as contracts, such as tournament appearances,” said Tsitsipas. So, it did come to the cost of losing sponsors. “There was one issue with one sponsor, that if I didn't do a commercial on this specific day, they would have wiped out my contract,” she said. “And so, I was like, ‘Hey, can you compromise a little bit here?' Jabeur feels contracts for female athletes can be particularly tricky and can affect major decisions, like taking time away from the sport to have a baby. Tennis players are considered independent contractors, which theoretically affords them freedoms that other athletes, who play for teams or clubs and are part of a league, don't necessarily have. A player recently told The National they wanted to change their racquet but weren't sure how they would get out of their current contract with a specific manufacturer. “It's not an easy decision,” Tsitsipas said last month in Madrid. “It requires ferocity and being a really big risk-taker because you are used to a certain thing for so long and you don't know what's out there. Ahead of the start of this season, Madison Keys switched to Yonex when her contract with Wilson ended – a move that was heavily encouraged by her husband and coach Bjorn Fratangelo. Keys, 30, said that getting to make her own decisions was not easy at the start of her career, and it wasn't until she started working with former world No 1 Lindsay Davenport that she realised how important it was to take ownership. “She really pushed me to start making my own decisions, kind of setting my own schedule and not being afraid of getting a fine or taking a zero somewhere if I didn't want to go to a tournament,” explained Keys. Former world No 1 Andy Murray, who retired last year, does not believe players are forced to do anything – a realisation that came to him later on in his career. But that's a decision, you're saying I don't want to play because … or I'm making a decision to play because it's better for me financially.” Murray says the same goes for entering contracts with racquet manufacturers. “That's a decision you don't need to take,” said the Scot. So I don't necessarily think there's pressure on the player in that respect.” Dr Nawal Al-Hosany: Why more women should be on the frontlines of climate action Shelina Janmohamed: Why shouldn't a spouse be compensated fairly for housework?

Maros Sefcovic is juggling multiple international trade agreement files, but his message was clear when he spoke to The National on Wednesday. The EU-UAE bilateral trade deal will be finalised soon, he said. Both sides want to move quickly and are in alignment. It's full speed ahead - and with some lofty ambitions - on the road to a free trade agreement. He answered that both sides need to talk more and more often, but he is prepared to defend Europe's position and said diplomacy should be a guiding principle through the current moment. • Supports military aid for Ukraine, unlike other eurosceptic leaders, but he will oppose its membership in western alliances. • Cultivates tough-guy image, posting videos of himself at shooting ranges and in boxing rings. • Met Donald Trump at the White House and received his backing.
