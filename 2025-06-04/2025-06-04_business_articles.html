                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Education Department said Wednesday that Columbia University has failed to meet the standards for accreditation because it "is in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws" for allegedly tolerating harassment of Jewish students on campus. The Education Department's Office of Civil Rights notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, an accrediting institution that Columbia belongs to, of the alleged violation. The department noted that federal regulations, "accreditors are required to notify any member institution about a federal noncompliance finding and establish a plan to come into compliance." "If a university fails to come into compliance within a specified period, an accreditor must take appropriate action against its member institution," the department said. Education Secretary Linda McMahon, in a statement, said, "After Hamas' October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, Columbia  University's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students on its campus." "This is not only immoral, but also unlawful," McMahon said. "Accreditors have an enormous public responsibility as gatekeepers of federal student aid. They determine which institutions are eligible for federal student loans and Pell Grants. Just as the Department of Education has an obligation to uphold federal antidiscrimination law, university accreditors have an obligation to ensure member institutions abide by their standards."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. economy has contracted over the past six weeks as hiring has slowed and consumers and businesses worried about tariff-related price increases, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday. In its periodic "Beige Book" summary of conditions, the central bank noted that "economic activity has declined slightly since the previous report" released April 23. "All Districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty, which have led to hesitancy and a cautious approach to business and household decisions," the report added. Hiring was "little changed" across most of the Fed's 12 districts, with seven describing employment as "flat" amid widespread growth in applicants and lower turnover rates. "All Districts described lower labor demand, citing declining hours worked and overtime, hiring pauses, and staff reduction plans. On inflation, the report described prices as rising "at a moderate pace." "There were widespread reports of contacts expecting costs and prices to rise at a faster rate going forward. A few Districts described these expected cost increases as strong, significant, or substantial," it said. "All District reports indicated that higher tariff rates were putting upward pressure on costs and prices." There were disparities, however, over expectations for how much prices would rise, with some businesses saying they might reduce profit margins or add "temporary fees or surcharges." "Contacts that plan to pass along tariff-related costs expect to do so within three months," the report said. In early May, Trump said he would relax so-called reciprocal tariffs against China, which responded in kind, helping to set off a rally on Wall Street amid hopes the duties would not be as draconian as initially feared. Regionally, Boston, New York and Philadelphia all reported declining economic activity. Richmond, Atlanta and Chicago were among the districts reporting better growth. In New York specifically, the Fed found "heightened uncertainty" and input prices that "grew strongly with tariff-inducted cost increases. Richmond reported a slight increase in hiring despite Trump's efforts to trim the federal government payroll. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republican Sen. Ron Johnson on Wednesday blasted President Donald Trump's "one big, beautiful bill" as "immoral" and "grotesque," and reiterated that he will vote against it unless his GOP colleagues make major changes. "This is immoral, what us old farts doing to our young people," Johnson said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" after sounding alarms that the massive tax-and-spending-cut bill would add trillions of dollars to national deficits. "This is grotesque, what we're doing," Johnson said. "I can't accept the scenario, I can't accept it, so I won't vote for it, unless we are serious about fixing it," he continued. Johnson and other fiscal hawks have taken aim over its effect on the nation's debt. Johnson has proposed splitting the bill into two parts, though Trump insists on passing his agenda in a single package. "The president and Senate leadership has to understand that we're serious now," Johnson said of himself and the handful of other GOP senators whose opposition to the bill could imperil its chances. "They all say, 'Oh, we can pressure these guys.' Republicans hold a narrow 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they can only afford to lose a handful of votes to get the bill passed in a party-line vote. "Let's discuss the numbers, and let's focus on our children and grandchildren, whose futures are being mortgaged, their prospects are being diminished by what we are doing to them," Johnson said. Johnson's comments came one day after Elon Musk ripped into the spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" that will lead to exploding deficits. The White House brushed aside Musk's comments. "He's in the inside, he showed … President Trump how to do this, you know, contract by contract, line by line," Johnson said of Musk. Johnson said his campaign against the bill in its current form is not a "long shot," because he thinks there are "enough" Republican senators who will vote against the bill. "We want to see [Trump] succeed, but again, my loyalty is to our kids and grandkids," he said. "So there's enough of us who have that attitude that very respectfully we just have say, 'Mr. President, I'm sorry, 'one, big, beautiful bill' was not the best idea," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reddit is suing artificial intelligence startup Anthropic for what it's calling a breach of contract and for engaging in "unlawful and unfair business acts" by using the social media company's platform and data without authority. The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco on Wednesday, claims that Anthropic has been training its models on the personal data of Reddit users without obtaining their consent. Reddit alleges that's has been harmed by the unauthorized commercial use of its content. Reddit shares closed up more than 6% on Wednesday. Reddit follows by saying, "It is anything but." "For its part, despite what its marketing material says, Anthropic does not care about Reddit's rules or users: it believes it is entitled to take whatever content it wants and use that content however it desires,with impunity," the filing said. In an emailed statement, an Anthropic spokesperson said, "We disagree with Reddit's claims and will defend ourselves vigorously." Reddit announced a partnership with OpenAI in May that will allow the company to train its AI models on Reddit content. The company has a similar agreement with Google. In the lawsuit, Reddit said that "other giants in the AI space understand and respect Reddit's rules." It named OpenAI and Google as companies that "are permitted to use public Reddit content but only after agreeing to Reddit's licensing terms" protecting user privacy. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is a former board member and major shareholder in Reddit, with a stake now worth well over $1 billion. In March, Anthropic was valued at $61.5 billion in a funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and including participation from Salesforce Ventures and Cisco Investments. Reddit held its IPO in 2024 and now has a market cap of about $22 billion. "While Reddit has always been of the mind that the community should be open to all humans looking for connection and community, it has never allowed its platform and the countless communities who find a home on it to be appropriated by commercial actors seeking to create billion-dollar enterprises and offering nothing in return to Reddit and its users," the complaint says. Reddit said the aim of the lawsuit is to seek damages and compel Anthropic to abide by its contractual and legal obligations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI on Wednesday announced that it now has 3 million paying business users, up from the 2 million it reported in February. "There's this really tight interconnect between the growth of ChatGPT as a consumer tool and its adoption in the enterprise and in businesses," OpenAI's chief operating officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC in an interview. The company supported 400 million weekly active users as of February. OpenAI expects revenue of $12.7 billion this year, a source confirmed to CNBC. Lightcap said OpenAI is seeing its business tools adopted across industries, including highly regulated sectors like financial services and health care. Companies including Lowe's, Morgan Stanley and Uber are users, OpenAI said. The company also announced new updates to its business offerings on Wednesday. ChatGPT Team and ChatGPT Enterprise users can now access "connectors," which will allow workers to pull data from third-party tools like Google Drive, Dropbox, SharePoint, Box and OneDrive without leaving ChatGPT. Additional deep research connectors are available in beta. OpenAI launched another capability called "record mode" in ChatGPT, which allows users to record and transcribe their meetings. Record mode can assist with follow up after a meeting and integrates with internal information like documents and files, the company said. Users can also turn their recordings into documents through the company's Canvas tool. Lightcap said enterprise customers have been asking for updates like these, and that they will help make OpenAI's workplace offerings more useful. "It can't be the intern locked in a closet. OpenAI said it has been signing up nine enterprises a week, and Lightcap said the company will try to sustain that pace over time. "People are starting to really figure out that this is a part of the modern tool stack in the knowledge economy that we live in," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin for well over an hour about Ukraine's latest attack on Russian airplanes and nuclear talks with Iran. Putin in that call vowed retaliation against Ukraine for the stunning surprise attack, which Kyiv said resulted in strikes on more than 40 Russian bombers, Trump said. "It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields," the president added. Trump's post did not say if he discouraged Putin from taking that action during their 75-minute conversation. "We also discussed Iran, and the fact that time is running out on Iran's decision pertaining to nuclear weapons, which must be made quickly!" "I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement." Putin "suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion," Trump wrote. The U.S. president said that he believes Iran has been "slowwalking" its decision, adding, "we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!" We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Companies are cutting middle management positions, and the roles that remain could change significantly in the years ahead. Aneesh Raman, LinkedIn's chief economic opportunity officer, believes AI adoption — and the broader economic transformation he expects it to drive — will fundamentally change what it means to be a middle manager over the next decade. In addition, Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart have announced plans to reduce the number of managers. These cuts to midlevel roles are part of a trend some have dubbed the "Great Flattening," and reflect a broader push to reduce costs and bureaucracy — moves some corporate executives say will make their organizations more efficient. At the same time, companies are grappling with the rise of AI tools and how they might reshape their operations and workforces. I asked Raman which management skills he thinks will be most critical going forward — and how millennials, many of whom are now in management roles, might navigate their next career challenge: adapting to the evolving role of middle managers. Below are excerpts from our conversation, edited for length and clarity. Please fill out this quick form, or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com or Signal at jzinkula.29. It's not going to play out in the same way everywhere on the same timeline, but I think every company is trying to figure out how to build organizations that are able to adapt more than we have before — organizations that are less hierarchical and built more around projects. One of the biggest things that's going to look and feel different in five to 10 years is what it means to be a middle manager in the knowledge economy. How to make sure you've got teams that have psychological safety to test, and try, and fail in the service of building new things. How you're being mindful of where people's skillset and energy are best used in the course of a project as it gets built. Over the past few years, we've seen change come in waves: remote work, shifting generational values, and rising worker expectations. It's a force, alongside breakthroughs in robotics and quantum computing, that's reshaping every job, in every sector, all at once. We have a window right now to shape that shift — to make work more human, not less — but only if we act with urgency and intention. The reason I think the role of manager is going to change is the same reason I think we're entering a new economy, which is that the role of humans at work is going to be more about coming up with new ideas, coming up with new inventions, coming up with new ways of work as an employee or new businesses as an entrepreneur. That's going to be what will make work linger for humans. In that world, if you're a manager at a company, you're trying to create the best environment for people to imagine and invent, and that's a different set of tasks than in the previous economy of just tracking people's tasks and making sure those tasks were moving forward. I think every single person is having their career clock reset right now. Everyone's job is changing on them, even if they aren't changing jobs, and everyone's career trajectory is changing on them, even if they have no plans to change their career trajectory. That is something that people can approach with anxiety and fear, because we're biologically wired to be anxious and fearful of change, or it can be something that people see opportunity in so that they can start driving their career and their job in ways that give them more agency and more unique contribution than ever before. If I look at millennials and Gen Z, they have the "it" credential right now. Those are really important behaviors that everyone is going to want in their organization. If you can start by thinking about "What are my strengths?' There's a great deal of opportunity for people to figure out how they want to lean into that change. I encourage people to think about understanding their strengths, including strengths like resilience and adaptability, and then figuring out how they want to maximize the opportunity that's coming as everything gets remade. Do you have a story to share? Correction: June 4, 2025 — This story has been updated to clarify that Amazon has not announced middle manager layoffs this year. In September, it said it would flatten team structures and increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers, which could include role eliminations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The CEO of BarkBox, the company that offers a monthly subscription service for boxes of dog toys and treats, has issued a public apology for a "disrespectful and hurtful" internal message that leaked on social media. A screenshot of the message that circulated on Reddit described the decision to immediately pause paid ads and lifecycle marketing pushes for the company's Pride kit. "While celebrating Pride is something we may value, we need to acknowledge that the current climate makes this promotion feel more like a political statement than a universally joyful moment for all dog people," the message reads in part. "If we wouldn't feel comfortable running a promotion centered around another politically charged symbol (like a MAGA-themed product), it's worth asking whether this is the right moment to run this particular campaign." "Right now, pushing this promo risks unintentionally sending the message that 'we're not for you' to a large portion of our audience," the message concludes. Founder and CEO Matt Meeker apologized for the "disrespectful and hurtful" message in an Instagram post on Wednesday. While the company has donated a portion of profits from its Pride collection to an organization supporting LGBTQ people in past years, it'll donate 100% of the revenue from the collection this year, he added. The company's Pride collection is available as an optional add-on for BarkBox and Super Chewer subscribers, and has been offered for the past four years. The initial pullback on Pride isn't unique to BarkBox. Target last year scaled back its Pride Month collection after receiving backlash from conservatives over the merchandise in prior years. In late November, Walmart announced it was ending some of its DEI initiatives and taking down some LGBTQ-related merchandise from its website.</p>

War in Ukraine:

Russian intelligence was behind an arson attack on a London warehouse supplying goods to Ukraine — including Starlink satellite equipment — prosecutors alleged at the opening of a trial against six men accused of pushing Moscow's agenda on home soil.

The men live streamed the attack at the east London business, where the SpaceX-made devices and generators were stored in March last year, the prosecutors said. The firm was also involved in organizing humanitarian aid to Ukraine. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doing one thing every day that makes you smarter is a good goal to have. Here's my suggestion for today: Subscribe to BI Tech Memo. Alistair Barr is the best in the biz at breaking down what's going on in Big Tech. In today's big story, Elon Musk had some not-so-nice things to say about President Donald Trump's tax bill. Meet the key execs in Wall Street's hottest market. Tech: What a top Microsoft exec learned from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. Business: Florida real estate is showing cracks, and it could be a red flag for the rest of the country. But first, I just can't stand it anymore. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The billionaire railed against President Donald Trump's tax bill Tuesday afternoon, calling it a "disgusting abomination." Musk, known for keeping his opinions to himself, posted on X that he "just can't stand it anymore," before criticizing the "massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill." He's not the only one attacking Trump's bill. Some within the president's own party have gone after it for fueling the government's growing deficit. We're less than a week removed from his decision to leave Washington. DOGE disappointment: According to one estimate, Trump's tax bill will increase the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years. That's probably a difficult pill to swallow for Musk, who was tasked with cutting that down via DOGE. The group took extreme measures trying to achieve that, and Musk faced plenty of professional and personal backlash. Now he's seeing the tax bill "undermine" — his words, not mine — all of that work. Musk Inc. and the tax bill: Despite his recent foray into politics, Musk is still a business owner at heart. Trump's tax bill has real implications for his companies, both good (SpaceX) and bad (Tesla). BI's Ana Altchek, Alice Tecotzky and Kelsey Vlamis have a breakdown on what it means for his portfolio. The end of a friendship: Since the Trump-Musk bromance first blossomed, people have speculated when it might end. As BI's Peter Kafka put it shortly after the election, "both men are famously short-fused" and "adore the spotlight." "And that combination makes it easy to imagine a break-up down the line," Peter added. We've seen cracks in the relationship before. Musk also clashed with Trump's base over H-1B visas. Musk has a history of shooting from the hip with his takes. This could just be another example of that. After bottoming in April during a broader market sell-off, Nvidia's stock is now up 45%. These are four big catalysts spurring it on. Six Wall Street veterans on the best trades they've ever made. Senior money managers told BI about the highlights of their investing careers, from buying undervalued stocks to making well-timed exits. The secondaries market — in which investors buy and sell secondhand shares of private funds — is on pace to break last year's record highs of $160 billion. Meet 14 people who took the industry from niche to new heights. The CEO of the company, which makes AI agents for the workplace, told BI that embracing AI now would help protect jobs, not threaten them. The company's latest exec Jay Parikh is adopting Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's strategies for his new AI organization, Core AI, according to an internal email viewed by BI. Parikh shared takeaways from an annual letter Jassy sent to Amazon shareholders in a memo. Here are three of his takeaways. Since ChatGPT came out, the internet has been flooded with AI-generated content. That's sent researchers diving deep to preserve content made by humans prior to 2022, BI's Alistair Barr writes. Florida was the undisputed winner of the pandemic relocation boom, luring millions of new residents with its beaches and low taxes. Now, Floridians are experiencing an affordability crisis, hurricane-fueled insurance nightmares, and more. It's also a warning for America's real-estate market. A business immigration lawyer on Trump 2.0. The Trump administration is being as strict as possible when it comes to work-visa applications, attorney Jason Finkelman told BI. With the amount of effort and hoops to jump through, Finkelman believes it's designed to frustrate US companies into giving up on hiring foreign workers. Alvaro Munevar Jr. told BI he'd seen middle management practices that siloed workers and slowed productivity. But as Big Tech culls those roles, the remaining ones could still evolve significantly.

GOP Tax Bill:

The US Capitol in Washington, DC.

A measure in President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill that's meant to penalize foreign investors may also raise interest costs for some US borrowers.

The so-called Section 899 provision takes aim at nations such as Canada, the UK and France that have digital services taxes or other corporate tax rules the US deems unfair. Investors and companies from those countries may see gradually higher tax rates on income they earn from US assets — which some analysts have called a “revenge tax.” </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's tariffs have overall been bad news for Wall Street dealmaking, but one corner of the market is benefiting from the uncertainty: secondary investing. Verdun Perry, the head of Blackstone's $87 billion secondary investing business, predicts that the market will grow to $220 billion this year, a nearly 40% jump from last year. The first quarter, usually the slowest for the secondaries market, saw roughly $45 billion in secondaries transactions, Perry said.After more than three years of "relatively slow" distributions from private equity funds, many investors are "motivated to sell," Perry said. The investors who made the cut work for a range of firms, from megafunds like Blackstone and Ares to secondaries specialists like Ardian. They invest across a wide array of strategies, including private equity, real estate, and infrastructure. Their portfolios often include both LP-led deals — where institutional investors sell stakes in private equity funds — and GP-led transactions, in which financial sponsors offer liquidity to existing investors without offloading the underlying assets. These structures have become more common as overall deal flow remains subdued across the industry. Many of them didn't even know what secondary investing was when they were first recruited but are now leading this growing business at some of the largest and most powerful investment firms. Check out Business Insider's first list of secondaries power players, highlighting 15 top professionals in this budding industry, presented in alphabetical order by firm name. Akers got his start as an investment banker at a regional bank, researching the private markets long before every private equity buyer was just a Google search away. His early experience evaluating private equity managers helped lead Akers to join Adams Street nearly 20 years ago as a secondaries investor. He has now led the firm's secondary investing team for nearly nine years, helping grow its assets under management to $8.5 billion. Akers said he was drawn to Adams Street because of its impressive fund of funds offering, which boasts over a thousand active investments in private equity funds. "These little insights can be critical to differentiating our underwriting in a situation, and that collaboration has been enormously valuable." He sees volatility being a big boon for the industry. "We're maybe the one investment group in our offices around the world that gets excited when we see some market volatility because it usually does create a great buying opportunity," Akers said. He and Colas were two of the firm's three US-based employees. The secondaries industry was "hyper-niche," Benedetti said, but he and Colas were about to land several large deals that helped put them on the map. The pair closed a $1.9 billion deal with Bank of America in 2010, leading to similarly large deals with GE and Citibank and eventually relationships with pension and sovereign wealth funds, according to reporting at the time. The fund is already half-invested, said Colas, with an average deal size of $2 billion. He sees the market continuing to grow at a fast pace, with many transactions from the past two years coming from first-time sellers. He predicts this will most likely lead to even more deals. Benedetti added that more than half of the fund's secondaries deals were from repeat sellers. Fundraising, not seller demand, will be the biggest roadblock, Colas said. Still, they aren't afraid to get their hands dirty. "Just yesterday," Benedetti said, "we called an emergency meeting with the two of us and a team of six people hunkered down in a conference room for four hours to make a go-no-go decision for our final pricing on two multibillion-dollar deals." Seven years into his secondaries career, Keith helped launch a new line of business at Ares: investing in infrastructure assets. "Having brought them in, I was now responsible for managing that program. I was thrust into a position of responsibility very early in my career." Landmark was one of the first firms to launch a secondaries business focused on infrastructure, just as infrastructure was emerging as a sought-after asset class among buyout professionals. "I'd say North American investors were very comfortable in secondaries, but very few of them actually had infra allocations," Keith said, using shorthand for infrastructure. "You go to some places in Europe and they've got a very good feel for infrastructure, but haven't really done secondaries." "If you look at secondaries historically, you can predict the future pretty well by looking at how much capital's gone into a private market," Keith said. In that time, the firm's ownership has changed three times, from the investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, to Credit Suisse, to, finally, Blackstone in August 2013. Perry, who led negotiations for Strategic Partners, alongside Stephen Can, his then cohead and a founding partner, described the union with Blackstone as "aspirational." "Over the last 24 years, we believe that my team has done more secondary deals than anyone else," Perry said. "More than 2,200 deals, or one deal every three business days, on average." Now they could range from $1 million to over $5 billion. "We recently completed what we believe to be the largest secondaries deal in history," Perry said, referencing Strategic Partners' $5.0 billion purchase of private equity funds from a major pension fund, which a person with knowledge of the matter said involved New York City's nearly $300 billion pension for teachers, police officers, and other city workers. "We had a matter of weeks to value that portfolio." While the team has deep expertise in LP-led transactions, it has since expanded into GP-led deals, as well as real estate and infrastructure secondaries — each supported by dedicated funds. "I am one of the spokespeople for this market and have helped to put a face and a philosophy on what it is that we do," Perry said. When Perriello first joined AlpInvest in 2007, the firm had about 20 people and managed capital exclusively for two Dutch pensions. At about the same time, AlpInvest launched its first fund with outside capital, raising $700 million from 18 investors. The firm declined to comment on fundraising specifics, but Carlyle CFO John Redett said in a May earnings call that the firm was getting ready to close its latest secondary fund soon. Perriello said he's proudest of his role helping transform AlpInvest from the captive arm of a pension fund to a third-party fundraising organization. He now travels a lot in his role helping the firm raise money. "If you look at the Middle East and Asia, they've become big investors in secondary funds," Perriello said. GP-led transactions — where private equity sponsors turn to secondaries investors to provide liquidity for their LPs — have become much more common in recent years. But AlpInvest has been active in this space from the start. In fact, its first deal was a GP-led transaction. "What really separates us has been the fact that we didn't just get into the single-asset space in 2018, or we didn't start doing continuation funds in 2014," Perriello said. "At the time we raised a fund of $300 million," he said. As Ardian expanded, so did Gombault's travel schedule — managing operations across 18 offices. Eventually, he retired, but it didn't suit him. That's when a former Ardian colleague, Ingmar Vallano, reached out. "The whole industry runs on Excel models," Gombault said. The software automates portfolio data extraction from a wide range of sources — quarterly reports, news articles, and more — fundamentally transforming the secondaries workflow, Gombault said. "In secondaries, 80% of the team's time is spent on data crunching on Excel, which, if you know the salaries of private equity, that doesn't make sense," Gombault said. The firm, which was founded in 2023 with backing from asset managers General Atlantic and Carmignac, declined to comment on when it might launch its first fund. At Clipway, there are just as many tech staffers as there are investment staffers — and Gombault said they are paid like investment staff, including a form of compensation known as carried interest and an underlying share in the business. "It is very funny because now I don't know if Clipway is a technology company or an investment company," Gombault said. He said TESS had proved game-changing because it could dramatically shorten the time needed to underwrite a portfolio with 50 funds or 500 companies. "With TESS, it takes a team of 10 one week at most." Coller has helmed Coller Capital since he founded it in 1990, and he credits Saddam Hussein of all people for convincing him to venture into private equity secondaries. "In the late 1980s, private equity had been booming for a few years, everyone wanted a piece of it," Coller told BI in an email. When Coller started, there were just a few million dollars of deals annually in the market. Now, with 10 offices across four continents and $38 billion AUM, Coller Capital continues to set records. Last year, it completed the largest GP-led private credit secondary transaction, a $1.6 billion deal alongside Abry Capital. The firm has also launched offerings to bring secondaries investment to the private wealth market, broadening its investor base beyond institutional investors. Coller sees both his firm and the broader market continuing to grow, expecting total annual secondaries volume of at least $500 billion a year. Goldman Sachs is best known for its investment bank, which facilitates thousands of deals. But its asset management arm also houses one of the largest secondaries investment platforms in the world, investing over $80 billion since it was founded in 1998. When Hope joined the secondaries team in 2001, there were just four people on the team, he said, adding that there was a lot of room for innovation back then. He recalled a wave of "spin-out" deals the firm did during the 2000s banking M&A boom, turning banks' captive private equity arms into stand-alone funds after mergers, alongside more traditional LP-led deals. That spirit of innovation has helped catapult Goldman's secondaries unit from a $400 million fund with just four people to one with more than $40 billion in assets and 90 investment employees, including more than 10 dedicated engineers, known as quantitative strategists. Brittain started out in investment banking, which prepared him well when he joined Hamilton Lane as a secondaries investor 15 years ago. "I knew how to value companies, how to execute and negotiate transactions, and I knew a lot of private equity firms," Brittain said. Hamilton Lane was taking a chance on him, too, he said. "I didn't know much about secondaries," Brittain said. Now, Brittain is cohead of the platform, which boasts $24 billion in assets under management. Among his biggest milestones: He helped raise $5.6 billion for Hamilton Lane's sixth secondary fund — announced last year as the firm's largest closed-end fund to date. He's also taken on a leadership role sourcing deals, helping double the team's deal flow in recent years. Before Trump's tariff proclamations rattled markets in April, deal flow in the market was up 60% from last year, "on pace to be another record year," Brittain said. Activity has remained strong since, but buyers are becoming more selective, targeting higher-quality funds, he said. "We will have another year where liquidity is going to be top for investors," Brittain said. Keay joined HarbourVest in 1999, becoming the fifth member of a secondaries team that has been active since 1986. "Our team's founder, Fred Maynard, and his partner, John Begg, were the only managing directors who have ever left the secondary team," Keay said. Both retired over a decade ago, and Keay soon stepped into his current role. Today, the team has grown to more than 60 members worldwide. The firm has long been active in GP-led deals. Keay pointed to its spin-out transactions, which helped launch several now-prominent private equity firms — beginning with MidOcean Partners, the $11 billion AUM firm that HarbourVest spun out of Deutsche Bank. "They picked a name and became an independent buyout manager," Keay said. Despite his deep experience, Keay no longer spends much time landing deals — the original "passion" that he says brought him to secondaries. Instead, he focuses on mentoring the next generation of HarbourVest investors. Warren joined Lexington Partners just as the firm spun out of Landmark Partners, one of the earliest secondaries specialists, which is now owned by Ares. That was back in 1994, when the secondaries industry had barely begun. Lexington, which remains under Warren's leadership, has been busy ever since. As university endowments face continued challenges under the Trump administration, similar transactions are expected to follow. This year, the firm launched a secondaries fund for private wealth investors, reaching nearly $1 billion in AUM. Lexington did not respond to comment requests for this story. Perkins has been investing in secondary private markets since the 1990s, beginning his career at the storied Wall Street firm Bankers Trust before its acquisition by Deutsche Bank in 1999. A veteran of the space, Perkins is bullish on today's environment. "Having invested in secondary private equity for more than two decades, this appears to me to be one of the most attractive environments I have experienced," he told BI. After Deutsche Bank exited its private equity investments, Perkins and some of his Bankers Trust colleagues jumped to Neuberger Berman, launching the firm's secondaries platform with an $800 million fund in 2005. "Many of my peers at buyouts firms only make one or two investments a year, and some years they don't make any at all." Now a managing director, Perl has played a key role in expanding Neuberger's secondaries platform, which has completed over $16 billion in GP-led deals across 55 transactions since its founding. "They said it was like landing five planes simultaneously." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was disappointed to hear Elon Musk's critique of President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill." I have come to consider Elon a good friend. He's obviously a very intelligent person, and he's done a lot of great work," Johnson told reporters on Tuesday. "But with all due respect, my friend Elon is terribly wrong about the one big beautiful bill," Johnson added. Johnson said he had a "friendly conversation" with Musk on Monday, where he pitched the bill's merits to the Tesla and SpaceX CEO. "He and I spoke for, I think, more than 20 minutes on the telephone, and I extolled all the virtues of the bill and he seemed to understand that," Johnson said on Tuesday. In his post, Musk called Trump's signature tax bill a "massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill" and a "disgusting abomination." On May 22, House Republicans passed Trump's "big beautiful bill" and sent it to the Senate. GOP lawmakers hope the bill will be sent to Trump's desk on July 4. This isn't the first time Musk has criticized Trump's signature tax bill. Musk told "CBS Sunday Morning" in an interview that aired on June 1 that he was disappointed with the bill. I don't know if it could be both," he added. Musk said on May 28 that he was wrapping up his 130-day tenure as a special government employee leading the White House DOGE office. In his interview with CBS, Musk said he did have "differences of opinion" with the Trump administration but did not specify what they were. "But it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention," Musk told CBS. But I also don't wanna take responsibility for everything the administration's doing," he added. Musk did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla could take a hit if President Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" becomes law. Elon Musk's AI company, however, may get a boost. Many of Musk's companies rely largely on federal regulations, subsidies, or contracts. That means the GOP's federal spending bill, if signed into law, could directly affect his businesses. "This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination." "Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong," he said in criticism directed at the Republican politicians who voted in favor of the bill. Musk's sharp words for Trump's bill come just days after he officially left his position as the de facto head of the DOGE office, ending his formal work at the White House. In recent weeks, both Trump and Musk have looked to assure the public that their relationship remains intact, even if they disagree on some issues. It also includes administration priorities, including removing taxes on tips and overtime. While Tesla stands to lose, companies such as SpaceX and xAI may benefit from the president's massive spending bill. It would largely phase out the clean vehicle credit, which lets people buying a new EV claim up to $7,500, and up to $4,000 for used EVs. Tesla delivered more than 336,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025 alone. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Others don't seem sold on Musk's rationale. "Consumers have increased long-range EV choices at similar price points as Tesla," Goldstein said. Goldstein said that tax credit elimination could lead to a decrease in sales volume, which the automaker has been struggling with. The JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in an investor note that Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill," combined with other proposed legislation, including ending the California Air Resources Board Program, threatened more than half of Tesla's 2025 profits. Brinkman wrote in the note that the $7,500 consumer tax made up 19% of Tesla's 2024 earnings before interest and tax and could result in a $1.2 billion headwind. Tesla is betting big on AI and robotics as it pushes to reach full autonomy, in part through its coming robotaxi service, efforts that Musk has said are key to growing the company's valuation. Brinkman said any material benefit from Tesla's autonomous robotaxi business was years away, while the headwind from EV subsidy removal would most likely hit the automaker in 2025 and 2026. "We expect estimates to come down as the impact of Trump Administration EV subsidy removal becomes clearer," Brinkman wrote. Trump's spending bill wouldn't only change existing taxes and fees. Under its current language, it would also impose a $250 yearly fee for EV drivers through the Federal Highway Administration, and a $100 yearly fee for hybrid vehicles. As written, the bill also scraps a loan program that Tesla utilized in 2010, long before Trump entered the political scene. The spending bill also threatens Tesla's energy business, which Musk has said is "growing like wildfire," by ending energy tax credits. Tesla Energy also added that it was urging the Senate to enact legislation with a "sensible wind down" to continue speedy deployment that supports AI and domestic manufacturing. "This bill would hurt Tesla around the energy tax credits going away," Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst who's a noted Tesla bull, told BI. Trump's spending bill, if signed into law, may also help his AI company, xAI. One section of the bill prohibits states and local governments from regulating AI for the next decade in an effort to remove legal barriers related to deploying and adopting AI. That could allow Musk to develop and advance xAI with less red tape on the regulatory side to slow the company down. Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.</p>
