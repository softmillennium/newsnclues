Clicking the link takes victims to phishing sites or dApps that ask them to input sensitive information like account passwords and wallet recovery seed phrases. Unlike blockchains that store data in sequential blocks, hashgraph uses a gossip protocol and virtual voting to achieve consensus, allowing for faster, more scalable, and more energy-efficient operations. This technology was introduced in 2018 as a next-generation distributed ledger aiming to overcome the limitations of conventional blockchains, and scammers have started to target it more as its popularity and adoption rise. FBI says that fraudsters currently promote their fraud campaigns beyond the unsolicited NFT airdrops, including phishing emails, social media advertisements, and fake websites. When receiving airdrop alerts, it is advisable to always verify their legitimacy with the official source before engaging. Finally, cryptocurrency accounts should be regularly monitored for signs of unauthorized activity/transactions and suspicious login attempts. If you suspect you have been compromised by scammers, it is advisable to contact your account providers and report it as soon as possible.

Yuga Labs has recently started slimming down, handing over IP rights to several NFT collections — including CryptoPunks and Moonbirds — in what may signal a shift for the once-dominant NFT giant. Meanwhile, Moonbirds — another blue-chip collection — has landed in the hands of a relatively unknown gaming company called Orange Cap Games. Nicki Schiller, chief of staff at Yuga Labs, emphasized in a commentary for crypto.news that “with Punks, we remain the largest holder and chose Node for their ability to steward the legacy — we'll stay involved via the advisory council.” These moves reflect a clear focus: Yuga is going all-in on Apes, Otherside, and what's next.” Prices were sky-high and one CryptoPunk famously sold for over $23 million in Ethereum (ETH), and that sort of thing doesn't really happen anymore. CryptoPunks were created by Matt Hall and John Watkinson of Larva Labs in 2017. Long before the Bored Apes took over Twitter profile pics, the Punks were already being auctioned by Christie's, an art and luxury auction house. Yuga came in during peak hype, acquiring multiple NFT collections. But now, it's offloading those same assets — and not just CryptoPunks. The deal includes not just Moonbirds, but also related spinoffs Mythics and Oddities. Orange Cap Games described the acquisition in an X post as a chance to bring “beloved IPs to life through carefully crafted experiences that introduce them to new fans and deepen the connection with existing communities.” The company emphasized its excitement about taking over the Moonbirds franchise, stating that Moonbirds “have simply been nesting during the bear market, filled with untapped possibility, and under our stewardship, it is now time to take flight.” Orange Cap Games has a track record in NFT gaming, having launched Vibes TCG, a collectible card game centered around the Pudgy Penguins IP, which “celebrates culture, community, and joy.” The studio prides itself on attention to detail, saying that “those who know us through Vibes know that we obsess over excellence, whether in game design, physical product development, or creative execution.” “Moonbirds deserve a team whose whole world is the birds,” he said, praising Orange Cap Games' execution so far. Regarding the blockchain environment, Orange Cap Games pointed out that that future on-chain components of Moonbirds created by them will be on either mainnet or, if on a layer-2, will exclusively use ApeChain, a network which was also backed by Yuga Labs. Yuga Labs seems to be doubling down on what it sees as core, with Solano saying in an X post that the firm is “laser-focused on Apes, Otherside, and something special we've been cooking up.” When Yuga acquired CryptoPunks' IP, “it wasn't just about ownership — it was about honoring a cultural icon we believed in,” said Yuga Labs co-founder Wylie Aronow, adding that giving the brand away was “a full-circle moment.” Founders from both Larva Labs and Art Blocks are on its advisory board, and a live Ethereum node will run at its new facility to emphasize decentralization. “We'll be sharing more on all of this soon,” she added. It's just quieter, more mature, and, possibly, a bit wiser.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His comments came ten days after the central bank released a second progress report on its digital yen pilot program, which involves seven working groups and 64 private companies through the CBDC Forum. These groups are tackling different aspects of digital currency development through both technical implementation and theoretical research. One working group is examining how CBDCs might integrate with emerging technologies like distributed ledger technology (DLT). However, they concluded this approach isn't currently viable due to scalability limitations, privacy concerns and governance challenges. Another avenue under consideration involves using CBDCs to settle security token transactions on permissioned blockchains, though this approach would require pre-funding mechanisms. Drawing inspiration from the UK's Project Rosalind, another working group focused on application programming interfaces (APIs). Their research emphasized the need for modular, basic APIs that could be combined like building blocks to create more sophisticated applications. While APIs offer valuable functionality, the researchers noted that excessive usage could create performance bottlenecks. For instance, frequent API calls to verify transaction completion could strain the system. Despite having no immediate issuance plans, Japan will continue its CBDC research efforts. Beyond domestic considerations, Japan participates in Project Agorá, a BIS-led international initiative involving seven central banks and 41 institutions. This project aims to enhance cross border payments by combining CBDCs, tokenization, and correspondent banking. While Japan explores digital currency possibilities, its timeline remains tied to actual market demand rather than technological capability.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kazakhstan's Minister of Digital Development, Innovations and Aerospace Industry, Zhaslan Mädiyev At the Astana International Forum, Kazakhstan's Minister of Digital Development, Innovations and Aerospace Industry, Zhaslan Mädiyev, laid out a sweeping vision for the country's future in a detailed conversation covering everything from cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence to aerospace and global partnerships. Mädiyev described how Kazakhstan is rapidly becoming a regional and global leader in digital innovation by creating a regulatory and technological framework designed for the challenges of the 21st century. “Kazakhstan is quite active in terms of developing the crypto ecosystem and trying to promote a crypto-friendly environment for changing organizations and promoting innovative solutions in the whole value chain,” Mädiyev said. The Digital Ministry is the regulator of crypto mining, and we are also regulating mining pools.” The country's digital infrastructure includes over 60 operating mining firms and more than 10 officially licensed exchanges, among them global giants like Binance, Bybit, Bitfinex, and Binone. Mädiyev emphasized that this ecosystem is supported by the Astana International Financial Center, which regulates crypto exchanges, and Astana Hub, a dedicated innovation zone where crypto and blockchain startups benefit from zero tax incentives. One of the most ambitious plans is to establish a crypto city. “The President's idea is to define a crypto city that will be completely crypto-friendly, where crypto can be a legal tender — you can pay in restaurants, in cafes, purchase real estate, invest in crypto,” Mädiyev said. On concerns that crypto might threaten the national currency, Mädiyev was reassuring. “We believe, as per my expectation, it shouldn't have a huge negative impact on the currency. “We already established official crypto-fiat channels, and we didn't see a massive run on deposits or on the national currency.” He added that there is still a technological and psychological barrier among the public. Also, the availability of local currency instruments with good yields makes crypto less attractive for many citizens.” Asked about Kazakhstan's broader digitalization priorities, Mädiyev pointed to impressive achievements. “For the last 10 years Kazakhstan has been investing a lot into digital transformation,” he said. “We became a top 24 country in terms of the UN's e-government development index and top 10 in terms of online service quality. Over 90% of public services are available online, and 90% of transactions in Kazakhstan are cashless.” The Minister highlighted that the country is among the first to pilot a Central Bank Digital Currency, and that most personal documents are now fully digital and legally equivalent to physical ones. A five-year conceptual framework is already being implemented and will soon be formalized as the national AI strategy. “We are forming an AI Council under the President, with international experts like Peter Norvig, Kai-Fu Lee, and Laura Tyson as members,” he noted. A draft AI law is also expected this year, setting out terminology, ethical standards, product labeling, and risk management. In terms of infrastructure, Mädiyev announced that Kazakhstan is about to launch a supercomputer cluster this July. We opened a first cluster in the U.S. to train Kazakh LLMs — on Lama, YeLightning, DeepSeek, Falcon — and now we are bringing that power home,” he said. A national AI platform is already in place, giving public employees access to tools like GPUs, data sets, and low-code environments to create their own AI engines. Mädiyev also revealed a massive human capital development program. “We announced a plan to train one million people over five years in AI — 500,000 schoolchildren, 300,000 university students, 90,000 public sector employees, 80,000 corporate sector employees, and 30,000 from other areas,” he said. “We opened the first AI school in the region — Tomorrow School — a peer-to-peer model created with Nicolas Sadirac, founder of École 42,” Mädiyev said. “It will be a center of excellence with big tech companies, startups, public and event spaces, hackathon zones, an AI museum, café, cinema, and kids' zone,” Mädiyev described. On Kazakhstan's growing cooperation with the UAE, Mädiyev emphasized strong ties in logistics, renewables, and digital technology. In our sector, we have two key projects — a supercomputer cluster and a Smart City initiative with G42, an AI company from the UAE,” he said. G42's Presight AI has hired over 40 Kazakh specialists and is developing a smart control center with thousands of cameras, due to be finalized by the end of the year. “We're vertically integrated: we run the world's largest cosmodrome, have launch pads, and started producing our own launch vehicles and satellites,” Mädiyev said. “For the first time, we began exporting satellites — to Mongolia, Congo, and others. All production is certified by Airbus through our joint venture.” The country is now testing AI applications in image labeling and processing, with long-term ambitions to embed AI capabilities directly onto satellites. Mädiyev concluded by emphasizing the international reach of Kazakhstan's tech ecosystem. “We have over 1,500 startups — in blockchain, medtech, edtech, defense tech, and more. Our IT hubs in Saudi Arabia, Silicon Valley, and Europe are giving them global access,” he said. One standout example is Higgsfield AI, a Kazakh startup working on text-to-video generation. With its bold national strategies, international partnerships, and homegrown talent, Kazakhstan is emerging as a digital powerhouse — not just in Central Asia, but on the global stage.

China-based Webus International (WETO) filed a Form 6-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday with plans to build a $300 million XRP-focused corporate treasury.

The filing follows an earlier May announcement by the firm, which aims to fund the initiative using loans and credit facilities rather than new share issuances.

Webus plans to integrate Ripple's payment network into its business, aiming to streamline cross-border payments and improve booking transparency across its global chauffeur services.

The announcement follows VivoPower International's plans to build a $121 million XRP treasury, indicative of growing interest from corporations in the fourth-largest token by market cap.

The financing plan is non-binding and subject to final agreements and due diligence.

The provider of customizable car and touring services for travelers worldwide added that it was renewing a partnership with Tongcheng Travel Holdings, one of China's largest online travel agencies, to extend their “Wetour x Tongcheng” charter lines, stating they would aim to use the XRP Ledger to settle cross-border rides and driver payouts.

XRP is up 2% in the past 24 hours, alongside muted gains in the broader crypto market. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq-listed firm's shares rose about 9% in early trading on Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least 60 Bitcoin strategy adopters among publicly listed companies collectively doubled BTC holdings in the past two months, outstripping the buying speed of Michael Saylor's Strategy. Update (June 4, 1:00 pm UTC): This article's headline and the piece have been updated to emphasize that Standard Chartered's sample included 61 out of a total of 124 publicly listed companies that have adopted Bitcoin treasury strategies, as reported by BitcoinTreasuries. The Bitcoin reserve strategy trend has led to 61 publicly listed firms now holding a combined 3.2% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist, according to Standard Chartered. In the report, Kendrick focused on the implications of Bitcoin's growing popularity as a treasury asset, warning about potential risks stemming from rapid corporate adoption. “For now, we think this is justified by market inefficiencies, including regulatory hurdles to investor access and conservative investment committee processes,” Kendrick wrote, adding: Kendrick also observed that a large portion of Strategy “imitators” have started Bitcoin accumulation recently, with holdings rising significantly in the past few months. Standard Chartered's report came amid a new batch of companies announcing Bitcoin strategy adoption, including Canada's renewable energy developer SolarBank. SolarBank officially announced its Bitcoin treasury strategy on June 3, reporting it has filed an account opening application with Coinbase Prime to provide secure custody, USDC (USDC) services and a self-custodial wallet for its Bitcoin holdings. Related: Michael Saylor's Strategy offers $250M preferred stock to buy more Bitcoin On the same day, Paris-based crypto firm Blockchain Group announced a $68 million Bitcoin acquisition, following in the footsteps of Norwegian crypto brokerage firm K33, which raised $6.2 million to buy BTC in late May. While Standard Chartered focused on 61 public companies holding Bitcoin, the actual number is more than twice as big. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries, there are 124 companies holding Bitcoin at the time of publication. According to Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor, the company's capital structure is constructed to remain stable even if Bitcoin falls 90% and “stays there for four or five years.” “It wouldn't be a good outcome for the equity holders. According to some prominent industry figures, such as former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, the companies that add Bitcoin to their balance sheets are definitely taking risks, but these risks are manageable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Bitcoin price is still ping-ponging between support and resistance, but is still moving in favor of the bulls at this point. This is due to the fact that the price is still holding well above $100,000, and this is a psychological level that could be a determinant of a bull or bear move. Amid this, crypto analyst Xanrox believes that the Bitcoin price is headed down after hitting its new all-time high close to $112,000, and this downtrend would push altcoins down further. Why The Bitcoin Price Is Breaking Down This was seen in the initial downtrend that sent Bitcoin from $111,000 down to $103,000, before the relief rally. This is also important to keep an eye on since symmetrical triangles are known for sweeping liquidity. While these liquidity sweeps are not one-sided, it is still notable as it can sweep liquidity above and below the triangle. In this case, it is expected to fall back to the 0.382, 0.500, and 0.618 Fibonacci levels again. At this level, the crypto analyst believes that it is time to start buying. In addition to the chart formations, Xanrox also calls out an unfilled Fair Value Gap (FV) at this level, and once it fills, it is a great level to start buying before the next wave to the upside. If this decline does happen, then altcoins are expected to actually fall further from here. This would put them at great buy levels as well, especially as altcoins are sitting so close to all-time low levels. “Usually we want to look for a buying opportunity at the 0.382, 0.500, or 0.618 FIB levels,” the crypto analyst explained.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After stagnating for more than a year, Ethereum has clawed its way back into relevance this quarter. Its price is up 44% in the last month, massively outperforming Solana's modest 7% and even besting Bitcoin's 26% uptick during the period. Ethereum, once again, is winning the confidence of investors that it can rewire finance. “The recent rally in Ethereum's price isn't just about short-term positioning, but rather is a reflection of a deeper shift in the market's understanding of what the future of blockchain infrastructure will look like,” Dom Harz, cofounder of BOB, a hybrid layer 2 blockchain, told DL News. Ethereum exchange-traded funds have consistently notched positive daily flows in the last month. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $1.2 billion in outflows this week. Ethereum has drawn attention for its recent Pectra upgrade, and investors are taking note of the “narrative shift.” “Ethereum is the likeliest platform choice for many financial institutions due to its superior security and stability,” Sygnum analysts wrote in the bank's monthly investment outlook report for June. Ethereum has recorded more than $1 billion in flows into the network in the last three months, dwarfing all other blockchains, including its layer 2 networks. This massive inflow spike coincided with the Pectra upgrade, which analysts say has helped Ethereum regain the initiative from layer 2 networks that some critics said were economically strip-mining it. Buterin has proposed expanding the network's ability to handle more transactions per block and also implementing stateless clients, network nodes that don't store Ethereum's entire history, a move that could reduce hardware demands for some participants. Despite the price uptick this quarter, Ethereum is still 46% below its all-time high of over $4,800. A staking-based ETF, previously seen as a regulatory long shot, could be the catalyst to boost Ethereum's price prospects. Such products suddenly seem possible thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission softening its stance on staking-based vehicles not qualifying as securities. But Ethereum isn't lapping the field just yet as its rivals are looking to reclaim lost ground. Despite losing its edge amid backlash over the memecoin-fuelled craze, Solana proponents say the network is working to course-correct. XRP is also quietly gaining traction as a crypto asset for corporate balance sheets. Companies like VivoPower and Webus have announced plans to begin stockpiling XRP.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since Saylor first announced his plans to do so in August 2020, Strategy has spent $40.7 billion to amass more than 580,000 bitcoins and become the largest corporate holder of the world's largest cryptocurrency. His company's stock has climbed more than 2,900%, far ahead of the S&P 500's 76% gain. Since 2023, public companies have increased their exposure to the digital asset by 160% and now hold roughly 3.4% of all bitcoins in circulation, according to Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. In all, 80 companies have adopted the so-called “bitcoin standard” by holding bitcoin as part of their treasury reserves, according to Bernstein and data tracked by Coinkite. Recently, the limits for investor interest in such a play were tested. Last week, the stocks of Trump's namesake media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), and video game retailer GameStop each fell about 10% following separate announcements to amass bitcoin. Trump Media unveiled plans to raise $2.5 billion to create what it claims will be one of the largest bitcoin treasuries held by any public company, noting it is part of a broader strategy to integrate digital assets across its media and financial ecosystem. "We view bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom," Trump Media CEO and chair Devin Nunes said in the release. GameStop and Trump Media — the parent company of social media platform Truth Social and streaming service Truth+ — are not the only firms outside of the cryptocurrency world making a pivot to Saylor's approach. “It's not complicated, it's not even risky, in my opinion, it's just novel,” Saylor last month said to an audience that showed up for an Orlando, Fla., conference focused on showing other firms how to adopt his bitcoin treasury strategy. Bitcoin, Saylor explained, was their best chance out of this predicament. “Since there is no visible road ahead for value creation” at those firms, and “the success of the MSTR model offers them a rare value creation path, these companies are uniquely positioned to adopt Strategy's Bitcoin playbook,” Chhugani added. There are risks to this approach, however, since bitcoin can be volatile. “The main risk in running a leveraged 'bitcoin treasury' strategy is that a rapid drop in the price of bitcoin would lead to a possibility of bankruptcy,” NYU Stern School of Business professor David Yermack told Yahoo Finance. “Not every Bitcoin treasury will be successful simply replicating MSTR's playbook, in our view.” “I'm personally curious to see how the market is going to figure us out,” Jack Mallers, CEO of Twenty One Capital Inc., a soon-to-be public company imitating Saylor's Strategy with backing from Japanese investment firm SoftBank, stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings, and Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald LP. Twenty One has raised $685 million in capital from private investors by issuing both debt and equity, making it the third-largest bitcoin holding company. The stock price for this investment vehicle has climbed 300% since its April announcement. While admitting doubts that all firms imitating Strategy will make it, Mallers pointed to bitcoin's 16-and-a-half-year track record as the clearest signal for his firm's future success. “Investors should always be careful assuming they're intellectually superior to the market," Mallers said. Another Strategy follower, Nakamoto Holdings, wants to add another layer of complexity to the bitcoin treasury scheme when it officially launches in the third quarter through a reverse merger. The plan is to acquire and become a maker of more Strategy imitators. David Bailey, a crypto adviser to Trump and founder of BTC Inc., will run the company as CEO post-merger. He said in an interview last month that Nakamoto is seeking to turn 25 separate public companies into Strategy imitators “within the year." Nakamoto, which will trade under the ticker NAKA, saw its fundraising surge in reaction to Twenty One Capital's announcement. Through a mix of equity and short-term loans from private investors, including Chinese crypto billionaire Jihan Wu, the company has raised $710 million, according to its press release. KindlyMD, the healthcare software company Nakamoto is using as a vehicle for quick public listing, has seen its stock climb 370% since the May 12 announcement. “Frankly, it's almost like the meme stock phenomenon where we know people are piling in just because it has worked for MicroStrategy,” Columbia Business School professor Omid Malekan said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan currently has no plan to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) but must continue innovating its payment and settlement system in an increasingly cash-less society, a senior central bank official said on Wednesday.

Although banknote issuance remains high in Japan, usage of notes could fall significantly in the future amid rapid digitalisation, said Bank of Japan (BOJ) Executive Director Kazushige Kamiyama.

“As such, Japan must consider what steps it can take now to ensure its retail settlement system is convenient, efficient, accessible universally, while being safe and resilient,” he said in a speech.

While the BOJ currently has no plan to issue a CBDC, it must keep up efforts to enhance the safety and efficiency of Japan's payment and settlement system, Kamiyama said in a meeting with  private firms on a pilot programme for developing a digital yen.

The BOJ has said no decision has been made yet on whether Japan will actually issue a CBDC, which must be made by the government and parliament.

But the central bank has been conducting experiments and exchanging views with private firms on a digital yen, to be ready in case Japan decides to issue a CBDC.

CBDCs are back in the spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump banned work on a digital dollar in one of his first moves after regaining power in January.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoins show promise for global payments but remain largely unused in everyday commerce due to user friction, regulatory hurdles and back-end complexity, especially in developed markets like the U.S. Success may depend on making stablecoin use seamless and invisible to users, allowing traditional institutions to integrate them behind familiar interfaces while handling blockchain complexities in the background. Emerging markets are leading adoption, with stablecoins already seen as more stable alternatives to local currencies and enabling efficient cross-border transactions through integrations with domestic payment systems like PIX, M-Pesa and GCash. Outside of perhaps AI, few technologies have generated as much curiosity and confusion as stablecoins have within payments and commerce over the past 18 months. By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Despite the hype, and their utility across non-U.S. payment landscapes, these digital assets, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to an allegedly stable mix of assets like U.S. treasuries, have yet to enter the mainstream of everyday commerce. Same with using it to pay for something like school tuition. But that hasn't stopped both the payments and crypto industries from working to build solutions that can help make stablecoins practical, scalable, and seamlessly integrated into real-world business flows. “Stablecoins are a great way to transfer value,” Kirill Gertman, CEO of Conduit, told PYMNTS in an interview. But the challenge happens when you actually need to use USDC or USDT for something.” For financial institutions (FIs) and payment service providers (PSPs) that are no longer asking if they should engage with blockchain, but how best and most responsibly to do so, stablecoins likely top the list of interest. But the journey from zero to crypto isn't plug and play. Institutions face steep learning curves around regulation, compliance and back-end complexity. The goal, after all, is not to turn everyone into a crypto user. Read more: Crypto Rulemaking Has FinTech Rushing in, TradFi Waiting to See For stablecoins to achieve mass adoption within mainstream financial services, user experience must be indistinguishable from today's digital money. The most promising models do not require users to hold private keys, manage gas fees, or understand token standards. Instead, users interact with familiar interfaces such as mobile apps, dashboards, payment portals; all while the stablecoin machinery operates invisibly in the back end. We take your money and send it somewhere else. His firm, which raised a $36 million Series A last week (May 28), aims to facilitate cross-border B2B and B2B2C flows by letting businesses move money globally using stablecoins as the liquidity rail. Traditionally, cross-border B2B trade has leaned heavily on net-30, -60 or -90 payment terms. “Customers are now saying, ‘I can pay you today. And often, the answer from suppliers is yes,” Gertman said. “Imagine sending money from here to Uruguay,” Gertman said. To get there, the backend may look complex — currency conversions, stablecoin burns, bank settlements. For FIs and PSPs, stablecoins can serve as on-ramps to more sophisticated digital finance use cases, ranging from real-time FX and supply chain finance to smart contract-based credit scoring. The crypto era once promised to disrupt traditional finance. For institutions that embrace this evolution, the potential is significant: faster settlements, broader reach and programmable financial products that operate at internet speed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a post on X Tuesday, Jack Lu, the CEO of a digital asset marketplace called Magic Eden, said his firm had collaborated with GetTrumpMemes -- the firm behind the $TRUMP meme coin -- on $TRUMP Wallet, a digital app that allows users to conduct financial transactions. But within hours, Eric Trump wrote on social media that "I run @Trump and I know nothing about this project!" Donald Trump Jr. added that he "has zero involvement with this wallet product," and teased plans for a separate digital asset wallet under a different Trump-affiliated crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. Despite those disavowals, the $TRUMP Wallet that launched Tuesday claimed to be the "First and Only Crypto Wallet for True Trump Fans." "Our partnership with the $TRUMP team to build @TrumpWalletApp represents our commitment to onboarding mainstream audience deeper into crypto," Lu wrote on X. ABC News has reached out to Magic Eden for clarification on the venture. As of Tuesday afternoon, X -- the social media company run by Trump ally Elon Musk -- had suspended the account for @TrumpWalletApp. The $TRUMP Wallet website contains little information about the platform itself, but invites visitors to sign up for a waitlist ahead of a formal launch at some later date. Critics have raised concerns about the Trump administration's regulatory role over cryptocurrencies while the president stands to personally benefit from cryptocurrency ventures. "We got into politics and all of a sudden [the banks] wouldn't take our call," he said. "We went all in on a concept that makes total sense because we'd actually been the recipients of how quickly that can be shut off."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform moved a step closer to having a bitcoin exchange-traded fund available to everyday investors. Known as a 19b-4 form, the filing is required before regulators can decide whether to allow the fund to launch and trade on a U.S. exchange. The filing follows an announced partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com in March to bring a suite of digital asset products to market later this year, pending regulatory approval. Those planned offerings include baskets of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and Crypto.com's native Cronos token, combined with traditional securities. The products will be branded under Trump Media and made available to global investors through major brokerage platforms and the Crypto.com app, which serves more than 140 million users worldwide. Since the January 2024 launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, the market has swelled to more than $130 billion in total assets. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) accounts for the lion's share, with nearly $69 billion in assets, making it the largest digital asset manager in the world. Trump is the majority owner of Truth Social's parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group, which has made a series of crypto-aligned moves in recent months — from trademarking digital asset products to unveiling a $2.5 billion bitcoin treasury plan last week in Las Vegas.
