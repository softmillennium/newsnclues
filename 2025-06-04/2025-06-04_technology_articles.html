That shit is infuriating and a much bigger real world problem. It's a big company, our corporate network is very very large.A better definition of "local IP" would be whether the IP is in the same subnet as the client, i.e. look up the client's own IP and subnet mask and determine if a packet to a given IP would need to be routed through the default gateway. It would be really annoying if this use case was made into an unreasonable hassle or killed entirely. One particular example I can think of is UPS's label printer API that prints shipping labels off their website.Eventually someone will 'helpfully' point out that workarounds wouldn't be necessary if everyone just used Google owned and operated services instead. *Cue Charlie Brown arm-waving and some mumbling about 'security'.I'm really getting tired of this.

I often see sites like Paypal trying to probe 127.0.0.1. I guess once this is added maybe the proposed device opt in mechanism could be used for applications to cooperatively support access without a permission prompt? It would be nice to know when a site is probing the local network. But by the same token, here is Google once again putting barriers on self sufficiency and using them to promote their PaaS goals.They'll gladly narc on your self hosted application doing what it's supposed to do, but what about the 23 separate calls to Google CDN, ads, fonts, ect that every website has your browser make?I tend to believe the this particular functionality is no longer of any use to Google, which is why they want to deprecate it to raise the barrier of entry for others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ahead of the new season, Science Saru and GKids are collaborating again to release Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye, a theatrical cut featuring the first three episodes of the second season. This release will also include a special behind-the-scenes interview with co-directors Fuga Yamashiro and Abel Gongora. After a special Los Angeles screening of Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye, io9 held a virtual interview with the English voice cast: Abby Trott (who voices Momo Ayase), A.J. During our conversation, the three cast members reflected on their favorite moments from the previous season and shared their excitement about the scenes they are eager for fans to experience in the upcoming compilation preview film, which will be released June 6, as well as the anime's new season premiering in July. This interview has been edited for brevity. Isaiah Colbert, io9: You've voiced plenty of standout characters in anime, but Dan Da Dan's Momo Ayase is one of my personal favorites. With her being a co-lead in a shonen series—a genre that traditionally puts male protagonists in the spotlight—what about Momo makes her special to you,  and how do you think she stands out even more in the shonen landscape this season? I've been having so much fun with her. And it's interesting that this anime, although maybe if you had to put a label on it, a shonen has a lot of elements from different genres incorporated into it. And I think that helps Momo stand out. We do see a romance element, whereas in a lot of typical shonen, the protagonist will typically not be aware of romantic advances or intentions from a female protagonist. We can only look forward to seeing how that is going to grow and develop over the course of however many seasons the show goes on. Those are things about Momo that I love. She makes everyone else around her want to step up to the plate and do their best, too. She makes everyone want to do their best. io9: In your last interview with io9, you mentioned being a fan of the Dan Da Dan manga and having read it before auditioning. Were there any specific scenes from the manga that you were particularly excited to bring to life in season two ? Science Saru, like always, took it and made it so much better; they added so much more content. So I was really excited to see what that would look like, and they knocked it out of the park—Evil Eye's ball thing that he uses is really cool. Beckles: He has to dodge and punch, or whatever else, which he doesn't really know how to do. You get to see that bit of awkwardness, too, that he clearly doesn't know what he's doing versus Evil Eye, who seems so experienced in comparison. It's interesting, and they did a great job of showing that. io9: First off, congrats on your anime voice acting award for Solo Leveling, Aleks. You've really kept your finger on the pulse of fan engagement—not just by pushing your vocal limits as Sung Jinwoo but also by embracing the memes and sharing behind-the-scenes moments on TikTok. In Dan Da Dan season one, you threw “Deez Nuts” into the mix, making it an unexpectedly perfect fit for the series' chaotic energy. Can you walk me through how that creative choice came about with the team at Bang Zoom? And are there any other localization line reads you're especially excited to bring to life in season two? Aleks Le: First of all, thank you so much for the congratulations. And as for that particular line, I made a video about that where I said that the line was actually adapted by our English dub director, Alex Von David, who is wonderfully talented. He had pitched the idea of for this joke. He was like, “Maybe we should put deez nuts in there.” We were discussing it back and forth because it was just two words, but there was so much history behind the meme itself that we wanted to get it just right for the show. What ended up happening was that we performed it once initially, and Alex was like, “That's good. I think we should put the emphasis on deez, like deez nuts.” And I was like, “But I want to do it like the original.” So he was like, “Oh, the original, deez nuts?” and I'm like, “You've seen the video?” And he's like, “I've heard it thrown around, but I don't remember the video.” So I was like, “Okay,” [so] I pulled up the video, and our poor engineer had to just sit there as I showed him the deez nuts and then we were going back and forth on it. He was very insistent on one way and I was like, “I want to do it exactly like the video.” We did it so many times, and then we finally found one that we were both really happy with. So that was how deez nuts ended up in the show. Alex is a driving force of this adaptation. In terms of improv, it's always the most unnoticeable, subtle moments of comedy, I feel, are where my strong suits come in. There's a lot of Jiji reads where I really want to make it sound as noncommittal as possible, as in it doesn't sound like somebody who's doing a performance. One of my favorite improvs that didn't make it was in episode 11 when Jiji first introduces himself. It wouldn't really make sense for the moment.” In the future, though, I hope we can throw it back in there somewhere. io9: Alongside their seiyuus, you've all brought Okarun, Momo, and Jiji to life beautifully, capturing the essence of the anime's low-taper fade occult nerd, outspoken gyaru, and resident himbo. As season two approaches, what aspects of their dynamics are you most excited to explore, and how has your approach to voicing them evolved, especially while recording separately, and the energy each of you is bringing into the booth? Trott: For Momo, this season kicks off with a lot of action. The first three episodes (that hopefully you'll go see in theaters, everyone) is a lot of yelling and a lot of [being] in the action. Just those little moments, I'm looking forward to the development of relationships. He's very mature for his age in terms of how he views relationships and communication and Jiji throws all that out of the window. I'm interested to see how he handles it. It'll be fun to play like him handling those moments where he's trying to be a certain way, trying to be like kosher, and Jiji doesn't care. And how he's gonna handle coming out of his shell more. But in the meantime, I think where we're at, it's very much Okarun knowing who Jiji is, but they haven't spent a lot of time together. Okarun's never had that before—a friend who's not picking on him—and I think that'll be really cool to see Okarun embrace and learn not to see Jiji as a threat to his new feelings he has towards Momo. Le: I think we all know each other pretty well, and our performance styles. We have a good image in our heads of how one person would do a specific read or [how] one person would interpret the scene this way and, ultimately, the nuances of those performances in the final surprise us. But, for the most part, we have a really good idea of what the other person's gonna do. I feel that closeness and understanding has given us the ability to performing these scenes basically in the dark, yet still having them mesh really well with each other. I feel like we all understand each other's sense of humor or acting choices pretty well, for the most part.

But a few years ago, Sonos tossed convention aside and created a Bluetooth (and Wi-Fi) portable speaker that you can carry with you wherever you go whether to the beach, a backyard barbecue, or the pool. Today, this tough speaker is hitting its all-time best price on Amazon, and it's an amazing deal to prepare your summer holidays. Usually, the Sonos Move 2 retails for $449 which is on par with other premium portable speakers. But with a 25% discount on Amazon, you can bring it home today for just $336. That's a $113 discount and the lowest price this speaker has ever been which makes it an elite deal for a speaker of this caliber. What sets the Sonos Move 2 truly unique is its exceptional audio quality: Sonos has reimagined the acoustic design for this new model. Instead of a single tweeter, the Move 2 features two which unveils a genuine stereo soundstage providing crisp vocals and detailed instruments. The bass is deep and dynamic and it is powered by a precision-tuned woofer that brings music to life with the emotional energy of a live performance. You don't have to futz with settings or worry about where to put it as the speaker does it all for you. Due to efficiency gains across the board, you can now have a maximum of 24 hours of uninterrupted playback from a single charge which is double the last generation. When the time comes to recharge, simply place the Move 2 on its included wireless charging base, now featuring a detachable power cord and shrinker adapter. Its IP56 rating guarantees that the speaker is spill-proof, splash-proof, rain-proof, dirt-proof, and dust-proof. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AMD's latest acquisition could help reduce Nvidia's market dominance when it comes to AI hardware. Semiconductor giant AMD on Wednesday announced it acquired AI software optimization startup Brium. Brium is a startup that appears to be in stealth mode. In a press release, AMD said its acquisition of Brium will help its commitment to “building a high-performance, open AI software ecosystem that empowers developers and drives innovation.” While AMD is saying that this acquisition helps create a more open AI ecosystem, which isn't wrong, it seems clear that it's also meant to help AMD overcome one of its biggest roadblocks: a large percentage of AI software is being designed for Nvidia hardware and chips. “Solutions such as AMD's Instinct GPUs offer strong performance characteristics, but it remains a challenge to harness that performance in practice as workloads are typically tuned extensively with Nvidia GPUs in mind. At Brium, we intend to enable efficient [model] inference across a range of hardware architectures.” The company previously acquired Silo AI (in July 2024), Nod.AI (October 2023), and Mipsology (August 2023).

EDIT: One library I found is https://github.com/thetarnav/streaming-markdown which seems to combine incremental parsing with optimistic rendering, which works good enough in practice, I guess.


reply



However, the second thing (not mentioned in the post) is that we are not rendering the markdown to HTML on the server, so []() markdown is sent to the client as []() markdown, not converted into <a href=...>. So even if a []() type link exists in a code block, that text will still be sent to the client as []() text, only sent in a single chunk and perhaps with the link URL replaced. The client has its own library to render the markdown to HTML in React.Also, the answers are typically short so even if OpenAI outputs some malformed markdown links, worst case is that we end up buffering more than we need to and the user experiences a pause after which the entire response is visible at once (the last step is to flush any buffered text to the client).

(This comment when subjected to this processing could look like: "Could this result in edge cases with ")


reply



There are some easy wins that could improve this further: line endings within links are generally not valid markdown, so if the code ever sees \n then just flush buffered text to the client and reset the state to TEXT.


reply



it formats its own stuff with markdown, so if i ask it for markdown but dont explicitly specify a downloadable file, it will produce valid markdown up to where it conflicts with its own markdown, and then it gets choppy and chunked.its an issue of my prompting is what im sure some customer service rep would be told to tell me :p because theres money to be made in courses for prompting skills perhaps, idk. (cynical view).sure is enjoyable to struggle together with the AI to format its responses correctly :'D

The Nintendo Switch 2 is only just launching, and someone has already torn it down. YouTube channel ProModding has opened up the new handheld console, showcasing the new Nvidia chip, as well as taking a microscope to examine all the circuits. Recently, Nintendo of America updated its End User License Agreement to note that you can't "bypass, modify, decrypt, defeat, tamper with, or otherwise circumvent any of the functions or protections of the Nintendo Account Services, including through the use of any hardware," and that if you do, Nintendo may "render... the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part." So if you open it to make a change, you may be risking the possibility of your system working at all.Nintendo will likely have a more specific repair manual for its technicians. But until the launch tomorrow, June 5, we can watch modders on YouTube do their thing. Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Yes, it may not make sense to use classical algorithms to try to recognize a cat in a photo.But there are often virtual or synthetic images which are produced by other means or sensors for which classical algorithms are  applicable and efficient.

GlobalFoundries specified that $13 billion of the funds will go towards expanding the company's existing New York and Vermont fabs, with the remaining $3 billion dedicated to researching advanced packaging and other new technologies. Compare this to Intel's annual construction budget of $14 billion in 2024 and years prior. New CEO Tim Breen, appointed to the position in February of this year, makes no claims about when the new funds will be spent. Breen prefers to "stay flexible" in the face of endorsements from high-profile clients, including Apple, Qualcomm, and General Motors. "Supply security matters," said Breen in an interview, claiming that GlobalFoundries' clients are looking for more local production and to "reduce dependence on suppliers that have their manufacturing concentrated in one location". GlobalFoundries' reliance on legacy process nodes is still a profitable existence thanks to the "AI boom" seen in enterprise spending. Breen claims this most recent announcement is "a strategic response to the explosive growth in artificial intelligence" seen in recent years. GlobalFoundries' website marketing seems largely reliant on the low power consumption of its legacy chips, a key concern for enterprise clients as data center power draw grows beyond 100 MW.

Thanks to GlobalFoundries' entrenchment in the U.S. and its commitment to plant expansions rather than new construction, it is thankfully highly unlikely that the company will pull a Foxconn and completely abandon its commitments.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. YouTube creator DIY Perks has partnered with startup Etherdyne Technologies to create a true wireless power system on a four-foot by two-foot desk, allowing him to run a complete workstation with its associated accessories without any cables. These wireless chargers generate an alternating electromagnetic field with a frequency between 110 and 205 kHz, which is enough to produce around 15 watts of power. But because its frequency is so low, your device must be so close to the wireless charger that it will only work efficiently if the coils are perfectly aligned with each other. You also don't have to align the coils perfectly to achieve wireless power transmission — as long as it's within the range of the ‘power dome', your devices will reliably get enough power, depending on the power coil you use. He also built the stereo speakers, a heated mug, and the wireless microphone from 3D printed and spare parts — all of which are powered wirelessly. This allowed him to ditch the monitor's power cord entirely, and he then used a wireless HDMI receiver to connect it to a Framework that's built directly into the desk. Unfortunately, it's not yet commercially available, although you can request an Evaluation Kit from the Etherdyne website if you're interested in experimenting with it. Some users might also have some health concerns about the amount of radio frequency the wireless tech is pushing out, but the company claims that its Eval Kit has already received FCC and CE certification, so it likely complies with safety regulations. But if you want to try the wireless power tech for yourself without going through all the trouble of building your own desk, you can purchase the AirBrite Universal Wireless Lighting System, which uses the same technology to deliver lighting solutions to miniature builds. It's also planning to launch a Kickstarter for a sit/stand desk that implements the technology similar to how Perks does it. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. These are promising applications for such an innovative technology, and it could even be the next step towards true wireless power. Etherdyne also isn't the first company to experiment with this, with researchers able to harvest low amounts of energy from radio and Wi-Fi.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In two days, Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 comes out, and the universe as we know it will never be the same again. The Switch 2 release won't merely be a tidal wave coming for the PS5 and Xbox Series S / X—it's gonna be a tsunami with Mario Kart World riding on top. Gizmodo had a chance to get even closer and more personal with the Switch 2 last week. If you're used to the portability of the Switch / Switch OLED, you may be surprised to unbox the Switch 2 and see that it's noticeably larger, which also shouldn't be shocking at all, considering the display has jumped up from 6.2 inches and 7 inches, respectively, to 7.9 inches. The Switch 2 is still not going to fit into 99.9% of pants (unless you're rocking deep-pocket JNCOs again), but at the very least it'll take up less space in a backpack or tote bag compared to larger handhelds. Whereas the Steam Deck has a thicker design (to accommodate an internal fan and larger, sculpted grips), the Switch 2 doesn't, and as a result, it retains its thin 13.9mm profile. To unlock better performance while in console mode plugged into a TV, you can drop the Switch 2 into its included dock, which does include a cooling fan. Ever drop a Steam Deck on your chest while gaming in bed? If you've got a Switch OLED or a Steam Deck LCD / Steam Deck OLED, the leap in display size is relatively minor. But for OG Switch owners like myself, the bigger screen is delightful. I've played hundreds of hours of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Switch, and even in my limited few hours with Mario Kart World, I could tell that the Switch 2's display was more immersive. While blacks on the Switch 2 display are not as inky as devices with an OLED screen, colors are more vibrant and pop thanks to its support for HDR (and presumably increased brightness to qualify as HDR compatible). I regularly play on my Steam Deck OLED and feel the screen's dynamic range is lacking despite it being an OLED panel. Sure, it would have been nice of Nintendo to go with an OLED, but the company's probably saving it for a mid-cycle refresh. I love OLED as much as the next nerd, but trust me when I say nobody is going to be fixated on black levels when they're trying to survive a chaotic 24-person round of elimination-style “Knockout Tour” in Mario Kart World. Frankly, I'm relieved that the Switch 2 doesn't have a thick profile. I've tried many handheld PCs like the Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally X, and Lenovo Legion Go S—they're bulky handhelds that are a far cry from “portable.” Others may disagree with me, but I'm firmly of the belief that if you're going to make the dimensions of a device taller and wider, then at least keep it thin and light enough to not hurt while using it. In this regard, I'm appreciative of the Switch 2's thin profile. On the other hand, I can sympathize with gamers who feel Nintendo should have made the Switch 2 and shoved a bigger battery inside. The Switch 2's thinness also gives way to its weight: 535 grams (1.18 pounds). In comparison to Steam Decks, Nintendo's new handheld is lightweight. It's not as light as the original Switch or Switch OLED, but again, you need to remember that it's got a larger screen, larger Joy-Con 2 controllers, and a few extra components like a secondary USB-C port on the top for connecting additional accessories such as the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera. This is where I have to remind everybody that hand feel really makes a big difference. You can look at the dimensions and weight of the Switch 2 and think you have a good idea of how it compares to other similar devices, but real life tells a different story. I spent several stretches playing the Switch 2 in handheld mode for 30-45 minutes continuously and didn't feel it was ever too heavy or that I had to rest it on my lap or chest. Everybody is going to feel different, but generally, Nintendo has taken its decades of expertise designing hardware and applied it to the Switch 2. While it's impossible for me to confirm whether or not these new detachable controllers will suffer from joystick drift long-term from my brief hands-on time with them, I can tell you that their bigger size makes longer game sessions more comfortable. My fingers didn't feel as cramped trying to stretch across all of the buttons and joysticks. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The Stanley Quencher H2.0 Tumbler has become something of a hydration status symbol. It's less of a vessel than an accessory you'll find in everything from desk setups to car cup holders and even gym selfies. Go to Amazon now and get the Stanley Quencher H2.0 Tumbler for just $21, down from its usual price of $35. That's especially helpful if you're trying to increase your daily water intake without lugging around something that feels like a small keg. It has a pretty narrow base, which makes it car cup holder-friendly, and the sturdy handle gives you a solid grip. There are purses made for that specific purpose even, Stanley's FlowState lid rotates to offer three modes: a straw opening, a wide opening for sipping or chugging, and a full cover to keep things sealed. Paired with a reusable straw and durable stainless-steel build, it's perfect for cold drinks, smoothies, or even iced coffee. And thanks to vacuum insulation, whatever you pour in stays at just the right temp for hours. Personally, I like to keep mine on my bedside table, where it really does last and last, and by morning I still have ice floating around in my drink. For just $21, which is nearly half off, this is a solid deal for a tumbler that gets as much use as your favorite coffee mug, but with a whole lot more style and capacity. If you've been thinking about upgrading your drinkware, this is one of the best ways to do it. And if your kids have been clamoring for one, now you can grant their wish.

Intel's upcoming Nova Lake chips are expected to advance their modular design philosophy by bringing together future Xe3 and Xe4 IPs to handle different engines on the chip. Jaykihn, an avid Intel leaker, asserts that Nova Lake-S will allegedly use Celestial for its graphics engine. At the same time, Druid will handle media and display functions, likely on a separate SoC Tile. The disaggregated chiplet design, introduced for consumers with Meteor Lake, provides Intel with the flexibility to manufacture less critical chip elements using mature and cheaper fabrication nodes. Meteor Lake splits the media and display capabilities from core graphics. The media and display units were placed on a separate System-on-Chip (SoC) chiplet, manufactured using TSMC's N6 process, while the graphics engine resided on a separate tile produced with TSMC's N5 technology. Meanwhile, Bionic_Squash reports that the graphics engine will utilize a slightly modified version of Xe3, for better or worse. Should it be an improvement over vanilla Xe3, which we'll see in Panther Lake, it might be comparable to the evolution from Meteor Lake's Xe-LPG to Arrow Lake's Xe-LPG+ (mobile-only), the latter of which introduced XMX engines. Beyond Nova Lake, this is a positive indication for future graphics products from Intel. We could see the first Druid-powered engines by as early as 2026, while Celestial, which is already undergoing pre-validation, is slated to power Panther Lake CPUs next year.
