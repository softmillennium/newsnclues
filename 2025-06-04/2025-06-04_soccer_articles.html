                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matt Turner doesn't necessarily see himself as the No. 1 goalkeeper for the U.S. men's national team and goes into every training camp with the mindset that he has to fight for his job just like anyone else. So with the Gold Cup beginning on June 14 and the World Cup almost exactly one year away, how does he see the pecking order of USMNT goalkeepers shaking out and what does that mean for him? "That's a fully loaded question for me," Turner told reporters Wednesday. "I don't see myself as the ‘No. I think that's my mindset going into every camp right now is that every inch, every opportunity needs to be fought for and every opportunity that I've had under this current staff I've earned by my performances within training and the opportunities that I've had this past season with Crystal Palace. I mean listen, there's lots of good goalkeepers in the pool right now. I think a lot of guys are performing well, especially some of the guys here in MLS, so it's nice to be around them, to train with them, and just keep pushing myself and pushing them to get better and hold the standards true to what we want to build on this national team." Turner has not played much for club side Crystal Palace, which won the FA Cup last month. His last competitive match for the team was a 3-1 FA Cup win over Millwall on March 1; he didn't play in a league match this season. USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino recently commented on Turner's lack of minutes as a backup, acknowledging that he needs to "find the way to compete every week" before the 2026 World Cup. If not, another goalkeeper could overtake him as the Americans' new No. "It's open in our mind," Pochettino told reporters last month regarding the starting goalkeeper position. Turner has an entire summer to prove himself. Pochettino initially called up Turner, along with Zack Steffen, Matt Freese and Patrick Schulte as part of a 27-player roster for two upcoming friendlies against Turkey (June 7) and Switzerland (June 10). Chris Brady recently replaced Schulte, who left camp with an oblique injury, and the Colorado Rapids announced Wednesday that Steffen suffered a knee injury and has returned to his club for further examination. Zack Steffen was among the initial goalkeepers called into the USMNT camp, but a knee injury has forced him out. "I'm pretty sure that Gold Cup is essentially what launched me to get my move to Arsenal and now fighting my way through Europe and trying to make it work over there right now," Turner said. "Since then, I've been through a lot. Back then, Turner was playing for the New England Revolution and was named MLS Goalkeeper of the Year in 2021 before moving to Premier League side Arsenal. Since then, his club play has been inconsistent, with just 31 total appearances for the Gunners, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace. He's previously stated that his preference would be to stay in Europe. "But I've had a lot of positive talks with a lot of different clubs and think the important thing for me is finding the right situation for me to play in and to maximize what I feel is my potential as well. If you look around the European soccer world — especially with a lot of new financial rules and regulations in place — clubs have to do business and get creative with the way they do business in certain situations. So it's not always just, ‘I point my finger to this club, this is a good situation, I want to go here, let's make that happen.' You have to weigh the family side, you have to weigh the personal side, and obviously the playing side and what works from club to club as well." But no matter what happens on that front, he has an opportunity to influence Pochettino's decision-making with quality performances at the Gold Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joint complaint to UN agency about ‘rights violations' Development starting to scale up before 2034 World Cup Trade unions from 36 countries have filed a complaint with the International Labour Organisation over the treatment of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia. “This is a call for immediate action towards genuine, inclusive and collaborative reform,” he said. “We cannot tolerate another death of a migrant worker in Saudi Arabia. We cannot remain silent while migrant workers, especially construction and domestic workers continue to face fundamental rights violations. Human rights groups and trade unions have repeatedly warned that the World Cup, and other major projects, could be tarnished by abusive conditions endured by migrant workers in constructing the necessary infrastructure. These concerns include extortionate recruitment fees, non-payment of wages, false contracts, passport confiscation and exposure to extreme heat. Thousands of workers could be likely to die as construction ramps up, the rights group FairSquare claimed last month. The number of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia has surged in recent years to more than 13 million, driven in part by a massive construction boom linked to the World Cup and so-called giga-projects. The Guardian understands that Saudi Arabia's agreement with the ILO includes proposals for new measures to support fair recruitment and make it easier for workers to change jobs, the introduction of a minimum wage and the inclusion of migrant workers on workers' representative committees. In the longer term, it promises to strengthen protections for domestic workers, who have been excluded from key provisions of the labour law. The planned reforms have failed to satisfy trade union delegates. “Africans go to Saudi Arabia looking for life but come back in coffins,” said Omar Osman, the general secretary of the federation of Somali trade unions and one of the signatories. The trade union complaint is understood to acknowledge that this dialogue has begun. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development in Saudi Arabia was approached for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ST. LOUIS, Mo.—Former U.S. women's national team defender Becky Sauerbrunn got a hometown hero's welcome on Tuesday at Energizer Park ahead of, during and after the USWNT defeated Jamaica 4-0 to close out a successful international window. Having retired from professional soccer last December after a 16-year career, the former U.S. captain returned not only as part of TNT's broadcast crew covering this friendly, but also to receive a proper send-off. “I'm not used to having a lot of spotlight on me for something like this, but it's really about celebrating the people who got you here,” Sauerbrunn told reporters Monday. Sauerbrunn was born in St. Louis and developed her game here as a budding talent until she left for the University of Virginia in 2003. A post shared by The Athletic Full Time (@tafulltime) A commanding presence at center back, Sauerbrunn made 219 appearances for the U.S., anchoring the backline to two Women's World Cup titles and Olympic gold in 2012. It's quite a legacy for someone who never sought the spotlight. Hayes' squad delivered a dominant win, applying relentless pressure for 90 minutes, having 82 percent possession and allowing only two shots from the opposition. Though the accomplished defender never scored for her country, she came very close two years ago at the same stadium that bid her goodbye. On Tuesday, it was rookie Ally Sentnor who scored twice in the first half and Sauerbrunn's close friend Lynn Biyendolo who added two more after she came on early in the second half. “The two things that they have in common are that they didn't want the role, but it just found them. And I think that makes the best leaders, is somebody who just doesn't want it, but is so natural at it.” Girma, now the most expensive transfer in women's soccer history, had a rocky start at Chelsea after joining in January, left sidelined by a string of injuries. With both a Women's Super League title and the FA Cup under her belt, she is proving to be worth every penny. Girma told ussoccer.com, “Becky was one of the best leaders this team has ever had.” Listening to her former teammates after the match, it was clear: the trust and respect Sauerbrunn commands were built over years of grit, consistency and quiet leadership, beginning with her debut in 2008, when she earned her first cap against Canada at the Four Nations Tournament in China, playing with a broken nose. “Becky is a legend, an icon,” Kerry Abello, who made her debut Tuesday, said after the match. She was always calm and composed, even when somebody made a mistake. “Becky doesn't get mad often, but if you mess up, like pass to the wrong player… she'll give you this look,” Biyendolo said after Tuesday's match. “It's always nice when the people you leave behind talk about someone in such a way,” Hayes said. “I've got a locker room — not just the senior players, but less experienced players — that talk about her in the highest esteem, both as a leader and as a human being, and I don't think you could want anything more than that in life.” She has reported on the global game since 2013, for TRT Sport, USA Today Sports, VICE, Forbes, and most recently was a staff writer at Sportico.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Grealish set to be left out of Man City's Club World Cup squad, raising doubts over his future; Grealish has two years left on City deal; if any options come up for a summer move they will be considered; due to his transfer fee and contract, a loan switch may become a possibility Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Jack Grealish is expected to be left out of Manchester City's Club World Cup squad, Sky Sports News has learned. City are yet to submit their final 35-player squad ahead of the tournament in the USA but, as it stands, the England international will not be part of next week's travelling party. Grealish has two years left on his Man City contract and will fight for his place after struggling for game time this season. If any options come up during the summer for a move, they will be considered. City boss Pep Guardiola revealed last month that the club, Grealish and his representatives will look to work out a solution on his future this summer. Grealish joined City in the summer of 2021 from Aston Villa for £100m - a then British-record transfer deal - and played a key role in City securing the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup to complete a historic treble two years later. But this season, Grealish started just seven league games and was an unused substitute in City's FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player He's an unbelievable player that has to play football every three days. He needs to do it, and that's with us, or another place. Put to Guardiola that he is unhappy with Grealish, the Spaniard snapped back: "Who said I'm not happy with Jack? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player I have 24 players, I have to get rid of six players for the last game and five today because (Mateo) Kovacic got sent off. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player "If Grealish is to leave, it would be a complicated deal. "We have seen other players move on loan like Jadon Sancho from Manchester United. "For Jack, it could be a case of a very long summer and having to wait until Deadline Day on September 1. He is really focused and wants to play regularly. "If it is at City, he will get his head down and fight, or he will go and play somewhere else. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders could be part of the tournament squad after City agreed a £46.3m (€55m) deal to sign the Netherlands international, who is set to sign a five-year deal at the Etihad. But City have not made a bid for Wolves left-back Rayan Ait Nouri yet, despite wanting to sign the Algeria international before the mini-transfer window closes on Tuesday. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player There has been no verbal contact with Wolves, who want at least £50m for Ait Nouri. Lyon playmaker Rayan Cherki is another key target, with City keen to strengthen at full-back and in the No 10 position this summer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Grealish is expected to be omitted from the Manchester City squad for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup as he moves closer to a summer exit. Such an underwhelming term has fueled speculation regarding his future and the fire was stoked further by Pep Guardiola's decision to leave him out of the squad for Man City's final Premier League game of the season against Fulham. That snubbing doesn't appear to be a one-off, with The Athletic reporting that Grealish is “likely” to be omitted from Man City's traveling squad for the upcoming Club World Cup which begins in mid-June. There is a growing expectation that his time at the Etihad Stadium has come to an end as Man City look to usher in a new era. There is unlikely to be a place for the ageing forward in Guardiola's squad moving into 2025–26. While the Cityzens are unlikely to recoup a significant chunk of the eye-watering fee splashed on Grealish, there will undoubtedly be an array of prospective buyers. In the Premier League alone, Newcastle United, former side Villa and, somewhat surprisingly, Arsenal have all been linked. There have been reports suggesting interest from Italian sides Inter Milan and Napoli, too, while there are likely to be suitors further afield—potentially in Saudi Arabia and the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino's tenure as head coach of the U.S. Men's National Team has been rocky thus far, guiding his side to a 5-0-3 record, including back-to-back defeats in their failed defense of the CONCACAF Nations League. However, while many of the USMNT's biggest stars have failed to impress of late, with many being criticized for lacking pride and effort on the pitch, one young attacker has stood out for all the right reasons. Real Salt Lake star Diego Luna received just his second national team call-up in January, joining Pochettino's camp for their friendlies against Venezuela and Costa Rica. The latter game proved a turning point for Luna, who came off bloodied and bruised with a broken nose after taking an elbow to the face, only to force his way back into the game to immediately provide an assist during the USMNT's 3-0 win. Luna's determination and grit have shone through ever since, proving a standout performer in their Nations League third-place playoff loss to Canada, as he once again received plaudits for his fight and effort. And it seems Pochettino has been equally impressed by the 21-year-old, telling Landon Donovan and Tim Howard in a recent interview on their Unfiltered Soccer podcast that the RSL star reminds him of himself. “But he said, 'Coach I want to play.' I said, 'But it's a friendly game. I didn't want to worry him. “And he convinced the doctor, 'Doctor, I can play. And then in the half-time, we'll see.' No, that is what I want. Pochettino went on to add that during his playing days, in which he made 20 appearances for Argentina, he “was like this. Reflecting on the incident, Luna recently told reporters that he felt it may have served as a reminder to others of the level of commitment that should be given to the USMNT. “I think that experience for me was, I could say life changing as it gave me,” he said. “I think it added an opportunity for me to come back into more camps and show the type of the grit and the hunger that I have to play and represent for my country. “And I think, yeah, it showcases, Mauricio really liked that about me and really liked the fight that I had. Luna will soon have another opportunity to show Pochettino just what he's made of when the USMNT hosts Turkey in a friendly on June 7, before taking on Switzerland three days later. Focus will then turn to the CONCACAF Gold Cup, where the USMNT will look to win its first title under Pochettino.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ally Sentnor and Lynn Biyendolo both scored twice to lead the United States to a 4-0 victory over Jamaica on Tuesday night at Energizer Park in St Louis. Sentnor, 21, opened the scoring in the 19th minute and added a second goal just 10 minutes later for her first career brace. And once Sentnor brought this energy, the U.S. were on their way. The final goal was assisted by Avery Patterson for the first helper of her international career (Tuesday's match was just Patterson's fourth cap). Phallon Tulis-Joyce started in goal again,  and appears to have inched into the lead in the ongoing battle to identify which keeper will replace the formidable Alyssa Naeher. In earning a third clean sheet in as many caps, Tullis-Joyce became the first U.S. keeper since Naeher to play her first three games for the team without allowing a goal. Orlando Pride defender Kerry Abello started and played the full 90 minutes on Tuesday night. Abello is also the 19th player to debut under head coach Emma Hayes, who has prioritized experimenting with young talent during the first half of 2025. Prior to the match, St Louis native and two-time World Cup champion Becky Sauerbrunn was honored by the team. Sauerbrunn, who retired from soccer late last year, was a mainstay of the U.S. Women's National Team from 2008-2024. Aside from her international career, Sauerbrunn played professionally for almost two decades. By her own admission, Carli Lloyd never took much time while she was playing...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Raheem Sterling is not expected to be part of Chelsea's Club World Cup squad with Arsenal confirming he will return to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea are likely to leave several names behind from their squad for the tournament that starts later this month in the USA, even though they can select 35 players. Meanwhile, Axel Disasi could also be given June to find a new club following his loan spell at Aston Villa. Ben Chilwell, Armando Broja and Alfie Gilchrist are three other names up for sale this summer after they were loaned out to Crystal Palace, Everton and Sheffield United respectively. However, suggestions Noni Madueke could be sold are downplayed by Chelsea insiders. Newcastle held historical interest in Madueke, but it's believed they are not planning on rekindling interest, even if they miss out on Manchester United target Bryan Mbeumo. Chelsea also want to resolve their goalkeeper situation before the Club World Cup. Should a move not materialise, Chelsea are content with the goalkeepers they have and will only look at elite options who can be secured at value. The bigger priority is still to find a right-footed left winger. Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens, Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho and Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams are three options considered. Williams, meanwhile, has an appealing £50m release clause, but the overall cost of any deal is high given his wage and the agent fees involved, and the Spain international is also engaged in early-stage talks to renew at Athletic Bilbao. Chelsea will also be taking some new faces to America for the Club World Cup. There is still ongoing dialogue as to the best approach, but Chelsea can chose to block Delap's inclusion in this summer's tournament in Slovakia if they wish as club football would take precedence. Andrey Santos will also be part of Chelsea's Club World Cup squad following an impressive loan at Strasbourg in which he scored ten goals. He is not considered for sale this summer despite genuine Bayern Munich interest. Kendry Paez will also be part of the travelling party. Paez has already visited Cobham to train and spent time with Strasbourg. Mathis Amogou is also expected to be loaned to Chelsea's sister club next campaign, but could also play at the Club World Cup first.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite not having team captain and star player Christian Pulisic for this summer's tournament, Pochettino fully recognizes the No. “Christian has shown great quality this past year, both in Europe and with the national team. He's a talented player who can help us win. I don't mean to disrespect Messi or Pulisic, but I believe Christian should be our Messi in this country,” said the coach during a relaxed conversation with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard on their podcast Unfiltered Soccer. Addressing Pulisic's absence from the Gold Cup, he explained: “We're in constant communication with him. He's fully committed, wants to help, and is focused on being in top shape for the World Cup. You can't force someone to come. You have to think beyond just the short term.” Pulisic has worn the U.S. jersey 78 times, scoring 32 goals and providing 20 assists. After successful stints at Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea, he's now one of the top figures at AC Milan. World Soccer Talk, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective.

DAZN has built a global brand on soccer and boxing coverage, and it isn't pulling punches about using both to score points with soccer fans at the FIFA Club World Cup. Even as Europe and more than 100 million viewers around the world recover from Paris Saint-Germain's win over Inter Milan in the UEFA Champions League final, FIFA and DAZN prepare to welcome 32 clubs from around the world to the United States for 63 matches at 12 venues from Saturday, June 14, until Sunday, July 13. All matches will be streamed on DAZN for free. To set the tone, DAZN borrowed Hall of Fame boxing announcer Michael Buffer and Eric B. In a spot debuting today—less than two weeks ahead of the tournament—Manchester City's Erling Haaland, Bayern Munich's Harry Kane, Inter Miami's Luis Suárez, and Boca Juniors' Edinson Cavani all don boxing robes with fighter nicknames and make their way to the match. Suarez even gets a mouthguard with a tribute to his home city of Salto in Uruguay written across it—for the safety of opposing players and boxers alike. After a brief cameo by DAZN Italian broadcast host Diletta Leotta, Buffer asks the gathered crowd who will be the undisputed Club World Cup champion. “We're excited to partner with FIFA for this historical event, where throughout June and July and across the globe, fans will tune in on DAZN for the first time in history to see one club crowned the undisputed champion of the world,” said Pete Oliver, CEO of growth markets at DAZN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup kicks off in less than two weeks. Amid a stand-off over the upcoming FIFA prize pool, the Sounders players took the field Sunday wearing warm-up shirts reading "Club World Ca$h Grab." The shirts received considerable attention on social media, and even more attention from the owner's box. According to Sounder at Heart and GiveMeSport, Sounders owner Adrian Hanauer angrily addressed the team in a profanity-laced postgame address. At the center of the fight is a tournament where players are only guaranteed to receive less than 1% of the prize money if they pull off a miracle run. Those teams' players already play a full, taxing schedule, and the Club World Cup adds between three and seven games to that docket. FIFA addressed this concern the way soccer governing bodies usually do: with enormous amounts of cash. By simply showing up to their own Lumen Field in Seattle and playing three group play games, the Sounders organization is guaranteed to receive $9.55 million in participation money. If they get out of group play? If they win the tournament, which no one expects them to do, the Sounders will walk away with more than $120 million. And it is now at this point we will tell you the players' cut of all that money, no matter what happens, is capped at $1 million. As Sounder at Heart broke down, the reason for this is a provision in the MLS CBA — signed in 2021, back when the Club World Cup was a minor, seven-club competition — that says players can receive a total of no more than $1 million per tournament. So basically, the Sounders organization is on track for the deal of a lifetime, and the Sounders players want payment that reflects three games of elite soccer. And now they are publicly fighting over it less than two weeks before their tournament opener. It specifically called the $1 million clause out of date and ignorant of longstanding international standards for player payment in global competitions. It's also worth noting the MLSPA did agree to this CBA, but without the foresight that FIFA would be springing a multi-million cash cow on the league's better clubs. The Sounders are one of three MLS squads that made the tournament, alongside LAFC and Inter Miami. Seattle was placed in Group B, alongside France's Paris Saint-Germain, Spain's Atlético Madrid and Brazil's Botafogo. Neither of the other American teams have aired out their grievances like the Sounders have, but it's hard to imagine either of those groups of players being happy with what the league is currently arguing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea are accelerating their transfer plans to secure three MAJOR signings before the FIFA Club World Cup, with manager Enzo Maresca determined to strengthen his squad for the global showdown. TEAMtalk understands the Blues are pushing to secure deals for all of AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan, Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, AND Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens, aiming to integrate them with new signing Liam Delap. Maignan, the 29-year-old French international, is a top target to challenge Robert Sanchez in goal. Maignan's commanding presence, exceptional shot-stopping, and ability to play out from the back have made him one of Europe's premier goalkeepers, and his experience at Milan could prove invaluable for Chelsea's ambitions. The French International goalkeeper has said yes to the move and Chelsea believe a deal could be done for as low as £15m pounds, due to his contract coming into its last year. Ekitike's pace, aerial ability, and clinical finishing make him a promising addition to Chelsea's attack. Maresca views him as a dynamic option to compete with Nicolas Jackson and Delap. He is also seen as a player who can play across multiple positions in the front line and sources say he is very keen to play in the Premier League next season.

How to follow our coverage: We'll have all the build-up from 6pm (16:00 GMT) on Al Jazeera Sport. Holders Spain and France play in the other tie on Thursday with their match being played in Stuttgart. Instead of a flow of international friendlies, which had become devalued by players and fans alike, nations now compete in a structured format that ends in a country being crowned Nations League champions. It is an added incentive to all teams as a back-up plan should their official World Cup qualifying campaign fall flat. Cristiano Ronaldo aiming for a second #NationsLeague title 🇵🇹🏆 pic.twitter.com/VMzf5JFEMA Germany, who finished top of Group 3 in League A, beat Italy 5-4 in their last-eight encounter over two legs. Portugal, who finished top of Group 1, beat Denmark 5-3 on aggregate in their quarterfinal. Cristiano Ronaldo is to start the semifinal for Portugal despite the mystery surrounding his immediate club future – which looks likely to result in an appearance at FIFA's Club World Cup this month. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid star posted on social media on the final day of the Saudi Pro League that his time with Saudi Arabian top-flight team Al Nassr had come to an end. FIFA President Gianni Infantino had already revealed that talks were under way for a loan for Ronaldo to play for one of the teams competing at the competition being staged in the United States. Spain proved how important this tournament can be when they won it before triumphing at Euro 2024. Roberto Martinez, Portugal coach: “There aren't many opportunities in international football to win trophies, and there is nothing better than doing so. The important thing is that we are here, and the final four is where we have to be. This team have shown significant resilience over these two and a half years, and facing teams like Germany, followed by maybe Spain or France, are perfect challenges to continue preparing the team for the World Cup.” The Germans have won the last five encounters, which had all been at either FIFA World Cups or UEFA European Championships. Out: Amiri, Bisseck, Havertz, Henrichs, Kleindienst, Musiala, Rudiger, Schlotterbeck, Stiller Germany have a string of injuries but do welcome back long-term absentee Marc-Andre ter Stegen in goal. Who replaces Bayern Munich's Jamal Musiala in midfield will be one of the key questions, but the absences of Real Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger and Arsenal forward Kai Harvertz will also be heavily felt. Portugal are boosted by an almost fully fit squad with only Al Hilal defender Joao Cancelo leaving a void to be filled. Possible Germany XI: ter Stegen; Kimmich, Tah, Koch, Raum; Goretzka, Gross; Adeyemi, Wirtz, Sane; Fullkrug Possible Portugal XI: Costa; Dalot, Dias, Goncalo Inacio, Nuno Mendes; Vitinha, Fernandes, Neves; Silva, Ronaldo, Leao</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nike and MOX have turned sportswomen into stars plastered across city streets and bedroom walls, for the debut of the US National Women's Soccer League (NWSL)  2025 kit. Elevating NWSL plays while heroing the new Nike kits, the digital and print campaign saw photographer Emily Lipson capture the players as star-status individuals, nostalgically recalling times when icons were found in fold-out magazine posters. But rather than framing the women's league through a reductive, dated lens, the digital and print campaign shows off their grit and toughness through an injection of movement and expression. Emily's work feels timeless and textural, which made her a great fit for the creative. Her work treads the line of appearing old school and analogue, but it always has a fresh, modern spin to it which is especially present in the way she's able to connect and capture her subjects. Key to the campaign was MOX's all-women team, who ensured the NWSL athletes felt comfortable and confident enough to shine on set. As each player was to be photographed in full performance wear, the team found ways to introduce variation and personality through small styling cues, from rolled-up sleeves to ribbons in hair. MOX wanted to work with creatives who are linked to the football world, understanding the players style and their background which led them to work with stylist  Sam Herzog, co-founder of Systema Rosa  – a platform aiming to bridge football and fashion. Transforming the soccer players into household names, the collection of images can be seen across Instagram, Nike live events, Mundial magazine, and in the wild around New York and LA. ​Vilde Røsjø Tobiassen, senior art director at MOX and lead creative on the campaign, commented, “We really wanted to showcase the strength of these athletes.</p>

New Brazil national team manager Carlo Ancelotti can see his side confirm its spot at the FIFA 2026 World Cup this week. Colombia who currently sits in the sixth and final automatic qualifying spot in South America will likely need just three points from an available six to qualify this week. Vinicius Junior of Brazil celebrates after scoring the team's first goal during the CONMEBOL Copa ... More America 2024 Group D match between Paraguay and Brazil at Allegiant Stadium on June 28, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. One year out from the big tournament, Brazil shouldn't even have to contemplate qualification. With that in mind, Carlo Ancelotti better get moving. This international window will be too soon to judge the new manager, but heavy expectations will be waiting around the corner for Ancelotti, and come the September and October internationals Brazil fans will expect big improvements for their side after a recent humbling by Argentina. Willian Pacho of Paris Saint Germain celebrates with the trophy after the UEFA Champions League ... More Final 2025 between Paris Saint-Germain and FC Internazionale Milano at Munich Football Arena on May 31, 2025 in Munich, Germany. Ecuador sits second in the table and are the only team in qualification to have lost as few as two games. Days ago, PSG centre-back Willian Pacho became the first ever player from Ecuador to win the European Cup, and his international teammate Moisés Caicedo scored for Chelsea as he lifted the UEFA Conference League title. Uruguay's Argentine head coach Marcelo Bielsa gestures during the 2026 FIFA World Cup South American ... More qualifiers football match between Uruguay and Argentina at the Centenario stadium in Montevideo, on March 21, 2025. Uruguay has been relatively quiet and inconsistent during this campaign. Marcelo Bielsa's men have won just five games from 14 but those included famous victories at home to Brazil and away to Argentina. Like any Bielsa or Uruguay side however they are a fiercely competitive group of players and very difficult to beat. Uruguay has a year to try and convince the country it can do something special at the World Cup, starting with games away to Paraguay and at home to Venezuela this week. Paraguay has undoubtedly been the surprise package of this FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign, and on an eight match unbeaten streak it is also the most in-form team on the continent. It is quite remarkable that Paraguay seems a near-qualifier with four games of the league still to be played; very few would have predicted such. This amazing campaign has been formed on few goals at either end. Paraguay has conceded nine and scored just 11 in 14 games, but that means seven clean sheets providing the base to go and get results from. Paraguay are six points above Venezuela in the play-off position and faces Uruguay and Brazil in the next week. Luis Diaz of Colombia during the international friendly match between Spain and Colombia at London ... More Stadium on March 22, 2024 in London, England. Luis Díaz and his teammates are five points ahead of Venezuela and will hope to extend that margin, or at least maintain it, by defeating Peru at home this week. A win against Peru would make Colombia very difficult for Venezuela to catch as they also have a home fixture to come against Bolivia in September.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ST. LOUIS (June 3, 2025) - Ally Sentnor recorded the first multiple-goal match of her career and Lynn Biyendolo followed that up with a brace of her own to lift the United States Women's National Team to a 4-0 win over Jamaica, extending the program's undefeated streak against the Reggae Girlz to six and giving the United States back-to-back clean sheets. A few days ago on May 31, the USA defeated China PR 3-0 in St. Paul, Minnesota. The stalwart center back returned to camp for this FIFA window after injuries held her back from international action during the first three events of this year. Emily Fox, coming off winning the UEFA Women's Champions League title with Arsenal, accompanied Girma in the defense. With 113 caps between them, Fox and Girma brought balance to a starting backline that featured a pair of fresh 25-year-old defenders. Kerry Abello earned her first cap for the USWNT, becoming the 19th player to debut for the senior team under head coach Emma Hayes, while Tara McKeown earned her sixth cap and fifth career start. Sentnorstruck it first time with her right foot, bouncing it under a closing defender and into the left side netting to give the United States the early lead. Sentnor's second goal arrived in the 29th minute. While forward Alyssa Thompson, Yohannes and midfielder Sam Coffey combined in a triangle, Sentnor slipped into the box, sneaking into perfect position to clean up Thompson's deflected shot. Sentnor's goals came just two minutes apart. Right out of the gate, Catarina Macarion early caught Sentnoras the team's scoring leader this year after a promising sequence. The central striker unloaded a fierce shot on frame that required an outstretched reach from Jamaica goalkeeper Liya Brooksto push it over the crossbar. Those reinforcements would have an immediate impact. Midfielder Claire Hutton, playing in just her third cap, rose to meet the service on the corner kick and directed a testing header on frame. After Jamaica intercepted her pass to Michelle Cooper from the left wing, Abello hustled after the ball and tracked it down. The crowd of 17,689 celebrated Becky Sauerbrunn Bobblehead Night, honoring the St. Louis native for her decorated 16-year international career. Hayes's squad returns to action later this month for the second June window. First, it's back-to-back friendlies against Ireland on June 26 in Commerce City, Colorado and June 29 at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio. Then, the USWNT closes out their summer with the program's debut in the Allstate Continental Clásico when they clash with Canada at Audi Field in Washington, D.C. on July 2. USA – Ally Sentnor (Emily Fox), 19th minute: Lily Yohannes opened up the field with an arching cross toward the far post. USA – Ally Sentnor, 29th minute: After working together with Lily Yohannes and Sam Coffey in the United States' attacking third, Alyssa Thompson's shot from the edge of the box caught a deflection and spun toward goal. USA – Lynn Biyendolo, 60th minute: Just moments after coming off the bench, Biyendolo found herself on the score sheet. USA – Lynn Biyendolo (Avery Patterson), 88th minute: Avery Patterson and Lynn Biyendolo nearly connected twice earlier, and the two worked together to find the back of the net with just a few minutes left. Biyendolo, running hard at the goal, slammed it home to secure her brace. ), 5-Tara McKeown, 24-Kerry Abello; 17-Sam Coffey (3-Lo'eau LaBonta, 58), 16-Claire Hutton (8-Avery Patterson, 80), 7-Lily Yohannes (10-Lindsey Heaps, 58); 9-Ally Sentnor (13-Olivia Moultrie, 67), 20-Catarina Macario (6-Lynn Biyendolo, 57), 11-Alyssa Thompson (12-Michelle Cooper, 67) Substitutes not used: 1-Mandy McGlynn, 2-Emily Sams, 14-Emily Sonnett, 18-Claudia Dickey, 19-Crystal Dunn, 22-Emma Sears Head coach: Emma HayesJAM: 23-Liya Brooks; 16-Amelia Vam Zanten (15-Tiffany Cameron, 69),4-Chantelle Swaby,17-Allyson Swaby (21-Olufolasade Adamolekun, 81),14-Deneisha Blackwood;12-Kalyssa Van Zanten (10-Jody Brown, 46),27-Nyema Ingleton (3-Vyan Sampson, 57), 5-Konya Plummer,22-Solai Washington;20-Atlanta Primus (9-Kayla McKenna, 81),18-Natasha Thomas (7-Shania Hayles, 57) Substitutes not used: 1- Sydney Schneider, 2-Naya Cardoza, 13-Serena Mensah, 19-Kameron Simmonds, 24-Shaniel Buckley, 26-Reanna Blades Michelob Ultra Woman of the Match: Ally Sentnor</p>
