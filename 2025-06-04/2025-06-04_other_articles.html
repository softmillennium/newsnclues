                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It turns out that us humans might not be the only ones calling the universe home after all, as boffins have just found another potentially habitable planet out among the stars. Dubbed 'Kepler-725c', this planet might prove to be the breakthrough which extraterrestrial fans have been waiting for. For those who don't know, Super-Earths are a class of planets which are bigger than Earth, yet lighter than the likes of Neptune and Uranus. According to NASA, they can be made of gas, rock or a combination of both, while they are also usually between twice the size of Earth and up to 10 times its mass. Despite the name suggesting it's a superior version of our world, it's simply a reference to its size. The US space agency explains: "The true nature of these planets remains shrouded in uncertainty because we have nothing like them in our own solar system – and yet, they are common among planets found so far in our galaxy. "We don't yet know enough about these planets to tell at what point they might lose a rocky surface. So, now we've gotten that out of the way, let's get onto what the experts in China have just found. Essentially, it's not too hot or too cold for liquid water to exist on its surface, which is very intriguing - as we all know that H20 is a crucial ingredient when it comes to sustaining life. Kepler-725c is also believed to have a rocky surface, just like Earth has - meaning theoretically, it could have an ocean and land. As well as this, it orbits its host star in approximately 207.5 days...which isn't that far off how long it takes us to get around the Sun, but still, it's a shorter year than what we have. This star which Kepler-725c orbits is only 1.6 billion years old, so it's significantly younger than the ball of fire which gives us heat and light, which is three billion years its senior. This information all supports the idea that Keplier-725c could in fact be habitable - but don't get too excited, as nothing has been confirmed yet. To make things even more interesting, the research team made this discovering using a new technique, which is known as Transit Timing Variation (TTV). You never know lads, there might be a load of aliens giving us a wave from Kepler-725c as we speak.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A prominent ufologist made the startling claim after aliens were rumored as being spotted dead among the wreckage. Conspiracy theories and mystery swirling the alleged crash have fascinated UFO watchers for nearly 80 years. However, confusion ensued after that release was later retracted, and replaced with a statement saying the object was in fact a high altitude weather balloon. A similar view has been expressed by veteran researcher Kevin Randle, a prominent ufologist who is regarded as one of the top experts on the reported crash. Randle has written multiple books about UFOs and the Roswell story. “What we can say with authority is that something fell at Roswell,” he said. But, fortunately, some words can now be read using technology. “Ramey was holding the memo in his hand when he was photographed with the debris in his office. “And what's interesting is we know when the picture was transmitted over the wire, we know who took it and we can see Ramey is holding the document in his hand. “So we pretty much have the provenance nailed down. He has concluded that the weather balloon story is nothing but a "government hoax" to fob off those intrigued by UFO sightings. Randle said, “What they've said officially is that the Roswell crash was a weather balloon and [radar-type] target from this experiment being conducted in New Mexico. "What I discovered is that while [the radar-type] targets were a part of the experiments conducted on the east coast, when they got to New Mexico, they didn't use those targets. "That kind of points the finger at this being a government hoax to explain away the Roswell case.” Julie Shuster, Walter Haut's daughter, told SBS News, a broadcaster based in Australia, that she had many conversations with the former Army PR man about the "flying disk" he wrote about in 1947. She said before her death in 2015, “People began to talk about Roswell in the late '70s after several decades of keeping quiet. "I would ask dad to tell me the whole story, and he told me the same thing he told everybody: ‘I put out the press release', and nothing else." It later emerged that Haut had been sworn to secrecy by base commander and close personal friend, Colonel William Blanchard. But, Haut was unhappy about keeping such a big secret, and prepared a signed affidavit to be opened after his death. “Basically dad said yes, he did see the bodies, yes he did see the craft and much more than that,” said Shuster. “At one point I asked him about the size, and he said the craft was about 25 feet in diameter." Thomas Carey, who co-authored a book with Shuster, Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the Government's Biggest Cover-Up, published in 2007, said his big secret "all came out in his sealed statement after he died." Carey added, “The ship which he described was about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, more of an egg-shaped object, and he did see a number of bodies. “He described them as being the size of children. "And when asked point blank if what he believed it was that he had seen, without hesitation he'd say, ‘It was not from this Earth, it was something manufactured off this Earth. A retired cop claimed that he saw the remains of dead aliens being lifted with a crane and hauled away. Former Deputy Sheriff Charles H Forgus of Howard County, Texas, recalled traveling to Roswell to pick up a prisoner with Sheriff Jess Slaughter. Forgus claimed he saw four alien bodies with big eyes and brownish-colored skin being taken away by military personnel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Water From Your Eyes – the duo of Rachel Brown and Nate Amos – will release a new album called It's A Beautiful Place on 22 August via Matador. They've shared the lead single from the album, “Life Signs”, which finds them once again stitching together different art-rock approaches with inimitable style and slickness. Brown's falsetto gives everything a sweet innocence, putting an innocent glaze over their pain – “I am coming apart / I'm becoming together / True to form,” she muses. But I also think the medium lends itself to the idea of fitting an infinite amount of universes into a little box you can keep in your living room. I wanted the video to encapsulate as many worlds as the song does and to express an entire lifetime within a short few minutes.” Water From Your Eyes' new album A Beautiful Place arrives on 22 August via Matador (pre-order/save).

Derryn Donaghey, who has a fantastical UFO encounter story of his own, is organizing the conference, to be held near Cooking Lake, about 42 km southeast of Edmonton. The attendees all form a circle, looking up. There is mental focus on attracting alien attention, and sounds are played that are supposedly signals to extra-terrestrials that “hey, we've set up a sort of interstellar bus stop, here.” In Douglas Adams' famed The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, travellers can  stick out a beacon called an “electronic thumb” that attracts alien ships.

Donaghey said that recent moves by the American government to declassify military files and video of UFO encounters has helped push his research into the mainstream. This is what he recalls: In the middle of nowhere, their compasses stopped working. But, when they returned to base, only three of the dozen military personnel remembered the ship at all. Then, it was just Donaghey and his superior officer. Dongahey said he tried to report it, and was told by superior officers to keep his mouth shut, instead. Nathan Zieber is a dual American/Canadian citizen who spent years working as an investigator for MUFON, the civilian-led, non-profit group that investigates UFO sightings around the world. He said that 98 per cent of his investigations can be explained: Aircraft, drones, balloons, comets and other natural phenomena. He said that his goal as a UFO researcher is not to prove the existence of extraterrestrials, but to simply eliminate the easy-to-come-by explanations. “My job isn't to prove what it is, but to prove what it can't be, that it can't be these other things,” he said. He said that his grandfather saw many of what the military called “foo fighters” during his time in Asia. The most compelling investigation Zieber has been on? In the UFO community, Alberta is well-known for cattle mutilations. He was called to one near the hamlet of Madden, about 240 km south of Edmonton, where some cows were drained, the eyeballs removed. He said there was no rational explanation on how cows could be slain like that. He said there were traces of radioactivity in the area and that nearby trees showed signs of charring. It's one that is still in the unsolved file. Even amongst those we might call UFO enthusiasts, there are no easy explanations. He's heard it all, from alien visitation to government false-flag operations to that all of this reported heightened activity in the sky is a sign of the Rapture. Donaghey understands that a lot of people see him as a nut, or someone who has seen things that can be scientifically explained. But he said that attendees to these events often include the likes of police officers, nurses and doctors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sean 'Diddy' Combs' sex trafficking trial has spawned a slew of absurd conspiracy theories linking the rapper to several high-profile figures. Prince and Kim Porter were brought into the discourse posthumously with theorists alleging both detailed Diddy's alleged exploits before their deaths. Others even went as far as baselessly claiming Los Angeles' deadly Palisades Fire was set in an attempt to burn evidence that would be essential to Diddy's trial. Diddy, 55, has pleaded not guilty to five counts including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan say that over two decades Combs coerced women, including his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, to take part in drug-fueled sexual acts. Combs' lawyers have acknowledged he was at times abusive in domestic relationships, but argue that women who took part in 'Freak Offs' did so consensually. After Diddy was accused of a string of depraved crimes, there was widespread fears among Justin Bieber fans that the singer may have been sexually abused by the rap mogul during his early years in the music industry. Concern first erupted last year after a video resurfaced of Combs and Bieber - who was a minor at the time - hanging out for '48 hours.' He added: 'I have been given custody of him. 'I don't have legal guardianship of him [Bieber] but for the next 48 hours he's with me and we're gonna go full crazy.' During the clip, Bieber offered simple responses to Combs - such as saying 'yeah' and also 'full crazy.' But Bieber, 31, has insisted he wasn't targeted by the rapper. The singer's spokesperson told TMZ last month: 'Although Justin is not among Sean Combs' victims, there are individuals who were genuinely harmed by him. When a series of deadly wildfires tore through southern California in January, conspiracy theorists made baseless claims the infernos were started to 'cover up' Diddy's alleged sex crimes - and protect any allies he may have left. Diddy's lavish house in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles, a few miles east of Beverly Hills, was untouched by the devastating fires. But many celebrities who live in or near the Pacific Palisades area - anywhere from five to 50 miles away from Holmby Hills - did lose their homes. Former government official Catherine Austin Fitts ramped up the theory by asking how many people connected to Diddy have avoided their homes being destroyed. 'In situations like [the L.A. fires], I look at patterns,' Fitts said on her podcast. The Diddy list is said to name all celebrities accused of attending parties hosted by the rapper where he is alleged to abused. There are also wild claims about the fires being started to destroy evidence and even a network of tunnels from Diddy's home to other properties including the Playboy mansion and even Michael Jackson's home. There are claims that this was a joke online. 'There's a lot at stake for our communities right now and it's critical we bring to the forefront how coronavirus is perpetuating racial inequality and health disparities,' the tweet read. President Donald Trump even shared a meme featuring a doctored image of Harris and Diddy to his Truth Social platform, saying: 'Madam vice president, have you ever been involved with or engaged in one of Puff Daddies freak offs?' Beyoncé and Jay-Z were baselessly accused of being involved in a criminal enterprise with Diddy last year. The allegations surfaced on Piers Morgan's Uncensored show when singer Jaguar Wright, who appeared as a guest on the program, suggested the pair had committed crimes similar to those of which Diddy has been accused. Wright told the media personality she had been 'screaming' that 'Diddy and Jay-Z are 'monsters' for four years. But Morgan was forced to issue an apology to the famous couple after their lawyers contacted him, saying the allegations were 'totally false and have no basis in fact'. Wright's claims, which Morgan said would 'have an audience with or without shows like mine', were edited out of the program, BBC reported. Morgan also apologized, saying: 'Editing interviews is not something we do lightly at a show called Uncensored. But like the proverbial cries of 'fire' in a crowded theatre, there are legal limits on us, too. Jay-Z also came under fire after he was accused in a lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old alongside Combs after the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed. This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere. A fake news story, based on no evidence whatsoever, went viral in October last year, alleging that Will Smith sold his daughter Willow Smith to Diddy. The article featured a doctored image of Willow, 23, and the rap mogul in bed together, prompting widespread speculation that she had been harmed by Diddy. Internet sleuths posted lengthy videos claiming that there was 'deeply unsettling' 'leaked footage' showing both Willow and her older brother Jaden, 26, in 'compromising situations' with Diddy. Conspiracy theorists quickly looped Former President Barack Obama into the Diddy dialogue after the disgraced rapper was arrested last year and an image of them together resurfaced. Conservative influencer Charlie Kirk discussed the pair's connection on his web show, even baselessly questioning: 'Maybe P. Diddy has footage of Barack Obama doing something he shouldn't have been doing?' Obama first crossed paths with Diddy in 2004 when the music mogul rallied support for Democrats ahead of that year's DNC. This included Diddy interviewing Obama for MTV, where Obama praised the rapper for encouraging people to get out the vote. Their exchange appeared jovial, as Diddy made fun of Obama sweating at the convention as he said he 'wanted to apologize for not sweating' while Obama jokingly padded his head with a napkin. Diddy's former personal assistant David James testified that A-listers would pop pills including Percocet and ecstasy at the parties. Just last month a rumor circulated online that federal prosecutors presented a secret recording of Prince exposing Diddy as evidence in the rapper's trial. But the alleged video or audio recording never surfaced. AI-generated content claiming to be a 'Prince & 'Diddy' video' has been shared online, but factcheckers on sites like YouTube have added disclaimers that the footage is 'altered or synthetic content'. Prince was mentioned in the Diddy trial by Cassie Ventura who, in her testimony, said she fled a party at the musician's house just before Diddy assaulted her at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Porter and Combs' children denounced the 59-page book - titled Kim's Lost Words: A journey for justice, from the other side... - as a complete fabrication after it became a bestseller on Amazon in September last year. 'We were made aware of a dispute regarding this title and have notified the publisher,' an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. 'The book is not currently available for sale in our store.' The independent publisher is Todd Christopher Guzze, who goes by the name Chris Todd and defines his occupation as an 'investigative producer, author and journalist.' Todd told The Associated Press in a phone interview in September that sources 'very close to Kim and Sean Combs' provided him with a 'flash drive, documents and tapes' from Porter that he eventually pieced together to create the memoir. The name is an apparent reference to a conspiracy theory involving rapper Tupac Shakur, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in 1996.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Japanese graphic novel artist and psychic has foretold of a major disaster that'll befall Japan in 2025 — and people are so spooked they're canceling their summer vacations. For her latest apocalyptic prophecy, outlined in a 2021 edition of her best-selling comic “The Future I Saw,” she predicted a calamity occurring on July 5, 2025, the Guardian reported. But it mirrored a prediction she made in the original 1999 manga in which she warned of a major “great disaster” striking Japan in March 2011 — the same date as the Japanese earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people and caused a triple-meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. As such, superstitious parties took such stock in Tatsuki's latest premonition that they uploaded social media PSAs warning people to steer clear of the Land Of The Rising Sun. With the so-called doomsday date just around the corner, many travelers who had summer Japan trips booked are getting cold feet and either postponing or scrapping their vacays altogether. Flight reservations for Japan from key markets such as South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong plunged dramatically following the prophecy. According to a survey by Bloomberg Intelligence bookings from Hong Kong were down 50% year-on-year while trips between late June and early July had plummeted by as much as 83%. An HK travel agency claimed that Japan travel reservations during the April-May spring break were down by half from last year. Japanese officials have since implored people to ignore the warnings, which they claim are completely unfounded. “It would be a major problem if the spread of unscientific rumors on social media had an effect on tourism,” said Yoshihiro Murai, governor of Miyagi prefecture — one of the hardest hit during the 2011 earthquake — said at a press conference, per the Daily Mail. “There is no reason to worry because Japanese are not fleeing abroad … I hope people will ignore the rumors and visit.” Nonetheless, even state officials have been concerned over quakes of late — and not just because of Tatsuki's manga, whose latest edition has sold more than 1 million copies. Fortunately, while Japan is one of the world's most quake-prone countries due to its location on the Pacific “Ring Of Fire” experts pointed out that it's impossible to accurately forecast the time and location of an earthquake.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When a distorted guitar riff tore through the screen and MTV's animated logo crashed into view, Marie Hyon, co-founder of production company Psyop, felt her world shift. “It was loud, defiant, and unapologetically threw me into a new world of creative possibility,” she recalls. Growing up as a young Korean immigrant in gritty, pre-gentrified Williamsburg, Brooklyn, MTV felt like salvation. “I found a strange sense of belonging,” Marie says. It gave her hope that creativity could transcend language, culture and isolation. At nine, she arrived in Brooklyn from Seoul to find herself one of the only Asian kids in the neighbourhood. “We stood out, and not in a good way,” she says. “He said martial arts weren't for girls. That denial lit a quiet rebellion in me -- I vowed to never feel powerless again.” Still, the pain of being othered chipped away at her. “I started hiding my Korean identity, patching together a personality shaped by what others wanted me to be. At Parsons School of Design in  New York, a colour theory professor dropped the needle on Coltrane's 'A Love Supreme', and Marie felt something awaken. I started to feel free.” With coffee, craft paper, a tackle box of art supplies, and Coltrane's improvisations echoing around her, Marie listened to her instincts and began to reclaim her voice. “Every bold mark was a piece of my becoming. That confidence led to her first illustration job for The New York Times Book Review, and soon she was building a portfolio that bridged fine art and bold graphic storytelling. She taught herself digital tools on a Macintosh Quadra 650, landing design gigs at Nickelodeon and MTV, where she thrived in the promos department. At MTV, she met Marco Spier, Eben Mears, and Todd Mueller -- her future Psyop co-founders. In 2000, they turned an East Village dive bar into a studio, even rigging a Flame suite in the bathroom. Above: One of Psyop's earliest projects - 'Crow'  for MTV HD For over 25 years, Marie's work has been defined by emotional resonance. Refusing to be boxed in by any one medium, Marie also directs live-action alongside Psyop's animation expertise, including music videos for Converse (featuring Pharrell, Santigold, and Kid Cudi), Vampire Weekend, and Best Coast, as well as projects for brands. That empathy shaped 'Bottle Cap', a charming but dark short produced by Psyop, alongside Parley for the Oceans, to bring awareness to climate change. The film premiered at Annecy Film Festival in France and was introduced and endorsed by James Cameron. A feature-length adaptation is currently in development. “No matter our differences, we all crave connection.” Storytelling has become the home she once longed for. “It's where we feel seen and heard.” Still, doubt sometimes lingers. But even the persona you build to survive can be a tool. “Trust your voice, even if it shakes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On “To Bring You My Love”, PJ Harvey uses American blues to explore the supernatural in search of a human connection. Broken relationships are not new to songwriting, but Harvey reaches for an even older tradition in traversing the boundary between earth and its ghosts. Having felt the pain of lost love, Harvey commits to a baptism of fire to carry love over endless obstacles. Harvey said she created “To Bring You My Love” based on “atmosphere” and “feeling.” The title track of her third studio album exposes conflict and survival within her invented world. Additionally, the supernatural metaphors lend Harvey's punk blues a mystical quality, following a tradition that has inspired artists like Elvis Presley and Nick Cave. Climbed over mountainsTraveled the seaCast out of HeavenCast down on my knees. To Bring You My Love marks Harvey's first proper solo album. But this new chapter finds Harvey beginning her lauded work with producers Flood and John Parish. Following the raw grunge of Rid Of Me, recorded by Steve Albini, Harvey moved to rural England and wrote in isolation. She imagined an emotional reality and explored the shadowy corners of the human condition, like someone transformed (or possessed) by desire. This isn't Robert Johnson selling his soul at the crossroads. Harvey sounds so darkly possessed, it's like she's wrestled back control of her soul from the devil. Its recaptured and murky condition creates a kind of superpower—someone with nothing to lose. This is just how it's going to be. The spirit might be an essence or a principle. But one hardened by the harsh winds of experience and rejection.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A psychic dubbed Japan's 'Baba Vanga' issued a terrifying prediction for 2030 which will bring back harrowing memories for many. Ryo Tatsuki, a manga artist from Japan who's drawn frequent comparisons to the famous fortune teller Baba Vanga, has earned a reputation for eerily accurate predictions of some of the world's most devastating catastrophes. 'An unknown virus will come in 2020, will disappear after peaking in April, and appear again 10 years later,' she wrote. A theory that may not be so far from the truth in light of the news that Covid cases are creeping back up in India. Major states including Kerala, Maharashtra, and Gujarat, among others have reported a 'sharp increase' in diagnoses of the virus, reported the Economic Times. Officials have told the public not to panic but have emphasised the need for people to be cautious and act in line with government issued health guidelines. Last month, tourists were seen cancelling their trips in swathes after a prediction from Tatsuki foresaw disaster striking Japan. Tatsuki, who also has a career as a manga artist, first gained notoriety after a number of predictions from her 1999 book titled, The Future I Saw, appeared to come to fruition. In 2021, Tatsuki released an updated version of 'The Future I Saw' which included a prediction of a major disaster in mid-2025. Now, as the date draws closer, many travellers who had holidays booked to Japan for July are getting cold feet and postponing their trips or cancelling altogether. According to CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, a travel agency based in Hong Kong, bookings to Japan dropped by half during the Easter holiday. Tourists from China and Hong Kong, which are the country's second- and fourth-largest sources of tourists, respectively, have been the most likely to cancel or postpone their Japan travel plans. This was further exacerbated after China's embassy in Tokyo stoked concerns by releasing an official warning to Chinese citizens in late April to take caution when travelling, studying or buying real estate in Japan. But the panic has since spread to other markets including Thailand and Vietnam, where social media platforms have been flooded with Tatsuki's prediction, warning travellers to reconsider their holidays to Japan. Japanese officials have since attempted to quell the panic with a series of official statements to reassure travellers that these were simply 'unscientific rumours'. 'It would be a major problem if the spread of unscientific rumours on social media had an effect on tourism,' Yoshihiro Murai, governor of Miyagi prefecture, said at a press conference. 'There is no reason to worry because Japanese are not fleeing abroad … I hope people will ignore the rumours and visit.' In 1999, after consistently having what she described as visions of the future, Tatsuki released her book which was titled, 'The Future I Saw' (cover pictured) While she was largely unknown at the time her first book was published, Tatsuki has since became a recognised force among psychics. Her book has recently gained renewed interest after a number of her premonitions made in hindsight appeared to mirror real life events. Amongst her chilling predictions for the future, Tatsuki is said to have accurately foretold the sudden death of Freddie Mercury. She claims to have seen images of the Queen frontman dying suddenly in a dream on November 24, 1976. She is also thought to have predicted the death of Princess Diana. The prophet has previously said that her predictive dreams arrive in a period of time that can be divided by five. Then in 1995, Tatsuki said that dreamed an old man led her to 'cracked earth', leading her to predict that the Japanese city of Kobe would be 'cracked' in either 15 days or 15 years. And thus her prophecy came true as 15 days later, Kobe was struck by an insidious earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people. She too became a cult figure after supposedly predicting major world events such as 9/11, the Covid-19 pandemic and even Princess Diana's death. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.
