                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Household environments, including owning a dog, may affect the likelihood of children developing eczema, according to an analysis of almost 300,000 people from across Europe. Representing the largest and most comprehensive analysis of gene-environments interactions to date, the findings provide new insights into what could cause eczema in children and how environmental factors may influence genetic risk. An initial analysis of more than 25,000 individuals suggested there may be a relationship between seven environmental factors - dog ownership, having an older sibling, cat ownership, breastfeeding, smoking, antibiotic use and washing practices - and at least one established genetic variant that predisposes a child to eczema. Children or babies with that gene whose families owned a pet dog had a lower risk of developing eczema. This genetic mutation is located near DNA that codes for interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) - a protein involved in immune cell function and inflammation. Lab tests confirmed that in human skin cells with the genetic variant, molecular signals from a dog can suppress skin inflammation instead of causing allergy. These results are preliminary; however, they point to the IL-7R protein as a potential area of focus to inform prevention of eczema in some individuals. The study also found a similar effect among young children with older siblings, but further studies are needed to confirm the link. The researchers speculated that more microbial exposure at an early age, through contact with dogs and other children, could be behind the protective effect. Despite the large number of people studied, the researchers did not have enough participants to draw meaningful conclusions on many gene-environment interactions, suggesting that only weak interactions are likely to exist. Further research involving a larger population, as well as greater diversity of ethnic background, is needed is needed to better understand interactions between genetic and environmental factors linked to eczema. These results are an important step in understanding how environmental risks affect childhood eczema and how we might develop ways to prevent it. While exposure to dogs stands out as a factor worth exploring further, the results do not support exposure to a dog as an effective strategy to prevent eczema now. The study also helps rule out strong genetic interactions for many other environmental factors, which will help focus future research efforts." Standl, M., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new University of British Columbia-led study is shedding light on a long-overlooked consequence of colorectal cancer: the lasting toll it can take on women's sexual health, even years after treatment ends. diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1985 and 2017, comparing their experiences to those of cancer-free women. Cancer treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation were linked to a range of long-term sexual health issues, including a 67 per cent higher risk of dyspareunia-pain during sex-a condition that can cause severe distress and affect quality of life. For women diagnosed before age 40, the risk jumped to 90 per cent. The study also revealed that survivors were more than three times as likely to experience pelvic inflammatory disease and nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis. Among younger women, the risk of premature ovarian failure-or early menopause-was 75 per cent higher than in their cancer-free counterparts. The study, published in JNCI: Journal of National Cancer Institute, is one of the first to use population-level data to explore sexual health outcomes for colorectal cancer survivors. Sexual health is a fundamental part of quality of life, yet it's an area that needs much more emphasis in colorectal cancer survivorship care. What our study shows is that these issues aren't rare-they're common, significant, and often only diagnosed well after treatment has ended." Dr. Mary De Vera, senior author and associate professor in UBC's faculty of pharmaceutical sciences In my patient communities, I've seen how often these challenges are experienced-but with very little support. This study was inspired by those experiences and is an opportunity to use research to raise awareness and bring these issues into the open." While often seen as a disease that affects older men, rates are rising among women and younger people. "Addressing sexual health in cancer care is still not standard of practice, and many healthcare providers attribute this to lack of training in the various ways that cancer can impact a patient's sexual health. These findings highlight the importance of all healthcare providers receiving some training in identifying sexual problems, and in being aware of evidence-based supports for survivors," said Dr. Brotto. The authors say their findings point to an urgent need for better education, early interventions and more open conversations in cancer care settings. "Identifying and acknowledging these issues is the first step toward more comprehensive, compassionate care for women after cancer," said Dr. De Vera.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A novel screening approach developed by physicians at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University shows significant promise for improving the detection of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-a life-threatening form of heart failure related to high blood pressure in the lung circulation that is often overlooked due to vague symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath. "Our EMR-based VEST tool proved highly accurate in identifying individuals likely to have PAH," said Anjali Vaidya, MD, FACC, FASE, FACP, Co-Director of the Advanced Pulmonary Hypertension, Right Heart Failure & Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH) Program at Temple University Hospital; Professor of Medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine and lead author on the new study. According to Dr. Vaidya, the novel technology could be game-changing for heart failure and pulmonary vascular care. By embedding a simple but powerful screening tool into everyday hospital workflows, PAH can be caught earlier, when treatment has the greatest chance of success. In previous work, Dr. Vaidya and colleagues applied VEST scoring to echocardiogram data, which provides estimates on pressure in the pulmonary artery and detects heart changes that suggest further testing is needed. They found that most patients had positive VEST scores more than 200 days before they received a referral to an accredited pulmonary hypertension (PH) center to confirm and treat their PAH diagnosis. For their latest study, Dr. Vaidya's team developed the EMR-based VEST algorithm and then tested it in nearly 5,000 patients who had undergone an echocardiogram. VEST scores automatically calculated by the algorithm were then compared to manually calculated VEST scores and used to identify patients at highest risk for PAH. Individuals with high risk scores were further analyzed to determine whether they had been referred to a PH center or had undergone right heart catheterization, which is the gold standard for PH diagnosis. Among the highest-risk patients flagged by the tool, degree of PH was severe-but a third had never been referred to a PH specialist." Dr. Anjali Vaidya, MD, FACC, FASE, FACP, Co-Director of the Advanced Pulmonary Hypertension, Right Heart Failure & Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH) Program at Temple University Hospital, Professor of Medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine When patients were referred for expert PH care, nearly all underwent confirmatory testing and were diagnosed with serious disease, highlighting how the tool can guide timely, life-saving referrals. The simplicity of VEST, along with its ability to accurately detect patients at high risk of PAH, render it highly adoptable for widespread application. "VEST has already been adopted at Temple, and we are now in the process of collaborating with other centers, nationally and internationally, to facilitate its implementation elsewhere," Dr. Vaidya added. The hope is that with broad uptake of the automated EMR-VEST algorithm, more patients will receive earlier diagnoses and expert care-ultimately improving survival and quality of life for those living with PAH.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But as an undergraduate, the sports science curriculum included an exercise metabolism course that explored how cells turn energy into movement. This biological focus captured Renton's imagination, and he became increasingly interested in the mechanisms that underly muscle function, including developing force through contractions that mediate precise movements. Now continuing his heart research at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC, Renton has received a postdoctoral fellowship from the American Heart Association to study coronary microvascular dysfunction. But subtle cardiac problems can arise long before the first chest pain. One condition puts patients at a particularly increased risk: obesity. "Pannexin-1 is a channel," said Renton, who works in the lab of Scott Johnstone. The link between obesity and heart disease is long established, but the Johnstone lab team recently discovered that when pannexin-1 is removed, blood vessels in the heart lose their ability to expand and contract properly - a symptom that also occurs in obesity. This loss of function can lead to blood vessel spasms and chest pain. If we can understand exactly how obesity disrupts these channels, we might be able to develop treatments that keep them working properly - potentially preventing heart problems before they start." Mark Renton, Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC "Obesity doesn't just affect the heart," Renton said. "It affects the brain, liver, kidneys, and everything that needs a blood supply." Understanding how pannexin-1 regulates blood flow could lead to new treatments for multiple obesity-related conditions. "Mark is a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher, and this award allows him to further scientific understanding of how obesity is linked with blood vessel spasms in patients' hearts," said Johnstone, an assistant professor at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute. "He continues to be extremely productive, working with world-class researchers as he builds momentum toward his eventual goal of starting his own research group." Renton also works closely with Professor Steven Poelzing and Assistant Professor Jessica Pfleger, both primary faculty in the institute's Center for Vascular and Heart Research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An 'AI scientist', working in collaboration with human scientists, has found that combinations of cheap and safe drugs – used to treat conditions such as high cholesterol and alcohol dependence – could also be effective at treating cancer, a promising new approach to drug discovery. To test their approach, the researchers prompted GPT-4 to identify potential new drug combinations that could have a significant impact on a breast cancer cell line commonly used in medical research. They instructed it to avoid standard cancer drugs, identify drugs that would attack cancer cells while not harming healthy cells, and prioritise drugs that were affordable and approved by regulators. The drug combinations suggested by GPT-4 were then tested by human scientists, both in combination and individually, to measure their effectiveness against breast cancer cells. The LLM then learned from these tests and suggested a further four combinations, three of which also showed promising results. The researchers say that tools such as LLMs are not replacement for scientists, but could instead be supervised AI researchers, with the ability to originate, adapt and accelerate discovery in areas like cancer research. But in scientific research, hallucinations can sometimes be a benefit, if they lead to new ideas that are worth testing. "Supervised LLMs offer a scalable, imaginative layer of scientific exploration, and can help us as human scientists explore new paths that we hadn't thought of before," said Professor Ross King from Cambridge's Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, who led the research. "This can be useful in areas such as drug discovery, where there are many thousands of compounds to search through." This is not automation replacing scientists, but a new kind of collaboration. Guided by expert prompts and experimental feedback, the AI functioned like a tireless research partner-rapidly navigating an immense hypothesis space and proposing ideas that would take humans alone far longer to reach." By exploring subtle synergies and overlooked pathways, GPT-4 helped identify six promising drug pairs, all tested through lab experiments. Among the combinations, simvastatin (commonly used to lower cholesterol) and disulfiram (used in alcohol dependence) stood out against breast cancer cells. Some of these combinations show potential for further research in therapeutic repurposing. These drugs, while not traditionally associated with cancer care, could be potential cancer treatments, although they would first have to go through extensive clinical trials. "This study demonstrates how AI can be woven directly into the iterative loop of scientific discovery, enabling adaptive, data-informed hypothesis generation and validation in real time," said Zenil. "The capacity of supervised LLMs to propose hypotheses across disciplines, incorporate prior results, and collaborate across iterations marks a new frontier in scientific research," said King.

Dr Torres-Lockhart walks through the complex interplay between alcohol use and mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. Sometimes alcohol use is primary; other times, it's a coping mechanism for existing psychiatric conditions. Regardless of which came first, physicians must treat both simultaneously. She advocates for integrated care models that bridge addiction, mental health, and primary care — a shift that could transform outcomes for this highly comorbid population.

Dr Torres-Lockhart explains that clinical frameworks often overlook a vast population of patients who drink moderately but still face significant health risks. She outlines the full spectrum of alcohol use — ranging from abstinence to chaotic dependence — and urges clinicians to identify and support those in the gray zone. This clip introduces validated screening tools like the single-item screener and AUDIT-C to help clinicians engage this often-ignored population with confidence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In adults with psoriasis, adding methotrexate to adalimumab did not improve effectiveness or drug survival compared with adalimumab alone, according to a UK cohort study of patients with plaque psoriasis. “This target trial emulation cohort study did not find evidence that adding methotrexate to adalimumab was beneficial for treating plaque psoriasis,” the study authors wrote. “Future studies evaluating the effect of concomitant methotrexate should either focus on high (> 10 mg/wk) dosing regimens with biologics other than adalimumab for treating plaque psoriasis or with adalimumab for other inflammatory skin diseases,” they added. The study was led by Zenas Yiu, PhD, Centre for Dermatology Research, Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, England, and was published online on June 4 in JAMA Dermatology. Most of the study participants deviated from treatment allocation and had missing outcome data, leading to inaccuracy of relative treatment effects measured by PASI and pharmacokinetic outcomes. Effect estimates in the intervention group lacked precision across all outcomes. Quality-of-life outcomes and baseline adjustment were omitted due to high levels of missing data. As an observational study, participants were unblinded to treatment allocation, introducing potential detection bias.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting found that bedtime procrastination in young adults is associated with specific personality traits, including depressive tendencies. These results remained significant after statistically adjusting for chronotype. Our study demonstrated that individuals who habitually procrastinate their bedtime were actually less likely to report seeking out exciting, engaging, or enjoyable activities. Instead, bedtime procrastinators reported having emotional experiences consistent with depression, specifically endorsing a tendency toward experiencing negative emotions and lacking positive emotional experiences." The AASM recommends that adults should sleep 7 or more hours per night on a regular basis to promote optimal health. The study involved 390 young adults with an average age of 24 years. Participants also completed a questionnaire to assess five personality traits: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. They completed a sleep diary for 14 days to assess bedtime procrastination. According to Carlson, the study suggests that emotional health is a potential target for interventions to address the widespread problem of bedtime procrastination. "Bedtime procrastination is not only associated with poor planning, low self-discipline, and time management problems, but also potentially due to difficulties managing negative affect and anxiety prior to bed," he said. "Given the ubiquity of this behavior, and its impact on sleep health, we hope to extend this research to determine whether reducing negative emotions prior to bedtime can be an effective treatment for bedtime procrastination." The research abstract was published recently in an online supplement of the journal Sleep and will be presented Tuesday, June 10, during SLEEP 2025 in Seattle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study in Genome Biology and Evolution, published by Oxford University Press, finds that the African Swine Fever virus, currently circulating in Europe, is not the result of a recent introduction. Its current dramatic spread appears to be driven largely by people within Europe traveling longer distances. African Swine Fever virus is a highly virulent DNA virus that causes a severe hemorrhagic disease of the same name affecting both domestic pigs and wild boars. Additionally, the outbreak has destroyed many small and medium-sized farms, contributing to structural transformations in agricultural markets, notably in China. Currently, there is no vaccine against the virus available widely. In 2024, the World Organization for Animal Health reported African Swine Fever virus outbreaks in seven European countries, with over one million pigs lost since 2022. The researchers here analyzed ten samples from domestic pigs and wild boar, collected between July 26, 2016, and August 23, 2019, as part of the State Food and Veterinary Service of the Republic of Lithuania surveillance activities in Lithuania. From these samples, they generated complete genome sequences of African Swine Fever Virus. The analysis shows the African Swine Fever Virus genotype II now circulating in Europe shares a single common ancestor with those circulating in Africa, with no evidence of recent viral exchanges between the two continents. Sequences from Europe are closely related to each other and some countries, particularly Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Germany, appear to have played important roles in the regional spread of the virus across the continent. African swine fever virus continues to threaten domestic pig and wild boar populations in Europe. Each viral genome we sequence helps to deepen our understanding of the virus's circulation dynamics."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study conducted by researchers at the Center for Cell-Based Therapy (CTC) highlights key proteins and signaling pathways involved in the efficacy of immunotherapy based on CAR-T cells (lymphocytes modified in the laboratory to fight cancer). The CTC is a Research, Innovation, and Dissemination Center (RIDC) funded by FAPESP and based at the Ribeirão Preto Medical School of the University of São Paulo (FMRP-USP) in Brazil. The research, published in the Journal of Proteome Research, was carried out by John Oluwafemi Teibo, a doctoral student at FMRP-USP and FAPESP scholarship holder, under the supervision of Professor Vitor Faça. "CAR-T cell therapy is innovative and has made incredible advances against hematological diseases. There are many CAR-T cell constructs being approved for clinical use. But we don't fully understand how these CAR-T cells work in terms of molecular mechanisms, or the signaling pathways and molecular effectors involved. And that's the motivation for this study," Teibo said in a video published on the São Paulo Blood Center YouTube channel. The research sought to identify molecular effectors – molecules (usually proteins, but they can also be other molecules) that play a crucial role in responding to stimuli and carrying out specific cellular processes, such as the immune response or signal transduction – related to CAR-T cell therapy in databases such as PubMed and Scopus. "We found 14 proteins, which were classified into four categories. For example, we have interferon gamma and also IL2, which can be used as a surrogate biomarker. John Oluwafemi Teibo, doctoral student at FMRP-USP In addition, recent advances in mass spectrometry have made it possible to analyze the abundance, cellular localization, synthesis/degradation, and post-translational modifications of proteins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Newsom wants to block a California law from taking effect next year that will require nursing homes to have a 96-hour backup power supply, potentially giving the industry a reprieve from having to spend over $1 billion in capital investments. If lawmakers go along, it will be the second time nursing homes have forestalled spending on generators or other power supplies required to keep ventilators, feeding and IV pumps, and medication dispensing machines running during emergencies, such as wildfires. After what just happened earlier this year in Los Angeles, we think fire safety and emergency preparedness is where we want to make cuts?" said Tony Chicotel, a senior staff attorney with the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. California law requires skilled nursing facilities to provide six hours of backup power, from generators or other sources, to run heating and cooling systems and lifesaving medical equipment when utilities shut off power to prevent wildfires or when power is lost. Federal guidelines require nursing homes to have emergency response plans that include backup power or building evacuation. Starting next year, most of California's roughly 1,200 facilities must extend their backup power capability to 96 hours under AB 2511, which lawmakers passed and Newsom signed in 2022. The governor's office did not return multiple requests for comment. Since the 96-hour bill became law, the long-term care sector has made multiple requests for an extension, citing costs over $1 billion to make capital investments. Corey Egel, a spokesperson for the California Association of Health Facilities, said nursing facilities are asking for funding to make the changes. He said that between 800 and 900 of the state's 1,241 nursing facilities will need "substantial modifications," costing at least $1 million per facility, to meet the requirements of AB 2511. Adding backup power supplies often requires big changes to electrical and HVAC systems, all of which need state and local permits. Charlene Harrington, a professor and researcher at the University of California-San Francisco who studies nursing homes, said the industry's lobbying against stricter regulations and enforcement has succeeded largely because nursing home owners have been good at hiding their profits. "When you have a governor who is running for president, they're susceptible to tremendous influence," Harrington said of Newsom, who is widely expected to launch a 2028 presidential bid. And nursing homes, she said, "have been very effective in arguing that they're losing money." Nationally, efforts to more effectively regulate the nursing home industry or enforce tougher standards have often fallen flat, even as the quality of care in skilled nursing facilities has been a concern for years. In April, a federal judge in Texas blocked a Biden administration rule to increase staffing at nursing homes, even though research has found low staffing to be at the root of many of the quality issues across such facilities. "They're jeopardizing the safety of their patients," Harrington said. While federal regulations require nursing homes to have emergency plans with options for backup power or evacuations, some states demand additional preparedness. After 12 people died in an overheated nursing home after Hurricane Irma knocked out the power, Florida in 2018 enacted legislation requiring nursing homes and assisted living facilities to have a generator capable of keeping patient areas at 81 degrees Fahrenheit or lower for at least four days. In California, it took groups representing about 400,000 nursing home residents several years to secure the rule for extended backup power, overcoming a veto by Newsom in 2020. "Put simply, any loss of electrical power puts nursing home residents in peril, since most are extraordinarily vulnerable, and many rely on electrical-powered life support systems," state AARP director Nancy McPherson wrote in a December 2020 policy letter to the California Department of Public Health. "Unsafe temperatures, unrefrigerated medications, and medical devices without power can all have deadly consequences for nursing home residents." It's unclear whether lawmakers will go along with Newsom's request. State senators are advancing separate legislation in committee that would mandate 72 hours of backup power at assisted living facilities that are home to 16 or more residents. Such facilities are not considered health care operations and have different regulations in California. Democratic Assembly member Jacqui Irwin, who authored the 96-hour law, expressed frustration with the governor for "attempting to bureaucratically veto" her legislation, noting that climate-related threats, such as power shutoffs, have only increased. Irwin said Newsom's budget proposal "for an indefinite suspension of the requirement abandons California seniors and those recuperating from an illness or surgery."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cannabis use in older adults is up, according to researchers who used a national survey database to study emergent patterns in older adult use of the substance. Han and colleagues found that when compared with prior years, past-month cannabis use increased significantly across the cohorts, from 4.8% (95% CI, 3.9%-5.9%) in 2021 to 7.0% (95% CI, 6.2%-8.0%) in 2023. Both women and men showed increased trends, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.32 (1.10-1.59) in women and an OR of 1.18 (0.97-1.43) in men. Increased past month cannabis use was also observed in older adults with a minimum $75,000 annual income, those with college or postgraduate degrees, those who were married, and those living in a state with legalized medical cannabis. Further subanalysis of the survey respondents by race showed that persons who identified as “other” sustained the highest OR of increased use, OR = 2.26 (1.12-4.59). Although an increase in past-month cannabis use was associated with a number of medical conditions, the researchers wrote that they were unable to cleanly sort recreational from medical use. The most common medical condition recorded was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with heart conditions, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and two or more chronic conditions also noted to have increased prevalence (6.4%-13.5%). “The substantial increased prevalence in states with legalized medical cannabis highlights the importance of structural educational support for patients and clinicians in those states,” Han and colleagues wrote. “The use of cannabis products, especially with psychoactive properties, may complicate chronic disease management among older adults.” A cannabis researcher not involved in Han and colleagues' study agreed. Meanwhile, in an accompanying editorial, experts pointed to how, despite a lack of consistent data on cannabis use in older age, its use is growing as it is increasingly legalized. “Existing therapeutic evidence for medical cannabis in older adults has been inconsistent across several conditions, with many studies suggesting possible benefits, while others finding limited benefit,” the authors of the editorial wrote. “The potential harms of cannabis use in older adults are apparent, with increased risks of cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal conditions, stroke, sedation, cognitive impairment, falls, motor vehicle injuries, drug-drug interactions, and psychiatric disorders,” they wrote. The editorial authors stated concerns about scant evidence and a lack of standards around administering cannabis in this patient population. “Existing therapeutic evidence for medical cannabis in older adults has been inconsistent across several conditions, with many studies suggesting possible benefits, while others finding limited benefit,” they wrote. “Much of the evidence for benefit derives from a single or a small number of studies with nonrandomized designs, and very few studies evaluated harms, making the benefit to risk ratio unclear.” The study's findings did not surprise Weerts, who said she has been tracking similar data elsewhere. “I am concerned that older adults using cannabis may not be aware of the risks, and that data supporting its efficacy for medical purposes are still not available,” Weerts said.
