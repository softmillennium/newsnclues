                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The filmmaker's planned project follows David Gordon Green's 'The Exorcist: Believer' underperforming in 2023. Fans of The Exorcist might feel their stomachs turn a bit upon learning that Mike Flanagan‘s planned film could take longer to hit theaters than expected. The Hollywood Reporter reported last year that Flanagan would be writing, directing and producing a new project in the Exorcist universe for Universal Pictures that was scheduled for release on March 13, 2026. “Production hasn't started, we need to finish Carrie first,” Flanagan wrote. 'Carrie' Showrunner Mike Flanagan "Can't Wait" for Viewers to See Summer Howell in Title Role The director's new Exorcist feature that hails from Blumhouse and Morgan Creek was announced in May 2024 and will not be a sequel to a previous film in the franchise. This followed Universal shelling out a whopping $400 million in 2021 to land an Exorcist trilogy from director David Gordon Green. During an interview last year with THR, Flanagan addressed the pressure surrounding his Exorcist film being billed as a radical new take on the property. “This is an opportunity to do something that I believe has never been done within the franchise — something that honors what came before it but isn't built on nostalgia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Peter Gould (Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul) has a new drama pilot in development at FX. Disinherited, written by Gould, who will also direct the pilot and serve as executive producer, will star Victoria Pedretti (Ponyboi, You) and Kiera Allen (Watson, The Good Doctor). In Disinherited, an unexpected inheritance thrusts a pair of scrappy sisters into a world of generational wealth and long-buried crimes. In addition to Gould, Rian Johnson, Ram Bergman, and Nena Rodrigue of T-Street executive produce with FX Productions producing. He made his TV directorial debut in Season 4 of Breaking Bad and wrote and directed the penultimate episode of the series. Gould also wrote the HBO film Too Big to Fail, directed by Oscar-winner Curtis Hanson. Pedretti made her TV debut in Nell Crain's The Haunting of Hill House (2018), based on Shirley Jackson's novel, for Netflix. She followed that up with the role of Love Quinn in Netflix's You, and in 2020, she headlined The Haunting of Bly Manor. She is currently filming Forbidden Fruits, a horror film about a witchy cult beneath a mall store, and will star in Rachel Rose's The Last Day opposite Alicia Vikander and Wagner Moura. Pedretti is represented by CAA, Entertainment 360, and Sloan, Offer, Weber & Dern. Kiera Allen is best known for her work as the leading role opposite Sarah Paulson in Hulu's psychological thriller Run, directed by Aneesh Chaganty. Allen will next be seen in Jonathan Sobol's Littlemouth opposite Dennis Quaid and Josh Hutcherson. Allen's work in Run earned critical praise, with the Los Angeles Times calling it a “revelatory performance” and The Hollywood Reporter naming her one of their “Breakout Stars of 2020.” She was also honored with the “Spotlight Award” at the 2020 Hollywood Critics Association Awards for her role. Allen is represented by Paradigm, Entertainment 360 and Peikoff/Mahan. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 27-year-old streamer and rapper DDG (Darryl Dwayne Granberry Jr.) made the allegations in a counter-petition filed Wednesday (June 4) against Bailey, who won a temporary domestic violence restraining order last month after claiming DDG had physically attacked her multiple times in the presence of their 18-month-old son, Halo. DDG denies abusing Bailey and says he's actually the one who needs protection. He claims Bailey has repeatedly punched and slapped him, stalked him by hiding Airtags in his cars, and threatened to take her own life during jealous outbursts when he attempted to end their relationship or “establish boundaries.” DDG says Bailey has also used Halo as a tool of manipulation, threatening to get an abortion during the pregnancy and, now, blocking his access to the child. “In or about August 2023, during a particularly volatile argument, petitioner became enraged and threatened to end her life using my legally owned firearm. DDG's counter-petition includes pages of text messages between the duo, including messages where Bailey writes, “IM GOONG TO KILL MYSWLF TONIGHT” [sic] and “I am simply not tough enough for this world. Please take halo so he doesn't have to see.” Bailey has sought court permission to bring Halo on the contractually mandated film shoot, but DDG's counter-petition says international travel is dangerous because Bailey poses a psychological risk to both herself and the child. “A parent who has threatened suicide repeatedly — who has armed herself with a firearm while in emotional crisis, who has driven with the child in a potentially suicidal state, and who continues to escalate when emotionally dysregulated — cannot be entrusted to care for a vulnerable infant abroad, without the safety net of California court supervision, welfare checks, mental health intervention or child protective services,” wrote DDG's attorney Larry Bakman in the court papers. Bailey's reps did not immediately return a request for comment on the allegations, though her attorney, Terry Levich Ross, said during a hearing in Los Angeles court on Wednesday that DDG's counterclaims are “not accurate.” During that hearing, Judge Latrice A.G. Byrdsong said she'll issue a decision soon as to whether Bailey can bring Halo when she departs for Italy on Saturday (June 7). A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Nearly twelve months on from its last round of layoffs, Warner Bros. Deadline understands that the company is set to lay off employees on the cable television side of its business. This comes as the global linear networks division saw operating profit fall 14% to $1.8B with revenue down 6% to $4.8B in its first-quarter financial results unveiled last month. All of this follows a move by Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav to reorganize the company into two operating divisions – Global Linear Networks and Studios & Streaming. He said that the move means it “can move quickly if we decide to change and make a determination on restructuring”. However, S&P downgraded the company to “junk status” on “weak credit metrics” and called such a separation “credit negative”. This is precisely what NBCUniversal owner Comcast did by splitting off its cable networks from the rest of the company into a standalone public company called Versant, which led to another round of layoffs. Earlier this month, Deadline revealed that Disney laid off several hundred employees globally across its film and television businesses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discovery has been sued by Russell Simmons, who alleges that the filmmakers behind On the Record defamed him by turning a blind eye to evidence disputing accusations that he sexually assaulted women in his orbit. He seeks $20 million and a court order that would force WBD to remove the title from its platforms. On the Record tells the stories of Simmons' accusers — including former Def Jam executive Drew Dixon, domestic violence awareness activist Sil Lai Abrams and screenwriter Jenny Lumet — as they decide to go public with allegations of sexual assault. It was produced by Oscar-nominated directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering via their production banner Jane Doe Films, all of whom are named in the complaint, with Dan Cogan for Impact Partners. Russell Simmons Sued For Defamation By Former Def Jam Recordings Executive A distribution deal with Apple TV+ was severed when Oprah Winfrey publicly announced that she was pulling out as executive producer, citing creative differences with the filmmakers. It was later picked up by HBO Max as its first-ever festival acquisition. WBD and the documentary's producers additionally ignored ignored nine polygraph tests, as well as other information that “would have been discovered with due diligence and adherence to accepted journalistic standards,” writes Imran Ansari, a lawyer from Simmons, in the complaint. The majority of the title follows Dixon, who last year filed a defamation lawsuit against Simmons for allegedly trying to undermine her sexual assault accusations against him.

One of Cassie Ventura's friends testified Wednesday that Sean “Diddy” Combs dangled her over a 17th-floor balcony, telling jurors that the incident left her with “night terrors and paranoia.” Bongolan is one of many witnesses already called by prosecutors, who claim Combs ran a criminal enterprise aimed at coercing Ventura and other women into participating in drug-fueled sex shows known as “freak-offs.” Defense attorneys have said the sex was consensual and that Combs merely operated a legitimate music business. On the witness stand Wednesday, she described it for jurors, saying it had left her with “a bruise on the back of my leg and back and neck pain.” Bongolan also testified that she once saw Diddy throw a knife at Ventura, and about another time that she saw Cassie with a black eye. She also told jurors about an alleged incident at a photoshoot in which Combs threatened her life. “He came up really close to my face and said something around the lines of, ‘I'm the devil and I could kill you,'” Bongolan said. Combs was indicted in September, charged with running a sprawling criminal operation aimed at facilitating the freak-offs — elaborate events in which Combs and others allegedly coerced Ventura and other victims into having sex with escorts while he watched and masturbated. (Read Billboard‘s full explainer of the case against Diddy here.) Once one of the music industry's most powerful men, Combs is accused of racketeering conspiracy (a so-called RICO charge), sex trafficking and violating a federal prostitution statute. The trial, which has already featured testimony from Ventura herself, another unnamed victim named Mia and numerous other witnesses, is expected to run until early July. Bongolan is expected to continue testifying in the afternoon. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

That night included a Halloween KISS concert, an attempted casino trip (denied at the door: no passport), a persistent limo driver trying to crash the afterparty, and vodka. “If we tried that now, it would take me two weeks to recover.” Lynskey still lights up when she talks about how Lyonne works. She has a real sort of looseness to her limbs. And I feel like there's always a part of my brain that's like, ‘What do I do with hands? Even before “Poker Face,” Lyonne's spirit helped shape Lynskey's path — sometimes literally. When Lynskey was auditioning for the role of a New Jersey girl in “Coyote Ugly” and couldn't afford a dialect coach, she leaned on her interpretation of Lyonne (never mind that she was very much born and raised on the Upper East Side). “It morphed into something else after I got cast, but I kind of based it on Natasha, yeah,” she said with a laugh. Now, even as Lyonne's busy running the show, she's still hyping her friends. I remember one time I got a message from her, and she was looking for acting coach or a dialect coach and she said, ‘You're the best actor I have in my phone.' I loved how it wasn't hyperbolic,” Lynskey said. “We had this great night recently, just hanging at Natasha's house and talking for hours. “She's such a treasure to all of us,” Lynskey said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As President Donald Trump and his administration continue their systematic attack on trans Americans, both activists and unaffiliated individuals are targeting the FBI's latest attempt to prosecute doctors giving trans youth gender-affirming care. On Monday, the FBI asked for tips on doctors or hospitals “who mutilate under the guise of gender-affirming care,” which refers to surgical intervention for trans youth. In January, Trump issued an executive order calling gender affirming care the “chemical and surgical mutilation” of children and threatening to remove federal funding from hospitals that performed it. In April, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi — who served as one of the lawyers on Trump's first impeachment defense team — issued a memo stating the Justice Department's intention to use several existing  U.S. laws to investigate providers of trans health care, including those prohibiting female genital mutilation. So on Monday, the FBI asked anyone who had tips of doctors or practitioners performing gender affirming “surgical procedures” to report them directly to the FBI tip line. “As the Attorney General has made clear, we will protect our children and hold accountable those who mutilate them under the guise of gender-affirming care. For minors 15 to 17 years old, almost all who underwent surgery had procedures focused on their chests — but at a lower rate than cisgender males. But in May, a 400-page report released by the Department of Health and Human Services recommended treatment plans entirely similar to conversion therapy. So it didn't take long for this social media post and the accompanying contact information to make its way into the group chats of numerous pro-LGBTQ+ allies and advocates. The two sources say that various concerned citizens, activists, and other individuals immediately began making calls — including anonymous VoIP ones — to the 800 number, delivering profane tirades and insults. At times, pissed-off callers were frustrated they couldn't seem to leave a voicemail and were left chastising what appeared to be just a human operator for the bureau. Covid Vaccine Boosters Won't Be Available for Healthy Adults Under 65. An audio file shared with Rolling Stone featured a gay former federal employee, who requested anonymity, simply screaming into the federal tip line: “Fuck off, Nazi dickheads!” However cathartic any spamming of the FBI hotline may be for any number of trans rights supporters, some activists and legal experts warn that callers or pranksters should be incredibly careful about what they say on a recorded federal tip line — especially given the uniquely lawless administration that has shown an eager willingness to crack down on Trump's enemies when there's no evidence of any wrongdoing. “There are absolutely a lot of people who want to clog up the snitch line,” this person says. “My advice is: Don't make anything that can be construed as a threat. Just speak your mind, be short and sweet about it, hang up.” In late February, top Trump adviser Elon Musk demanded that federal employees reply to “an email requesting to understand what they got done last week” or face a forced “resignation.” As Rolling Stone reported at the time, after copies of the email were leaked online, the government inbox was predictably flooded with pranks and what one Trump administration official described as “very rude” and foul-mouthed emails. In recent years, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton emerged as a high-profile proponent of wielding state power against these families. More recently, some of Paxton's team have filtered into the new Trump administration. “These decades of established research standards of care that have been empirically validated are now relegated to junk science, and the legitimate science is whatever they want to make up — but that's the Trump administration for you,” Douglas C. Haldeman, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist who's worked with people recovering from conversion therapy, told Rolling Stone in May. What Happened When the FBI Asked for Dirt on Docs Treating Trans Kids: ‘F-ck Off Nazi Dickheads' Raquel Willis, co-founder of the Gender Liberation Movement, tells Rolling Stone that building a practice of defiance is an important part of making sure communities don't become complacent to Trump-era harassment attempts — especially those that seem to be attempts at control couched in safety language. “Even though this FBI tip line and the discourse around it seem maybe innocuous to a lot of people, it does speak to the desire to criminalize bodily autonomy for young trans people and also criminalize private decisions that they're making with their parents and qualified physicians about their care,” Willis says. “It's very interesting that conservatives have taken on this crusade to infringe on private decisions when for so long they claimed they didn't want state intervention in everyday life. This is not actually about some deeper desire to protect anyone.</p>

Heart is offering an unspecified reward and “no questions asked” for any information leading to the retrieval leading to their return.

After the first part of his sprawling epic made history as the highest grossing movie musical of all time, Chu and his VFX team felt the pressure to be more than “good” once more. “When we're in VFX reviews, I'm like, ‘Guys, this is going to be a meme. So if you're not proud of this and you don't want to see this repeated a thousand times in your feed, then just get it right,'” Chu told Vanity Fair about being in post-production on part two. “It allows us to all push ourselves again and not rest on our laurels.” Related Stories ‘John Candy: I Like Me' Documentary to Open 2025 Toronto International Film Festival ‘The Ritual' Review: Al Pacino Performs an Exorcism in a Horror Effort Possessed by Mediocrity And there are more than a few laurels the “Wicked” team could be resting on: The film landed 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Actress for Cynthia Erivo, and Best Supporting Actress for Ariana Grande. Meanwhile, Chu took home Best Director at the Critics' Choice Movie Awards, and the feature won a Golden Globe for box office achievement. In “Wicked: For Good,” Erivo and Grande reprise their roles of Elphaba and Ariana Grande, with the political turmoil of Oz throwing their friendship into disarray. “As we prepared the production over the last year, it became impossible to wrestle the story of ‘Wicked' into a single film without doing some real damage to it,” Chu wrote in April 2022. We decided to give ourselves a bigger canvas and make not just one ‘Wicked' movie but two! With more space, we can tell the story of ‘Wicked' as it was meant to be told while bringing even more depth and surprise to the journeys for these beloved characters.” “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” were shot at the same time, with Chu now telling VF that certain parts of “For Good” were actually filmed prior to the central storyline of “Wicked.” The out of order production no doubt was a shift for the ensemble cast, with Jonathan Bailey telling IndieWire that “Wicked: For Good” has a big “tonal shift.” “Every single person involved led with that same intentionality and thoughtfulness,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dakota Johnson brought both charm and humor to her June 2 appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” The “Fifty Shades of Grey” star was mid-conversation with the host when she noticed that the plunging neckline of her Ferragamo dress was revealing more than intended.The visit marked part of Johnson's press tour for her upcoming film “Materialists.” As she took her seat next to Fallon, she gasped and said, “Oh, God,” while adjusting her dress. A post shared by The Tonight Show (@fallontonight) Despite the wardrobe challenge, Johnson kept her composure and sense of humor throughout the interview — a reminder of her unfiltered charm that fans have come to love.“This is the wrong outfit,” Johnson told Fallon while shifting uncomfortably. Fallon quickly tried to reassure the Madame Web star by saying, “I think it's perfect.” The interview continued with Johnson remaining poised and self-aware. At one point, she remained motionless in her chair, smiling while Fallon remarked, “Just don't move.” As The Roots played a musical cue, Johnson joked again, “My eyes are up here,” drawing another round of laughter from the live audience. Fallon looked upward dramatically and joked, “I can't even look there. Johnson tucked the napkin into her dress and quipped, “That's good. While appearing on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” the strap of Johnson's Bottega Veneta dress came undone mid-interview. “Well, I'll just hold it,” she said, then added with a laugh, “The movie is really good,” while promoting her film “Daddio.”</p>
