            Meghan, Duchess of Sussex has shared rare photos of her daughter, Lilibet, to mark the princess' fourth birthday.
    


            In one black-and-white picture, posted on Instagram on Wednesday, Meghan can be seen cuddling Lilibet, whose face is partially visible behind her mother's hand and arm.
    


            “Happy birthday to our beautiful girl! Four years ago today she came into our lives – and each day is brighter and better because of it. Thanks to all of those sending love and celebrating her special day,” wrote Meghan in the caption.
    


            A second photo in the post shows Meghan cradling Lilibet, whose face is visible in profile, shortly after her birth.
    


            The princess was born on June 4, 2021, a year after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped back from their roles as senior royals and moved to the United States.
    


            Meghan and husband Prince Harry are known to fiercely guard the privacy of Lilibet and older brother Prince Archie, 6.
    


            The couple did release a Christmas card last year that featured a rare photo of both children, but their backs are to the camera as they run towards their parents. Five other images appeared on the card, all depicting engagements from the year. It marked the first time since 2021 that Harry and Meghan released a Christmas card featuring their children.
    


            In April, Meghan revealed that she had suffered from postpartum preeclampsia, calling the potentially fatal condition “so rare and so scary.”
    


            “The world doesn't know what's happening quietly,” Meghan said on the debut episode of her “Confessions of a Female Founder” podcast.
    


            “And in the quiet, you're still trying to show up for people… mostly for your children, but those things are huge medical scares.”
    


            Most cases of postpartum preeclampsia develop within 48 hours of childbirth, but it can develop four to six weeks postpartum, according to the Mayo Clinic. Postpartum preeclampsia can cause seizures and other serious complications if left untreated.

            Nearly 1 million Russian soldiers have been killed or injured in the country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a new study, a grisly measure of the human cost of Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked three-year assault on his neighbor.
    


            Russia will likely hit the 1 million casualty mark this summer, said the study, published Tuesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a think tank in Washington, DC. It said the “stunning” milestone was a “sign of Putin's blatant disregard for his soldiers.”
    


            Of the estimated 950,000 Russian casualties so far, as many as 250,000 are dead, according to the study. “No Soviet or Russian war since World War II has even come close to Ukraine in terms of fatality rate,” it said.  Ukraine has sustained nearly 400,000 casualties, it added, with between 60,000 and 100,000 deaths.
    


            Although Kyiv does not disclose its own combat losses in any detail and Moscow is believed to drastically underestimate its own casualties, the CSIS figures are in line with British and United States intelligence assessments.
    


            In March, the British defense ministry estimated that Russia had sustained around 900,000 casualties since 2022. For months, it has judged that Russia is losing about 1,000 soldiers each day, whether killed or wounded. Based on that trend, Russia would be expected to surpass the 1 million threshold in the coming weeks.
    


            Rebutting claims from some Western lawmakers that Russia holds “all the cards” in the war in Ukraine, the CSIS study used Russian casualty figures – as well as estimates of its heavy equipment losses and sluggish territorial gains – as evidence that Moscow's military “has performed relatively poorly on the battlefield” and failed to achieve its main war goals.
    


            After Ukraine repelled Russia's initial “blitzkrieg” assault in 2022, the war has since become attritional. While Kyiv dug in with trenches and mines, Moscow funneled more and more troops into what have become known as “meat grinder” assaults, throwing soldiers into campaigns for only marginal territorial gains, the study said.
    


            In the northeastern Kharkiv region, Russian forces have advanced an average of only 50 meters per day, according to the study. That is slower than the British and French advance in the Battle of the Somme in the trench warfare of World War I.
    


            The slow rate of advance has meant Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory since January 2024, which the authors called a “paltry” amount. Russia now occupies around 20% of Ukraine's territory, including the Crimean peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014.
    


            But Russia's dwindling territorial gains have not led to a change in strategy. To sustain Russia's staggering rate of casualties, the Kremlin has enlisted convicts from its prisons and welcomed more than 10,000 troops from its ally North Korea, but it has left the children of Moscow and St. Petersburg elites largely untouched.
    


            Instead, Moscow has recruited in the far north and far east of the country, where men have been lured by pay packages that are life-changing among poorer communities in those regions. “Putin likely considers these types of soldiers more expendable and less likely to undermine his domestic support base,” the study noted.
    


            Whereas Ukraine, a democracy with a population less than a quarter the size of Russia's, has faced some pushback in its attempts to mobilize more troops, Russia, where criticism of the war has been outlawed, has faced no significant dissent. But, with the war now well into its fourth year, the authors warned that the “blood cost” of its protracted campaign was a potential vulnerability for Putin.
    


            Although Russia has had the “initiative” in the conflict since early 2024, the authors said the attritional nature of the war has left “few opportunities for decisive breakthroughs.”
    


            Instead, Russia's main hope to win “is for the United States to cut off aid to Ukraine” – as President Donald Trump briefly did earlier this year – and “walk away from the conflict” – as officials in his administration have threatened to do.

Follow:


            Erin Patterson, the woman accused of murdering three guests with a meal laced with death cap mushrooms, told her trial on Wednesday she may have inadvertently added foraged mushrooms to the lunch because her duxelles tasted “a little bland.”
    


            On the third day of evidence on Wednesday, Patterson was taken through the events of July, 2023, when she's accused of deliberately adding lethal death cap mushrooms to a Beef Wellington meal she cooked for four guests, including her parents-in-law, at her house in the small Australian town of Leongatha in rural Victoria.
    


            Patterson has denied three counts of murder over the death of her in-laws, Don Patterson and Gail Patterson, and Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson. She also denies attempting to kill a fourth lunch guest, Heather's husband, Ian Wilkinson, her local pastor.
    


            Taking Patterson back to the days before the lunch, defense lawyer Colin Mandy SC asked where she'd bought the ingredients. Patterson said all ingredients came from Woolworths, a major Australian supermarket.
    


            Patterson said she found the recipe in a cookbook, which she followed with “some deviations.” For example, she said she couldn't find a beef tenderloin log, so she bought twin packs of individual steaks. The recipe had called for mustard, which she didn't use, nor did she use prosciutto because Don “doesn't eat pork,” she said.
    


            On the Saturday morning of the lunch, she said she fried garlic and shallots and chopped up the store-bought mushrooms in a food processor.  She cooked the sauteed mixture, known as a duxelles, for perhaps 45 minutes so it was dry and didn't make the pastry soggy, she said.
    


            Patterson told the court she tasted the mixture, and as it was “a little bland,” she added dried mushrooms that she'd previously stored in a plastic container in the pantry.
    


            Asked by Mandy what she believed to be in the plastic container in the pantry: “I believed it was just the mushrooms that I bought in Melbourne,” Patterson said. “And now, what do you think might have been in that tub?” Mandy asked.
    


            “Now I think that there was a possibility that there were foraged ones in there as well,” she said, her voice breaking.
    


            Patterson told the court that Ian and Heather Wilkinson ate all of their meal. Don finished what Gail hadn't eaten. Patterson only ate about a quarter or third of her Beef Wellington, because she was talking a lot and eating slowly, she said.
    


            After lunch, they cleaned up and sat down to eat an orange cake that Gail had brought.
    


            “I had a piece of cake, and then another piece of cake, and then another,” Patterson said. “How many pieces of cake did you have?” Mandy asked. “All of it,” Patterson replied. She said that amounted to around two-thirds of the original cake.
    


            “I felt over full, so I went to the toilets and brought it back up again,” she said. Patterson has previously told the court that she had battled bulimia for much of her life and was self-conscious about her weight.
    


            Patterson said she felt nauseous after the lunch, and later that evening, took medication for diarrhea. The next day she skipped Sunday mass due to the same symptoms and still had diarrhea later that day.
    


            That night, she said, she removed the pastry and mushrooms from the leftover Beef Wellington and put the meat in the microwave for the children to eat for dinner.
    


            The next day, Monday, she thought she might need fluids so went to the hospital, where a doctor told her that she may have been exposed to death cap mushrooms.  Patterson said she was “shocked and confused.” “I didn't see how death cap mushrooms could be in the meal,” she said.
    


            Earlier Wednesday, Patterson told the court she hadn't seen websites that purported to show the location of death cap mushrooms near her house.
    


            She said she was aware of death cap mushrooms and had searched online to find out if they grew in the area. She said she found that they didn't.
    


            Patterson also told her trial on Wednesday that she foraged for mushrooms at the Korumburra Botanical Gardens in May 2023, and may have picked some mushrooms near oak trees. The court has previously heard that death cap mushrooms grow near oak trees.
    


            Patterson said she would dehydrate any mushrooms she didn't want to use immediately and store them in plastic containers in the pantry. She said that around that time she also bought dried mushrooms from an Asian grocer in Melbourne. Because they had a pungent smell, she said she put them in a plastic container in the pantry.
    


            Mandy asked: “Do you have a memory of putting wild mushrooms that you dehydrated in May or June of 2023 into a container which already contained other dried mushrooms?”
    


            Patterson replied: “Yes, I did do that.”
    


            Later in proceedings, Patterson recalled a conversation she had with her husband, Simon, as his parents were gravely ill in hospital. She said she mentioned she had dried mushrooms in a dehydrator. “He said to me, ‘Is that how you poisoned my parents, using that dehydrator?'” she told her trial.
    


            She said his comment caused her to do “a lot of thinking about a lot of things.”
    


            “It got me thinking about all the times that I'd used (the dehydrator), and how I had dried foraged mushrooms in it weeks earlier, and I was starting to think, what if they'd gone in the container with the Chinese mushrooms? Maybe, maybe that had happened.”
    


            Patterson said she became “really scared,” and by the time she returned home from the health center, she was “frantic.” She felt “responsible” because she'd made the meal, and served it, and “people got sick,” she said.
    


            On August 2, Patterson said she dropped her children at school, then took the dehydrator to the trash dump. She said child protection officers were due to visit her house that afternoon, and she was “scared” about having a conversation about the meal and the dehydrator. “I was scared that they would blame me for it…. for making everyone sick,” she said.
    


            “I was scared they'd remove the children,” she added.
    


            Asked whether she had come to the realization that death cap mushrooms may have been in the meal, Patterson said, “No.”
    


            She said she thought there might be evidence of “any foraged mushrooms” in the dehydrator.
    


            Patterson also told the court she was responsible for three factory resets of her phone. Her son did the first. She said she knew there were images of mushrooms and the dehydrator in her Google photos. “I just panicked and didn't want them to see them,” she said. Asked who she was talking about, she said: “The detectives.”
    


            Patterson's evidence will continue Thursday.

The recent Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian airfields reportedly hosting nuclear-capable bombers sharply increase the risk of escalation, Keith Kellogg, US President Donald Trump's special envoy, has warned. 

On Sunday, Kiev launched a drone raid targeting airfields in five regions, according to the Defense Ministry in Moscow. Officials in Kiev said that the attack was aimed at Russia's strategic aviation. Ukrainian media reports claimed that the airfields house Russian Tu-95 and Tu-22M strategic bombers, as well as an A-50 early warning and control plane. 

Russian officials said that the “terrorist attack” was repelled with no casualties but that several aircraft caught fire. 

In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Kellogg suggested that the attack was upping the stakes in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “The risk levels are going way up,” he explained. “When you attack an opponent's part of their national survival system, which is their nuclear triad… that means your risk level goes up because you don't know what the other side's going to do.” 

The envoy also noted that he was particularly concerned by reports – which were not confirmed by Moscow – that Ukraine also struck the Northern Fleet headquarters in Severomorsk, which would have meant that two of the three legs of Russia's nuclear triad were under attack. 

He added that when it comes to such kinds of attacks, “it's not so much the damage you do on the triad itself… but it's the psychological impact you have.” Ukraine, according to the envoy, also wanted to show that it could “raise the risk level to levels that are basically, to me, they've got to be unacceptable.” 

Earlier this week, the New York Times reported, citing sources, that Ukraine did not give advance notice to the US of the strikes, and that the two sides currently have no joint planning on operations inside Russian territory. NYT sources also believe that Moscow will mount “a significant retaliation,” although specifics are yet unclear. 

Following the attacks, Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who now serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, warned that a response was “inevitable.”

US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will not attend Wednesday's Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels, the Pentagon has confirmed. It marks the first time the head of the Pentagon will miss a gathering of the group.

The US has been the lynchpin of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which has provided Ukraine with around $126 billion in weapons and other military assistance since its inception in April 2022. Under former Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin, Washington also served as the group's chair, with the secretary and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff attending its monthly meetings. 

However, Hegseth will not be present at the meeting of 50 defense ministers in Belgium, Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson confirmed, citing scheduling issues. At the same time, she stressed that “the United States is focused on ending the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible, on terms that establish an enduring peace.”

An unnamed US official cited by AP also said Hegseth will not participate in the meeting remotely. According to Politico sources, US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker will represent Washington at the gathering, and Hegseth himself is slated to take part in a NATO meeting in Brussels on Thursday.

Politico noted that Hegseth's absence is yet another sign of “softening of the Trump administration's relationship with Europe, and Ukraine.” Under Trump, Washington has not announced new military assistance for Ukraine.

The Trump administration has increasingly urged EU governments to reduce their reliance on Washington and increase their military spending.

Hegseth himself has been skeptical of the US involvement in the Ukraine conflict. In February, he said that returning Ukraine to its 2014 borders was “unrealistic” and that the country is unlikely to join NATO.

Nevertheless, the Trump administration has positioned itself as the key mediator in the conflict, consistently pushing Russia and Ukraine to reach peace. Moscow has praised Washington's efforts, saying the US better understands Russia's key security concerns caused by Kiev's desire to join NATO and the bloc's creeping expansion towards Russian borders.

 The US Navy has been directed to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a replenishment oiler named after the slain gay rights activist and Navy veteran, as part of a broader initiative by President Donald Trump to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) references within the military.

The upcoming renaming has not yet been officially confirmed but was outlined in an internal memo, multiple defense sources told Military.com and other media outlets on Tuesday.

The USNS Harvey Milk was named in 2016 by then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to honor Milk's service and activism, and it was christened in 2021 by a transgender veteran.

Milk, who became an LGBT icon as the first openly gay official elected in the state of California, served in the US Navy in the 1950s before being discharged due to his sexual orientation. Less than a year after he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Milk was assassinated in 1978 by a fellow board member who had clashed with him over city policy.

The renaming aligns with the Trump administration's efforts to reestablish a “warrior culture” and remove DEI initiatives from federal agencies.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the ship's new name has not yet been chosen.

The decision, which comes during Pride Month, has drawn harsh criticism from Democrats, with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemning the move as a “shameful, vindictive erasure” of civil rights figures' legacies. California Governor Gavin Newsom called the decision a sign of “Trump's contempt for the very values our veterans fight to protect.”

The Navy has not yet officially announced a new name for the vessel, and it remains unclear whether other John Lewis-class ships – all named after civil rights leaders – will also be renamed. Other ships in the fleet are named after African-American civil rights leader John Lewis, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, former US Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and women's rights activists and abolitionists Lucy Stone and Sojourner Truth.

PYONGYANG, June 4. /TASS/. On instructions from Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu arrived in Pyongyang, where he is scheduled to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a TASS correspondent reported.

This is his second visit to Pyongyang in less than three months.

The press service of the Russian Security Council told TASS that the sides are expected to ""discuss implementation of certain provisions of the Russia-DPRK treaty on comprehensive strategic partnership, and efforts to perpetuate the memory of Korean warriors, who helped to liberate the Kursk Region.""

On top of that, the sides are expected to discuss pressing issues of the international agenda, including the situation around Ukraine.

Shoigu's previous visit to North Korea took place on March 21. Back then, he was received by Kim Jong Un, and their conversation lasted around two hours. Shoigu said he conveyed Putin's message to the North Korean leader. They discussed Ukraine and the start of Russia-US dialogue.

On the sidelines of the 13th international meeting of high-level representatives in charge of security issues held last month, Shoigu met with North Korea's minister of state security, Ri Chang Dae.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Few other places in the US will see the effects of funding cuts felt more than in Appalachian communities

For healthcare specialists around western Appalachia, the recent dramatic fall in opioid overdose deaths has been nothing short of spectacular.

Last year saw a record decline of 30% in Kentucky to 1,410 people. In neighboring West Virginia, state health authorities estimate that there are at least 318 more people alive today due in large part to the availability and widespread use of naloxone or Narcan, a nasal spray that when administered in time, can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.

Recent years have seen a spate of treatment and recovery programs help initiate a dramatic fall in the number of people dying from illicit drug overdoses. In Tennessee alone, authorities have attributed it to saving “at least 103,000 lives” between late 2017 and mid-2024.

“It's working damn good. I knew six months ago that [the number of overdose deaths decreased] from the street,” says Chris Tucker, who works with the healthcare provider Pathways in north-eastern Kentucky.

“It's a good upswing from what it was two years ago. You see success stories every day. If people are putting a foot forward, that's a success.”

But now, the White House and Republican politicians are proposing cuts to programs and departments that could undo that hard-fought progress.

On 2 May, the Trump administration announced proposed cuts of $33.3bn to the health and human services department budget that would eliminate, among other programs, $56m used to train first responders and law enforcement officers how to administer Narcan.

In March, the White House cut more than $11bn in federal grants for addiction, mental health and infectious disease projects and programs. The same month, it announced plans to subsume the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) into the newly created Administration for a Healthy America (AHA). SAMHSA lost more than 100 staff in March and is set for further cuts.

House Republicans have been looking to cut funding for Medicaid, a program that provides communities with millions of dollars in opioid treatment and recovery funding, a move that Trump has recently warned against. Many of the proposed funding cuts are a part of the administration's 2026 fiscal year budget proposal, which starts on 1 July.

“We still saw nearly 90,000 people die from overdoses last year. We owe it to them to do better and to save lives. The answer cannot be to cut these programs,” says Hanna Sharif-Kazemi of the Drug Policy Alliance.

Few other places in the US will see the effects of funding cuts felt more than in Appalachian communities. And few Appalachian communities have been hit as hard as Huntington, West Virginia, part of a region situated along the banks of the Ohio river that major drug manufacturers swamped with highly addictive painkillers such as Oxycontin in decades past.

Huntington's Cabell county has the highest opioid overdose death rate in what for years has been the worst-hit state in the country. Nearby in Kentucky's Boyd county, its 31 drug-related deaths in 2019 were more than three times the national level, and the second highest of any county in the Commonwealth.

Kyle Gibson, 37, grew up in neighboring Boyd county, Kentucky, in the late 1990s.

“The thing I am concerned about is access to treatment, because there's a big pool of funding that puts peer supports in places where they otherwise wouldn't be – hospitals, ERs, syringe exchanges all over the place,” says Gibson, the regional director at Path Behavioral Healthcare in Huntington, an organization providing mental and behavioral health treatment across five states.

“They are meeting people at their most vulnerable point in their lives, trying to give them direction. If that was cut, that would be detrimental.”

Now in recovery, Gibson's journey into addiction was similar to many others in this area. He found the painkiller OxyContin in his grandmother's house when he was in high school, which led him on the road to methamphetamines, Suboxone and other substance addictions.

“That was at a time when [doctors] were really pushing [highly addictive opioid painkillers]. Doctor shopping was a thing. For 11 years, it got real bad,” he says.

“I went to treatment just so my mom could sleep at night.”

When authorities clamped down on pill mills and pharmaceuticals more than a decade ago, in their place came heroin, then synthetic opioids fentanyl and more recently, carfentanyl.

Health experts say the pandemic contributed to a rise in loneliness in many small, rural communities, which in turn fueled a further wave of opioid overdose deaths.

Kentucky saw a 49% increase in overdose deaths from 2019 to 2020. Two years later, it still ranked among states with the highest per capita opioid overdose fatalities.

So for those who've worked hard to develop recovery and treatment efforts across Kentucky, the recent budget cuts are a major blow.

“Reducing this funding not only undermines life-saving work, it contradicts the goal of achieving greater government efficiency. Pulling support now would not only stall momentum but set us back years in the great investments we have made,” says Tara Hyde of People Advocating Recovery, a Louisville-based non-profit.

Experts say the benefits of reducing the number of people dying from overdoses include having more people in local workforces, reducing the load on already-struggling hospital emergency rooms and staff, and parents being alive, healthy and able to raise their children.

“This progress has created momentum helping to reduce stigma, because more people are showcasing the reality of recovery and speaking out to show that they are thriving in the workforce, going to school, or learning a trade,” says Hyde.

In Huntington, a city that's lost close to half its residents since the 1950s, population decline has now slowed to a trickle, while household income levels are on the rise.

Still this region, which encompasses a corner of Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia, locally known as “KYOVA” and dissected by the slow-moving Ohio river, the recent successes don't mean that communities have entirely left addiction, and its associated ills – poverty, crime and mental health – behind.

Outside the Harmony House shelter on Huntington's 4th Avenue, around a dozen people with their belongings – sleeping bags, clothes and bottles of water gathered up in shopping carts – bake in the early summer heat.

“We're used to adapting and overcoming,” says Gibson, whose offices are a couple of blocks away, “one way or the other.”

Trump says ‘good' conversation with Putin won't lead to ‘immediate peace' in Ukraine 

Donald Trump has said that he has just discussed the recent drone attacks by Ukraine on Russia and developments concerning Iran in a phone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin that lasted over an hour.

During the conversation, Putin told Trump that Russia will have to respond to the Ukrainian drone attacks, the US president said. “It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace,” he said in a Truth Social Post.

Putin had said “very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields” - referring to ‘Operation Spiderweb', which saw Ukrainian agents move drones and explosives deep inside Russia to strike four airbases - Trump said.

He also said that Putin had suggested he may participate in talks with Iran to try to get a nuclear deal done. Trump said: “I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement.”

Here's the full post:

I just finished speaking, by telephone, with President Vladimir Putin, of Russia. The call lasted approximately one hour and 15 minutes. We discussed the attack on Russia's docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides. It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields. We also discussed Iran, and the fact that time is running out on Iran's decision pertaining to nuclear weapons, which must be made quickly! I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement. President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion. It is my opinion that Iran has been slowwalking their decision on this very important matter, and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!

The drone attacks carried out by Ukraine in Operation Spiderweb destroyed billions of dollars worth of Russian aircraft stationed at bases across the country, including at locations as far away as Siberia, in what Kyiv claims is its longest-range assault of the war.

The spectacular operation was prepared in secret over 18 months. Ukraine's agents moved short-range drones and explosives inside Russia before they were launched remotely for a coordinated strike on Sunday that was intended to strike at Moscow's air superiority.

Drones were smuggled into Russia and placed inside containers, which were later loaded on to trucks. With the trucks positioned near Russian bases, the roof panels of the containers were lifted off by a remotely activated mechanism, allowing the drones to fly out and begin their attack. The drones had first-person view, or FPV, technology that allowed them to be operated remotely, probably from Ukrainian territory.

Attempting to launch drones from Ukraine would have been much harder, as they would have had to cover huge distances and avoid Russia's air defences.

The White House confirmed yesterday that Donald Trump had no advance knowledge of the attack. He also hadn't commented on it publicly until this afternoon's call with Vladimir Putin.

Here's a visual guide to the operation from my colleagues:

Germany's new conservative leader, Friedrich Merz, is due in Washington tomorrow for his first official meeting with Donald Trump, putting political Berlin on tenterhooks like no other transatlantic encounter in living memory.

Discussions between the German chancellor and the US president will focus on Ukraine, the Middle East and trade policies. How well or badly the talks go – during a small group meeting, followed by a lunch and then, perhaps most nail-bitingly, a press conference in the Oval Office – may shape relations for decades to come, analysts say.

Having reportedly spoken by phone four times since Merz's election win in February, swapped numbers and exchanged an undisclosed number of text messages, the two leaders are now on first-name terms.

But Merz knows the road to a normal friendship is thorny. The transatlantic relationship has been altered almost beyond recognition since Trump's return to office, and the shock “sits very deep”, said Mariam Lau, a journalist and the author of a new in-depth portrayal of Merz. She went on:

It's the equivalent of a medical emergency in political terms: the speed and degree to which the Merz government has had to react to the disintegration of the transatlantic alliance, one of its main foreign policy pillars, is like being forced to undergo dialysis or an organ transplantation.

Berlin has viewed as menacing and dangerous the unprecedented interference in German politics by leading members of the Trump administration – by his former adviser Elon Musk; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and the vice-president, JD Vance, in particular. There is the lack of unity over how and even whether to punish Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine, there are tensions over defence spending levels, and there are diverging viewpoints over the Middle East, and over Trump's looming tariffs.

Indeed nobody in Berlin is resting on their laurels. As to just how quickly leaders' inaugural visits to the Oval Office can curdle, one only needs to recall Volodymyr Zelenskyy's lions' den encounter three months ago, or more recently the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa's. It has not gone unnoticed that Merz called the latter last Friday, reportedly to pick up a few Trump-whisperer tips.

Lau said Merz would have to “walk a tightrope between keeping an open dialogue with Trump and standing up to him, not giving into his whims”. And Merz is said to have been coached on an array of eventualities and is armed, rhetorically at least. Merz knows that keeping things brief, not interrupting, heaping praise and stressing the commonalities is the accepted playbook when dealing with Trump.

Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has told a Senate hearing that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is “fully staffed” with weather forecasters and scientists after concerns were raised about some offices losing 24-hour staffing ahead of hurricane season.

“We are fully staffed with forecasters and scientists. Under no circumstances am I going to let public safety or public forecasting be touched,” Lutnick told a Senate appropriations subcommittee overseeing NOAA, saying he got the National Weather Service (NWS) exempted from a federal hiring freeze.

NOAA, which includes the NWS, lost around 1,000 people or 10% of its workforce amid federal job layoffs in the first months of the second Trump administration, including 600 at the weather service. At least six NWS offices had stopped the routine twice-a-day weather balloon launches that collect data for weather models.

The US hurricane season officially began on Sunday and lasts through November. NOAA forecast last week that this year's season is expected to bring as many as 10 hurricanes.

The agency had been scrambling to reassign staffers internally to fill gaps in understaffed offices over the last few months, sources told Reuters.

Lutnick told the committee that they are going to fill these positions and focus on cutting programs that he said were not part of NOAA's mission, including “children's books about climate anxiety”.

An internal memo seen by Reuters said that NOAA plans to hire 126 mission-critical positions at the National Weather Service including forecasters, radar technicians, hydrologists and physical scientists that will be advertised externally.

US economic output will fall as a result of Donald Trump's new tariffs on foreign goods that were in place as of 13 May, while also reducing federal budget deficits by $2.8tn over a decade, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has said.

Reuters reports that in a letter to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and two other high-ranking Democrats, the CBO said the tariffs, which have been challenged in court cases, will raise the costs of consumer and capital goods.

“CBO estimates that, on net, real (inflation-adjusted) economic output in the United States will fall as a result,” the agency said.

“Inflation will increase by an annual average of 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026, in CBO's estimation, reducing the purchasing power of households and businesses,” the letter to Schumer and senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley stated.

Wyden is the senior Democrat on the Senate finance committee and Merkley is the ranking Democrat on the Senate budget committee. The three senators requested the CBO analysis on the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs implemented between 6 January and 13 May through executive actions.

The CBO's inflation estimates were compared to an economic outlook published by the CBO on 17 January.

The analysis was completed before two courts ruled that the tariffs exceeded the president's authority to impose them. The administration has asked an appeals court to pause one of the rulings.

Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, said he tried to call Elon Musk on Tuesday night after the tech billionaire's online outburst denouncing Donald Trump's tax and spending bill as a “disgusting abomination”.

Johnson told reporters on Wednesday:

I called Elon last night and he didn't answer. I hope to talk to him today.

He said he and Musk are “very friendly”, adding:

We've laughed about our differences on policy before. I'm not upset about this.

The Trump administration formally asked Congress to rescind $9.4bn in already approved funding from foreign aid and public broadcasters including NPR and PBS on Tuesday, seeking to enshrine spending cuts identified by Elon Musk's “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

The process, known as rescission, is required by Donald Trump to retrieve money from programs and policies that have already received the funding.

A spokesperson for the White House office of management and budget told the Associated Press that $8.3bn was being cut from the state department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID). NPR and PBS will also lose about $1.1bn in federal funding if Congress fulfills Trump's request.

The targeting of public broadcasters fits with the Trump administration's ongoing war on the US media. Trump signed an executive order in May cutting federal funding to NPR and PBS, and has launched multiple lawsuits against other news organizations.

The House and the Senate will now weigh whether to rescind the funding. On Tuesday Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, pledged to pass the cuts.

Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he met with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Washington DC.

In a series of posts on social media, Yermak said he and Rubio discussed the “situation on the front lines and the urgent need to strengthen support for Ukraine's air defense.”

The pair also “exchanged views on the meetings with the Russians in Istanbul, the further course of negotiations, the upcoming prisoner exchange, and the importance of bringing back all hostages and children abducted by Russia,” he said, adding:

I emphasized that Ukraine has done everything possible to achieve peace and is ready for a ceasefire — but Russia refuses. That is why additional sanctions are necessary.

He and Rubio “agreed to coordinate our next steps,” Yermak said.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has also projected an increase of 10.9m people without health insurance under Donald Trump's big tax and spending cut bill.

That would include 1.4m people who are in the country without legal status in state-funding programs, Associated Press reports.

As we reported earlier, the House-passed version of the bill could add $2.4tn to the federal government's $36.2tn debt, according to the CBO's revised estimate on Wednesday.

The new CBO estimate takes into account late changes that were made to the bill as Republican leaders steered it to passage.

Mexico will announce measures next week if there is no agreement reached with the United States on the steel and aluminum tariffs announced, president Claudia Sheinbaum has said.

She also called the US announcement to raise the metals' tariffs an “unfair measure” during her morning conference, and added that Mexico's answer will not be “an eye for an eye”.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has released a revised estimate of the cost of Donald Trump's tax and spending cut bill passed by the House of Representatives, concluding it will add $2.4tn to the federal government's $36.2tn debt.

The new assessment comes a day after Elon Musk blasted the bill as a “disgusting abomination”, emboldening GOP deficit hawks who have been pushing back against the measure.

An earlier CBO estimate predicted the bill, which passed through the House on 22 May by a single vote and with no Democratic support, would add around $3.8tn to Washington's debt over the next decade.

The measure, now under consideration in the Senate, aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts while also achieving steep spending reductions to pay for them, largely – and highly controversially – on Medicaid.

The new CBO estimate takes into account late changes that were made to the bill as Republican leaders steered it to passage.

The United States and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to start negotiations for a potential bilateral trade agreement that could ease tariffs on the Gulf state's steel and aluminum industry, four people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.

Emirati officials discussed the possibility of a trade agreement with US counterparts during Donald Trump's two-day visit to Abu Dhabi last month, the sources said.

The Office of the US Trade Representative did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Neither did Emirati officials.

Like other nations, the UAE has been hit by Trump's 10% baseline tariff on its exports to the US. But its steel and aluminum products have also been hit by a 25% tariff that the Trump administration is now doubling to 50%.

While the UAE is a major oil producer, its steel and aluminium products are significant non-oil exports. In 2024, the UAE was the second-largest steel and aluminium exporter to the US, accounting for 8% of total US consumption, data shows.

In Abu Dhabi, Emirati officials highlighted to American counterparts comprehensive trade deals that it had signed with other countries over the past three years, the sources said, to illustrate that the UAE was capable of moving quickly on trade talks.

The sources said that US officials had responded positively, although it was unclear when talks would start. Two of the sources said Washington was likely to negotiate a limited deal that would fall short of a comprehensive free trade pact.

The UAE is Washington's biggest trade partner in the Middle East, according to the Gulf state's foreign ministry. Bilateral trade in 2024 was valued at $34.4bn, according to US trade data, with the US enjoying a $19.4bn surplus.

The Gulf state, which is reliant on the US security umbrella, has pledged to invest $1.4tn in the US over the next decade. Its sovereign wealth funds, including Abu Dhabi's $330bn Mubadala, are already big US investors, and Trump and his family have business interests in the UAE.

Republican allies close to the White House are privately arguing that Elon Musk's bombshell attacks on the spending megabill stem from the fact that it harms the tech billionaire's business interests, according to Politico.

“The West Wing is perplexed, unenthused, and disappointed” with Musk, who left the White House to attend to his ailing business empire, one White House official told the news outlet, which reports that a push is now underway among Republicans close to the White House to reframe Musk's criticisms of the “big, beautiful bill” as self-serving.

“When businessmen criticize legislation, journalists don't take them at their word, they look at how the legislation would impact their business interests,” said one Republican close to the White House. “They should be doing that in this case.”

Indeed Tesla benefitted from the Biden-era EV support package which included multiple federal tax credits, which the “big, beautiful bill” strips away, as was noted by House speaker Mike Johnson yesterday. He told reporters:

It's not personal. I know that the EV mandate [is] very important to [Musk] — that's going away, because the government should not be subsidizing these things as part of the Green New Deal … And I know that has an effect on his business, and I lament that.

Today is the White House's deadline for countries to submit their “best offers” in trade negotiations with the US in order to avoid being slapped with steep tariffs in July.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed yesterday that the Trump administration had sent letters to trading partners to push for offers by today as the deadline approached, underlining Trump's use of tariffs as a negotiating tool.

“This letter was simply to remind these countries that the deadline is approaching and the president expects good deals, and we are on track for that,” she told reporters.

Reuters first reported on the office of the US trade representative's letter seeking to accelerate unwieldy talks with multiple partners ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline in under five weeks.

Those negotiations kicked off on 9 April when he paused his so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs for 90 days until 8 July amid stock, bond and currency markets turmoil over the sweeping levies.

While over the last few months Trump and his administration officials have boasted about the number of countries reaching out to discuss trading arrangements and have even claimed that several agreements are close to being over the line, they have also admitted that talks have been slow-moving and they don't have the capacity to negotiate (hugely complex) trade deals with so many countries at once.

The US has so far only reached a framework agreement with the UK, and an agreement with China that both countries are now accusing each other of reneging on.

Trump administration officials delayed and redacted a government forecast because it predicts an increase in the nation's trade deficit in farm goods later this year, two people familiar with the matter have told Politico, in a story that could raise questions about potential political interference in government reports that present “politically inconvenient” data.

Here's an extract from Politico's story:

The numbers run counter to Donald Trump's messaging that his economic policies, including tariffs, will reduce US trade imbalances. The politically inconvenient data prompted administration officials to block publication of the written analysis normally attached to the report because they disliked what it said about the deficit.

The highly unusual rollout could raise questions about potential political meddling with government reports that have traditionally been trusted for decades.

“Objectivity is really key here and the public depends on it,” said Joe Glauber, a former USDA chief economist. “To lose that trust would be terrible.”

A USDA spokesperson blamed the delay on an internal review.

“The report was hung up in internal clearance process and was not finalized in time for its typical deadline,” said USDA spokesperson Alec Varsamis in a statement. “Given this report is not statutory as with many other reports USDA does, the Department is undergoing a review of all of its non-statutory reports, including this one, to determine next steps.”

It's not clear when or if the written analysis portion will be released.

Donald Trump has – once again – called on Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, to lower interest rates, noting that payroll processing firm ADP reported that job creation slowed in May.

In the post on his Truth Social platform, he said that Powell – who in the past he has called a “major loser” – is “unbelievable”.

ADP NUMBER OUT!!! “Too Late” Powell must now LOWER THE RATE. He is unbelievable!!! Europe has lowered NINE TIMES!

ADP's report showed private payrolls ticked up by only 37,000 in May - far below the Dow Jones forecast for 110,000 - and mark the lowest monthly reading from ADP since March 2023.

At a meeting with Trump at the White House last week, Powell had pushed back against the president's demands, telling him “that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook,” according to an unusually blunt statement issued by the central bank.

Trump, who has attacked Powell repeatedly over the Fed's decision to not lower interest rates, recently said he has no intention of trying to fire Powell. But the possibility of a firing has unsettled financial markets that bank on an independent Fed's ability to do its job without political interference.

Earlier this month, Powell kept interest rates on hold and cautioned that the president's tariff regime was likely to raise prices, weaken growth and increase unemployment in the US if maintained.

The statement went on to say that Powell maintained that the Fed “will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis”.

The full statement read:

At the President's invitation, Chair Powell met with the President today at the White House to discuss economic developments including for growth, employment, and inflation.

Chair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook.

Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the FOMC will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

They warned it could happen: a world of surging nationalism, stalling economic development and the unraveling of decades of international cooperation on climate change and other global challenges.

Long before Donald Trump lurched away from diplomatic norms and the international rules-based order, scientists mapped out different potential futures to understand the possible implications for greenhouse gas emissions. Developed a decade ago, five of these “pathways” became crucial to the work of the UN's IPCC climate expert panel. These are not predictions for the 21st century.

Rather, they envision what could happen with various societal changes including for trade, economic development, technological innovation and global population. The most optimistic narrative foresees sustainable growth and improved equality.

A second “middle-of-the-road” scenario is an extension of current trends. 

The third is a world riven by rivalries, a fourth is blighted by increasing inequality, and the fifth assumes supercharged economic growth grounded in expanding fossil fuel use. Keywan Riahi, of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, who coordinated the development of the so-called Shared Socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), said the world has largely developed in line with the third scenario in recent years. 

While it is certainly not a perfect fit, what we see now “is a much more fragmented world,” Riahi said. “Collaboration is more difficult, economic development is actually also not so optimistic.”

‘ROCKY ROAD' 

Scientists' original description of the SSP3 scenario was: “A resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues.”

This “rocky road” is arguably the worst of all the hypothetical futures. Planet-heating emissions are second only to economic expansion driven by oil, gas and coal. But the fractured SSP3 world ranks first when it comes to damages from climate change, showing the largest population boom, and the weakest economic growth.

This scenario “reflects a current strain of populist isolationist politics that is ascendant today,” climate scientist Zeke Hausfather noted in a recent newsletter post. In 2021, Hausfather got blowback for calling SSP3 “Trump World.” But “the actions in his second term around energy and trade seem to be playing out much more closely to SSP3 than other pathways,” he said.

The US has ditched the Paris climate treaty, turned its back on global cooperation on science, trade and health and eviscerated its international development budget.

Washington has lambasted UN sustainable development goals, especially related to climate change and women's rights. Domestically, the world's second biggest carbon polluter has undermined progress on low-carbon technology, canceled climate research and even stymied weather data collection. World leaders have expressed their disquiet. 

“The global economy thrived on a foundation of openness and multilateralism underpinned by US leadership... but today it is fracturing,” said European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde in late May. Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney declared the global trade system in place for 80 years “over,” and China's Xi Jinping (習近平) urged the preservation of “the international order based on international law, and global fairness and justice.”

NOT DESTINY

There are important ways in which today's reality differs from the hypothetical SSP3 world. World population projections are significantly lower, for instance. And the development of climate tech has been “much more successful,” Riahi said. A dramatic drop in the cost of solar and wind power, as well as electric vehicles and batteries, has boosted the growth of low-carbon technologies.

Carbon dioxide emissions have also slowed, while predicted warming for the end of the century is lower than a decade ago — albeit still reaching catastrophic levels. Scientists are currently updating SSP projections and crafting a new set of climate narratives.

They have much to unpack. Riahi said that even if there was a “complete collapse of climate policies globally,” the previous worst-case emissions projections will likely not materialist because clean energy has become so cheap. 

At the same time, he said, the world will almost certainly overshoot the Paris deal's aspirational goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in the coming years. This has forced scientists to consider a new set of questions. What is the new best-case scenario for bending emissions down to zero? If current policies persist, will emissions stay high for a longer period, causing temperatures to keep rising in the coming decades? 

“What are the implications climatically of this high overshoot, which is unfortunately a more and more likely scenario if you extrapolate what we see at the moment?” said Riahi.

After all, it is not difficult to explain the rise in Taiwanese identity after the early 1990s. But no model predicted its decline during the 2016-2018 period, they say. 
After testing various alternative explanations, Wang et al argue that the fall-off in Taiwanese identity during that period is related to voter hedging based on the performance of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Since the DPP is perceived as the guardian of Taiwan identity, when it performs well,

After being damaged by harbor restoration projects, heavy rainfall and typhoons since 2020, the famous “Clown Island” diving site off Green Island (綠島) is gradually recovering, the East Coast National Scenic Area Headquarters said today.

The ecosystem's recovery provides valuable insight for marine conservation, sustainable tourism and environmental education, the headquarters said.

The site is named for the clownfish and three-spot dascyllus that converge there, as it is covered by sea anemones.

The headquarters has promoted marine ecological surveys and dive site documentation since 2016, it said, adding that this year the results from Green Island brought encouraging news.

According to a survey conducted by the Taiwanese Coral Reef Society, the ecological environment of Clown Island is gradually recovering and showing signs of vibrant marine life, it said.

In addition to nearby construction projects and extreme weather depositing large amounts of sediment in the area, rising sea temperatures caused coral bleaching and killed many sea anemones, causing fish populations to nearly disappear, the headquarters said.

Over the past four years, a research team has documented the area's damage and gradual recovery, with the latest surveys showing that local populations are gradually stabilizing.

Sea anemones appear to be growing healthily and the populations of indicator species including clownfish and three-spot dascyllus are slowly increasing, the surveys found.

The surveys include a collection of valuable underwater footage that show nature's resilience, the headquarters said.  

This data are a valuable reference for public infrastructure and environmental management policies across various sectors, it said.

The headquarters said it would continue collaborating with academic institutions and local teams to protect dive site ecology through regular surveys.

It would also introduce low-impact, eco-friendly practices to promote the coexistence of tourism and conservation, moving toward sustainable marine tourism, it added.

The annual index, which was published last month, evaluated 1,000 of the most populated metropolises based on five indices — economics, human capital, quality of life, environment and governance.
New York maintained its top spot this year, placing first in the economics index thanks to the strength of its vibrant financial industry and economic stability.
Taipei ranked 263rd in economics, 44th in human capital, 15th in quality of life, 284th for environment and 75th in governance,

The sports agency said in a statement that the  Chinese Taipei Table Tennis Association (CTTTA) must  explain to the public why it withdrew Yeh from the WTT  tournament in Las Vegas.
The sports agency said it contacted the  association to express its disapproval of the decision-making  process after receiving a complaint from Yeh's coach,  Chuang

His resignation was immediately accepted by the Control Yuan.

In a statement explaining why he had resigned, Lee apologized for using a Control Yuan vehicle to transport his dog to a pet grooming salon on May 20.

The issue first came to light late last month, when TVBS News reported that Lee had instructed his driver to take the dog to the salon.

SEOUL — South Korea's new President Lee Jae-myung has positioned Japan as an important, cooperative partner and also called for enhanced trilateral relations between the two countries and the United States.

It is believed that Lee has attempted to provide a sense of security both domestically and internationally by showing that he would not turn away from former President Yoon Suk Yeol's decision to work toward improving Japan-South Korea relations.

Lee pledged during his campaign that he would engage in pragmatic diplomacy. Regarding relations with Japan, he also claimed that he would deal with social, cultural and economic issues in a future-oriented manner. Through positioning Japan as an important partner, Lee said he would lay a foundation for a consistent and stable bilateral relationship.

Wi Sung-lac, Lee's diplomatic brain and a member of the National Assembly, said at a press conference on May 28 that Lee would, within a broad framework, maintain Yoon's policies, including his solution to the issue of lawsuits regarding former wartime requisitioned workers from the Korean Peninsula.

In the past, Lee made a series of harsh comments about Japan and criticized Yoon's efforts to improve the South Korea-Japan relationship, calling it “humiliating diplomacy toward Japan.”

During the election campaign, Lee's remarks toward Japan became more conciliatory, as momentum has grown for a cooperative response to issues such as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policy and the deteriorating security environment in Northeast Asia.

Lee has pledged that he would “deal with issues related to history and territory in a principled manner.” However, should there be a dispute with Japan, some have voiced concerns over his ability to handle the situation in a cool-headed manner.

Among Lee's campaign pledges was a policy to strengthen cooperation among Japan, South Korea and the United States, which stressed that a strong alliance with the United States is the foundation of diplomacy. The pledges also indicated that the diversification of diplomatic relations would also be sought, saying the relationship with China, which “reached its lowest level under the previous administration, would be managed in a stable manner.”

Concerning the North Korean nuclear issue, Lee claimed that he would establish a framework of cooperating with the United States and the international community in order to make substantial progress on a solution. He said he would aim to relieve tension with North Korea by reopening hotlines and other communication channels. He added that he would be involved in efforts to improve the human rights situation in North Korea.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) carried out the third attack against the Crimean Bridge since Russia's full-scale war began in 2022, mining and damaging its underwater supports, the SBU announced on June 3.

""God loves the Trinity, and the SBU always brings what is conceived to the end and never repeats itself,"" SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk said in a statement posted on social media.

""Previously, we struck the Crimean Bridge in 2022 and 2023. So today we continued this tradition underwater,"" he added. 

The SBU said the operation ""lasted for several months,"" with agents mining the ""supports of this illegal construction.""

Constructed after Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Crimean Bridge is a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to the occupied Ukrainian territories.

""And today, without inflicting any civilian casualties, the first explosive was activated at 4:44 a.m.,"" the SBU said.

Underwater supports of the bridge's piers were severely damaged at the bottom as 1,100 kilograms of explosives in TNT equivalent were detonated, according to the statement.

Russian state media later reported a ""Ukrainian intelligence agent"" who had constructed a bomb on ""orders from Kyiv"" had been detained by Russia's FSB.

In comments later on June 3, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, said the ""key and most complex"" part of the bridge had been damaged in the attack.

The operation, which follows the SBU's mass drone strike against Russia's strategic aviation on June 1, was personally supervised by the agency's chief, Vasyl Maliuk.

President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the SBU in his evening address, though he did not refer to the attack directly. 

""And it is always nice to give special thanks to the Security Service of Ukraine, well done!"" he said.

A claimed ""agent of Ukrainian intelligence services"" has been detained in Crimea, Russia's Federal Security Service said later on June 3, accusing the detainee of producing a ""powerful explosive.""  

The bridge suffered significant damage during two previous Ukrainian attacks in October 2022 and July 2023, though neither managed to take the bridge out of commission. 

The construction of the bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge, holds a significant symbolic value for Russia. The $4 billion project was a political statement designed to affirm the Kremlin's illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea, as the peninsula is not connected by land to Russia.   

Russia's Defense Ministry previously claimed that three Ukrainian drones were downed over Crimea overnight on June 3. 

The Crimean Bridge was closed for traffic between 6 and 9 a.m. local time on that day, according to local Telegram channels. The Mash Telegram channel reported that a Ukrainian drone was shot down over the bridge, and its debris fell onto the road.

According to pro-Ukrainian Telegram channel Crimean Wind, the bridge had been closed down for inspection, possibly to examine damage.

Later the same day, Crimean Wind reported a new ""powerful explosion"" near Kerch at around 3 p.m., writing that a helicopter is patrolling the strait. Several local channels reported that a fresh drone attack against the peninsula was underway in the afternoon, and that the bridge is closed once again.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

An explosion recently occurred at the Crimean Bridge, but caused ""no damage,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on June 4, accusing Ukraine of attempted attacks on Russia's infrastructure.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the explosion that rocked the bridge in the early hours of June 3. The agency said that more than a ton of explosives in TNT equivalent damaged the underwater supports of the structure.

""There indeed was an explosion. There was no damage, the bridge continues to function,"" Peskov said, according to the Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti. ""Kyiv continues in its attempts to attack infrastructure facilities.""

Constructed after Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Crimean Bridge — also known as the Kerch Bridge —  is a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to the occupied Ukrainian territories. It connects the occupied peninsula to Russia's Krasnodar Krai via the Kerch Strait.

The Russian state media reported on June 3 that a ""Ukrainian intelligence agent"" who had constructed a bomb on ""orders from Kyiv"" had been detained by Russia's FSB.

Alarm over China's stranglehold on critical minerals grew on Tuesday as global automakers joined their U.S. counterparts to complain that restrictions by China on exports of rare earth alloys, mixtures and magnets could cause production delays and outages without a quick solution.

German automakers became the latest to warn that China's export restrictions threaten to shut down production and rattle their local economies, following a similar complaint from an Indian EV maker last week.

China's decision in April to suspend exports of a wide range of rare earths and related magnets has upended the supply chains central to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world.

The move underscores China's dominance of the critical mineral industry and is seen as leverage by China in its ongoing trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Trump has sought to redefine the trading relationship with the U.S.' top economic rival China by imposing steep tariffs on billions of dollars of imported goods in hopes of narrowing a wide trade deficit and bringing back lost manufacturing.

Canada poised to fill some of rare earths void as China curbs U.S. exports in retaliation to Trump tariffs

Trump imposed tariffs as high as 145 per cent against China only to scale them back after stock, bond and currency markets revolted over the sweeping nature of the levies. China has responded with its own tariffs and is leveraging its dominance in key supply chains to persuade Trump to back down.

Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to talk this week, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday, and the export curbs are expected to be high on the agenda.

“I can assure you that the administration is actively monitoring China's compliance with the Geneva trade agreement,” she said. “Our administration officials continue to be engaged in correspondence with their Chinese counterparts.”

Trump has previously signaled that China's slow pace of easing the critical mineral export controls represents a violation of the agreement reached last month in Geneva.

Shipments of the magnets, essential for assembling everything from cars and drones to robots and missiles, have been halted at many Chinese ports while license applications make their way through the Chinese regulatory system.

The restrictions have triggered anxiety in corporate boardrooms and nations' capitals – from Tokyo to Washington – as officials scrambled to identify limited alternative options amid fears that production of new automobiles and other items could grind to a halt by summer's end.

“If the situation is not changed quickly, production delays and even production outages can no longer be ruled out,” Hildegard Mueller, head of Germany's auto lobby, told Reuters on Tuesday.

Chinese state media reported last week that China was considering relaxing the curbs for European semiconductor firms while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said it would strengthen cooperation with other countries over its controls.

However, rare-earth magnet exports from China halved in April as exporters grappled with the opaque licensing scheme.

How this Canadian startup is removing the need for rare earths in EV motors

Frank Fannon, a minerals industry consultant and former U.S. assistant secretary of state for energy resources during Trump's first term, said the global disruptions are not shocking to those paying attention.

“I don't think anyone should be surprised how this is playing out. We have a production challenge [in the U.S.] and we need to leverage our whole of government approach to secure resources and ramp up domestic capability as soon as possible. The time horizon to do this was yesterday,” Fannon said.

Diplomats, automakers and other executives from India, Japan and Europe were urgently seeking meetings with Beijing officials to push for faster approval of rare earth magnet exports, sources told Reuters, as shortages threatened to halt global supply chains.

A business delegation from Japan will visit Beijing in early June to meet the Ministry of Commerce over the curbs, and European diplomats from countries with big auto industries have also sought “emergency” meetings with Chinese officials in recent weeks, Reuters reported.

India, where Bajaj Auto warned that any further delays in securing the supply of rare earth magnets from China could “seriously impact” electric vehicle production, is organizing a trip for auto executives in the next two to three weeks.

In May, the head of the trade group representing General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen, Hyundai and other major automakers raised similar concerns in a letter to the Trump administration.

“Without reliable access to these elements and magnets, automotive suppliers will be unable to produce critical automotive components, including automatic transmissions, throttle bodies, alternators, various motors, sensors, seat belts, speakers, lights, motors, power steering, and cameras,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation wrote in the letter.

Algeria's Imane Khelif won the gold medal in boxing at the 2024 Summer Olympics, after being banned by the sport's then-international-federation.John Locher/The Associated Press

Once he was on the verge of quitting as boss of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach felt freed to begin dropping bombs. 

One of the big ones involved the gender-identity set-to at the Paris Olympics involving Algerian boxer Imane Khelif. 

Khelif had been banned by boxing's then-international-federation, the IBA, after failing a test they would not identify. All the IBA, a Russian-led organization at war with the IOC, would say was that Khelif had “competitive advantages over other female competitors.” The implication was that Khelif was not a biological woman. 

The IOC waved this off during the Games. A million online skirmishes were engaged, most famously by author J.K. Rowling. Khelif won a gold medal. Everybody left angry, including Khelif, who promised to sue her most famous antagonists, including Rowling. No suit has yet materialized. 

Bach came back at it months later, imbued with the confidence of waning authority: “I would not consider this a real crisis because all of this discussion is based on a fake news campaign coming from Russia.”

IOC president backs two female boxers amid gender controversy, condemning ‘unacceptable' attacks

I get that we've entered our anything-goes era, but that is a bold claim. It probably ought not be made by a serious official at a serious organization without some basis in provable fact. However, saying it was as far as Bach was bothered to go. The IOC clearly thought it had won this round. 

This week, that approach blew up in its hands. 

U.S.-based journalist Alan Abrahamson has published what he contends is the report from a March, 2023, test that got Khelif banned by the IBA. It states, in part: “Chromosome analysis reveals Male karyotype.”

Abrahamson reported during the last Olympics that the IOC had been given the full picture of the situation, but chose to ignore it.

Worse, boxing's new bosses seem as amenable to IOC control than the last bunch, which is to say, not very.

The IOC got rid of the IBA by threatening to remove boxing from the competition slate at Los Angeles 2028. In its stead, a shinier, happier boxing body emerged - World Boxing. Its mandate was to clean up the sport and make it as beyond reproach as, say, ice dancing. Baby steps and all. 

In one of its first acts, World Boxing announced it will expand boxing's sex-testing regime. Khelif cannot compete again until she undergoes what World Boxing calls “genetic screening.”

So you've got two armies of the culture wars lined up. On one side, progressives whose main argument devolves to, “But it was OK by the Olympics.” On the other, activists whose battle cry is “Stop the Olympic cover-up.” 

Either way, it's the Olympics' problem now. What a wonderful welcoming gift for Bach's successor, Zimbabwe's Kirsty Coventry. 

IOC's new chief Kirsty Coventry has controversial record as Zimbabwe's sports minister

During the Paris Games, the IOC repeatedly fell back on the letter of their law – that the gender listed on a person's passport determines which category they compete in. All of the competitors in women's boxing were listed “female” on their official I.D. No one in authority would expand beyond that conversation ender. 

In the absence of other, better information, that seemed like enough. It doesn't any more. 

No sporting organization in the world has gone on louder or longer about the centrality of women's sport to its mission. So it verges on satirical that the IOC continues to duck and dodge a basic question: “For competition purposes, how do you define these women that you're always talking about?”

Holding up a rulebook, pointing at a line in it and then making an exasperated face is not an argument. 

If the IOC thinks the definition of female competitor should be left to participating states and never questioned beyond that, then it should say that out loud. Then it should defend its policy, rather than shunting the issue onto others. 

If the IOC doesn't think that, then a full reckoning of what they knew and when vis-à-vis Khelif is owed. This isn't a private business. It's a public concern. They've never been shy about drug testing and the many places it goes wrong. Why is this any different?

Instead, the IOC will try to let time do its heavy lifting. There are more than three years until the next Summer Games. Khelif cannot compete internationally until she undergoes screening. 

Undoubtedly, the IOC's preferred option is that she refuses testing. That way the outcome is never known for a certainty. That makes it less likely that a campaign to strip Khelif of her 2024 gold medal ever catches traction – though it would be the right thing to do should Khelif fail the screening. It would also mean that Khelif has functionally retired from sport.

If Khelif takes the screening and passes, the IOC is not vindicated, but it's off the hook. If she takes it and fails, then all hell breaks loose. 

The people on the edges of the Olympic movement are in constant search of their next cause. They've had their pick in recent years, but most of those have lost their zing. Russia is old news; war has become commonplace; nobody gives a damn about drugs; and the political right is ascendant. 

Nobody wants to complain if that's all it is - complaining. They want some possibility of action. 

All the external actors have figured out the ultimate ju-jitsu move when Olympic athletes start moaning - ignore them. What are they going to do if the war in wherever doesn't stop today? Refuse to get into the starting gate? Yeah, nobody cares that much. 

That leaves Olympians with only one target - the Olympics. It's the last organization left that has to listen to them. 

Now all they need is a wedge in. Here's predicting that by L.A. 2028, the slow, uncontrolled fire that the IOC started with its hands-off handling of the Khelif situation in Paris has become a women's rights conflagration.

Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem takes part in a news conference after announcing an interest rate decision in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada March 6, 2024. REUTERS/Blair GableBlair Gable/Reuters

Jeremy Kronick is vice-president and director of the Centre on Financial and Monetary Policy at the C.D. Howe Institute, where Steve Ambler, a professor of economics at Université du Québec à Montréal, is the David Dodge Chair in Monetary Policy.

The Bank of Canada left its policy interest rate at 2.75 per cent on Wednesday, confirming market expectations. Data showing stubbornly high underlying inflation and robust-looking first-quarter gross domestic product had led markets to price in only about a 20-per-cent probability of this cut. 

While we understand the bank's thinking, we believe they should have cut. 

In April, we argued that the high degree of economic uncertainty and some concerning core inflation measures made a good case to pause. So, if uncertainty remains as high as it does, and we saw stronger-than-expected GDP numbers last Friday alongside rising core inflation – Consumer Price Index-trim to 3.1 per cent and CPI-median to 3.2 per cent – why a cut this time? 

Three reasons: increasing unemployment, sagging housing markets, and weakness behind the strong-looking data. This flagging on the demand side will outweigh potential inflationary pressure from the impact of tariffs and trade wars on the economy's supply side. This weakness means the Bank of Canada will have to cut its policy rate sooner or later. Doing it now may help prevent the economy from sliding into recession, something which is looking increasingly likely.

Bank of Canada: The latest news, analysis and reaction on the rate decision

We aren't the only ones worried about a downturn. The economics departments of the major Canadian banks are seeing the same thing. Four of the six major Canadian chartered banks are predicting at least one quarter of falling GDP this year, and three of them are predicting two quarters of it. 

The stronger-than-predicted GDP growth in the first quarter of the year (2.2 per cent annualized) masks some underlying weaknesses. The key driver of growth was exports, much of it caused by U.S. importers front-running tariffs. Consumer spending barely grew in the first quarter, and (already very weak) gross fixed capital formation fell.

As for housing, expectations were that as the bank cut the overnight rate off its 5-per-cent peak, the housing market would start to take off – an argument for the bank to cut only slowly. However, the housing market has slumped amid tariffs and economic uncertainty. In March, Canadian home sales were the lowest they've been in that month since 2009, during the slump following the Great Financial Crisis. Sales-to-new listings haven't been this low since February 2009.

The strongest negative signals are coming from the labour market. 

After a fall of more than 30,000 in March, employment was stagnant in April, despite the hiring of temporary workers for the federal election. Moreover, employment among core-aged (25 to 54 years old) individuals fell by 36,000 in April. Core-age employees are traditionally those who are the most strongly attached to the labour force, and a fall in employment in this group is typically a sign of layoffs. The unemployment rate increased again in April and now stands at 6.9 per cent.

Cutting the policy interest rate when core inflation measures (which strip out the most volatile components of the consumer price index) are moving up would have been a communication problem for the bank. But we think it would have been appropriate. 

The bank pays attention to core inflation as an indicator of where inflation may be headed in the medium term. The headline inflation drop to 1.7 per cent wouldn't be much help in this regard as it is almost entirely due to the elimination (at least in practice) of the consumer carbon tax. The key would have been to convince the public that any increase in headline inflation that arises from the current spike in core measures is temporary, and economic weakness will bring price growth down in the medium term. Falling employment among core-age individuals is an especially important part of that messaging. We'd also add that one major difference between the situation now and in 2021 when inflation started to take off is that the growth in broad monetary aggregates, which is strongly linked to inflationary pressures further down the road, is much weaker.

After GDP in the first quarter of 2025 came in stronger than anticipated, and core inflation measures jumped above 3 per cent, it was understandable that the bank would hold off lowering its policy rate. But in our view, the signs of economic weakness were too strong to ignore. With uncertainty likely to remain elevated, these signs will likely continue. And with them will come more cuts.

The German chancellor will be meeting President Trump in Washington with Ukraine and tariffs on the agenda. Meanwhile, a massive evacuation effort is taking place in Cologne as three WWII bombs are defused. DW has more.

Read about developments and news from Germany on Wednesday, June 4, 2025:

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul says Chancellor Friedrich Merz will use his upcoming visit to Washington to tell US President Donald Trump that Europe stands firmly with Ukraine in opposing Russia's invasion  — and that no opportunity for peace should be missed.

""Europe expects us — the United States and Europe — to bring Russia to the negotiating table,"" Wadephul said during a news conference alongside his Polish counterpart.

""This opportunity for peace must not be missed. And this war must finally be brought to a just end.""

In response to Germany's decision to deny a Russian state media journalist a residency permit renewal, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova announced that Russia will take retaliatory measures against German journalists currently in the country.

Zakharova added that Moscow has repeatedly warned Berlin of retaliatory measures.

""In this case, we will quickly develop and implement retaliatory measures. Therefore, there is no need for Berlin to pretend that they were unaware of this,"" she concluded.

In November, Russia expelled two German reporters in a tit-for-tat move after Berlin informed two employees at Russian state broadcaster Channel One that they would have to leave Germany.

The German government is looking at a simpler process when it comes to declaring countries of origin as safe, under a push by the new conservative-led coalition to reduce the number of asylum seekers.

Chancellor Merz's Cabinet approved a draft policy in which a country can be declared safe with a simple statutory order and where the consent of the Bundesrat (Germany's upper house of parliament) is no longer needed.

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the move was part of a whole package of ""national measures (...) to implement the asylum turnaround.""

Under German asylum law, ""safe countries of origin"" are seen as those where people are not subject to political persecution or inhuman punishment. 

Migrants seeking asylum from these countries are likely to have asylum applications rejected, apart from exceptional cases. 

Deportations back to safe countries will also face fewer legal obstacles. Opposition lawmakers from the Green party have criticized the draft as contrary to German law, as have asylum and immigration NGOs.

The reform still needs to be approved by the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.

The announcement comes just days after a court declared the government's tightened border security, including the turning back of asylum seekers, to be illegal under German law.

German mechanical engineering firms reported a drop in orders in April. This decrease came amid concerns over US tariff policies.

According to trade group Association of German Mechanical and Plant Engineering (VDMA), orders declined by 6% year-on-year in April, though they were 1% higher in the first four months of 2025 than in the same period the previous year.

Domestic orders in April were 4% below last year's level, while foreign orders dropped 7%, exacerbated by a 13% decline in non-euro countries, the trade group said in a statement.

""In view of the many tariff threats and announcements by US President Donald Trump and the great uncertainty this has caused, this was an expected setback,"" said VDMA chief economist Johannes Gernandt.

""Global uncertainty remains high. This makes it all the more important that we set the right course ourselves in Germany and Europe,"" he added.

The Federal Association of Research and Information Centres on Anti-Semitism (RIAS) said there had been a 77% increase in antisemitic incidents across Germany last year.

In its latest report, RIAS said 8,627 such cases had been documented when compared to the 4886 incidents recorded in 2023.

The consequences of the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led terror attacks and the subsequent war were found to have had ""a decisive influence on the number of antisemitic incidents,"" RIAS said.

""With 5857 cases, Israel-related antisemitism was the most common manifestation of antisemitism in 2024,"" RIAS said in a summary of its findings.

The organization said it documented 8 incidents of extreme violence, 186 assaults, 443 cases of targeted property damage, 300 threats, 176 mass mailings and 7514 instances of abusive behaviour.

Among the eight cases of extreme violence highlighted was the attack in Solingen in which three people were killed and eight others injured. The so-called Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility and RIAS said in a video the group released, the attacker referred to the war between Israel and Hamas.

""Among other things, the attack was stated to be an act of revenge for the Palestinian people who had suffered massacres with the support of “Zionists,”"" RIAS said.

With 544 incidents, Rias 2024 also recorded the highest number of antisemitic incidents with a right-wing extremist background since the nationwide comparison began in 2020.

The German Police Union (GdP) in Berlin is pushing for a countrywide ban on private fireworks around New Year's, news agency DPA reported, citing the branch chairman.

""The public is ready to rethink how we celebrate New Year's,"" said Stephan Weh, who pointed to results from an online survey in April which showed high levels of support for more stringent restrictions on fireworks.

The poll conducted by Berlin GdP showed that 97% of around 178,000 respondents backed banning of firewords for private use, while 93% supported a ban on sales.

The issue was brought into sharp focus at the beginning of this year when 5 people were killed in firework-related incidents and many more were injured.

A video also went viral showing a man shoot a firework into an apartment in Berlin's Neukölln district, sparking anger and debate about the conduct of revelers during this time.

Emergency services are frequently attacked and injured in incidents where fireworks are fired deliberately towards them.

Instead of private fireworks, 91% of respondent supported organized public firework displays, with nearly half saying they would attend such events. 
 

The US has doubled steel and aluminium tariff as President Donald Trump ramps up his sweeping import measures since returning to office.

The tariffs — which came into force at 0401 GMT — doubled from 25% to 50% of the goods' value as Trump seeks to rectify alleged trade imbalances while strengthening US industry.

""We need to come up with negotiated solutions as quickly as possible, because time is running out,"" German economy minister Katherina Reiche said Tuesday on the sidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) talks. 

The EU has said it ""strongly regrets"" Trump's measures, cautioning that it ""undermines ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated solution"" with the US.

The German Steel Industry Association says the US is the most important sales market for the European steel industry.

Germany's aluminium industry warned on Wednesday that the tariffs would harm all parties and called for urgent and constructive dialogue with the Trump administration.

The tariffs come amid a climate of increased pressure and uncertainty in the sector.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will leave for Washington on Wednesday night for his first visit to the US as leader of Europe's largest economy.

Merz will be holding talks with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday.

Talks are expected to center around ending the war in Ukraine and the Trump administration's tariffs, among other issues.

The one-on-one discussion will be followed by an Oval Office press conference, which is highly anticipated considering the manner in which both Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa were dealt with during their respective visits.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul called for the preservation of well-established US-German relations on Wednesday. He visited Washington last week where he held talks with US State Secretary Marco Rubio.

""They have made me confident that we can reach agreements in mutual interest even on issues where we have differences of opinion,"" German news agency DPA quoted Wadephul as saying at a meeting of former Arthur F. Burns Fellowship scholars in Berlin.

The discovery of World War II-era bombs in Cologne on Monday has led authorities to evacuate an estimated 20,000 people from their homes.

City authorities say its one of the largest evacuations in postwar history and affected areas including the entire old part of the city, 58 hotels, three Rhine bridges, the town hall, the railway station in the district of Deutz, which lies across the Rhine from the city center, museums, a hospital and two care homes.

Bomb disposal is a common occurrence in Cologne, which was one of the most heavily bombed German cities during World War II.

UNICEF and the World Food Programme have condemned an attack on an aid convoy in Sudan's restive Darfur region. The trucks were carrying much-needed food as two years of conflict has cut off supply. 

Five aid workers were killed in an attack on a convoy in Sudan, preventing food deliveries to families who face starvation in the war-torn Darfur region, UN agencies said on Tuesday.

The attack on the 15-truck convoy happened Monday night near the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)-controlled town of Koma in North Darfur province.

""Five members of the convoy were killed and several more people were injured. Multiple trucks were burned, and critical humanitarian supplies were damaged,"" UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP) said in a joint statement.

Both agencies called for an investigation into the attack, which they said was a violation of international humanitarian law.

""It is devastating that the supplies have not reached the vulnerable children and families they were intended to,"" the statement added. 

The agencies did not specify who was behind the attack. The UN said those killed and injured were Sudanese contractors working for WFP and UNICEF. 

The aid agencies said the convoy was attacked while trying to access el-Fasher city, which is one of the last strongholds of the Sudanese military in Darfur. Since 2024, el-Fasher has been under siege by RSF forces.

The trucks had traveled more than 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) from the eastern city of Port Sudan on the Red Sea. 

""This was the first UN humanitarian convoy that was going to make it to el-Fasher in over one year,"" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.

The RSF claimed in a statement the convoy was hit by a military aircraft in a ""pre-planned attack.""

However, Sudan's military-led government rejected this and said in a statement that aid trucks were ""treacherously attacked by assault drones operated by the rebel Rapid Support Forces militia.""

Neither of the reports could be independently verified. 

Since fighting between RSF paramilitary group and Sudan's military-controlled government began two years ago, Sudan has been engulfed by what the UN has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than a million people on the brink of starvation in the North Darfur state alone.

The fighting has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted 13 million people and created dire hunger and displacement crises. Four million people have fled across Sudan's borders, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday.

Aid distribution centers in Gaza will stay shut on Wednesday for reorganization, a day after dozens of Palestinians were killed near one such center. DW has more.

Follow below for the main developments on Israel and the crisis in the Middle East on Wednesday, June 4:

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was in Lebanon on Wednesday for talks with senior Lebansese leaders, including President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, and Foreign Minister Youssef Raggi.

Araghchi also met with the leader of Lebanese militant and political group Hezbollah Naim Kassem. 

Iran is the primary backer of Hezbollah, whose political and military power was severely weakened by an Israeli bombing campaign last year.

Ties between Lebanon and Iran have been shaky since Lebanon's new government took steps towards diminishing Hezbollah's political and military sway in Lebanon. 

For example, Lebanon's new government has vowed to implement a state monopoly on bearing arms amid international pressure. 

After the talks, Raggi posted on X that they centered on ""Lebanon's hope that Iran remains committed to supporting our country's security and internal stability,"" including efforts to ensure ""that arms are held solely by the state.""

""Araghchi affirmed his country's keenness to open a new page in bilateral relations with Lebanon, based on mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs,"" Salam's office said.

Hezbollah is considered to be a proxy force for Iran, and disarming the militant group is a sore spot in ties. 

Hezbollah's Kassem said in a statement he thanked Iran for its  ""ongoing support for the Lebanese people"" and Hezbollah.

In November, a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel ended more than a year of conflict and two months of all-out war.

The ceasefire called for Hezbollah to pull its forces away from Lebanon's border with Israel, north of the Litani River. Israel was to withdraw all of its forces from Lebanon, however, it continues to keep troops in several areas deemed critical for security.

A contract to buy 168 firing posts and 1,680 anti-tank missiles from Israeli defense company Rafael has been cancelled by Spain, national media reportered.

The daily newspaper El Pais, citing unnamed government sources, reported that the deal was valued at €287.5 million ($327 million). The equipment was to be manufactured in Spain under license from Rafael.

Sources from the Spanish Ministry of Defense told AFP news agency that the government has begun revoking licenses of Israeli origin and redirecting its procurement programs to achieve ""greater technological independence and autonomy.""

In late April, Spain canceled a contract to purchase bullets from another Israeli company, IMI Systems.

Spain strongly criticizes Israel's military operation in Gaza. Last year, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez officially recognized a Palestinian state, drawing criticism from Israel.

The United Torah Judaism (UTJ) alliance, an ultra-Orthodox Israeli party, announced that it is leaving the country's governing coalition, which could potentially jeopardize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hold on power.

Leading rabbis from the UTJ said the party would withdraw its support for the government amid a dispute over forcing highly religious Orthodox Jewish men to serve in the Israeli military.

The party represents the strict Haredi Jewish community and holds seven of the 120 seats in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. 

With 68 seats currently held by Netanyahu's right-wing, religious government, UTJ's withdrawal would leave his majority hanging by a thread.

Ultra-Orthodox community members have been exempt from compulsory military service for decades. However, the exemption expired last year, and the government has failed to pass a new law securing their special status.

In summer 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that ultra-Orthodox men can be drafted into the military.

Local health authorities said that an Israeli airstrike on a school in Khan Younis, which they said was housing displaced Palestinian families, killed at least 10 people, including children.

According to residents, the Israeli military has escalated airstrikes and tank shelling on parts of Khan Younis a day after dropping leaflets warning residents to leave their homes and head west.

The leaflets said that forces would fight Hamas and other militants in those areas.

Khan Younis is located in the southern part of the Gaza Strip.

The UN Security Council is set to vote on a resolution late Wednesday afternoon (2000 GMT) that demands ""an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, respected by all parties.""

Drafted by the council's 10 elected member states, who serve two-year terms, the resolution reiterates the demand for the release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups following their October 7, 2023, surprise attack in southern Israel.

It also calls for the immediate lifting of all restrictions on the entry of aid and its safe and unhindered distribution, including by the UN, throughout Gaza.

A resolution needs nine votes in favor from the 15-member body and no vetoes from the five permanent members — the United States, Russia, China, Britain, and France — to pass.

This will be the first vote on the subject by the UN Security Council since November, when the United States, a key ally of Israel, blocked a resolution calling for an end to the fighting. Washington is expected to use its veto again.

""We eat whatever is available, one meal a day, from morning until late at night. Sometimes it is lentils; sometimes it is pasta,"" 21-year-old Hazem Lubbad told DW in video message from Gaza. 

For the past 19 months, he has been hunkering down with his extended family in Sheikh Radwan, a neighborhood in the northwest of Gaza City.

Israeli's military said it was shelling targets in Syria late on Tuesday after projectiles launched from Syria hit the Israel-controlled Golan Heights. 

""Two projectiles were identified crossing from Syria into Israeli territory, and fell in open areas,"" the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) posted on X.

In a subsequent post, the IDF said that its ""artillery struck in southern Syria"" following the launches.

Syria's official news agency SANA reported shelling ""targeting the Yarmuk Basin, in the west of Daraa"" province.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said violent explosions had hit farmland in southern Syria, without reporting casualties.

Israel says its strikes aim to stop advanced weapons reaching Syria's new authorities, led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, whom it considers jihadists.

Israeli media said Tuesday's projectiles were the first fired from Syria into Israeli territory since the fall of former Syrian President Bashir Assad in December.

A group calling itself the Mohammed Deif Brigades, named after a Hamas military leader killed by an Israeli strike in Gaza last year, claimed the attack in a post on Telegram, according to AP news agency. 

The group first surfaced on social media a few days before.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a post on X that he held Syria's leader ""directly responsible"" for the launches.

Syria's foreign ministry said in a statement carried by the state-run TV channel that it has ""not yet verified the accuracy"" of the reports of strikes launched from Syria toward Israel.

""We affirm that Syria has not and will not pose a threat to any party in the region,"" the statement said. 

Aid centers run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an agency backed by the United States and Israel, will temporarily close on Wednesday, it said.

""June 4, distribution centres will be closed for renovation, reorganisation and efficiency improvement work,"" GHF wrote on Facebook.

The Israeli army confirmed the temporary closure and warned civilians against moving in areas leading to GHF sites on Wednesday, deeming them ""combat zones.""

The GHF said it has asked the Israeli military to improve civilian safety around its distribution centers in Gaza.

This includes guiding foot traffic to minimize confusion or escalation risks and develop clearer guidance for civilians. 

This comes a day after at least 27 Palestinians were killed and dozens injured near a GHF food aid distribution site in southern Gaza, according to local officials and a Red Cross field hospital. 

Israel's military said on Tuesday that it had opened fire on ""individual suspects"" deemed a threat after they advanced towards troops.

Aid distribution is expected to resume on Thursday. 

The GHF, a private contractor whose funding is unclear, started delivering aid just over a week ago. 

The use of the GHF to deliver aid in Gaza, where one in five people face starvation, has been highly controversial. 

The organization, which uses armed security contractors and distributes food and medicine from only four distribution points, has drawn fierce criticism for bypassing the UN and major aid organizations, and has been accused of ignorning international laws related to providing humanitarian relief.

Following reports that Israeli forces killed civilians near a food distribution site in Gaza for a second time, all aid centers in the enclave will remain closed on Wednesday.

The facilities would remain shut for ""renovation, organization and efficiency improvement works,"" according to the controversial US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which runs the aid operations in Gaza.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","Trump Calls for Rescinding $9 Billion From Foreign Aid and Public Broadcasting","https://truthout.org/articles/trump-calls-for-rescinding-9-billion-from-foreign-aid-and-public-broadcasting/","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:32:42 GMT","

Because the request to Congress is not subject to the Senate filibuster, the GOP can pass it without Democratic votes.

The Trump White House on Tuesday formally asked Congress to rescind over $9 billion in approved spending, taking aim at lifesaving foreign aid programs as well as funding for U.S. public broadcasting outlets targeted by the president.

The $9.4 billion rescission request, expected to be the first of several, is laid out in a memo authored by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who wrote that the clawback “would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests, such as funding the World Health Organization, LGBTQI+ activities, ‘equity' programs, radical Green New Deal-type policies, and color revolutions in hostile places around the world.”

The White House request specifically urges Congress to rescind hundreds of millions of dollars from U.S. contributions to United Nations peacekeeping; $500 million from U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) global health programs that fund “activities related to child and maternal health, HIV/AIDS, and infectious diseases”; $800 million from Migration and Refugee Assistance; and $125 million from the Clean Technology Fund.

The request would also eliminate U.S. contributions to the U.N. Children's Fund.

If enacted, the rescissions would compound the damage already done by the Trump administration's lawless assault on USAID, an attack that has had devastating impacts around the world.

Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, said Tuesday that “this attempt to claw back billions of dollars of federal funding already approved by Congress, including lifesaving foreign aid, is yet another deadly setback for communities now left without food, clean water, healthcare, and more.”

“The global aid system is already overstretched as need continues to rise,” said Maxman. “We are already seeing the life and death impacts of foreign assistance cuts — championed by a handful of the world's richest people — on women, children, and communities already enduring poverty, hunger, conflict, and disaster.”

“We call on Congress to vote ‘no' on this reckless rescissions package and uphold longstanding bipartisan commitment to these programs that save untold lives and make the world a better place for us all,” Maxman added.

The humanitarian alliance InterAction warned that “these cuts would condemn countless vulnerable women, children, and families to preventable suffering and death — and already have.”

“The closing of clinics in South Sudan caused at least five children with cholera to die while trying to access treatment,” the alliance said. “In the Democratic Republic of Congo, entire communities were cut off from water, food, and healthcare. Stories like these continue to emerge from across the globe.”

The White House package also demands that Congress rescind all $535 million appropriated for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which would cement President Donald Trump's broadside against NPR and PBS. Both outlets are suing the president over his attempt to cut off their federal funding.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the new request “is just the beginning,” warning that “next time, it might be funding for cancer research or to help working families afford their energy bills this summer.”

“After linking arms with Elon Musk to take a chainsaw to key programs the American people count on, President Trump is now asking Republicans in Congress to rubberstamp his DOGE cuts and codify them into law,” said Murray. “In asking Congress to rescind some of the funding he has been illegally blocking for months, Trump is conceding what we've known all along: that Congress — not the president — must approve the rescission or withholding of investments that were signed into law.”

Because the rescission process is not subject to the 60-vote Senate filibuster, congressional Republicans can approve the White House's demands without any Democratic support. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) pledged to “bring the package to the floor as quickly as possible.”

Peter Maybarduk, Access to Medicines director at Public Citizen, said in a statement Tuesday that the White House proposal marks “a low moment for our country.”

“This president, having unconstitutionally obliterated foreign aid, is now asking members of Congress to bless the power he illegally took from them and the destruction he has wrought with it,” said Maybarduk. “Trump's cuts will save no more than a rounding error, but cost America its credibility, and hundreds of thousands of people their very lives.”

If bosses want to force workers to put in extra hours, then they should be the ones who pick up the tab, not taxpayers.

Donald Trump's campaign promise to make overtime pay tax-free seems to have left Democrats looking like deer caught in the headlights. It looks like a pro-worker measure, even though it is bad from many perspectives. 

It actually should not be hard for progressives to think their way out of this one. It just requires going back to the original rationale for the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in 1937, which set the length of the normal workweek at 40 hours.  

While the Act does reward workers by giving them a 50 percent wage premium when they work more than 40 hours a week, another purpose of this premium was to discourage employers from forcing workers to put in long hours. The idea was both to ensure that workers had a reasonable amount of leisure time to enjoy with their families or for other purposes, and to encourage employers to hire more workers instead of requiring that their existing workforce put in long hours.

If we remember this simple point, it is obvious how we can do better for workers than Trump's tax-free overtime. Rather than having taxpayers subsidize employers who make their workers put in long hours, we can simply increase the wage premium for overtime. Instead of requiring employers pay a premium of 50 percent of the workers' ordinary wage for hours above the 40-hour standard, we can require that they pay a 100 percent wage premium.

This means that if a worker's ordinary hourly wage was $35.00 then they would get $70.00 for each hour they worked in excess of the normal workweek, rather than $52.50 as is now the case. This would both put more money in the worker's pocket and mean that the employer is paying it rather than the taxpayer. 

While it might be nice to give manufacturing and construction workers (those most likely to get overtime pay) some additional money, it's hard to make a case that this should come out of the pockets of lower paid retail and restaurant workers. It is important to remember that overtime is generally mandatory. If employers want to force workers to put in extra hours, they should be the ones who pick up the tab.

This change in the overtime wage premium is also harder to game. With the Trump tax scheme, it's easy to imagine employers playing around with the reported (not actual) lengths of workweeks to maximize the tax subsidy. 

The increased overtime wage premium might also have the intended purpose of the FLSA when it was passed, of discouraging employers from requiring workers to put in long hours and instead encouraging them to hire more workers. If we want to see more people employed in manufacturing and construction, we should be giving incentives to hire more workers rather than fewer workers, as is the case with the Trump tax scheme.

If we want to get really radical, we can actually amend the FLSA to have the overtime wage premium kick in at 38 hours or even 36 hours. After all, it's been almost 90 years; a 10 percent reduction in the length of the workweek over this period hardly seems unreasonable.

It doesn't take too much arithmetic to realize that cutting the length of the average workweek by 10 percent means roughly a 10 percent increase in employment in the industry. It's not easy to envision policies that would increase employment in construction and manufacturing by 10 percent, certainly Donald Trump's trade policy is not going to do the trick.

Of course, the story will not actually be that simple. There may be some changes in demand and output. Also, many companies will continue to work employees 40 hours or more and just pay out more money in overtime wages. That would be fine too. We would have a 5 percent pay increase to workers putting in a 40-hour week, or a 10 percent pay increase if we double the overtime wage premium. And again, this money is coming from employers, not taxpayers.

We might also think it actually is a good thing if workers had shorter workweeks, as was the case when the FSLA was passed. The goal of the labor movement, pretty much forever, has been for workers to have enough time to live decent lives and also enough money to pay the bills. 

It would be great if Democrats could put some version of this increased overtime wage premium on the table in the current debate on making overtime tax free. They are not obligated to play dumb all the time.

Dismantling a key HHS agency, gutting important programs, and cuts to Medicaid will roll back decades of progress.

On May 30, the Trump administration released its most comprehensive look yet at its proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The proposal heightened concerns that the disability community and advocacy groups have voiced in recent months regarding the administration's plan to eliminate the Administration for Community Living (ACL) and related grant programs.

If these programs are not funded, experts warn that an increasing number of disabled and aging Americans could be institutionalized with little oversight to ensure their rights are protected against abuse and neglect. The National Disability Rights Network (NDRN) called the plan to eliminate the programs “a direct and deliberate attack on people with disabilities, their families, and the systems that protect their rights, health, and independence.”

Alison Barkoff, who served as ACL's acting administrator and assistant secretary for aging during the Biden administration, is now director of George Washington University's health law and policy program. “The dismantling of ACL combined with the elimination of programs and these big Medicaid cuts are literally going to roll back decades of progress,” Barkoff told Truthout. “In terms of people with disabilities, the default [could become] people in institutions that are very unsafe with huge rights violations.”

A subsidiary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), ACL houses and funds the state councils on developmental disabilities, university centers for excellence in developmental disabilities, and the nation's network of protection and advocacy (P&A) agencies. It also provides grants to centers for independent living, administers employment programs for disabled people, and offers other services to help ensure disabled people and older adults can live and participate in their communities, a requirement of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and a 1999 Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C. That decision held that under the ADA, segregating persons with disabilities in institutions constitutes discrimination. One in five older adults and almost a quarter of the nation's more than 70 million disabled people depend on ACL programs, according to Barkoff's testimony before the Senate at a forum held in May.

Plans to shutter ACL and shift some of its programs to other HHS agencies were first announced on March 27 to comply with President Donald Trump's earlier executive order on so-called “workforce optimization” and “eliminating waste [and] bloat.” HHS said that the “dramatic restructuring” would save the department $1.8 billion per year and shrink the department's workforce by 10,000 employees, resulting in a total decrease from 82,000 full-time employees to only 62,000 when combined with other efforts to downsize — a reduction of almost 25 percent.

More details of the Trump administration's plan to eliminate ACL became public when a draft budget proposal from the Office of Management and Budget, dated April 10, was leaked. The new budget documents published on May 30 now confirm that the administration wants to eliminate ACL and much of its work as part of a $163 billion cut in federal spending. While the proposed budget slashes vital services for disabled and aging Americans, it promises over $1 trillion for military spending and anti-immigrant and border infrastructure.

These moves are also part of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s agenda to “Make America Healthy Again,” which Kennedy claims is focused on fighting chronic illness and reducing federal spending. However, funding for chronic disease treatment and research has also been slashed in the Trump administration's May 30 budget proposal. Experts also warn that rolling back programs like those provided by ACL could result in increased spending, as it is more expensive to house people in institutions than to provide services that allow them to live in community.

While these efforts do not seem to align with the administration's stated goals, ramping up institutionalization, particularly for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, does align with the administration's dangerous and dehumanizing rhetoric about disabled people and Trump's long-held obsession with eugenics. Dom Kelly, founder, president and CEO of New Disabled South, a nonprofit disability advocacy organization in the U.S. South, told Truthout, “It's ableism at its core.”

Already, many ACL programs are struggling to operate because HHS has delayed distributing funding authorized by Congress in March and has fired about half of ACL's staff, including those responsible for budget and grants, making it almost impossible for the remaining staff to fund and implement programs.

One of the most alarming aspects of the proposed defunding of ACL is its effect on P&As. There are 57 P&As — one in every state, every territory, and Washington, D.C. — and most receive almost all of their funding from the federal budget. If that funding is cut, the organizations will not be able to carry out their federally mandated functions to provide legal and advocacy services to disabled people and monitor and investigate abuse and neglect in institutions and group facilities housing disabled and older individuals, such as hospitals, prisons, jails, group homes, and nursing homes.

Importantly, under federal law, P&As are the only organizations with the authority to access all areas of facilities housing people with disabilities that would otherwise be accessible only to residents and to have unaccompanied access to residents themselves to communicate with them privately. This allows the organizations to expose and address abuse and neglect, even if an individual has not sought out the agency.

“The critical role of the P&As is that they go into so many of these facilities and investigate and reveal so much of the abuse and neglect that happens in these places,” Kelly told Truthout. “They're one of our only layers of oversight that allows for some of these injustices to be uncovered and fought.”

P&As were created in 1978 under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, which was signed into law three years prior. The legislation came on the heels of a historic civil rights lawsuit challenging living conditions at Willowbrook State School in New York, a state-funded institution where adults and children with intellectual and developmental disabilities were beaten, experimented on, and deprived of fundamental rights to food, appropriate medication and access to hygiene facilities.

While there has been a hard-fought shift toward community living since Willowbrook, tens of thousands of disabled people and older adults remain in institutions nationwide. This includes more than 16,000 people with intellectual or developmental disabilities housed in state-operated institutions and over 1.2 million people in nursing homes. While nursing homes are often thought of as places for aging adults, more than 200,000 nursing home residents are disabled individuals under the age of 65.

Nationwide, almost 700,000 people are on waiting lists to access home- and community-based services (HCBS) waivers that would allow some to transition out of institutional settings. Between 2016 and 2023, people sat on waiting lists for an average of 36 months before receiving waivers through the Medicaid program, which provides services for disabled adults and children in their own homes. Since 1999, dozens of lawsuits have also been filed against state and local governments alleging continued segregation and institutionalization of disabled people in violation of the ADA and the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C.

Legal protections for disabled people have also been strengthened since Willowbrook, but research suggests that cases of abuse and neglect persist in institutional settings. In 2022, the last year for which complete data is available, the National Adult Maltreatment Reporting System investigated over 120,000 reports of alleged maltreatment of older or disabled adults living in residential care facilities. Cases of maltreatment included the use of force or violence, deprivation of necessities, sexual abuse, financial exploitation and emotional abuse, such as verbal insults or humiliation.

Matthew Borus, a professor at Binghamton University who studies disability and nursing homes, told Truthout that dehumanizing treatment is commonplace in some facilities. Nursing home residents that Borus interviewed for his research have reported being shoved by staff, committed to a psychiatric facility as a form of punishment, and having their call button put out of reach to prevent them from calling for assistance. “A lot of the folks I've talked to have talked about how they feel like the management of the nursing home treats them essentially as bodies in beds, rather than as people participating in a community,” he told Truthout.

“People think about [Willowbrook] and think, ‘Oh, we've moved beyond that. We don't have these kinds of institutions.' But actually, there are still state-run institutions, and while it may not be the kind of horrific circumstances that people used to live in at Willowbrook, it is, in today's environment, still tantamount to abuse and neglect,” Kelly told Truthout. Fulfilling the promise of the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Olmstead v. L.C. would require reinforcing ACL and funding more HCBS waivers to get people off waiting lists and out of institutions.

Instead, Barkoff warns that a return to Willowbrook-like conditions could be on the horizon if Congress moves to approve Trump's proposed budget and eliminate ACL and its network of P&As. “We will not only have a lot of people who might die, [but also] people certainly experiencing things like restraints and seclusion, having their rights violated,” she told Truthout. “We've worked really hard to put systems and supports in place to help people live the lives that they want in the community [and] if these programs were eliminated, I do fear that we will be going backwards to a time where people with disabilities will be primarily in congregate settings [and] not be able to be part of their own communities and will face huge risks of abuse and neglect.”

A new U.S. president enters office vowing to reach out a hand to a bitter enemy. He pledges to resolve a long-burning crisis through diplomacy, despite widespread skepticism that it's possible. When his early efforts stall, Congress—including members of the president's own party—loses patience and advances sweeping sanctions to break the impasse. European allies also grow frustrated and impose new penalties.

This is the story of the opening months of Donald Trump's second term on Russia. After refusing to accept a cease-fire and intensifying attacks on Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has shown that he's not interested in peace. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, has secured over 80 votes for a bill to impose “bone-crushing sanctions” on Russia—enough for a veto-proof majority. The EU is preparing new sanctions, too.

But it's also the story of the opening year of Barack Obama's presidency on Iran. During George W. Bush's second term, the United States steadily escalated sanctions on Iran. When Obama entered office, he pivoted to diplomacy, proposing an arrangement in which Tehran would part with its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for nuclear fuel. In late 2009, however, Iran rejected the proposal. Congress responded with wave after wave of sanctions, culminating in measures that devastated Iran's oil revenues. European countries also stepped up and imposed an oil embargo. The combined pressure drove Iran's economy into freefall, creating the conditions that ultimately brought Iran to the negotiating table.

With Trump's Russia policy at a dead end, his administration would do well to learn from Obama's Iran experience. A particularly important lesson is that congressional initiative—while almost always unwelcome by the executive branch—can be an essential ingredient to a successful economic pressure strategy. If Trump is serious about ending the war in Ukraine, his administration should work with Graham and other hawks on Capitol Hill rather than oppose them.

Another takeaway is that oil sanctions can work, even against major exporters. As the Trump administration explores options to ramp up pressure on Russian oil, it should study what succeeded against Iran.

A final lesson is that Europe has more agency than it often realizes. Although the EU has typically followed Washington's lead on sanctions, the reverse can also be true: decisive European action can spur the United States to follow. As Trump repeatedly threatens sanctions and then retreats, Europe's best move now is to act first—and trust that the United States won't be far behind.

On becoming president in 2009, Obama inherited an Iran sanctions regime that, in some respects, resembles the sanctions Russia faces today. The Bush administration had imposed penalties on Iran's largest banks and worked to sever its access to the global financial system and to sensitive nuclear technologies. But it had stopped short of wielding secondary sanctions—penalties targeting Iran's trading partners—or aggressively curbing Iran's oil sales.

The result was underwhelming. Although Iran was increasingly isolated financially and its economy was sluggish, it never tipped into recession. The sanctions were falling short.

It was in this context that Obama made his first diplomatic overture. In fall 2009, his administration proposed a deal: Iran would ship most of its enriched uranium to Russia in exchange for enough nuclear fuel to power the Tehran Research Reactor—which produced medical isotopes—for more than a decade. Although Iranian negotiators initially accepted the deal, they soon reversed course, and it collapsed within weeks.

Long skeptical of Obama's Iran diplomacy, Congress took matters into its own hands. In the summer of 2010, it passed the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act, which required the Treasury Department to impose secondary sanctions on foreign financial institutions that dealt with Iranian banks. Obama signed the bill, and it worked: even risk-tolerant banks in Dubai and Istanbul backed away from Iran, completing the country's financial isolation.



The next year, Congress took aim at Iran's last remaining link to the world economy: oil exports. Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, of New Jersey, and Republican Senator Mark Kirk, of Illinois, proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act mandating secondary sanctions on any foreign bank that processed payments with the Central Bank of Iran, the repository for all the country's oil revenues. At the time, Iran exported roughly 2.5 million barrels of oil per day to more than 20 countries. When Obama administration officials studied Congress's plans, they went into a panic. Their projections found that the sanctions could spike oil prices above $200 per barrel and cause a “nuclear winter recession,” as a senior Treasury official recalled. The Obama administration vehemently opposed the amendment, arguing that it risked splintering the transatlantic alliance, as multiple European countries still bought oil from Iran.

But then, in late 2011, Iranian militiamen stormed the British embassy in Tehran, briefly holding staff members hostage. In response, the EU prepared its own oil embargo against Iran—deflating Obama's main argument against Congress's plans. Menendez and Kirk pushed the amendment forward. Days before a vote, Obama officials reached a compromise with the senators: countries that significantly reduced their oil purchases from Iran every six months would receive a sanctions waiver. They would be allowed to continue importing Iranian oil without facing secondary sanctions—but only if they wound down their purchases over time. Even with this revision, Obama urged the Democratic-controlled Senate to reject the amendment, still uneasy about the ramifications for oil prices. But it passed 100–0 and Obama reluctantly signed it.

To the administration's surprise, the sanctions worked. Over the next 18 months, Iran's oil sales plummeted by 60 percent, to around one million barrels per day. U.S. shale producers boosted production in turn, keeping the oil market balanced and staving off the price spike that Obama had feared.

Congress wasn't finished. Next, lawmakers pushed legislation to try to drive Iran's oil sales to zero. Again, Obama officials were wary. By then, only six countries were buying oil from Iran, and just one, China, was buying a sizable quantity. Strong-arming China to quit Iranian oil entirely was unlikely to work, and if Beijing called Washington's bluff, the credibility of American sanctions could be permanently damaged.



Obama officials reached another compromise with Congress: foreign banks could keep processing payments for Iranian oil, but the funds had to remain in the buyer's country, usable only for nonsanctioned trade. If a Chinese refinery bought Iranian oil, it would deposit the funds in a Central Bank of Iran account based in China. Tehran could use that money to buy goods from China or medicine and food globally—but it could not bring it home. Tehran could not, therefore, use the money to fund its nuclear program or bankroll its terrorist proxies. In essence, the scheme would compel the creation of escrow accounts, locking Iran's oil money overseas.

The strategy worked even better than the Menendez-Kirk amendment. It allowed Iran to continue selling some oil, yet tens of billions of its petrodollars accumulated abroad. Deprived of hard currency, Iran's economy spiraled. That pressure helped Hassan Rouhani win election as Iran's president in 2013 and led to the negotiations that froze Iran's nuclear program and culminated in the 2015 nuclear deal. In those negotiations, the ability to repatriate Iran's escrowed oil funds was Washington's most valuable bargaining chip.

Throughout this entire period, Congress was a thorn in Obama's side. Yet Obama administration officials sometimes grudgingly acknowledged the upside of pressure from Capitol Hill. In 2015, while warning Congress not to “play the spoiler” in negotiations with Iran, National Security Adviser Susan Rice conceded that Congress had played a “hugely important role in helping to build our sanctions on Iran.” Later that year, in announcing that negotiations with Iran had produced an agreement, Obama himself thanked Congress for its role in crafting the sanctions. Congress had played the bad cop, forcing the Obama administration to go beyond its comfort zone and giving the threat of secondary sanctions serious credibility. Meanwhile, Obama had played the good cop, using congressional pressure to enable diplomacy.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, U.S. sanctions policy has attempted to strike a delicate balance: maximizing pressure on Russia without disrupting the world oil market. This has been difficult, as Russia accounts for just over ten percent of global oil production, while hydrocarbon revenues contribute roughly a third of Russia's federal budget. Russia plays a major role in the world oil market, and oil plays an essential role in funding the Russian government—including Putin's war machine.

Initially, the United States attempted to balance these competing objectives by focusing sanctions on Russia's banking and defense industries, leaving energy relatively untouched. On the very first day of the invasion, Joe Biden affirmed publicly that the sanctions were “specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue”—and his administration maintained a broad sanctions exemption for all energy-related transactions with Russia. In an economy already struggling with inflation, the prospect of skyrocketing gasoline prices was too frightening to hazard.

Over the next three years, Biden tiptoed toward oil sanctions but remained wary of anything that risked decreasing Russian supply. In December 2022, the United States and its G-7 partners imposed a price cap that aimed to reduce the revenue that Russia earned on each barrel of oil that it sold. Specifically, the policy barred Western tankers from carrying Russian oil—and Western firms from insuring such shipments—if the oil was priced above $60 per barrel. But the price cap was not backed by the threat of secondary sanctions, which had been so critical to the measures against Iran. When they bought Russian oil, Emirati traders and Chinese refineries faced no threat of U.S. penalties—even if they bought the oil at a price exceeding the cap. Russia exploited the built-in weaknesses of the policy, reducing its reliance on Western maritime insurance and amassing a large shadow fleet of oil tankers.

In his final weeks in office, Biden finally began dialing up the pressure on Russian oil, sanctioning Russia's third- and fourth-largest oil producers, but it was too little, too late. As of today, despite frequent claims that Russia is the most sanctioned country on earth, it's nowhere close: its top two energy companies, Rosneft and Gazprom, are not even subject to primary sanctions, to say nothing of Iran-style secondary sanctions.

Although Russia's economy has struggled under sanctions, oil revenues have kept it afloat. It turned out there are hard limits to how much pressure Washington could apply to Moscow without targeting its most lucrative export.

Since returning to office, Trump has imposed no new sanctions on Russia. He has focused instead on diplomacy, pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to negotiate and insisting that Putin wants a deal. According to multiple media reports, Trump has pledged to keep Ukraine out of NATO and to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. But he has made no progress with Putin.

Although congressional Republicans have remained deferential to Trump, their patience appears to be wearing thin. In the Senate, Graham has introduced legislation requiring the Trump administration to regularly assess whether Russia is refusing to negotiate a peace deal. (Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, co-authored the bill.) If the administration determines that Russia is stonewalling, a wave of new penalties would automatically take effect—most notably, secondary tariffs of 500 percent on any country that imports Russian oil, gas, petroleum products, or uranium. In effect, the bill would impose embargo-level tariffs on a wide array of countries unless they halt Russian energy imports entirely, including China and India (Russia's top oil customers), Turkey and Brazil (major buyers of Russian diesel), and the EU and Japan (significant consumers of Russian liquefied natural gas).

That threat is not credible. The world has already watched Trump struggle to sustain 145 percent tariffs on China for more than a few weeks, and most countries would probably call Washington's bluff on a tariff threat several times higher. Besides, Russian energy exports cannot drop to zero overnight without triggering severe market dislocation. As a result, if the bill were enacted as written, Trump would most likely invoke a national security waiver and decline to enforce it.

But rather than oppose the bill, Trump should treat it as an opportunity to revive the good cop, bad cop dynamic with Congress that helped Obama secure the Iran nuclear deal. His administration should strike a compromise with Graham to replace the extreme tariff proposal with a more targeted oil sanctions regime, modeled on what worked against Iran. Under such a system, buyers of Russian oil would face secondary sanctions unless they meet two conditions: that their countries reduce total purchases every six months, and that payments are made into escrow accounts that Russia can use only for humanitarian imports.



There is good reason to believe this approach could work. With global oil supplies outpacing demand, there's room to cut Russian exports without disrupting markets. Removing all of Russia's crude exports from the market, totaling some five million barrels per day, is unrealistic, but a 20 to 40 percent reduction over the next year is achievable—and could even open the door for U.S. shale producers to gain market share, advancing Trump's goal of American energy dominance.

Moreover, Chinese, Indian, and Turkish banks would likely comply with the escrow account arrangement. All of them have been cautious about U.S. secondary sanctions, and this system might even benefit them by boosting exports to Russia. If Indian banks can release Russian oil funds only to finance bilateral trade, for example, India's sales of pharmaceuticals and agricultural products to Russia would likely increase—giving the country a reason to comply beyond the threat of punishment. And if the system succeeded, it would quickly give the Trump administration a massive pile of escrowed Russian oil funds to incentivize Putin to take concrete steps toward peace, such as accepting an unconditional cease-fire.

Just as the EU oil embargo on Iran helped spur action in Washington a decade and a half ago, major new EU sanctions on Russia could do the same today. Instead of waiting around for Trump, Brussels should advance new penalties on Russia's energy sector. Even unilateral EU measures would tighten the screws on Moscow—and could prompt Washington to follow suit.

Most important, the EU should seize the more than $200 billion in Russian sovereign assets that are already frozen in Europe and channel them into support for Ukraine. Combined with hard-hitting oil sanctions, such a move would force Putin to reconsider his long-standing belief that time is on his side—that Western resolve will crack if he just waits long enough.

Over the past four months, Trump has threatened to levy sanctions against Russia on at least half a dozen occasions. Each time, Putin has called his bluff and Trump has flinched. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently acknowledged, “The president's belief is … right now, [if] you start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking.”

Trump's handling of Russia diverges sharply from his approach to every other country. He hasn't hesitated to impose massive tariffs on China while pursuing a trade deal or to levy new sanctions on Iran amid nuclear negotiations. In most cases, he sees coercion as compatible with diplomacy. With Russia, he seems to believe that the two are mutually exclusive.

It's time for Trump to rethink that strategy. As Obama learned in his push for a nuclear deal with Iran, diplomatic breakthroughs with hard-line adversaries require leverage. And the most effective way to gain that leverage—while maintaining negotiating credibility—is to coordinate with Congress.

Of course, it will be even harder for Trump to coax Putin into a just peace in Ukraine than it was for Obama to strike a nuclear deal with Iran. Putin has transformed Russia's economy into a war machine and covets a decisive military victory more than sanctions relief. But that only underscores the need for more pressure. Without it, diplomacy is wishful thinking.

The moment is ripe. Congress is losing patience. Europe is growing frustrated. And the global oil market is better positioned to absorb disruptions than it has been in years. The stars are aligning for Trump to get the cards he needs to change Putin's calculus. The question is whether he's ready to play them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","2 Chinese researchers charged with smuggling biological pathogen to study at University of Michigan lab","https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/us/chinese-researchers-smuggle-pathogen-university-of-michigan","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 06:47:00 GMT","


            Two Chinese researchers were charged with smuggling a biological pathogen that they planned to study at a University of Michigan lab last summer, a complaint filed Tuesday says.
    


            Yunqing Jian, 33, and Zunyong Liu, 34, were charged with conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud the United States, smuggling goods into the United States, false statements and visa fraud for bringing in the fungus Fusarium graminearum from China, according to the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.
    


            “The Department of Justice has no higher mission than keeping the American people safe and protecting our nation from hostile foreign actors who would do us harm,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.
    


            Fusarium graminearum is described as “a potential agroterrorism weapon” that can cause disease in certain plants like wheat, corn, rice and barley, and is “responsible for billions of dollars in economic loss worldwide each year,” an FBI affidavit in support of the complaint says.
    


            “The toxins produced by Fusarium graminearum cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in livestock and humans,” the complaint states.
    


            The 25-page criminal complaint does not allege that the defendants – who investigators say were in a relationship – had any plans to spread the fungus beyond the laboratory, but it says Liu was aware of the restrictions on the material and deliberately hid it in a wad of tissues his backpack.
    


            The charges come as the Trump administration is looking to revoke visas for Chinese students, especially those with alleged “connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week. The State Department has zeroed in on any potential wrongdoing from academics across the country in the last several months, including a Harvard researcher accused of smuggling frog embryo remains.

            FBI Director Kash Patel said in a post on X that the case is “a sobering reminder that the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is working around the clock to deploy operatives and researchers to infiltrate American institutions and target our food supply, which would have grave consequences.” The affidavit doesn't specify what Jian and Liu's intentions were in studying the fungus.
    


            In its ongoing battle with Harvard University to cut billions of dollars in federal funding and international students out of the institution – moves that have prompted two ongoing lawsuits from the school – the administration has alleged that joint research with Chinese academics on optics and aerospace amounted to “coordinating with Chinese Communist Party officials on training that undermined American national security.”
    


            The Department of Homeland Security also cites an inquiry from three Republican congressional committee chairs saying that a series of health conferences hosted by Harvard included participation by members of a sanctioned Chinese paramilitary group accused of complicity in a genocide against China's minority Uyghur population.
    


            CNN reached out to the federal community defender of the Eastern District of Michigan, who represents Jian, for comment. Jian, who was arrested by the FBI, remains in custody. Liu is not currently in the US, said Gina Balaya, public information officer for the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.
    


            Liu, who is a researcher at Zhejiang University in China, tried to bring in multiple samples of the fungus during a trip with a tourist visa in July 2024, hiding it in his backpack inside tissues because he knew he wasn't allowed to import it, the affidavit says.
    


            “The tissues concealed a note in Chinese, a round piece of filter paper with a series of circles drawn on it, and four clear plastic baggies with small clumps of reddish plant material inside,” according to the affidavit.

            Jian, his girlfriend, is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Molecular Plant-Microbe Interaction Laboratory at the University of Michigan, and previously worked at a university in Texas since August 2022, the affidavit says. Authorities found evidence that during her time at the two universities, the Chinese government funded her research on Fusarium graminearum at Zhejiang University, the affidavit says.
    


            Files found on Jian's phone included a signed “annual self-assessment form” from the university, which described her research accomplishments from the previous year as well as an oath to follow the principles of the CCP, the affidavit says. Radio Free Asia previously reported on the practice, saying “tens of thousands” of Chinese students using government-backed scholarships were required to sign the document.
    


            When Liu was questioned at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport in July 2024, he initially claimed he didn't know what the materials containing the fungus were, but eventually admitted he intentionally hid the samples and planned to clone different strains at the University of Michigan lab where Jian worked, the affidavit says.
    


            Several devices seized from Liu, the affidavit says, showed messages where he coordinated with Jian to smuggle biological samples and other materials for the July 2024 trip as well as for a trip two years earlier.
    


            Additionally, the complaint accuses Jian of coordinating with another person in China to ship her illicit samples that were believed to be Fusarium graminearum last year, instructing the individual to cut filter papers into smaller pieces that could be hidden inside a thick textbook.
    


            That shipment was intercepted by Customs and Border Protection agents and destroyed before its exact contents were determined. The person who sent it from China has not been charged with a crime.
    


            The University of Michigan officials said in a statement Tuesday they “strongly condemn any actions that seek to cause harm, threaten national security or undermine the university's critical public mission,” and noted they received no funding from the Chinese government in relation to those charged.
    


            Jian appeared in court Tuesday but didn't enter a plea, Balaya said. She is scheduled to be in court for a detention hearing Thursday.

            US tariffs on steel and aluminum doubled to 50% as of 12:01 am ET on Wednesday, a move cheered by the beleaguered American steel industry but worrisome to sectors that heavily use the metals, from car makers to can manufacturers.
    


            The jump in import taxes is the latest salvo in President Donald Trump's trade war, part of a broad range of tariffs he's levied since February. But the steel tariffs are especially significant to him and his political base, a symbol of once-iconic US manufacturing that has since fallen on hard times.
    


            The leap in tariffs likely won't hit American pocketbooks immediately – but experts say that higher prices on construction projects, car lots, appliances and elsewhere are all but inevitable from the higher duties. And while the tariffs could protect steel manufacturing jobs, they could hurt employment in much larger industries.
    


            But the administration said the tariffs are crucial to national security and the economy.
    


            “Domestic steel and aluminum production is imperative for our defense-industrial base,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CNN. “The Trump administration is committed to reshoring manufacturing that's critical for our national and economic security while unleashing a full suite of supply-side reforms – including rapid deregulation, tax cuts, and unleashing American energy – to continue delivering economic relief for the American people.”
    


            The American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry trade group, said that protecting the steel industry is crucial.
    


            “We still consume more steel than we produce in America,” said Lourenco Goncalves, CEO of Cleveland Cliffs, one of the major US steelmakers, and the chairman of AISI.
    


            He said that raising the tariffs to 50% will only increase the cost of building a car by $300, which he characterized as minor in terms of the overall cost of a car.
    


            “The average cost of a car is $48,000, with an added $300, it's $48,300. That's not going to be the decision-making factor for a person to buy or not buy a car,” he said at a press conference Tuesday.
    


            But the Aluminum Association, the trade group for that industry, said it worried that the broad universal tariff could hurt it more than it helps as it cuts off the supply of raw aluminum from Canada many finishing mills in the United States depend upon. Those mills account for most of the jobs in the US aluminum industry.
    


            Industries that use steel and aluminum also expressed concern. Can manufacturers warned that price hikes could even reach grocery store shelves.
    


            The Can Manufacturers Institute, a trade group for the industry, said domestic can makers import almost 80% of tin mill steel due to the cut in domestic production of that type of steel. It said the increase in tariffs will “further increase the cost of canned goods,” such as food and drinks.
    


            But it is not clear when or if that increase of a few cents per can will be passed onto consumers.
    


            Experts also warn there are more jobs at risk at manufacturers that use steel and aluminum than would be protected by the tariffs.
    


            “I think that's a really quintessentially damaging policy, there are (at least) 50 times more workers…in industries that use steel, like cars, than there are in the steel industry,” Larry Summers, director of the National Economic Council during the Obama administration, told CNN Monday. “And so the net effect of this is going to be to destroy manufacturing jobs. The net effect of this is going to be to push up consumer prices.”
    


            Trump announced a 25% tariff on steel imports in February, part of a broader effort by the White House to revive America's Rust Belt and boost manufacturing jobs.
    


            He announced the doubling of the tariffs on Friday during a trip to a US Steel mill outside of Pittsburgh.
    


            “If you don't have steel, you don't have a country,” he told a crowd filled with cheering steelworkers. “You can't make a military. What are we going to do? Say, ‘Let's go to China to get our steel for the army tanks and for the boats and ships.' A strong steel industry is not just a matter of dignity or prosperity and pride. It's above all, a matter of national security.”
    


            Spot steel prices have increased 20% or more, depending on the product, since the original 25% tariffs went into effect in March, said Philip Gibbs, steel analyst for KeyBank. He said that aluminum prices have also increased, but not by as much. Overall steel prices increased 6% just between March and April, according to the government's Producer Price Index, while aluminum prices increased 2%.
    


            “They're not bashful about asking for price increases,” Gibbs said. “If they feel like if they have a window to ask, they will.”
    


            The two industries have been benefiting from the previous 25% tariffs. But they've had other protections.
    


            Trump in 2018, during his previous administration, also announced 25% tariffs on steel and 10% tariffs on aluminum, although the following year he lifted them on Mexico and Canada.
    


            While the US is not the manufacturing-focused economy it once was, it still consumes tens of millions of tons of steel and aluminum a year. Studies of those 2018 tariffs found that for every steel job that was saved, there were 75 jobs lost elsewhere in manufacturing due to higher input costs. (The American Iron and Steel Institute challenges those studies.)
    


            Automakers mostly source their steel used at North American plants from domestic mills, and they have long-term purchase contracts that have, so far, protected them from price increases in the spot market. But the previous round of tariffs in 2018 and the price increases that followed eventually cost the companies billions of dollars, the automakers reported at that time.
    


            It also did little to increase steel production then, and it's not clear it will this time. For example, American producers have largely exited the market for the tin mill steel used for cans. That includes Cleveland Cliffs, but Goncalves said the company is not considering restarting that production even with the 50% tariffs. He also wouldn't comment on his company's pricing plans.
    


            And the tariffs could actually hurt some manufacturers they we designed to protect. The earlier 25% tariff on all imported aluminum could cost 100,000 American jobs, William Oplinger, the CEO of Alcoa, one of the largest US aluminum makers, warned in February. Asked if it had any new estimates given the doubling of the tariffs, Alcoa told CNN in a statement that it is “evaluating the announcement.”
    


            Some of those jobs could be because of lost business. Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said in February the company is preparing to package more of its products in plastic and glass as opposed to aluminum to avoid the higher input costs, and that was considering only the 25% tariff rate.
    


            But US aluminum mills in the United States get much of the aluminum they process from Canada, where the cost of energy needed to make the raw material is cheaper. The Aluminum Association is seeking a carve out for Canadian imports.
    


            “We urge the administration to take a tailored approach that reserves high tariffs for bad actors—such as China—that flood the market and includes carve outs for proven partners—such as Canada,” said the trade group's statement. “Doing so will ensure the US economy has the access to the aluminum it needs to grow, while we work with the administration to increase domestic production.”
    


            However, Canada's largest labor union Unifor is urging its government to retaliate with 50% tariffs on US steel and aluminum, calling the US duties a “direct threat to Canadian jobs and economic stability.”
    


            “President Trump fails to understand the chaos and damage these tariffs will inflict on workers and consumers in both Canada and the US,” Unifor National President Lana Payne said in a statement Wednesday.

            After decades of mining coal deep below the mountains of West Virginia, David Bounds now struggles to carry a gallon of milk to the breakfast table without gasping for breath. The black lung disease that forced him to retire eventually may kill him, Bounds believes.
    


            He's proud of being a coal miner. But he doesn't want anyone else to face his fate – or the myriad other dangers miners confront on the job.
    


            “It's getting worse, and worse, and worse as I go along. I don't want to see nobody in that shape, if it can be prevented,” he told CNN.
    


            So Bounds has watched in dismay as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have slashed protections for coal miners.
    


            A CNN investigation has found that in just five months, President Donald Trump dismantled the safety net that has for years protected miners from lung disease, aided those already afflicted and kept miners safe on the job.
    


            Since January, “impact” inspections targeting mines with immediate dangers or the most troubling records of health and safety violations have dropped by 75 percent from the same period a year ago, according to data from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). They are at their lowest level for any year with data available since such “impact” inspections began in 2010.
    


            Those inspections “are geared to save miners' lives,” said Joe Main, the former head of MSHA under President Barack Obama. “If you take that component out, then you've placed more risk on the potential for mine disasters in the United States. It's that simple.”
    


            As Trump has tapped a former mining industry executive to lead MSHA, the agency has halted enforcement of a rule miners sought for decades to protect them against the silica dust that ravages their lungs – citing “unforeseen” restructuring at government offices charged with protecting miners.
    


            As part of Musk's DOGE efforts to reduce government, the mine agency rescinded job offers, froze hiring and reduced its ranks through deferred resignations. DOGE also ordered the closure of about three dozen of MSHA's offices around the country. Though most of those orders were rescinded last week, at least four offices are still slated to shut down, according to a memo obtained by CNN. That includes one in Pineville, West Virginia, created after 29 coal miners died in an explosion in 2010 at the Upper Big Branch mine.
    


            The administration also gutted the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), firing most of its staff in April and May, and shuttering regional offices in coal country, putting in limbo black lung and silicosis programs. While a judge recently ordered some NIOSH staffers to be reinstated, epidemiologists and other researchers told CNN that many remain on administrative leave and expect to lose their jobs.
    


            The president's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would further cut MSHA's budget by 10%, eliminating 47 positions and a grant program that trains miners to better identify, avoid and prevent unsafe working conditions in mines.
    


            A spokesperson for the Department of Labor said MSHA inspectors were exempted from the deferred resignation program, that overall inspection numbers “are similar to historical trends” and the agency “is confident that it will achieve its statutory yearly inspection obligations.” A Health and Human Services spokesperson said the “Trump Administration is committed to supporting coal miners” and added that “NIOSH's essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations.”
    


            Trump has argued that he can reinvigorate the coal industry by cutting red tape and “removing Federal regulatory barriers that undermine coal production.” He's signed executive orders intended to boost the coal industry and ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to end federal limits on coal- and gas-fired power-plant pollution that's been tied to climate change.
    


            “We're ending Joe Biden's war on beautiful, clean coal once and for all,” Trump said at an April 8 signing ceremony for his executive orders. “And we're going to put the miners back to work.”
    


            But many in mine country fear that Trump – who won 70 percent of West Virginia's vote in 2024, with equally strong support among the mining regions across Appalachia – is boosting the coal industry at the expense of the miners who actually carry out the dirty, dangerous work.
    


            “People are going to die because of this,” said Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America.
    


            He said, of Trump, “Look, we're the biggest cheerleader he could possibly have in creating new jobs, because Appalachia is in desperate need of jobs. We don't fault the president on that end. But you can't bring people back and kill them. I mean, how much sense does that make?”
    


            Miners have long faced grave health threats. Between 1900 and 1960, cave-ins, explosions, other disasters and mining accidents killed nearly 100,000 coal miners on the job. It's unclear exactly how many more miners died in those years from black lung.
    


            In 1969, a year after an explosion killed 78 West Virginia miners, Congress passed the landmark Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, which created what became MSHA. The act also established health standards; set fines and criminal penalties for repeated willful safety violations; set strict inspection schedules; and required compensation for miners who developed black lung disease. From when it began tracking black lung in 1970 to 2016, the Centers for Disease Control reported that the condition was the underlying or contributing cause of death for more than 75,000 miners.
    


            Since 1997, research into preventing black lung disease and other mining dangers has been conducted by NIOSH, an institute responsible for studying worker risks across many industries.
    


            At the institute's offices in Morgantown, West Virginia, epidemiologists and researchers in the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program have long provided free health checks for miners, and documented diagnoses of black lung so affected miners can legally demand to be moved to mine jobs that reduce their exposure to coal and silica dust.
    


            Those programs have recently grown in importance, as thinning coal seams force mining operations to dig through thicker layers of sandstone – a process that creates more silica dust, which has led to a steep rise in irreversible lung damage. About one in five of the 4,000 to 6,000 miners the program screens each year have developed black lung disease, researchers testified. That's one reason researchers and miners' advocates have pushed for the new silica dust regulations, which would have cut allowable exposure in half.
    


            But after Trump won election back to the White House, buoyed by his strong support in coal country, his administration moved quickly to walk back many of those programs.
    


            In April, MSHA suspended the new silica-dust rule until mid-August and declined to argue against a mining industry court request to stay the rule, which a court granted.
    


            Around the same time, two thirds of the institute's staff were laid off under orders from DOGE and HHS – including all the members of the surveillance program in Morgantown.
    


            “We found out through a Signal chat,” said Anthony Scott Laney, an epidemiologist who has worked at the program since 2008. “They were having a meeting of the CDC division directors. Someone at the meeting sent out a Signal message that said, ‘Oh no, sorry NIOSH,' with a frowny-face emoji.”
    


            Some lawmakers, including West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, lobbied to reverse the cuts. On May 13, a federal judge in West Virginia, in a lawsuit brought by a miner with black lung, ordered the “full restoration” of the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division, including the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program. At a House budget hearing the next day, HHS Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. told lawmakers that the surveillance and black lung programs would be fully reinstated.
    


            Even with the firings of the respiratory workers in Morgantown rescinded, other parts of the institute that contribute to miner safety remain closed, said Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the union chapter that represents the scientists and staff in Morgantown.
    


            “What wasn't rescinded was the group of persons who do the laboratory work. If new exposures for workers are found, that's where the lab division looks at that and studies it and gives documentation as to ‘this level of particulates does this type of damage,'” she said.
    


            Laney said shuttered labs in Morgantown and Pittsburgh were vital to the respiratory division's work. “How do you do a black lung program if you don't have laboratories?” he asked.
    


            And other pieces of the institute that work on miner safety issues, in Morgantown and elsewhere, still face deep cuts.
    


            “I have been on admin leave since April, but effectively I have lost my job,” said Catherine Blackwood, who studies occupational allergies and microbial triggers of disease. “We've received next to no communication from leadership.”
    


            “I don't think the president or Secretary Kennedy understand the long-term impacts of gutting NIOSH,” she said. “It will impact every single worker in the United States.”
    


            Brendan Demich came from a long line of coal miners – including an uncle buried in rubble at one mine and a grandfather with black lung – to work at a Pittsburgh mine research division of NIOSH. Now, his whole team has been cut.
    


            “If they had come to any of our facilities, asked any questions to NIOSH leadership, asked any questions to people on the ground, there's no way that these cuts would be going through, as we protect everybody from coal miners to construction workers to tradesmen,” said Demich. “It boggled my mind that somebody decided that work is not important.”
    


            Jennica Bellanca, a NIOSH engineer in Pittsburgh who worked on improving responses to mine emergencies, is one of many union members who have filed grievances to challenge their terminations. She said she fears that without NIOSH, research on how to improve the safety of miners simply won't get done.
    


            MSHA has long scheduled quarterly inspections at sub-surface mines and semi-annual inspections at surface mines. But after the Upper Big Branch mine disaster in 2010, the agency also began conducting “impact inspections” at mines that repeatedly violate health and safety standards, or to address specific risks raised by miners or operators.
    


            Main, the former MSHA head, said those inspections have helped prevent any major coal-mining disasters over the past 15 years.
    


            Under Trump, though, such inspections have plummeted. In the first five months of this year, the mining administration conducted one-fourth as many impact inspections as over the same period last year: 18 impact inspections, down from 72, issuing 274 citations for violations, down from 1,141.
    


            That is the fewest impact inspections MSHA has completed in the first five months of any year with available data since the inspection program began. (In 2021 and 2022, the agency stopped releasing inspection data during the Covid-19 pandemic.)
    


            “I can tell you what's going on: They are too short of inspectors to carry them out. That's my gut feeling,” said Main. He said it worries him. “When you start messing with these things that we know work, we know protect miners,” the risk increases, he said. “If there is a lack of inspections to fine them and catch them and get them fixed, miners are going to pay the price.”
    


            A Department of Labor spokesperson said that MSHA has “additional inspectors in the training pipeline,” and noted that its overall inspection numbers through May 20 were higher than in 2024.
    


            Some shortcomings at the mining agency predate Trump's administration. An inspector general report released toward the end of the Biden administration cited shortcomings at MSHA with completing inspections, writing violations and other issues as one of the top “performance challenges” facing the Department of Labor.
    


            But Carey Clarkson, the West Virginia-based vice president of a union that represents MSHA workers, said he worries that, with the changes under the Trump administration, “the safety aspect is gone.”
    


            He said the new administration rescinded job offers to about 90 people in the process of being hired at MSHA, including roughly 50 inspectors who were “justified and severely needed.” He said about 170 people, more than 11% of the workforce, left in DOGE's deferred resignation program.
    


            “The mission was not taken into account. It was ‘we need to get rid of bodies, we don't care from what areas, we don't care what it affects,'” he said.
    


            To lead MSHA, Trump has appointed Wayne Palmer, a former executive at the Essential Minerals Association, a trade group that has supported a legal challenge against the since-suspended silica rule.
    


            Palmer has repeatedly jumped between government and private sector jobs in Washington, DC. In addition to lobbying on behalf of mining interests, he previously registered to lobby for health care clients, as well as a foundation criticized by some US lawmakers and watchdog groups as linked to the Chinese Communist Party's broader effort to influence the United States. That foundation has described itself as an independent group.
    


            Asked about his work for that foundation, a Department of Labor spokesperson said about a decade ago Palmer organized trips for bipartisan delegations of state and local US officials and assisted in organizing events but did not speak at them.
    


            Palmer also served as a senior official at MSHA in Trump's first administration. At that time, a report by the Department of Labor's inspector general found the mine-safety agency did too little to protect miners from silica dust, sticking to outdated standards even as the number of miners developing black lung soared.
    


            “Every single day the silica dust rule is delayed is a day our miners are contracting black lung, and it is killing them,” said Erin Bates, a spokeswoman for the United Mine Workers of America, which fought against the pause.
    


            Rebecca Shelton, director of policy for Appalachian Citizens' Law Center, a nonprofit law firm that works on mine safety issues, called getting the silica rule in place foundational for protecting miners. “But if you don't have MSHA inspectors,” she added, “it doesn't matter how good your rule is, because you can't enforce it.”
    


            At his home in Oak Hill, in the heart of West Virginia's coal country, Bounds sits hooked up to the oxygen machine that helps him breathe.
    


            “With the black lung, it thickens your wall, and it's hard to get that breath in there,” he explained. He said most of the damage to his lungs comes from decades of exposure to coal dust. “We'd go down to Myrtle Beach for a vacation, lay on the beach, and spit up coal dust. Even after being down there for a week, you're still spitting up coal dust. You know there's a lot of dust down in your system when you do that a week later.”
    


            But, as NIOSH researchers have determined, Bounds said the silica dust now affecting younger miners is worse – damaging lungs more quickly and severely. It's one reason Bounds joined the fight for the rule to reduce silica exposure and celebrated when the new rule was approved.
    


            “We was tickled with that,” he said. “It was a big thing for us.”
    


            “Now, it's come down to the same thing it was before. ‘We'll take care of it in the fall, we'll do it in spring, we'll do it in fall.'”
    


            He pauses. “I just gotta get a little bit of wind. I'm talking too much.”
    


            Bounds, who said he did not cast a vote for a presidential candidate in the last election, said he doesn't think Trump and others in Washington understand the effect the program and inspection cutbacks will have on miners.
    


            Coal miners “depend on NIOSH. They depend on mine inspectors. They depend on things being right,” he says. “Mine operators get rich, but the… coal miner himself is getting sicker and sicker. And they want to go the wrong route. They're trying to go a wrong route by cutting the people that's there to help us.”

            An elephant never forgets – where the snacks are stored.
    


            A large wild elephant caught shopkeepers off guard at a convenience store in Thailand on Monday, when it lumbered into the shop in search of food.
    


            The hungry mammal can be seen on CCTV footage entering the store and helping itself to snacks.
    


            “Business was a bit slow that day. Around 2 p.m., the elephant just walked right up. I came out and tried to shoo it away. I told it not to come closer,” shop owner Khamploi Kakaew told CNN.
    


            “I told it, ‘Go away, go on,' but it didn't listen. It was like it came on purpose.”
    


            The store, in Thailand's Nakhon Ratchasima province, northeast of the capital Bangkok, is near the Khao Yai National Park, so elephants are often nearby.
    


            “We usually see it pass by, and watch from inside the house. But it never came into the shop before or hurt anyone,” she said.
    


            The elephant – a 27-year-old male called Plai Biang Lek – is well known in the area.
    


            Khamploi said it stayed in the store for about 10 minutes, picking and eating. While wild elephants usually prefer bananas, bamboo and grasses, Biang Lek went straight for the sweets.
    


            “It walked up to the counter – the candy counter near the freezer. It used its trunk to gently push the freezer out of the way so it could fit inside,” she said.
    


            “It went straight to the snacks, picked through them with its trunk. It ate about 10 bags of sweets – they're 35 baht ($1) each. It also ate dried bananas and peanut snacks.”
    


            Another elephant remained outside the store, “probably waiting,” Khamploi said.
    


            Park rangers were called and were eventually able to guide the elephant away, after much coaxing and shooing.
    


            “He's around here often but never hurts anyone. I think he just wanted snacks,” said Khamploi.
    


            Following the unexpected visit, a wildlife protection group stopped by and offered Khamploi 800 baht for the stolen goods.
    


            “They said they were ‘sponsoring the elephant's snack bill' – it was kind of funny,” she said.
    


            Elephants, Thailand's national animal, have seen their wild population decline in recent decades due to threats from tourism, logging, poaching and human encroachment on their habitats.
    


            Experts estimate the wild elephant population in Thailand has dwindled to 3,000-4,000, from more than 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century.
    


            A group of local volunteers in Khao Yai are working to keep the park's elephants away from residential areas.

            “The elephants' behavior has changed from looking for food at people's orchards or farms, to frequently visiting humans' houses,” Thanongsak Changin, 44, a resident and volunteer, told CNN.
    


            The elephant Biang Lek had “raided” several other places before Monday's incident, Thanongsak said, even injuring the tip of its trunk after breaking a glass cupboard in a local home.
    


            “He is now living in a village, which is unusual for a wild elephant. It is like they don't want to return to the mountain. It is easier for them to just stay among the houses,” he said.
    


            Human and elephant encounters are common and can turn violent, Thanongsak said. There have been instances of elephants destroying cars.
    


            Khao Yai National Park is home to an estimated 140-200 wild Asian elephants, and Thanongsak said his group is trying to keep the area safe for both elephants and humans.

(AP) — The Justice Department is dropping a lawsuit that it filed against White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, a case in which he was accused of using an unofficial email account for government work and wrongfully retaining presidential records during the first Trump administration, according to a Tuesday court filing.
    


            The joint filing by the Justice Department and an attorney for Navarro doesn't explain why they are abandoning a case that was filed in 2022, during President Joe Biden's term in office. The one-page filing says each side will bear their own fees and costs.
    


            The lawsuit accused Navarro of using at least one “non-official” email account — a ProtonMail account — to send and receive emails. The legal action comes just weeks after Navarro was indicted on criminal charges after refusing to cooperate with a congressional investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Navarro served a four-month prison sentence after being found guilty of misdemeanor charges.
    


            The civil cases alleges that by using the unofficial email account, Navarro failed to turn over presidential records to the National Archives and Records Administration.
    


            The government notified the court of the lawsuit's dismissal a day before US Magistrate G. Michael Harvey was scheduled to preside over a status conference for the case.
    


            A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. A lawyer for Navarro didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
    


            Navarro served as a trade adviser during President Donald Trump's first term. A longtime critic of trade arrangements with China, he has been named senior counselor for trade and manufacturing for Trump's second administration.

NEW YORK (AP) — Edmund White, the groundbreaking man of letters who documented and imagined the gay revolution through journalism, essays, plays and such novels as “A Boy's Own Story” and “The Beautiful Room is Empty,” has died. He was 85.

White's death was confirmed Wednesday by his agent, Bill Clegg, who did not immediately provide additional details.

Along with Larry Kramer, Armistead Maupin and others, White was among a generation of gay writers who in the 1970s became bards for a community no longer afraid to declare its existence. He was present at the Stonewall raids of 1969, when arrests at a club in Greenwich Village led to the birth of the modern gay movement, and for decades was a participant and observer through the tragedy of AIDS, the advance of gay rights and culture and the backlash of recent years.

A resident of New York and Paris for much of his adult life, he was a novelist, journalist, biographer, playwright, activist, teacher and memoirist. “A Boy's Own Story” was a bestseller and classic coming-of-age novel that demonstrated gay literature's commercial appeal. He wrote a prizewinning biography of playwright Jean Genet and books on Marcel Proust and Arthur Rimbaud. He was a professor of creative writing at Princeton University, where colleagues included Toni Morrison and his close friend, Joyce Carol Oates. He was an encyclopedic reader who absorbed literature worldwide while returning yearly to such favorites as Tolstoy's “Anna Karenina” and Henry Green's “Nothing.”

“Among gay writers of his generation, Edmund White has emerged as the most versatile man of letters,” cultural critic Morris Dickstein wrote in The New York Times in 1995. “A cosmopolitan writer with a deep sense of tradition, he has bridged the gap between gay subcultures and a broader literary audience.”




In early 1982, just as the public was learning about AIDS, White was among the founders of Gay Men's Health Crisis, which advocated AIDS prevention and education. The author himself would learn that he was HIV-positive in 1985, and would remember friends afraid to be kissed by him, even on the cheek, and parents who didn't want him to touch their babies.

White survived, but watched countless peers and loved ones suffer agonizing deaths. Out of the seven gay men, including White, who formed the influential writing group the Violet Quill, four died of complications from AIDS. As White wrote in his elegiac novel “The Farewell Symphony,” the story followed a shocking arc: “Oppressed in the fifties, freed in the sixties, exalted in the seventies and wiped out in the eighties.”

But in the 1990s and after he lived to see gay people granted the right to marry and serve in the military, to see gay-themed books taught in schools and to see gay writers so widely published that they no longer needed to write about gay lives.

“We're in this post-gay period where you can announce to everybody that you yourself are gay, and you can write books in which there are gay characters, but you don't need to write exclusively about that,” he said in a Salon interview in 2009. “Your characters don't need to inhabit a ghetto any more than you do. A straight writer can write a gay novel and not worry about it, and a gay novelist can write about straight people.”

In 2019, White received a National Book Award medal for lifetime achievement, an honor previously given to Morrison and Philip Roth among others.

“To go from the most maligned to a highly lauded writer in a half-century is astonishing,” White said during his acceptance speech.

White was born in Cincinnati in 1940, but age at 7 moved with his mother to the Chicago area after his parents divorced. His father was a civil engineer “who reigned in silence over dinner as he studied his paper.” His mother a psychologist “given to rages or fits of weeping.” Trapped in “the closed, sniveling, resentful world of childhood,” at times suicidal, White was at the same time a “fierce little autodidact” who sought escape through the stories of others, whether Thomas Mann's “Death in Venice” or a biography of the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky.

“As a young teenager I looked desperately for things to read that might excite me or assure me I wasn't the only one, that might confirm my identity I was unhappily piecing together,” he wrote in the essay “Out of the Closet, On to the Bookshelf,” published in 1991.

As he wrote in “A Boy's Own Story,” he knew as a child that he was attracted to boys, but for years was convinced he must change — out of a desire to please his father (whom he otherwise despised) and a wish to be “normal.” Even as he secretly wrote a “coming out” novel while a teenager, he insisted on seeing a therapist and begged to be sent to boarding school. One of the funniest and saddest episodes from “A Boy's Own Story” told of a brief crush he had on a teenage girl, ended by a polite and devastating note of rejection.

“For the next few months I grieved,” White writes. “I would stay up all night crying and playing records and writing sonnets to Helen. What was I crying for?”

He had a whirling, airborne imagination and New York and Paris had been in his dreams well before he lived in either place. After graduating from the University of Michigan, where he majored in Chinese, he moved to New York in the early 1960s and worked for years as a writer for Time-Life Books and an editor for The Saturday Review. He would interview Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote among others, and, for some assignments, was joined by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.

Socially, he met Burroughs, Jasper Johns, Christopher Isherwood and John Ashbery. He remembered drinking espresso with an ambitious singer named Naomi Cohen, whom the world would soon know as “Mama Cass” of the Mamas and Papas. He feuded with Kramer, Gore Vidal and Susan Sontag, an early supporter who withdrew a blurb for “A Boy's Own Story” after he caricatured her in the novel “Caracole.”

“In all my years of therapy I never got to the bottom of my impulse toward treachery, especially toward people who'd helped me and befriended me,” he later wrote.

Through much of the 1960s, he was writing novels that were rejected or never finished. Late at night, he would “dress as a hippie, and head out for the bars.” A favorite stop was the Stonewall, where he would down vodka tonics and try to find the nerve to ask a man he had crush on to dance. He was in the neighborhood on the night of June 28, 1969, when police raided the Stonewall and “all hell broke loose.”

“Up until that moment we had all thought homosexuality was a medical term,” wrote White, who soon joined the protests. “Suddenly we saw that we could be a minority group — with rights, a culture, an agenda.”

Before the 1970s, few novels about openly gay characters existed beyond Vidal's “The City and the Pillar” and James Baldwin's “Giovanni's Room.” Classics such as William Burroughs' “Naked Lunch” had “rendered gay life as exotic, marginal, even monstrous,” according to White. But the world was changing, and publishing was catching up, releasing fiction by White, Kramer, Andrew Holleran and others.

White's debut novel, the surreal and suggestive “Forgetting Elena,” was published in 1973. He collaborated with Charles Silverstein on “The Joy of Gay Sex,” a follow-up to the bestselling “The Joy of Sex” that was updated after the emergence of AIDS. In 1978, his first openly gay novel, “Nocturnes for the King of Naples,” was released and he followed with the nonfiction “States of Desire,” his attempt to show “the varieties of gay experience and also to suggest the enormous range of gay life to straight and gay people — to show that gays aren't just hairdressers, they're also petroleum engineers and ranchers and short-order cooks.”

With “A Boy's Own Story,” published in 1982, he began an autobiographical trilogy that continued with “The Beautiful Room is Empty” and “The Farewell Symphony,” some of the most sexually direct and explicit fiction to land on literary shelves. Heterosexuals, he wrote in “The Farewell Symphony,” could “afford elusiveness.” But gays, “easily spooked,” could not “risk feigning rejection.”

His other works included “Skinned Alive: Stories” and the novel “A Previous Life,” in which he turns himself into a fictional character and imagines himself long forgotten after his death. In 2009, he published “City Boy,” a memoir of New York in the 1960s and ‘70s in which he told of his friendships and rivalries and gave the real names of fictional characters from his earlier novels. Other recent books included the novels “Jack Holmes & His Friend” and “Our Young Man” and the memoir “Inside a Pearl: My Years in Paris.”

“From an early age I had the idea that writing was truth-telling,” he told The Guardian around the time “Jack Holmes” was released. “It's on the record. Everybody can see it. Maybe it goes back to the sacred origins of literature — the holy book. There's nothing holy about it for me, but it should be serious and it should be totally transparent.”

Russia's top security official was in North Korea on Wednesday for talks with the country's leader, the Russian Tass news agency reported, the latest sign of the two autocratic countries' alignment over Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. 

North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu are expected to discuss details on the strategic partnership agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang, which Kim and Putin signed in June 2024. 

The talks will also touch on “issues on the international agenda, including the situation around Ukraine,” Russian media reported, citing the Security Council's press team. Shoigu, formerly Russia's defense minister, last traveled to Pyongyang in late March.

In April, the Kremlin confirmed that North Korean troops are fighting alongside Russian forces to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk border region.

At the time, Putin praised North Korean soldiers who he said stood “shoulder to shoulder with Russian fighters, defended our Motherland as their own.”

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had said in January that Ukrainian forces captured two North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk — the first such claim by Kyiv since North Korea sent thousands of troops to shore up Moscow's war effort on the other side of the world.

Palestinian health officials and witnesses say Israeli forces fired on people as they headed toward an aid distribution site on Tuesday, killing at least 27, in the third such incident in three days. AP Video shot by Marian Dagga Production by Wafaa Shurafa

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Shootings have erupted nearly daily since last week in the Gaza Strip in the vicinity of new hubs where desperate Palestinians are being directed to collect food. Witnesses say nearby Israeli troops have opened fire. Hospital officials say at least 80 people have been killed and hundreds wounded.

The Israeli military has said it fired warning shots in several instances, and has also fired directly at a few “suspects” who ignored warnings and approached its forces. It has denied opening fire on civilians, and has not claimed Hamas fired in the area of the hubs, though it says it is still investigating.

What we know about the shootings that have occurred as crowds walked toward aid distribution hubs:

Three aid distribution hubs are being run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a newly formed group of mainly American contractors. Israel wants GHF to replace humanitarian groups in Gaza that distribute aid in coordination with the U.N.

Israel accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid under the U.N.-led system. But the U.N. and aid groups deny there is a significant diversion of aid to militants, and say the new system — which they have rejected — allows Israel to use food as a weapon, violates humanitarian principles and won't be effective.

GHF started distributing aid on May 26, following a nearly three-month Israeli blockade that has pushed Gaza's population of more than 2 million people to the brink of famine. The GHF system limits food distribution to hubs guarded by armed contractors. Of the three hubs that are open, one is in central Gaza and two are in the far south on the outskirts of the mostly uninhabited southern city of Rafah; not all have operated every day.




On Wednesday, GHF paused aid distribution, saying that it was discussing measures to improve civilian safety with the Israeli military, including changes to traffic management and troop training.

All the hubs are located in Israeli military zones, where journalists have no access.






To reach the sites in Rafah, Palestinians must walk for miles along a designated route where GHF says the Israeli military keeps security. In statements to the public, GHF has warned people to stay on the road, saying leaving it “represents a great danger.”

Distribution usually starts at 5 a.m. each day. But thousands of Palestinians start walking hours earlier, desperate not to miss out on food. That means large crowds passing by Israeli troops in the dark.

While shootings have been reported near all three hubs, the heaviest occurred Sunday and Tuesday at the Flag Roundabout. The traffic circle is located on the designated route about a kilometer (1,000 yards) northwest of GHF's distribution hub in the Tel al-Sultan district of Rafah. The hub is a few hundred meters from an Israeli army base.

Witnesses said that in the early hours Sunday, as crowds made their way down the coastal road toward the hub, Israeli troops fired warning shots and made announcements through drones flying overhead, telling them to turn back and return when the hub opened at 5 a.m.

By 3 a.m., thousands were massed at the Flag Roundabout, waiting for the hub to open. That was when Israeli troops started firing, with guns, tanks and drones, three Palestinian witnesses said. They said they saw people falling dead or wounded as the crowd scattered for cover.

Mohammed Ahmed, one man in the crowd, said he saw no provocative acts before the shooting. He said troops “may have opened fire because they felt threatened by the thousands of people in the area.”

Witnesses gave similar accounts of Tuesday's shooting, around 4 a.m. at the same roundabout.

The Israeli military said it fired warning shots Sunday at “several suspects” approaching them. On Tuesday it said it “fired to drive away suspects.” In a statement, army spokesman Effie Defrin said “the numbers of casualties published by Hamas were exaggerated” but that the incident was being investigated.

He accused Hamas of “trying to disrupt the arrival of aid” to Palestinians and pointed to drone footage that the military says shows armed men firing at civilians trying to collect aid in the nearby city of Khan Younis, where there are no GHF sites.

The Associated Press could not independently verify the video, and it was not clear who was being targeted. In its statements on the incidents near the GHF sites, the military has not reported the presence of armed Palestinians.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says there has been no violence in or around their distribution centers and that its personnel have not opened fire.

On Tuesday, GHF acknowledged that the Israeli military was investigating whether civilians were wounded “after moving beyond the designated safe corridor and into a closed military zone” in an area that was “well beyond our secure distribution site.”

A spokesperson said GHF was “saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor.”





Officials at the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah and at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis have reported being overwhelmed by casualties brought from areas close to the distribution sites. They have said most suffered from gunshot wounds, including women and children.

An aid worker at one hospital said the morgue was overflowing and that wounded filled every bed, or were on the floor, many with gunshots to the buttocks and legs. The worker spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.

Aid workers in Gaza say there is still a lot of uncertainty about what is happening and why so many people are being shot, injured and killed. The aid workers are unable to operate at the sites because they are in military zones.

Humanitarian groups had warned for weeks that having people collect aid in areas with a military presence would expose them to violence.

“This was a ludicrous and ineffective distribution mechanism that was going to end up deadly, which is, tragically, exactly what we are seeing,” said Arwa Damon, founder of the International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance.

The existing U.N.-run system operates differently, with workers taking aid to Palestinians wherever they are.

“It is appalling that the humanitarian sector that knows how to do their job is being prevented from doing it because of the false narrative that Hamas controls the aid,” Damon said.

Deadly encounters around aid distribution aren't entirely new. In February 2024, Israeli troops guarding an aid convoy heading to northern Gaza opened fire as a crowd of desperate Palestinians stripped supplies off the trucks. More than 100 people were killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is led by medical professionals but reports to the Hamas-run government.

After investigating the incident, Israel said its troops fired on a “number of suspects” who ignored warning shots and advanced toward its forces. It said a stampede around the trucks caused “significant harm to civilians.” EU and U.N. officials at the time said most of the casualties were from Israeli fire.



Palestinians have described a frenzied free-for-all to get food once they reach the GHF's distribution sites.

Boxes of food are left piled up on pallets in an area surrounded by fences and earth berms. Once the sites' gates are opened, the crowds rush in, with everyone grabbing what they can. Witnesses say some people take multiple boxes, which quickly run out, and that many leave empty-handed.

GHF issued a video at the Tel al-Sultan hub showing Palestinians racing furiously toward the boxes.

Aid workers say the supplies are far from enough. GHF says each box contains enough food for a family of five to eat for three to four days. Most boxes contain flour, sugar, cooking oil, pasta and tuna cans, among other items.

“Our team on the ground reports these boxes are woefully insufficient for ensuring children's well-being,” said Tess Ingram of UNICEF. “It doesn't have to be this way.”

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's new President Lee Jae-myung vowed Wednesday to restart dormant talks with North Korea and bolster a trilateral partnership with the U.S. and Japan, as he laid out key policy goals for his single, five-year term. 

Lee, who rose from childhood poverty to become South Korea's leading liberal politician vowing to fight inequality and corruption, began his term earlier Wednesday, hours after winning a snap election that was triggered in April by the removal of then-President Yoon Suk Yeol over his ill-fated imposition of martial law late last year.

In his inaugural address at the National Assembly, Lee said that his government will deal with North Korean nuclear threats and its potential military aggressions with “strong deterrence” based on the South Korea-U.S. military alliance. But he said he would “open a communication channel with North Korea and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula through talks and cooperation.”

He said he'll pursue pragmatic diplomacy with neighboring countries and boost trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo cooperation.

“Through pragmatic diplomacy based on national interests, we will turn the crisis posed by the major shift in global economic and security landscapes into an opportunity to maximize our national interests,” Lee said. 




It was unclear whether Lee's election would cause any major, immediate shift in South Korea's foreign policy. Lee, previously accused by critics of tilting toward China and North Korea and away from the U.S. and Japan, has recently repeatedly stressed South Korea's alliance with the U.S. as the foundation of its foreign policy and avoided any contentious remarks that would raise questions on his views on the U.S. and Japan.

“We'll have to now see if the pressures of office will cause Lee Jae-myung to govern from the center — at least when it comes to matters of national security and the alliance with the United States,” said Ankit Panda, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“It's hard to predict with absolute certainty how he will deal with the U.S., North Korea, Japan and China because he's changed his position so much,” said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security. “We can expect tensions if his government doesn't align with Washington's approach to China and Japan.”

The toughest external challenges awaiting Lee are U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policy and North Korea's expanding military partnerships with Russia. But experts earlier said whoever becomes president can't do much to secure major progress in South Korea's favor on those issues.

The U.S. and Japan said they congratulated Lee's election and expressed their commitments to developing three-way cooperation.

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he wants to hold summit talks with Lee “as early as possible,” saying he hopes to further promote bilateral ties, both public and commercial. The U.S. State Department said that Seoul and Washington share “an ironclad commitment” to the alliance.

Chinese President Xi Jinping also sent a congratulatory message to Lee, saying that Beijing is willing to work with Seoul to advance their cooperative partnership for the benefit of the countries' peoples, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

It's unclear how North Korea would react to Lee's speech, as it has shunned any talks with South Korea and the U.S. since 2019. North Korea in recent years has supplied weapons and troops to support Russia's war against Ukraine, and South Korea, the U.S. and their partners suspect Russia might in return transfer high-tech technologies to North Korea to help it perfect its nuclear weapons program.

Russia's Tass news agency said Wednesday that top Russian security official Sergei Shoigu has arrived in Pyongyang for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in the latest sign of the countries' booming exchanges.

Lee has said he would support Trump's moves to restart nuclear diplomacy with Kim Jong Un as part of efforts to engage with North Korea. North Korea hasn't publicly responded to Trump's outreach. 

“Lee and Trump would personally want to resume dialogue with Kim Jong Un. But North Korea has no incentive to talk to Washington or Seoul,” said Duyeon Kim, the analyst. “Pyongyang has Beijing and Moscow's support both politically and economically, and can buy a lot of time to further perfect its nuclear weapons.”

Later Wednesday, Lee nominated former Unification Minister Lee Jong-seok, a dove who favors greater rapprochement with North Korea, as his spy chief. The nomination is likely related to Lee Jae-myung's hopes to reopen talks, as the National Intelligence Service previously played a behind-the-scene role to promote ties with North Korea, observers say. 

Lee Jae-myung also nominated his key political ally and veteran lawmaker Kim Min-seok as prime minister, the government's No. 2 job. Lee is expected to nominate other top Cabinet members in coming days.

Lee called for unity to address the country's stark political divide deepened after Yoon's martial law debacle, saying that he will “answer the people's solemn call to let hope bloom over deep and painful wounds.” 

Lee still promised a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding Yoon's martial law imposition, describing it as a “rebellion that seized people's sovereignty with arms.”

Lee said revitalizing a slowing domestic economy would be his top priority and that his government would immediately launch an emergency task force to wage a “head-on battle” against the threats of recession. He also promised more aggressive government spending to help spur economic activity.

South Korea's central bank last week cut its key interest rate and sharply lowered its growth outlook for 2025 to 0.8%, as it moved to counter Trump's tariff hikes and weak domestic demand worsened by recent political turmoil.

Lee also reiterated his campaign vows to reduce inequality, saying that “the polarization fueled by inequality is now hindering further growth.”

Lee's term began immediately without the usual two-month transition period after the National Election Commission formally confirmed his election victory. Before his inauguration, Lee visited the national cemetery in Seoul to pay his respects to late Korean leaders, patriots and war dead who are buried there, and he had a telephone call with Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Kim Myung-soo to call for military readiness against possible North Korean aggression.

The Village of Dolton has been served a subpoena seeking records tied to a land development allegedly linked to Mayor Tiffany Henyard's boyfriend. (WFLD)

The self-described Chicago suburb ""super mayor"" is facing mounting legal woes after being ousted in a landslide election following a scandal-plagued time in office. 

Former Dolton Mayor Tiffany Henyard, a Democrat, has been ordered to appear for a contempt hearing after she did not turn over public records from her time in office, according to WGN 9. 

The Edgar County Watchdogs Inc. sued the Village of Dolton and the former mayor for failing to produce financial records after the administration allegedly disregarded Freedom of Information Act requests earlier this year.

""The former mayor is about to find out if losing an election is enough to escape contempt of court,"" Edward ""Coach"" Weinhaus, attorney for Edgar County Watchdogs, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. 

Henyard was previously held in contempt of court after she failed to turn over records from her time in office, directly dismissing state transparency laws for elected officials, WGN 9 reported. 

""The massive public exposure given to the defendant that has brought Illinois corruption into the national public spotlight needs to be addressed immediately to save further harm to the state's reputation,"" the complaint reportedly read.

In a hearing last week, Henyard reportedly told the judge she was the ""face"" of the village but was not tasked with recordkeeping, according to WGN 9.

Henyard and the attorneys representing the Village of Dolton did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

Last month, Jason House was sworn in as the newly elected mayor of Dolton, ending Henyard's tumultuous time in office. Henyard was also defeated by Illinois state Sen. Napoleon Harris in her bid for re-election as Thornton Township supervisor.

Henyard made national headlines in April 2024 after the FBI served subpoenas at Dolton Village Hall following corruption allegations against local officials, according to FOX 32 Chicago.

While Henyard was not charged, village trustees voted to hire former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to lead an investigation into her administration, with the town meeting descending into chaos as supporters of Henyard clashed with her opponents following the decision. 

Lightfoot reportedly discovered the village's general fund fell from its initial $5.6 million balance to a $3.6 million deficit, with the local government's credit card charges adding up to over $779,000 in 2023.

In February, a federal subpoena was issued, coinciding with the day Henyard was defeated in the mayoral primary, FOX 32 reported. The filing relates to a development project involving land reportedly owned by Henyard's boyfriend. 

Henyard is reportedly scheduled to appear in court on Friday.

Fox News' Christina Coleman reports on the state competition that sparked protests and saw competitors share a podium.

California high school girls' track athlete Clara Adams broke down in tears during her first TV interview since having her state championship revoked.

Adams, who took first place in the 400-meter final on Saturday, was penalized for excessive celebration when she prayed her shoes with a fire extinguisher after crossing the finish line.

California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) officials deemed the act unsportsmanlike and disqualified her.

""I worked so hard for that title,"" she said while crying in an interview with KSBW-TV.

Adams also lost the opportunity to compete in the 200-meter race.

Her father, David Adams, defended her in the interview.

""When she blew the fire extinguisher, the opponents were gone,"" he said. ""That was our moment of celebration, and CIF officials made it about them. The crowd went crazy, they loved it, the CIF booth went crazy, they loved it. But those few guys in those jackets took offense to it, didn't like it, and made a decision based off emotions.""

The father previously told the Monterey Herald that the CIF's decision was protested and that he felt like the disqualification was ""racially motivated.""

The decision to revoke the teen's title was heavily criticized online, especially by women's rights activists who pointed out that Adams was stripped of her title while a biologically male trans athlete was able to compete and win two titles.

AB Hernandez, representing Jurupa Valley High School, took first place in the girls' high jump and triple jump, while taking second place in the long jump.

The controversy involving Hernandez put the entire event under a national microscope, but Adams was the only girls' athlete who walked away from the meet with a significant penalty.

Boulder County Republicans Chairman Peg Cage told Fox News Digital the most recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado brought President Donald Trump's America First agenda ""into focus.""

BOULDER, Colo. – Following a recent terror attack in the heart of Boulder, Colorado, the county's GOP chair said local and state officials who enacted policies protecting individuals in the U.S. illegally are trading the law for tolerance.

Illegal Egyptian national Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested Sunday after allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails into a crowd of peaceful pro-Israel demonstrators near the Boulder County courthouse while yelling, ""Free Palestine.""

Authorities said eight people suffered burn injuries, and a total of 12 people were injured in the attack, which happened on the eve of Shavuot.

BOULDER TERROR ATTACK WITNESS DESCRIBES 'HORRIFIC' SCENE AT PRO-ISRAEL RALLY

""I find it interesting that with all of the things that have happened in Boulder, the one thing that's drawing out the most press and getting the most news is antisemitism,"" Boulder County Republicans Chairman Peg Cage told Fox News Digital. ""Antisemitism is a big deal right now, and that person was guilty of that, and he admitted it himself. But if you look at what he did, it was when he was done with the United States.""

Immigration authorities confirmed Soliman overstayed his non-immigrant visa, which was granted during the Biden administration.

He allegedly flew into Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 27, 2022 with orders to return home by Feb. 26, 2023. However, he never left, filing a claim with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services just one month after his arrival in the country.

On March 29, 2023, Soliman was granted work authorization, which was valid through March of this year.

""I mean, he waited until his daughter had graduated, and he had nothing to lose,"" Cage said. ""He was here illegally, and then he committed the crime.""

The attack took place near an event held by ""Run for Their Lives,"" a worldwide grassroots organization that advocates for the release of Israeli hostages held since Oct. 7, 2023. The local Run for Their Lives chapter gathers in Boulder weekly.

Soliman, who authorities claim drove an hour to commit the act of terror, allegedly said after the attack ""he would do it…again.""

BOULDER TERROR ATTACK SUSPECT SAID HE WANTED TO KILL 'ALL ZIONIST PEOPLE,' USED MOLOTOV COCKTAILS: FEDS

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is charged with attempted first-degree murder, crimes against at-risk adults/elderly, assault, criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies and use of explosives or incendiary devices during a felony. (Boulder Police Department)

""Frankly, if he hadn't been in the heart of Boulder, somebody probably would have shot him, because we're that way here,"" Cage said. ""The reactions that I'm seeing, it rather confirms the America-first agenda of our president and of our Republican Party. … I think [crimes involving illegal immigrants are] just becoming more pronounced, and it's making us side more with our side.""

Pointing to policies enacted by local and state officials, she questioned the disregard for immigration law in the name of tolerance.

""Basically, this wasn't a surprise as much [as], it's just like, thank God nobody got killed, and dang, why didn't somebody get him out of here when he first overstayed his visa,"" Cage said. ""Why aren't we following our laws. … They're too tolerant, and they think it's a good thing.""

She added that contradictions to President Donald Trump's directives are plainly visible on the Boulder County website and in public settings.

""If you go on to the Boulder County website, it's basically how to stay here if you're illegal,"" Cage said. ""We had this Cinco de Mayo event, and the booth next to ours was how to avoid [Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and] how to report an upcoming ICE event that you might know about. … So, no, I'm not surprised. I'm disgusted. It needs to stop, and it makes that come clearer into focus.""

He is also facing federal charges for allegedly committing a hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion or national origin.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem joins ‘Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss President Donald Trump's new daily arrest goal for ICE and provide an update on the legal battle over Trump's ban on foreign students attending Harvard.

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on Wednesday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had issued a detainer in Massachusetts for a criminal illegal immigrant charged with raping a child with force in a crime that was captured on video.

Lorenzo Lopez Alcario, a 30-year-old Guatemalan national accused of tying up and brutally sexually assaulting a young girl in a video that was ultimately found by the girl's mother, had the ICE detainer placed on him this week, according to a press release from DHS. 

The press release states that Alcario first entered the United States illegally on an unknown date before being arrested in 2017 in Arlington, Virginia, for drug possession. 

Later that year, in September, Alcario was ordered by a judge to be removed by the United States and was deported by aircraft on Sept. 28, 2017.

However, according to DHS, Alcario re-entered the United States in June 2022 and was released into the country by the Biden administration despite his criminal history and previous deportation. 

In a statement, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin made the case that Alcario should never have been allowed back into the United States and that the ICE detainer is aimed at ensuring Alcario does not victimize anyone else in the future.

""Lorenzo Lopez Alcario is a pedophile illegal alien from Guatemala who should've never been in the U.S. in the first place,"" McLaughlin said. 

""Despite his previous criminal charges and deportation, President Biden released this barbaric criminal into American communities in 2022. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, ICE lodged a detainer to ensure this criminal illegal alien will not be allowed to terrorize American citizens and will deport this child predator to prevent further victims.""

ICE has been active in Massachusetts in recent weeks, including via Operation Patriot, which resulted in the arrest of nearly 1,500 illegals, including murderers, rapists, drug traffickers and child sex predators, in the deep blue sanctuary city-heavy state.

Sources at ICE told Fox News that 790 of those arrested had criminal convictions or charges and 277 had final removal or deportation orders. The sources said that all the targeted criminals were roaming the streets of Massachusetts cities freely before being apprehended.

HEGSETH ‘AWOL' AT UKRAINE AID MEETING: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is en route to Brussels, Belgium, where NATO defense Ministers are gathering in what will be their last meeting before the big leaders summit at the Hague next month. But for the first time since the U.S. created what came to be known as a Ramstein group of some 50 nations contributing to Ukraine's defense, there will be no U.S. defense secretary in attendance at today's meeting. With no additional aid to announce, Hegseth has decided to skip the meeting, which the U.K. and Germany will chair.

Instead, he plans to deliver his standard lecture to NATO allies at tomorrow's session, urging them to spend more on their defense and stop relying so much on Washington, as the U.S. pivots to the Indo-Pacific as its main priority.

“The secretary will deliver a message at the defense ministerial focused on advancing President Trump's call for NATO allies to commit to spend 5% of their GDP on defense and refocusing NATO on collective defense and deterrence,” Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement.

Asked at a morning news conference if Hegseth's absence signals that the U.S. has gone “completely AWOL” regarding support for Ukraine, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte pushed back with a diplomatic answer, noting that the U.S. will be represented at the meeting, just not by Hegseth, while insisting the U.S. remains “completely committed to our joint and development that comes to Ukraine.”

“There's no reason to doubt that,” Rutte said. “Let's not forget these meetings take place most of the time in Europe, so it will not always be possible for U.S. officials to participate in every meeting.”

PETE HEGSETH TO APPEAR IN FRONT OF CONGRESS NEXT WEEK

ZELENSKY: ‘RUSSIA REMAINS FULLY COMMITTED TO WAR': Even as it reels from Sunday's devastating drone attack on his long-range bomber fleet, Russia is continuing to pummel Ukrainian cities, the latest Russian rocket attack killed at least four civilians and wounded at least 25 others, including children, in the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy.

“There have been virtually no days without killings during this whole time, while the United States, Europe, and other global actors have been urging Russia to agree to a ceasefire and negotiations to end the war,” Zelensky said in his nightly video address. “Russia remains fully committed to war — and they prove this commitment of theirs with both their strikes and their statements — all of this is the argument for new sanctions against Russia, tough sanctions.”

While Hegseth meets with NATO officials, Ukraine has dispatched a delegation to Washington led by Yuliia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's first deputy prime minister, and Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential office, for meetings with President Donald Trump's special envoy, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg.

“Our goal is to implement as quickly as possible everything agreed upon with President Trump. The cessation of killings, real peace, and economic cooperation with America,” Zelensky said. “We are offering the United States very concrete and mutually beneficial agreements.”

UKRAINE TARGETS KERCH BRIDGE CONNECTING RUSSIA AND CRIMEA

TRUMP WAFFLING ON SANCTIONS: Despite the growing bipartisan support in the Senate for legislation to impose crippling additional sanctions on Russia — a bill sponsored by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) has more than 80 cosponsors — President Trump has yet to commit to signing the bill, should it also pass the House by a similar bipartisan margin.

“The president has spoken about his position on sanctions on Russia. He has smartly kept this as a tool in his toolbox, if necessary,” said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “He's willing to use sanctions if he needs them,” she said. “Understand that the president is the commander-in-chief and he's leading United States foreign policy as he should … I think the Senate and everyone on Capitol Hill respects the president is the commander in chief for a reason.”

Majority Leader Sen. John Thune (R-SD) has said the Senate could take up the bill later this month. 

“Eighty Senators from both sides of the aisle, including Leader Thune and myself, co-sponsor this bill,” Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier this week. “We should put the sanctions on the floor for a vote as soon as possible. It's very much needed and it's needed now.”

“Putin is a clear villain and bully, so where is Donald Trump's backbone? Where is his conviction? Where is that toughness Donald Trump likes to project?” Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor. “Frankly, Senators from both sides of the aisle are getting tired of Donald Trump's wishy-washy approach to Putin. If Donald Trump won't stand up to him, the Senate must.”

HAPPENING TODAY: As President Donald Trump is pushing Congress to pass his “big, beautiful” bill of tax breaks and spending cuts by July 4th, the Senate Armed Services Committee has released a breakdown of defense spending that would be included in the budget measure.

The reconciliation measure has been agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators and would add more than $156 billion to the Pentagon's budget for this year.

Here's the breakdown:

“This bill is a landmark down payment toward the modernization of our military and our defense capabilities. It represents a generational upgrade for our national security with historic funding for Golden Dome, American manufacturing, innovative unmanned technology, and new shipbuilding efforts,” Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) said in a statement. “This is about building the future of American defense, and ultimately deterring war. In combination with significant legislative reforms through the NDAA process, this bill will fundamentally change the Pentagon and help us maintain peace and prosperity for Americans.”

HEGSETH TO STRIP NAME OF GAY RIGHT ICON FROM NAVY SHIP: June may be Pride Month for some, but it's not celebrated by the Pentagon or the White House. “There are no plans for a proclamation for the month of June, but I can tell you this president is very proud to be a president for all Americans, regardless of race, religion, or creed,” said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

And apparently, it's not a coincidence that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has picked this month to direct Navy Secretary John Phelan to find a new name for the U.S. Navy replenishment oiler USNS Harvey Milk, named in 2016 for the gay rights activist who gunned down in 1978 and who had served as a sailor during the Korean War.

In a statement, the Pentagon said it was not ready to make any announcement of the renaming. “Secretary Hegseth is committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the commander-in-chief's priorities, our nation's history, and the warrior ethos,” said Sean Parnell, Hegseth's spokesman. “Any potential renaming(s) will be announced after internal reviews are complete.”

The USNS Harvey Milk was one of several oilers named for civil rights leaders during the administration of President Barack Obama, beginning with the late Rep. John Lewis. Other ships in the class are named for former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, former Chief Justice Earl Warren, and women's rights activists Lucy Stone and Sojourner Truth.

Future ships' names include Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court's first black justice; Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg; abolitionist Harriet Tubman; and labor activist Dolores Huerta.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called the renaming a “spiteful move” that “does not strengthen our national security or the ‘warrior' ethos.” 

“Instead, it is a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country,” she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Emil Bove will be a great judge","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/3430112/emil-bove-will-be-a-great-judge/","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump has nominated senior Department of Justice official Emil Bove to a judgeship on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, an announcement that has ignited a firestorm of opposition across the political landscape — from the left about qualifications and consultation, and from the right regarding his overall fitness for the bench. 

The fixation in this storm of controversy is the fact that Bove previously worked as the president's personal attorney, representing him in the numerous criminal prosecutions that he faced during his time out of office.

Here, yet again, we find ourselves in the bizarre universe of double standards that apply only to Trump. Before Bove, when was a private lawyer's representation of the president of the United States ever held against the lawyer when he sought a promotion in government? Both the left and the right are wrong, but the debate is merely academic because Bove will be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  

Criticisms from the left that Bove is unqualified are ridiculous. Despite claims to the contrary, Bove has excellent credentials. In fact, Bove's profile is right out of central casting for an appellate judgeship during Trump's first term. 

Compare Bove's resume to that of Trump's first-ever appellate nominee, Judge Amul Thapar. Bove and Thapar both graduated from top 15 law schools, clerked for federal district and circuit judges, spent a brief time in private practice as litigation associates, served as federal prosecutors, then returned to private practice prior to entering high-level DOJ positions before being nominated to the federal bench. 

Nobody complained about Thapar's nomination because there was nothing to complain about — needless to say that while the American Bar Association no longer has a role in evaluating judicial candidates, Bove would deserve a “well-qualified” rating. As such, Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) should have no problem voting for him with a clear conscience.

Claims that New Jersey senators were not “adequately consulted” are also a joke.  Bove was floated along with a slate of other prospective nominees to the New Jersey Senators months ago. These names were met with the same radio silence Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) greeted the White House with during the entirety of Trump's first term—and as we know, the president has a long memory. Over four years, Booker refused to return a single blue slip, then proceeded to grandstand over the White House's supposed lack of adequate consultation. He followed this act with an encore performance as ringmaster of the circus that unfolded during the Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation.    

Perhaps we should be thanking Booker for reinforcing the important precedent that strong political ties to the White House are superior to objections by home-state Senators. I wonder if he is reflecting on last year's contentious Judiciary Committee debate over the nomination of Kevin Ritz of Tennessee to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  

At the time, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued a warning to Judiciary Democrats if they proceeded with a vote to confirm Ritz over the objections of Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Bill Hagerty (R-TN). “Remember this moment,” he said, because when the next president decides to “shove down the throats [nominees] in your circuits,” they “won't have the moral high ground” to demand that Republicans stand with them. This path was well-paved during the Biden administration. Last week, the Trump administration rolled out the red carpet.  

Finally, claims from the right that Bove is Trump's “henchman” are unfair. While it is true that Trump did not nominate any of his personal lawyers to the bench during the first term, he hadn't yet needed an army of lawyers to push back on the lawfare that wasted countless hours of judicial resources—nor has any president in our history had such a need. It's only natural that as a consequence of that ordeal the president would encounter a few lawyers who would be great judges. 

Indeed, judicial nominees throughout history have more frequently than not shared some connection to the president that nominated them or his party, and the president has the right to know what he's getting when he invests his political capital into a nominee. We saw this on full display over the last four years where former President Joe Biden nominated Democratic operatives like Dale Ho, who repeatedly bashed conservative values and personally attacked Senate Republicans, to the District Court for the Southern District of New York and Nancy Abudu, an activist who previously worked for the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center, to the 11th Circuit.

Ironically, Bove's greatest sin appears to be a willingness to put into practice theories touted at many conservative legal movement events throughout my lifetime. In a few short months, Bove has demonstrated fortitude in the face of certain hostility from Washington elites and the legal profession writ large by enforcing a robust view of the unitary executive, downsizing the bloated and overwhelmingly left-wing career staff, and eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion at the Department of Justice. This is what conservatives want, and this is what Bove has put his law license on the line to secure. If that all makes Bove a “henchman”, we should pray for a federal judiciary full of them.

TRUMP NOMINATES EMIL BOVE TO 3RD CIRCUIT APPEALS COURT

They say you can judge the measure of a man by the company he keeps. Two of the Trump administration's bright young stars—FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson and Acting Associate Attorney General Chad Mizelle—have already publicly endorsed Bove based on actually working with him.  

Ferguson called Bove “one of the most courageous lawyers in America” and Mizelle referred to Bove as a “fearless, law & order conservative”, which he would know from countless hours by his side at DOJ.  Ferguson and Mizelle are — as they say — “men to follow.” If the endorsements Emil Bove's nomination to the Third Circuit has collected to date are any indication of his judicial future, he will be a great judge.

Robert Luther III is a Distinguished Professor of Law at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University where he teaches constitutional law. He served as Associate Counsel to the President in the White House Counsel's Office from 2017 to 2018, where he co-managed the judicial selection process.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Biden's awareness of eight climate executive actions in question at House Oversight hearing","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3429609/eight-biden-climate-executive-actions-autopen-house-oversight-hearing/","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Former President Joe Biden‘s use of the autopen and his mental state during major White House green energy policy announcements will be aired out in Congress on Wednesday. 

In a hearing titled “NGOs gone wild,” the House Oversight Committee will parse claims that the Biden administration handed out billions of dollars to left-leaning nongovernmental organizations and that an autopen was used to sign sweeping executive orders that Biden never spoke about publicly.

Part of the hearing will center on new reports that Biden issued major climate policy changes via executive action without ever saying anything about it on the record, raising questions about his awareness of the orders. 

“President Biden didn't speak a lot to the press to begin with,” Power the Future President Daniel Turner said in an interview with the Washington Examiner. “But we couldn't even find any instance of Joe Biden in his own words, in his own voice, speaking about having signed [these executive orders], the need for it, the purpose of it, et cetera.”

Thus, the only evidence the group could find was the orders themselves, which Turner's group said were signed using an autopen device.

Those findings fold into the wider autopen accusations Republicans are leveling at Biden, questioning whether he coordinated or was even aware of his own administration's actions. Aside from Congress, the Justice Department is also investigating Biden's use of the autopen when he signed pardons, including those involving political allies and family members.

Power the Future advocates energy industry workers and thus focuses on Biden's energy and climate change-related actions.

It found eight actions that it said Biden signed but never spoke about publicly.

The actions included an offshore drilling ban that covered 625 million acres of the Outer Continental Shelf, a commitment for the entire federal government to reach “net-zero” emissions by 2050 and require carbon-free electricity by 2030, a memo invoking the Defense Production Act to push solar panels and heat pumps, an arctic drilling ban, and a leasing requirement for artificial intelligence data centers to be powered using “clean energy.”

Other actions included giving preferential federal hiring treatment to AmeriCorps alumni, creating a “Climate Change Support Office” within the federal bureaucracy, and requiring all federal agencies to assess climate-related financial risk.

“These are major, major, consequential decisions, and Joe Biden never spoke about them,” Turner said.

The offshore drilling ban was issued on Jan. 6, 2025, in the waning days of Biden's presidency. It covered 250 million acres off the West Coast and 44 million acres in Alaska's Northern Bering Sea. The announcement included a written statement from the president and a White House fact sheet.

Biden visited New Orleans that day to pay respects to the victims of a New Year's Day attack that killed 14 people and injured others. However, he did not mention the vast drilling ban.

Similarly, the executive order on clean energy in data centers was issued on Jan. 14, less than a week before Biden left the White House, and the AmeriCorps EO came two days later.

The Defense Production Act order was authorized on June 6, 2022, and while former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre publicly defended it in a news briefing, Biden did not have any public events scheduled that day.

Turner, in researching the matter, was particularly struck by a story House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) told after meeting with Biden late last year.

According to Johnson, he tried to confront Biden about a liquefied natural gas export ban, but the former president insisted he hadn't signed one. The initial reaction to that claim was that Biden had forgotten about signing the ban, but Turner said he now wonders if Biden ever had knowledge of signing it at all.

President Donald Trump has now overturned all eight of the executive actions in question. Representatives for Biden did not respond to requests for comment from the Washington Examiner.

That won't be the only focus of the hearing. 

The committee will also discuss billions of taxpayer dollars going toward NGOs.

Turner's written testimony holds that Jahi Wise, a staffer from an NGO called the Coalition for Green Capital, joined the Biden Environmental Protection Agency to direct $27 billion in green energy funding. Once appointed, he steered $5 billion in grants back to the Coalition for Green Capital.

Another group, Power Forward Communities, was only a few months old when it received nearly $9 billion in taxpayer dollars to use as it saw fit. Of that total, $2 billion went to a group affiliated with former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, which had only $100 in its bank account.

Also testifying will be Center for Immigration Studies Executive Director Mark Krikorian, who will speak on what he said are Biden administration grants to NGOs that helped facilitate illegal immigration.

“[An NGO] provided millions of intending illegal border-crossers with ‘cash-based interventions' in the form of debit cards and even cash in envelopes, as well as legal coaching that involved narrative engineering for fraudulent asylum claims, transportation facilitation, food, camping equipment, trail advice, and lodging assistance,” Krikorian's written testimony says.

While the number of people attempting to cross the border has plummeted since Trump took office, Krikorian said the network is ready to spring back into action should a new occupant enter the White House in a few years.

The Trump administration has largely echoed those concerns. 

For example, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, said in February that he was stunned to learn how much government money went to “far-left NGOs” under the Biden administration.

“In a very literal sense, America's state-owned enterprises are left-wing nonprofits,” he told reporters outside the White House. “Other countries, their state-owned enterprises are like steel companies, right? Or oil companies. In America, we learned our state-owned enterprises are radical left nonprofits.”

In a similar vein, Vice President JD Vance hit back at criticism of his immigration stance from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, saying that organization received “over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants.”

THE LONG CONTROVERSIAL HISTORY OF THE BIDEN AUTOPEN

“Are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line?” Vance said. “We're going to enforce immigration law. We're going to protect the American people.”

The hearing begins Wednesday at 2 p.m. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Consumers mobilize against corporate DEI programs","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/business/3429759/consumers-mobilize-against-corporate-dei-programs/","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 14:15:44 GMT","

EXCLUSIVE — A right-of-center consumer advocacy group is mobilizing its members to flood the phone lines of corporations that have maintained or stood firm on diversity, equity, and inclusion programming in 2025, according to a copy of a memo obtained by the Washington Examiner.

Apple, Delta Air Lines, Microsoft, Sephora, and Costco have all, to varying degrees, kept or even expanded DEI in their corporate structures, resisting pressure from the Trump administration and Republican policymakers to ditch the practice. 

Consumers' Research is directing its tens of thousands of members to call the corporate offices of these five firms to “demand they stop pushing discriminatory DEI programs.”

“Despite the public's understandable revulsion at the racist DEI agenda, these companies are choosing to double down on woke discriminatory behavior,” Consumers' Research Executive Director Will Hild wrote in the memo to members of his organization. “Examples include imposing racial hiring quotas, excluding qualified applicants from brand incubation programs because of their skin color, and conferring hefty DEI-related bonuses to executives. It is all blatant racial discrimination and should be treated as such.”

Costco has become one of the most well-known DEI stalwarts of the second Trump administration. After the corporation's shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to evaluate risks posed by its DEI efforts, it won the support of racial provocateur Al Sharpton, who called on like-minded individuals to support Costco by purchasing its goods. In addition to the shareholder vote, Costco asks its suppliers if they are “51% owned and operated by one or more” racial or sexual minorities, provides its executives with DEI-related bonuses, and funds an LGBT community center that assists children in accessing transgender procedures. 

While Costco has yet to waver publicly from its commitment to DEI, some cracks are showing in other firms flagged by Consumers' Research. Delta Air Lines, for instance, took down a webpage documenting the racial demographics of its employees following pressure from Consumers' Research.

Shortly after President Donald Trump took office for the second time, and as his administration plotted against DEI, Delta released a statement emphasizing its commitment to the ideology.

“We are steadfast in our commitments because we think that they are actually critical to our business,” Peter Carter, chief external affairs officer at Delta, said in February. “Sustainability is about being more efficient in our operations and really DE&I is about talent and that's been our focus.”

Delta's CEO has echoed similar sentiments.

In the tech sphere, Apple and Microsoft remain committed to achieving “pay equity” for their employees. Apple, similarly to Costco, advised its investors to reject a shareholder proposal to “Cease DEI Efforts” in January. 

“If ever there were a critical time for the business case for diversity and inclusion in the workplace, it is now. … Our innovation has come from our commitment to Diversity and Inclusion (D&I), and our future innovation depends on D&I,” Microsoft's chief diversity officer and corporate vice president of talent and learning, Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, wrote in October 2024.

Meanwhile, other companies, including Meta and Boeing, appear to be bending to conservative pressure by reining in corporate DEI efforts.

“In early 2025, we announced changes to our diversity programs in light of the shifting legal and policy landscape,” Meta wrote in a corporate filing after ending its DEI initiatives. “We will continue to work to build an inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve.”

Sephora is singing a different tune.

The beauty retailer boasts on its website that it seeks to become “the Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Champion in the retail industry.” To this end, it maintains a program to fast-track beauty products developed by “founders who are people of color” and has “an executive DE&I Steering Committee.”

HOW THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION INJECTED DEI INTO NUCLEAR SAFETY AND LANDSLIDE PREPAREDNESS

Consumers' Research is funded by individuals, corporations, and nonprofit foundations, including those linked to the conservative movement, such as Donors Trust and the Bradley Impact Fund.

Vice President JD Vance said the United States was “governed by complete morons” before President Donald Trump took office at a Tuesday night event during which he previewed the administration's economic vision.

“If I on Jan. 21 — in fact I did ask this question — ‘where are the biggest deficiencies in our supply chains? What are the 100 products that we're completely reliant on some other entity to make for us?'” Vance said in a conversation with American Compass founder Oren Cass.

He continued by saying the answer was “we don't know” because the prior administration didn't ask.

“What was so crazy about the hyper-globalized era is that you had these basic questions about the brittleness of our supply chains that were completely uninvestigated by the very people who supported globalizing those supply chains,” he said. “We were actually governed by complete morons, and we didn't even realize it until the Trump administration started to get underneath the hood.”

Vance made the remarks at a fifth anniversary event for American Compass, a Washington think tank with just 12 employees that counts Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio among its biggest fans.

Held at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., the gala featured Vance and Rubio as key speakers. Both outlined how economic thinking on the Right has changed since American Compass was founded five years ago.

Rubio shared the story of growing up in the 1980s amid the threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union and the effect it had when that threat vanished in 1991.

“Literally the entire world was transformed before my very eyes,” Rubio said. “We believed the Cold War was over, we won, and now the entire world was going to be just like us.”

That hasn't happened, both men agreed, and now the U.S. must focus on rebuilding its manufacturing base to shore up national security and to provide better employment for more workers. 

The federal government's focus for years was on what would be best for the global economy, according to Rubio, which has now changed under Trump's “America First” policy. 

“The number one foreign policy of the United States needs to be the United States and what's in the best interests of the United States,” he said, saying that reversing course will be one of the great challenges of the 21st century. “This is going to be the work of a generation.”

Vance, in a conversation with Cass, focused more on the domestic effects of the project.

“I just want normal people who work hard and play by the rules to have a good life,” he said. 

He credited Trump with being the first politician of the post-Cold War era to realize that globalization was not working well for most people. He credited the American electorate with knowing better than D.C.-based economists on what would be suitable for them.

Hitting on themes that have become common for him, Vance said the places that make products tend to become good at designing them, making the case that more things need to be built in the U.S.

However, he predicted that getting the country back to a commonsense economic policy will be a 20-year project.

“That's fundamentally why Donald Trump is the President of the United States. He was the first mainstream American politician to come along and say, ‘This isn't working,'” Vance said. “These trade deals are not working for the normal people who power our economy … I think the best way to summarize it is we just want normal people to have a good life.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Two Chinese nationals were charged with smuggling a “potential agroterrorism” fungus into the United States called Fusarium graminearum.

The fungus causes “head blight,” a disease associated with wheat, barley, maize, and rice that can cause billions of dollars in damage.

Yunqing Jian, 33, and Zunyong Liu, 34, who are citizens of the People's Republic of China, are also being accused of having ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

“This case is a sobering reminder that the Chinese Communist Party continues to deploy operatives and researchers to infiltrate our institutions and target our food supply, an act that could cripple our economy and endanger American lives,” FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News in a statement. “Smuggling a known agroterrorism agent into the U.S. is not just a violation of law, it's a direct threat to national security. I commend the FBI Detroit Division and our partners at CBP for stopping this biological threat before it could do real damage.”

Jian is a researcher for the University of Michigan, and Liu, Jian's boyfriend, allegedly works at a Chinese university and has done research on the fungus. Both were allegedly receiving Chinese government funding for their research.

“It is further alleged that Jian's boyfriend, Liu, works at a Chinese university where he conducts research on the same pathogen and that he first lied but then admitted to smuggling Fusarium graminearum into America — through the Detroit Metropolitan Airport — so that he could conduct research on it at the laboratory at the University of Michigan where his girlfriend, Jian, worked,” according to a DOJ press release.

“The complaint also alleges that Jian's electronics contain information describing her membership in and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party,” the release added.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the Justice Department “has no higher mission than keeping the American people safe and protecting our nation from hostile foreign actors who would do us harm.”

“Thanks to the hard work of our excellent DOJ attorneys, this defendant, who clandestinely attempted to bring a destructive substance into the United States, will face years behind bars,” she said.

Liu entered the U.S. in July 2024 with “a note in Chinese, a round piece of filter paper with a series of circles drawn on it, and four clear plastic baggies with small clumps of reddish plant material inside,” an affidavit said. When asked why they were in his bag, he said he didn't know and suggested someone else may have placed them there, before later admitting that he knew. He wasn't arrested at the time.

“LIU stated that he intentionally hid the samples in his backpack because he knew there were restrictions on the importation of the materials,” according to the complaint. “LIU confirmed that he had intentionally put the samples in a wad of tissues so CBP Officers would be less likely to find and confiscate them, and he could continue his research in the United States.”

The University of Michigan condemned any attempt to harm national security.

“We strongly condemn any actions that seek to cause harm, threaten national security, or undermine the university's critical public mission,” the school's statement said.

It continued, “It is important to note that the university has received no funding from the Chinese government in relation to research conducted by the accused individuals. We have and will continue to cooperate with federal law enforcement in its ongoing investigation and prosecution.”

VISAS OF CHINESE STUDENTS TO BE ‘AGGRESSIVELY' REVOKED, RUBIO SAYS

The charges came a week after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. would begin “aggressively” revoking Chinese students' visas.

“Under President Trump's leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,” Rubio said in a statement. “We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Andrey Kurkov's crime thrillers provide timely lessons for anyone living under an oppressive regime.

A relatively young Ukrainian state, having freed itself from Moscow's grasp, is trying to find its place as an independent nation in a changing world order. Moscow, however, decides to reclaim what it lost and sends an army to take Kyiv. An outnumbered Ukrainian force intercepts the Russian soldiers just north of the city. Ukraine's fate hangs in the balance.

This is a description not of February 2022 but of January 1918, when the Bolsheviks advanced on Kyiv to crush the Ukrainian People's Republic. The country was only months old, and fell quickly. In the ensuing two years, Kyiv changed hands multiple times among competing Tsarist, Ukrainian, Bolshevik, and German armies, but in the end, Moscow prevailed.

It is during these turbulent years that the Ukrainian author Andrey Kurkov has set his Kyiv mysteries, an ongoing series of crime novels that follows the policeman Samson Kolechko as he negotiates bandits, speculators, and roaming soldiers of various stripes in his quest to keep order amid the chaos caused by war. Kurkov's mysteries contain enough of the typical tropes of crime fiction to keep fans of the genre satisfied. There is the melancholic police officer with a traumatic origin story (Samson's father was murdered by Cossacks during the revolution); there is the long-suffering love interest (level-headed Nadezhda is the perfect foil to anxious Samson); there are eccentric villains (an ailing Belgian thief steals silver in order to make himself a new skeleton); there are chases, shootouts, and puzzles aplenty.

Kurkov's crime capers are deceptive, however. They lure you into seemingly safe generic territory only to subtly undermine your expectations. In the first novel, The Silver Bone, Samson doesn't even join the police force until about a third of the way in, leaving the reader suspended in the tense atmosphere of occupied Kyiv waiting for the story to begin. In the series' second book, The Stolen Heart, which has recently been published in Boris Dralyuk's English translation, the central crime—the illegal sale of pig meat—seems trivial, except that the Bolshevik secret police, or cheka, consider such “sabotage” punishable by death. These novels are more than detective thrillers: They are studies in the surprising ambivalence that people living under occupation may feel, even when those in power go to extraordinary lengths to cement their rule through violence, manipulation, and terror. And they are important today not just for their insight into the past but also as a guide for surviving the present.

Read: Zombie history stalks Ukraine

Samson despises the lawlessness that accompanies the breakdown of states, and he yearns for the restoration of order; less important to him is the ideology of the party in power. In a job interview with his soon-to-be commanding officer, he is asked whom he supports: the Tsarists, the Ukrainian nationalists, the German-backed government, or the “workers' regime”? He answers, “I sympathize with you.” He knows this vague answer can be interpreted as ideologically acceptable.

But the inhabitants of a police state can drift in ambivalence for only so long before they are compelled to make a moral choice. Samson realizes that arresting speculators and burglars on behalf of the Bolsheviks will not bring back the stability of his middle-class, prerevolutionary youth. Indeed, he isn't immune to the police's aggression simply because he works for them: His furniture, including his late father's beautiful writing desk, is confiscated, and two Red Army soldiers are billeted in his apartment.

There are echoes here of Kurkov's Kyivan literary predecessor, Mikhail Bulgakov, who died in 1940. Bulgakov's novel The White Guard, published in 1925 and set at the same time, is an elegy for Tsarist Kyiv that detests both Ukrainian national aspirations and Bolshevik rule. (Curiously, its theatrical adaptation was a favorite of Stalin's, a fact that kept its author employed through the terror of the 1930s.) The White Guard hinges on the contrast between the cozy bourgeois home of the Turbin family, based on Bulgakov's family home on Kyiv's most picturesque street, and the barbarism unfolding outside. In The Stolen Heart, Samson sees Red Army soldiers violently dispossessing a middle-class family on that same street. At moments like this, Samson begins to doubt his decision to serve the occupation regime: Yes, order is being established, but at what cost? And is order based on legalized violence and theft really order?

Bulgakov would have had little time for a Bolshevik lackey like Samson. His protagonists are uncompromisingly loyal to class and empire, and, in this sense, less interesting than Kurkov's more hesitant characters. As a writer born in Russia who built his career in Ukraine, Kurkov understands what it means to be caught between fiercely competing political and cultural projects (as, indeed, do several million Ukrainians living in areas now occupied by Russia). Many of Kurkov's other books examine how the instinct not to take sides often conflicts with the moral imperative to do so. The protagonist of his 1996 breakthrough novel, Death and the Penguin, for instance, naively thinks he can work for the Mafia while remaining an innocent civilian. The more recent Grey Bees, which is set in the aftermath of Russia's original assault on eastern Ukraine in 2014, revolves around the inhabitants of the no-man's-land between the Ukrainian and Russian armies and their attempts to remain neutral. In the end, keeping your head down is usually unsustainable, and Kurkov's protagonists tend, eventually, to locate their moral backbones.

In this regard, another early-20th-century influence besides Bulgakov lurks in The Stolen Heart: Mykola Khvylovy. The Ukrainian modernist died by suicide in 1933 in protest of Stalin's arrests of Ukrainian writers. His books were banned for decades, and, unlike Bulgakov's, they rarely reached the outside world in translation. His most famous story, “I (a Romance),” is about a cheka officer who discovers his mother among a group of counterrevolutionaries and is forced by his superiors to execute her. Khvylovy never did such a thing, but he did fight for the Bolsheviks during the Ukrainian wars of independence that followed the 1917 revolution, and in the end he despaired at what the Russians did to his country and his culture. The story ends with the bewildered officer trudging across the war-torn steppe into the uncertain future, haunted by the moral vacuum within.

Near the end of The Stolen Heart, Samson is ordered by a cheka officer to sign an execution warrant for the pork speculator, whom he has finally apprehended. When he refuses to do so, the officer takes Samson's hand, dips his thumb in red ink, and guides it toward the order, leaving a fingerprint in place of a signature: “The firm red thumbprint looked strange in this rectangle, like that of a criminal,” Samson reflects. That night, he awakens, weeping, from a dream in which he sits beside the coffin of a man with a seeping bullet wound. Looking at his hands, he notices that “his fingers were smeared with red ink, as if with blood. He knew it wasn't blood. The ink had a chemical scent. The red lines of the verdict issued earlier that day kept rising up in his memory, and a whisper from the darkness kept on repeating, repeating, ‘Samson, repent.'” The price of being part of the occupation bureaucracy has become clear.

Read: What Ukrainian literature has always understood about Russia

In his translator's note for The Silver Bone, Dralyuk (who handles Kurkov's wry tone and the novels' historical fabric with characteristic dexterity) writes of contemporary Ukrainians that “the Samsons of today have a far clearer sense of who they are and where they stand.” This is perhaps why Kyiv did not fall in 2022 as it did in 1918: Ukrainians understood that the “order” imposed by an occupation would come at the price of their freedom. They chose freedom, even if it brought instability, even at the cost of their safety and, for some, their life. That lesson is relevant far beyond Ukraine, wherever ordinary people face the threat of becoming cogs in the machinery of malevolent administrations.

The challenge: how to catalog and derive meaning from so much digital clutter

In February 1987, members of a queer-student group at Queens College, in New York, started jotting down their private thoughts in a communal composition book. As in a diary, each entry was signed and dated. Members wrote about parties they'd attended, speakers they wanted to invite to campus, questions they had about their sexuality. The book, now housed in an archive at the college, was also a place to vent and snipe. In November 1991, a student wrote in all caps, “I HATE QUEENS COLLEGE. I HATE HATRED. I HATE MY HAIR.” Below that, a member responded, “I hate your hair too.”

It's hard to imagine a future historian getting such an up-close glimpse into the thoughts and anxieties of the club's contemporary members. Around 2019, the group abandoned the composition books and migrated to the messaging app Discord. For students, the switch was likely a natural way to update the tradition of shared journaling. But for archivists interested in preserving the college's queer history, it caused a small panic. How would they ever sort through the sprawling chat? Whereas the journal entries required concision because page space was limited, people might be “typing a mile a minute” on Discord, Caitlin Colban-Waldron, a Queens College archivist, told me. “We were like, ‘How do we take screenshots? Is there a way to export all of their conversations in a text file?'”

Archivists across the country are confronting similar challenges. It was long the case that archives were full of physical ephemera. Think of Oscar Wilde's love letters to Lord Alfred Douglas; James Joyce's incessant lust for his future wife, Nora Barnacle (his “little fuckbird”); Sylvia Plath's shopping list; Malcolm X's lost poem; and other scraps of paper buried in boxes. Today, text messages and disappearing voice notes have replaced letters between close friends, Instagram Stories vanish by default, and encrypted platforms such as Signal, where social movements flourish, let users automatically erase messages. Many people write to-do lists in notes apps and then delete them, line by line, when each task is complete.

The problem for historians is twofold: On the one hand, celebrities, artists, executives, and social-movement leaders are generating more personal records than ever, meaning a lucky researcher might have access to a public figure's entire hard drive but struggle to interpret its contents. On the other hand, historians might lose access to the kind of intimate material that reveals the most—a possibility that has led some prognosticators to predict a coming “digital dark age.”

In some ways, archival research has always demanded sorting through verbal and visual detritus and working around unexpected gaps in records. But in the internet era, this laborious process threatens to become untenable. Our online lives will reshape not only the practice of studying history but also how future generations will tell the story of the past.

The work of history starts with a negotiation. A public figure or their descendant—or, say, an activist group or a college club—works with an institution, such as a university library, to decide which of the figure's papers, correspondence, photos, and other materials to donate. Archivists then organize these records for researchers, who, over subsequent years, physically flip through them. These tidbits are deeply valuable. They reveal crucial details about our most famous figures and important historical events. They're the gas feeding the engine of our history books.

Over the past two decades, the volume of these donations has increased dramatically. When Donald Mennerich, a digital archivist at NYU, first started working in the field, 15 years ago, writers or activists or public figures would hand over boxes of letters, notes, photos, meeting minutes, and maybe a floppy disk or a “small computer that had a gigabyte hard drive,” he told me. Now, Mennerich said, “everyone has a terabyte of data on their laptop and a 4-terabyte hard drive”—about 4,000 times as much content—plus an email inbox with 10,000 messages or more.

Read: The way we write history has changed

Processing this digital bulk is a headache. At the British Library, when a laptop arrives, Callum McKean, the library's lead digital curator, makes a master copy of the hard drive. Then archivists create a curated version that filters out sensitive information, just as they do for paper records. Various software promises to ease the work, for example by scanning an email inbox for potentially sensitive messages—bank-account details, doctor's notes, unintended sexual disclosures—but the technology isn't foolproof. Once, Mennerich was surprised to find that the tool had not redacted the phone number of a celebrity. So archivists must still review files by hand, which has “created a huge bottleneck,” McKean told me.

Now many libraries possess emails that they don't have the bandwidth to make accessible to researchers. The writer Ian McEwan's emails, although technically part of his collection at the Harry Ransom Center, in Texas, have not been processed, because of “challenges in capacity,” a spokesperson told me. The archive of the poet Wendy Cope reportedly contains a trove of emails, but they are also not yet ready for the public and still need to undergo sensitivity review, McKean said. Recently, I visited NYU to examine the activist, artist, and onetime Andy Warhol acolyte Jeremy Ayers's files, which include a collection of his emails and an archive of his Facebook account. The public description of the Ayers collection hinted at a labyrinth of insights into the late stage of his career, when he photographed scenes from Occupy Wall Street—the kind of deep look into an artist's process and social calendar that would have been unthinkable a few decades ago. But my requests to view both his emails and his Facebook account were denied; an archivist had not yet reviewed the records for sensitivity. For now, until Ayers's digital files are fully processed, which could take a while, the archive promises more access than it can deliver.

Even when an email archive is made public, as Salman Rushdie's is at Emory University and Chris Kraus's is at NYU, it's easy to get lost in the chaos. Jacquelyn Ardam, a writer and a literary scholar, was one of the first people to visit Susan Sontag's archive, which she told me was filled with digital clutter: Sephora marketing emails, files with unlabeled collections of words (rubbery, ineluctable), and lots and lots of lists—of movies she'd liked, drinks she'd enjoyed. “There was so much material,” Ardam told me, “that it was hard to make sense out of, okay, which one of these lists matters?”

Among that mess of information, however, Ardam found emails confirming Sontag's relationship with the photographer Annie Leibovitz, which Sontag had denied. All Ardam had to do to locate them was “search her computer for the word Annie,” she said. She didn't publish all of her findings about Sontag's romantic life, in part because they were so intimate.

Ardam was confronting a different, somewhat sensitive question about navigating a person's digital history. When Sontag donated her laptop to the archive, did she realize how much she was giving away? In the past, even a writer of Sontag's stature would typically have a small-enough correspondence collection that they could plausibly review the letters they were planning to donate to an archive—and perhaps wouldn't have included missives from a secret lover. But the scope of our digital lives can make it much harder to account for everything (imagine giving up your whole social-media history to a researcher) and much easier for a historian to locate the tantalizing parts with a single search.

Read: Gen Z never learned to read cursive

Of course, that's if historians are lucky enough to access records at all. Many people delete their old texts to save storage space; with each swipe, years of correspondence might disappear. And even if they are saved, digital records are sometimes impossible to retrieve. Colban-Waldron, the Queens College archivist, told me about a visual artist who'd donated a word processor that simply doesn't turn on. Mennerich said he's been locked out of the email accounts of several deceased public figures because they never shared their passwords.

Problems multiply when you run into information stored on third-party platforms. If you don't pay for Slack, for example, your messages will automatically delete after 90 days. Google Docs don't self-delete, but you can view version histories and resolved comments only on the platform itself, which poses a risk if Google Docs ever shuts down or stops supporting older documents. Whereas Toni Morrison's extensive notes on Angela Davis's autobiography have been preserved on paper for years, newer back-and-forths between editors and writers might disappear into the digital void.

Archivists might be able to sidestep some of these problems by rethinking how they present collections of digital records. Today, after archivists do their initial review of a collection, visitors can typically get a complete box of someone's letters with no questions asked. With emails, conducting that whole initial review up front would be so much more time intensive that blanket access might no longer be realistic. McKean suggested that someone's complete email archive could be reduced down to metadata specifying whom they wrote to and when, and uploaded online. Researchers could then request specific conversations, and the archive could conduct a sensitivity review of those specific emails before releasing them, rather than tackling whole computers at once. Such a system might strip the archive of its potential for serendipitous findings. And it might disperse the complex ethical task of deciding what should (and should not) be released to multiple different archivists, who might have their own biases. But compromises like these might be unavoidable in an era of such inscrutable excess.

A laptop donation might actually be the easy scenario. The archivists I spoke with told me they're all bracing themselves for the moment when, inevitably, a public figure donates their smartphone. It is in some ways the most personal kind of donation someone can make, offering access to text and WhatsApp histories, photos, Tinder messages, saved recipes, TikTok likes. Such a donation seems both likely to reveal more than a person's emails ever could and even harder to sort through and interpret. Archivists might want to stock up on the Excedrin now. As for historians, they might be in for more revealing discoveries—if only they can separate the signal from the noise.

History is repeating itself in the world of controversial sports records.

It was a travesty—two travesties, actually, separate but inextricably linked. In May 1953, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the summit of Mount Everest, a challenge that had killed more than a dozen people in the preceding decades and that scientists had once declared impossible. The catch: They breathed canisters of pure oxygen, an aid that the Everest pioneer George Mallory—one of those who died on the mountain—had once dismissed as “a damnable heresy.”

A month later, a young British medical trainee named Roger Bannister just missed running the first sub-four-minute mile, another long-standing barrier sometimes dubbed “Everest on the track.” But he did it in a race where his training partner let himself be lapped in order to pace Bannister all the way to the finish line, violating rules about fair play due to the advantages of pacing. Bannister's American rival, Wes Santee, was unimpressed. “Maybe I could run a four-minute mile behind one of my father's ranch horses,” he said, “if that's what you want.”

Funny how history repeats itself. Fast-forward to a couple of weeks ago: A controversy erupted in the world of mountaineering, when four British climbers summited Everest just five days after jetting to Nepal from the United Kingdom. To skip the usual weeks or months spent gradually adjusting to high altitude, they paid a reported $153,000 each for a bespoke protocol that included inhaling xenon gas to help them adjust more rapidly. Meanwhile, on the track, Kenya's three-time Olympic champion, Faith Kipyegon, is preparing for a carefully choreographed, Nike-sponsored attempt to become the first woman to run a mile in under four minutes. It's slated for June 26 in Paris and will almost certainly violate the same pacing rules that Bannister's run did.

Both initiatives are, by any measure, remarkable feats of human ingenuity and endurance. They're also making people very angry.

The xenon-fueled expedition was organized by an Austrian guide named Lukas Furtenbach, who is known for his tech-focused approach to expeditions. He has previously had clients sleep in altitude tents at home for weeks to pre-acclimatize them to the thin mountain air. What made the new ascent different is that, in addition to sleeping in altitude tents, the four British climbers visited a clinic in Germany where they inhaled xenon gas, whose oxygen-boosting potential has been rumored for years. The World Anti-Doping Agency banned xenon in 2014 after allegations that Russian athletes used it for that year's Winter Olympics. But subsequent studies on its athletic effects have produced mixed results. Other research in animals has hinted at the possibility that it could offer protection from potentially fatal forms of altitude illness, which can occur when climbers ascend too rapidly. For now, the strongest evidence that it helps high-altitude mountaineers comes from Furtenbach's own self-experimentation over the past few years.

When news of Furtenbach's plans emerged earlier this year, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation's medical commission put out a statement arguing that xenon probably doesn't work and could be dangerous because of its sedative effects. Other critics have pointed out that shorter expeditions mean less paying work for the Sherpa guides in the region. But these criticisms can feel like post hoc justifications for the fact that many mountaineers simply have a gut-level aversion to what seems like a shortcut to the summit. Their objection isn't to xenon itself but to the idea of making Everest easier.

That's the same problem many runners have with Kipyegon's sub-four-minute-mile attempt. Women have made extraordinary progress in the event since Diane Leather notched the first sub-five in 1954, but under conventional racing conditions, no one expects a sub-four anytime soon. Kipyegon is the fastest female miler in history: Her current world record, set in 2023, is 4:07.64, which leaves her more than 50 yards behind four-minute pace—an enormous deficit to overcome in a sport where, at the professional level, progress is measured in fractions of a second. Nike has promised “a holistic system of support that optimizes every aspect of her attempt,” including “footwear, apparel, aerodynamics, physiology and mind science,” but hasn't revealed any details of what that support might look like. That means critics—and there are many—don't yet have any specific innovation to object to; they just have the tautological sense that any intervention capable of instantly making a miler 7.7 seconds faster must by definition be unfair. (I reached out to Nike for further specifics about the attempt, but the company declined to comment.)

It's a safe bet that new shoes will be involved. Kipyegon's effort, dubbed Breaking4 by Nike, is a sequel to the company's Breaking2 marathon in 2017, in which Kipyegon's fellow Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge came within 25 seconds of breaking two hours at a time when the official world record was 2:02:57. Kipchoge's feat was made possible in part by a new type of running shoe featuring a stiff carbon-fiber plate embedded in a thick and bouncy foam midsole, an innovation that has since revolutionized the sport. But the reason his time didn't count as a world record was that, like Bannister, he had a squad of pacers who rotated in and out to block the wind for him all the way to the finish line. That's also likely to be a key for Kipyegon. In fact, scientists published an analysis earlier this year suggesting that a similar drafting approach would be enough to take Kipyegon all the way from 4:07 to 3:59 without any other aids.

Bannister's paced-time trial in 1953 was ruled ineligible for records because, per the British Amateur Athletic Board, it wasn't “a bona fide competition according to the rules.” Still, the effort had served its purpose. “Only two painful seconds now separated me from the four-minute mile,” Bannister later wrote, “and I was certain that I could cut down the time.” Sure enough, less than a year later, Bannister entered the history books with a record-legal 3:59.4. Similarly, Kipchoge went on to break two hours in another exhibition race in 2019, and Nike's official line is that it hopes that feat will pave the way for a record-legal sub-two in the future. (It's certainly getting closer: The world record now stands at 2:00:35.) In 1978, a quarter century after Hillary and Norgay's historic ascent, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler climbed Everest without supplemental oxygen.

One view of innovation in sports, advanced by the bioethicist Thomas Murray, is that people's perceptions are shaped by how new ideas and techniques are introduced. The status quo always seems reasonable: Of course we play tennis with graphite rackets rather than wooden ones, use the head-first Fosbury flop to clear high-jump bars, and climb mountains with the slightly stretchable kernmantle ropes developed in the 1950s. But many of these same innovations seem more troublesome during the transition periods, especially if only some people have access to them.

When Bannister finally broke the four-minute barrier, he was once again paced by his training partners, but only for about the first three-quarters of the race. This form of pacing remained highly controversial, but because none of the pacemakers had deliberately allowed himself to be lapped, the record was allowed to stand. These days, such pacing is so routine that there are runners who make a living doing nothing but pacing races for others, always dropping out before the finish. The full-race pacing that Kipyegon will likely use in Breaking4 remains verboten; the slightly different pacing that leads runners almost all the way through the race but forces them to run the last lap alone is simply business as usual. Oxygen in a can is good; xenon in a can is bad. These are subtle distinctions.

Sports are, in at least some respects, a zero-sum game: When one person wins a race or sets a record, it unavoidably means that someone else doesn't. Even at the recreational level, if everyone decides to run marathons in carbon-plated shoes that make them five minutes faster, the standards needed to qualify for the Boston Marathon get five minutes faster. “Once an effective technology gets adopted in a sport, it becomes tyrannical,” Murray told me several years ago, when I was writing about athletes experimenting with electric brain stimulation. “You have to use it.” In the '50s, a version of that rationale seemed to help the British expedition that included Hillary and Norgay overcome the long-standing objections of British climbers to using oxygen—the French had an Everest expedition planned for 1954 and the Swiss for 1955, and both were expected to use oxygen.

Less clear, though, is why this rationale should apply to the modern world of recreational mountaineering in which Furtenbach operates. What does anyone—other than perhaps the climbers themselves, if you think journeys trump destinations—lose when people huff xenon in order to check Everest off their list with maximal efficiency? Maybe they're making the mountain more crowded, but you could also argue that they're making it less crowded by getting up and down more quickly. And it's hard to imagine that Furtenbach's critics are truly lying awake at night worrying about the long-term health of his clients.

Something else is going on here, and I'd venture that it has to do with human psychology. A Dutch economist named Adriaan Kalwij has a theory that much of modern life is shaped by people's somewhat pathological tendency to view everything as a competition. “Both by nature and through institutional design, competitions are an integral part of human lives,” Kalwij writes, “from college entrance exams and scholarship applications to jobs, promotions, contracts, and awards.” The same ethos seems to color the way we see dating, leisure travel, hobbies, and so on: There's no escape from the zero-sum dichotomy of winners and losers.

Kalwij's smoking gun is a phenomenon that sociologists call the “SES-health gradient,” which refers to the disparities in health between people of high and low socioeconomic status. Despite the rise of welfare supports such as pensions and health care, the SES-health gradient has been widening around the world—even, Kalwij has found, among Olympic athletes. There used to be no difference in longevity among Dutch Olympians based on their occupation. But among the most recent cohort, born between 1920 and 1947, athletes in high-SES jobs, such as lawyers, tend to outlive athletes in low-SES jobs by an average of 11 years. As Kalwij interprets it, making an Olympic team is a life-defining win, but getting stuck in a poorly paying dead-end job is a loss that begets an endless series of other losses: driving a beater, living in a lousy apartment, flying economy. These losses have cumulative psychological and physiological consequences.

Some things in life really are competitions, of course. Track and field is one of them, and so we should police attempts to bend its rules with vigilance. Other things, such as being guided up Everest, are not—or at least they shouldn't be. The people who seem most upset about the idea of rich bros crushing Everest in a week are those who have climbed it in six or eight or 12 weeks, whose place in the cosmic pecking order has been downgraded by an infinitesimal notch. But I, too, was annoyed when I read about it, despite the fact that I've never strapped on a crampon. Their win, in some convoluted way, felt like my loss.

Another detail in Kalwij's research sticks in my mind. Among American Olympians, silver medalists tend to die a few years earlier than either gold or bronze medalists. Kalwij theorizes that these results, too, are related to people's outlook. Gold medalists are thrilled to win, and bronze medalists are thrilled to make the podium; silver medalists see themselves as “the No. 1 loser,” as Jerry Seinfeld once put it. With that in mind, I've tried to reframe my attitude about the xenon controversy. Let the annual Everest frenzy continue, with or without xenon, and let its allure continue to draw the most hard-edged and deep-pocketed summit baggers. Meanwhile, leave the other, lesser-known mountains for the rest of us to enjoy in tranquility. I'd call that a win.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Acing an intelligence test only counts for so much.

Who has the highest IQ in history? One answer would be: a 10-year-old girl from Missouri. In 1956, according to lore, she took a version of the Stanford-Binet IQ test and recorded a mental age of 22 years and 10 months, equivalent to an IQ north of 220. (The minimum score needed to get into Mensa is 132 or 148, depending on the test, and the average IQ in the general population is 100.) Her result lay unnoticed for decades, until it turned up in The Guinness Book of World Records, which lauded her as having the highest childhood score ever. Her name, appropriately enough, was Marilyn vos Savant. And she was, by the most common yardstick, a genius.

I've been thinking about which people attract the genius label for the past few years, because it's so clearly a political judgment. You can tell what a culture values by who it labels a genius—and also what it is prepared to tolerate. The Renaissance had its great artists. The Romantics lionized androgynous, tubercular poets. Today we are in thrall to tech innovators and brilliant jerks in Silicon Valley.

Vos Savant hasn't made any scientific breakthroughs or created a masterpiece. She graduated 178th in her high-school class of 613, according to a 1989 profile in New York magazine. She married at 16, had two children by 19, became a stay-at-home mother, and was divorced in her 20s. She tried to study philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, but did not graduate. She married again and was divorced again at 35. She became a puzzle enthusiast, joined a high-IQ society, and occasionally wrote an essay or a satirical piece under a pen name for a newspaper. Mostly, she devoted herself to raising her boys.

That all changed in 1985, when The Guinness Book of World Records published her childhood IQ score. How its authors obtained the record is murky: An acquaintance once told the Financial Times that he'd urged her to submit her result as a way of making her famous.

Read: How smart people actually talk about themselves

Thanks to all the publicity, vos Savant met her third husband, Robert Jarvik, who had developed a pioneering model of an artificial heart. Jarvik had his own story of being overlooked: Before ultimately enrolling in medical school at the University of Utah, he had been rejected by 15 other institutions. He tracked down vos Savant after seeing her on the cover of an airline magazine, and she agreed to a date after finding a picture of him taken by Annie Leibovitz. They quickly became an item, and eventually took up residence in New York.

At their 1987 wedding, the rings were made of gold and pyrolytic carbon, a material used in Jarvik's artificial heart. The science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov gave away the bride. A news report has them telling their guests that they were relieved to meet each other, because they found most people difficult to talk to—the implication being that mere mortals were not on their wavelength. The honeymoon would be spent in Paris, they revealed; vos Savant would write a screenplay for a futuristic satire, and Jarvik would continue researching his “grand unification theory” of physics. Yet despite their superior brains, vos Savant's screenplay was never made into a film, and Jarvik—who, according to a New York profile of the couple, thought the Big Bang theory was “wrong” and the theory of relativity was “probably wrong”—did not revolutionize physics.

What did happen, though, is that on the back of her anointment in Guinness, vos Savant built a career as a professional genius. She wrote books such as the Omni I.Q. Quiz Contest and Brain Building in Just 12 Weeks. Billing her as “the smartest person in the world,” Parade magazine gave her an advice column, where she answered readers' queries and published puzzles. (She didn't respond to my attempts to contact her through the magazine.) Her specialty was logic problems—which showcase the particular type of mental ability most readily identified by IQ tests. In one column, she provided a solution for an apparently insoluble conundrum, the Monty Hall problem. Angry readers wrote in to correct her, but she stood firm.

Vos Savant's life perfectly illustrates how genius can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. She was a housewife raising her children in total obscurity, until she was labeled a genius. And then she became one.

She embodied what I call the “genius myth,” the idea that humanity contains a special sort of person, what Samuel Johnson's dictionary defined in 1755 as “a man endowed with superiour faculties.”

Seeing yourself as such can be poisonous: Think of the public intellectuals who embarrass themselves by straying far from their area of expertise. Think of the smart people who twist logic in impressive ways to convince themselves of crankish ideas. Think of, say, a man who has had great success in business, who decides that means he must be equally good at cutting government bureaucracy. One of the cruelest things about the genius myth is that its sufferers cannot understand their failures: I'm so clever. I can't possibly have screwed this up. I prefer to talk about moments of genius: beautiful paintings, heartbreaking novels, inspired military or political decisions, scientific breakthroughs, technological marvels.

Nowhere are the downsides of the genius myth more obvious than in ultrahigh-IQ societies. I don't mean Mensa, which began in England after the Second World War; it asks only that members are drawn from the top 2 percent of the population. Even more rarified are groups such as the Mega Society, which was limited to people with “one-in-a-million” intelligence. Vos Savant made the cut.

The funny thing about ultrahigh-IQ groups is that they quarrel and schism with a frequency otherwise reserved for doomsday cults and fringe political movements. An exhaustive online history of the high-IQ movement, compiled by the blogger Darryl Miyaguchi in the 1990s, recounts the story of the Cincinnatus Society, which admitted only those with an IQ higher than 99.9 percent of the population. It usurped a previous group with the same criteria, called the Triple Nine Society, which was itself a breakaway faction from another group, the International Society for Philosophical Enquiry.

From the start, Mega was riven by infighting. In the 1990s, it merged with another society and announced that members would have to retake the entry test. This prompted something close to a civil war, and by 2003, the various factions in the high-IQ movement were so splintered that a dispute over who could use the group's name ended up in court.

The loser in that case, Christopher Langan, has a Facebook group where he outlines his “Cognitive Theoretical Model of the Universe,” as well as his belief that George W. Bush staged the 9/11 attacks to stop people from learning about Langan's cognitive-theoretical model of the universe. In another post, he wrote that humanity was failing because “rich libtards” were “pandering like two-dollar whores to the degenerate tastes, preferences, and delusions of the genetic underclass, the future of humanity be damned.” Is Langan smart? Yes. Is he insightful about humanity, or at least fun to be around? Perhaps not.

Another onetime member of Mega was Keith Raniere, whose local paper, the Albany Times Union, claimed in 1988 that his self-administered test proved his intellect was “one in 10 million.” In 2020, he was sentenced to 120 years in prison over the abuse he perpetrated as the leader of a cult called NXIVM. This operated according to a “master and slave” hierarchy in which no one ranked higher than Raniere, who was known as “Vanguard.” Some of NXIVM's disciples were branded with Raniere's initials. (Prosecutors also branded the group a pyramid scheme.)

As the cult collapsed, many of Raniere's early claims to genius came under new scrutiny. Had he really learned to read the word homogenized off a milk carton at age 2, and understood quantum physics by 4, as a news reporter had suggested in 1988—and was he also an avid juggler who needed only “two to four hours of sleep”? People began to wonder, and then noticed something potentially important: The Mega test was not supervised, could be taken at home, and had no time limit. Draw your own conclusions.

Today, because of their infighting and their members' lack of worldly success, high-IQ groups have become kind of a joke. But their history helps illuminate why intelligence alone does not necessarily yield sublime works. In the 1980s, when some of these groups' members were asked to propose a term for the intangible quality that distinguished them from everyone else, none chose genius, according to a contemporaneous account by Grady Towers, a stalwart of the high-IQ community. “When asked what it should be called, they produced a number of suggestions, sometimes esoteric, sometimes witty, and often remarkably vulgar,” Towers wrote in 1987. “But one term was suggested independently again and again. Many thought that the most appropriate term for people like themselves was Outsider.”

Towers believed that those with unusually high intelligence fell into three groups: the well-adjusted middle class, who were able to use their talents; those living marginal lives, working in manual or low-paid jobs and reading textbooks by night; and finally the dropouts, whose families had had no idea how to support their brilliant children, and might have gone so far as to treat them as a “performing animal, or even an experiment.”

The first group did not get involved with high-IQ societies, Towers thought, because their intellectual and social lives were already full. “It's the exceptionally gifted adult who feels stifled that stands most in need of a high IQ society,” he wrote, adding that “none of these groups is willing to acknowledge or come to terms with the fact that much of their membership belong to the psychological walking wounded.”

The predominance of the lonely, frustrated, and socially awkward in ultrahigh-IQ societies was enough, he wrote, “to explain the constant schisms that develop, the frequent vendettas, and the mediocre level of their publications. But those are not immutable facts; they can be changed. And the first step in doing so is to see ourselves as we are.”

Grady Towers was murdered on March 20, 2000, while investigating a break-in at the park in Arizona where he worked as a security guard. He was 55.

In 1990, The Guinness Book of World Records retired the highest-IQ category, conceding that no definitive ranking was possible, given the limitations of and the variation among the available tests. This new mood of caution means that vos Savant's Guinness record will remain untouched. If, that is, it was a record at all—critics have been arguing about the validity of her result for decades.

Why does the superlative matter? Because vos Savant couldn't and wouldn't have become a “genius” without the label being pinned on her first. Attention was paid, and then more attention followed, because if people were looking, then there must have been something worth looking at, surely. That should make us wonder if the same process happens in reverse. Do children who struggle at school get the message that they aren't “academic,” and lose interest and enthusiasm?

By thinking about IQ, I was venturing into one of the most bitter battles in 20th-century social science. In the decades following the development of standardized tests, the “IQ wars” pitted two factions against each other: the environmentalists and the hereditarians. The first believed that IQ was entirely or largely influenced by surroundings—childhood nutrition, schooling, and so on—and the second argued that IQ was largely determined by genes. In America, these became synonymous with two extreme positions: hard-left advocacy for pure blank-slatism and far-right belief in racial hierarchy.

The hereditarians were tainted by the fact that so many of them dabbled in the murky waters of race and IQ—extrapolating beyond the observed differences in average IQ scores across various countries to the suggestion that white people are innately and immutably smarter than Black people. One example would be the Nobel Prize–winning engineer William Shockley, who followed what now seems a very modern trajectory: years of real achievements, including his involvement in the invention of the transistor, followed by a second career of provocative statements and complaints about what we would now call “cancellation.” Shockley's views on white racial superiority were coupled with his advocacy for eugenics. In a 1980 interview with Playboy, he argued that people with “defective” genes should be paid not to reproduce. As he put it: “$30,000 put into a trust for a 70 IQ-moron, who might otherwise produce 20 children, might make the plan very profitable to the taxpayer.”

But the environmentalists went too far in their claims too. Most geneticists now acknowledge that IQ is partially heritable, even though progressive activists attack almost anyone who says so out loud. When the geneticist Kathryn Paige Harden began to advance the arguments she would later turn into her 2021 book, The Genetic Lottery—which argued for social equality but conceded that genes influence educational attainment—The New Yorker reported that she was subjected to “parades of arguments and counterarguments, leaked personal e-mails, and levels of sustained podcasting that were, by anyone's standards, extreme.”

Fascinated by the dangerous allure of IQ—its promise to provide a definitive ranking of human intellectual worth—I decided to sit for an IQ test myself. At the exam site, I was one of two dozen adults, plus a couple of children. One was reading a book called Why the West Rules—For Now, which didn't assuage my worries about the political overtones of this debate.

The question of what exactly IQ tests measure—and how accurately they can deliver judgment—is one that's wrapped around inflammatory questions about group identity, as well as a lively policy debate about the best system of schooling. It is no accident that so many IQ researchers have ended up endorsing scientific racism or sexism. If humans can be reduced to a number, and some numbers are higher than others, it is not a long walk to decide that some humans are “better” than others too. In 2018, Christopher Langan wrote an obituary for Koko, a celebrated gorilla that he said could sign 1,000 words and therefore had an IQ between 75 and 95. “Koko's elevated level of thought would have been all but incomprehensible to nearly half the population of Somalia (average IQ 68),” Langan wrote on Facebook, citing dubious research about that African country. “Obviously, this raises a question: Why is Western civilization not admitting gorillas? They too are from Africa, and probably have a group mean IQ at least equal to that of Somalia.”

Langan was featured in Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers, which attributed his lack of academic success to his chaotic, violent upbringing and the reluctance of educational authorities to extend him the same sort of grace and understanding a middle-class child might receive. But Langan has found other answers for why he did not fulfill the glorious destiny written in his genes. He blames affirmative action and a society controlled by “globalists” and “banksters.” Inevitably, he has a Substack.

As for me, I took two IQ tests that day. The first was a test designed in 1949 to be “culture fair,” meaning that there were no language- or logic-based questions, only shape rotation. What became immediately apparent is that the test selects heavily for speed. The strict time limits mean you simply don't have time to luxuriate over questions, turning them over in your head. Now, you could argue that quickly grasping concepts is exactly what intelligence is. But you'd also have to admit that some of history's greatest breakthroughs came from years of careful observation and rumination.

That first test convinced me that whatever an IQ test is measuring, it can't be genius—that label we are so keen to bestow on people with singular achievements. It doesn't measure showing up day after day. It doesn't measure the ego necessary to insist that you're right and everyone else is wrong. And it doesn't measure the ability to market yourself as the spirit of the age.

The second test was more recent, having been updated in 1993, and leaned heavily into verbal reasoning. What I noticed here, first, was how arguable some of these questions were. Is idle a synonym for inactive or a synonym for lazy? Both, surely—it can be used as a pure descriptor, as in “an idle engine,” or to convey a value judgment, as in “the idle rich.” My desire to argue with the test maker only increased in the analogies section, where the example given was: “Trousers are to boy as skirt is to … ?” The supervisor read this out with some embarrassment, assuring us that the language was “traditional.”

Things got worse. The logic puzzles in the final section included one about an explorer who might have been eaten by either lions or “savages.” Another question asked me to work out what my surname would be, based on clues about family relationships, and clearly rested on the assumption that women all took their husband's name, and so would their children. Full of feminist zeal, I prissily ticked the box labeled “It is not possible to know what my surname is” and resigned myself to losing points.

What were my results? Sorry—I'm not saying; we already know I'm not a genius, but I'm not an outsider either, so they don't matter. My time researching Langan, Raniere, and the others convinced me that IQ testing has narrow scientific uses, but it is a false god.

Vos Savant, who is now 78, made a career of being the smartest person alive, because she had a number to prove it. Once she was hailed as a genius, vos Savant was one. Nothing about her changed, but her life did. As big a brain as Stephen Hawking had little time for this kind of thinking. In a 2004 Q&A with The New York Times Magazine, the physicist was asked what his IQ was. “I have no idea,” he replied. “People who boast about their IQ are losers.”

How Trump is bullying the media and why it's working

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

On this episode of The David Frum Show, The Atlantic's David Frum opens with a warning about how Donald Trump's second term has brought a more systematic and punishing assault on American media, through regulatory pressure, retaliatory lawsuits, and corporate intimidation.

Then David is joined by the legendary newspaper editor Marty Baron to discuss how today's media institutions are struggling to stand up to power. Baron reflects on his tenure at The Washington Post, the new pressures facing owners such as Jeff Bezos, and how Trump has turned retribution into official policy. They also examine how internal newsroom culture, social media, and a loss of connection to working-class America have weakened public trust in journalism.

David closes the episode by reflecting on the recent media overhyping of President Joe Biden's age issues.

David Frum: Hello, and welcome to Episode 9 of The David Frum Show. I'm David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. Today, I'll be joined by Marty Baron, formerly executive editor of The Washington Post during the first Trump term and during the transition of ownership at The Washington Post from the Graham family that had led it through so many years to new ownership under Jeff Bezos.

Marty Baron is one of the most important media leaders of our time and has spoken forcefully, both in person and in his memoir, Collision of Power, about the threats to free press and the responsibilities of that press. I'll finish the episode with some thoughts about the way the media have covered the old age and infirmity of former President Joe Biden. But let me begin by addressing this larger topic of press freedom and press responsibility in the second Trump term.

President Trump began his campaign and has spent much of his first term attacking the media, coining phrases, calling the free media enemies of the people, enemies of the state, and huffing and puffing and complaining, and generally persecuting and often inciting dangerous threats against individual members of the press.

If you covered the Trump presidency in that first term, especially if you were a woman, you suddenly found yourself being attacked, both digitally and often in person, in ways unlike anything ever seen before: death threats, harassment, abuse, anti-Semitic and misogynistic, racist—the worst kind of garbage. I even got a little splash of myself. I had an FBI man come to the house to warn my wife that there had been some threats against me. The Atlantic is kind of high-toned, and I think a lot of the people who make the worst threats don't read The Atlantic, and so we get spared to some degree, but it was nasty. But it was also mostly ineffective.

The press worked during the first Trump term. Institutions like The Atlantic, like The New York Times, like The Washington Post, like CNN kept bringing to light important stories about what the Trump presidency was doing, about corruption, about ties to Russia, about many things that people needed to know. And while their lives were much more difficult than they had been in the past, and while the pressures on them were real, it did not, in the end, detract from getting the job done, for the most part, in the first Trump term.

In the second Trump term, things have been different. President Trump has been much more systematic, much more deliberate, much more sustained, and much more effective in putting pressure on America's free media. He does it by squeezing the corporate parents of media institutions, making it clear that mergers of the upstream parent will not be allowed or will be harassed or even illegally prevented in some way, unless those institutions change the way that their reporting arms behave themselves.

And we have seen media people end up paying what look very much like inducements, material inducements, to Trump. Amazon, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, paid millions of dollars for the rights to make a Melania documentary, money it has to know it will never see back for a documentary that will probably never be produced. ABC paid millions of dollars directly to President Trump's so-called library, but really to himself, because of pressure put upon the Disney Corporation, ABC's corporate parent. CBS offered a settlement to Trump for an even more vexatious and absurd lawsuit: Trump complained that he didn't like the way they edited an interview with Kamala Harris—which, So what? You don't like our editing? You have no claim on that. That gives you no right of due action. I mean, send us a letter if you don't like the editing. And other people don't like the editing of the interview we did with you; that's not lawsuit material.

The Atlantic, too, after our Signal story, a that reported that our editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, had been added to what should have been a more sensitive discussion of a military operation in Yemen: In addition to the usual concerns for accuracy that, of course, we had, we knew that there was a chance that the federal government under President Trump would pursue some sort of baseless, legal retaliatory action against us, and we had to fear that in a way that probably in another time we would not have had to fear.

So there are real things to worry about, and they're not just specific to Trump. We've seen other people in American politics do the same. When Ron DeSantis was governor of Florida—or he is the governor of Florida. When he was running for president, he made one of his signature issues threatening the Disney Corporation for exercising its free-speech rights to comment on some of his social legislation by stripping them of various business privileges that they had long had and punishing the corporate parent for exercises of corporate free speech, because Disney was unhappy that the DeSantis administration was penalizing what they saw as the free-expression rights of gay and lesbian people in the state of Florida. So DeSantis took the Trump path. In the end, it didn't do him any good, but Disney still took the blow.

We have seen this kind of acceleration of new kinds of threats, and they're working because media institutions of the traditional kind are more vulnerable than they ever used to be before. Look—the companies that were powerful in 1972 are a lot less powerful in 2025, but they remain the main sources of dispassionate, fact-checked, accurate information about the events of the day. New media does not see that as its mission, but the old media do. But because they've been losing audience share, because they're less wealthy than they used to be, they're subject to various kinds of pressure, and those pressures are being imposed on them with real-world consequences for all of us.

Meanwhile, the whole mental landscape is being altered by the rise of different kinds of media institutions. TikTok has to be regarded as the most important media company in America today, alongside Facebook and other social-media platforms. These are shaping the minds and mentalities of Americans, especially Americans under 40, especially those Americans who are not closely involved with the political process, and so whose votes are maybe more up for grabs and are therefore some of the most valuable voters to politicians. We have a new kind of landscape, and it's one that we all have to navigate with great care and one in which our responsibilities as citizens are as much at stake as our rights as citizens.

The information landscape is being reshaped, and Trump is abusing the powers of state in this new landscape to hasten the reshaping in ways favorable to him. Congress passed a law putting TikTok out of business. The Supreme Court approved that law. Trump has postponed enforcing the law long past all the deadlines that were supposed to be there, because he likes the way TikTok covers him. Remember, one of the rules of authoritarianism is: The protection for the culpable is as much a resource for the authoritarian as harassment of the innocent.

The goal and end state of all of these evolutions, of these pressures, of these changes in the media landscape is to create a world—or create an America—in which nobody will know anything that can be relied upon and shared with neighbors. Instead of knowledge informing our politics, our politics will inform our knowledge.

Now, there's no ready answer to this, but each of us as an individual has a power to do something about it, to be a better consumer of news, to be a wiser user, to read more carefully, to question more of what we see, to fortify our immunities against the coming wage of AI-fed distortion that is surely on its way.

It's going to be a different kind of country, different kind of way of processing information. But the task of democracy and the challenge of democracy remains eternal, even as the challenges and threats change. And we're all going to have to step up and be the best kind of citizens, the best-informed citizens that we know how to be, even as it becomes more difficult in the face of authoritarian pressure and new technology.

And now my dialogue with Marty Baron, formerly editor of The Washington Post. But first, a quick break.

[Music]

Frum: Marty Baron is a newspaper editor whose real-life story inspired an Academy Award–winning movie. After reporting for the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times, he was appointed executive editor of the Miami Herald. From Miami, he moved to Boston, where he led the Boston Globe's coverage of sex-abuse cover-ups in the Catholic Church. That coverage won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 and inspired the 2015 movie Spotlight.

In 2013, Marty Baron moved to The Washington Post. He led the paper through its purchase by Jeff Bezos and through the first Trump term, winning more accolades and prizes for himself and his reporters along the way.

He retired in 2021 and published his memoir, Collision of Power, in 2023. Marty, thank you so much for joining the program today.

Martin Baron: Thanks for inviting me, David.

Frum: All right, so we've got some things to cover, and we've talked about what those might be, but let me start off with a straightforward question: If you were editing The Washington Post today, do you think you'd keep your job?

Baron: (Laughs.) I think I would, actually, because I think I did a good job while I was there, and I think that was appreciated and I was supported by the owner and the publisher at the time. Obviously, some things have changed. But I think it would be very risky for them to fire me.

And the news department continues to maintain its independence from the owner. The owner has not interfered in the news coverage, as far as I know. And I think all of us would know, because there would be an explosive reaction within the newsroom if he had interfered. So yes, I think I would keep my job.

Frum: It's a major theme of your memoir, Collision of Power, that first-term Trump tried to pressure The Washington Post's new owner, Jeff Bezos, into submission, and that Bezos consistently and courageously resisted. Bezos paid a price for this. Amazon lost a $10 billion contract with the federal government because of Trump's unhappiness with The Washington Post coverage.

Amazon and the Post don't have a relationship, but Bezos is the owner of both. They're the largest shareholder in Amazon and [he's] the sole owner of the Post. Second-term Trump seems much more deliberate, methodical, purposeful, and effective in his pressures on the Post and other media institutions. And this time, he also seems more successful, and not just with the Post but with many others. I described in my opening monologue some of the other cases—CBS, ABC. What are media owners so afraid of?

Baron: Well, I think what they're afraid of is they're afraid of being made a target by Trump, that he's going to do severe damage to their other commercial interests. I think in the case of Bezos, he's afraid of the impact that Trump can have on Amazon, which has enormous contracts—particularly in the area of cloud-computing services—with the federal government.

And he has a private, commercial space venture called Blue Origin, which had fallen well behind SpaceX, the Elon Musk company, but was at the point of launching a rocket into orbit and then being able to start to compete, really, with SpaceX. It has now launched that rocket successfully into orbit. But it's highly dependent on contracts with the federal government, and I think that's true of the other companies as well, the parent companies of CBS and ABC. So in the case of ABC, Disney depends on the federal government for approval of mergers and things like that, and does not want to be in conflict with the president of the United States. And of course, Paramount, which owns CBS, wants to execute a merger with Skydance, and that requires approval by the FCC.

Frum: You know, you've had a long and storied career through many, many different institutions, and I'm sure along the way, you have observed close-up and directly how angry mayors, governors, and presidents and members of Congress can get at media coverage. And there's always a lot of huffing and puffing and bluster and anger. What is happening since the election in 2024 seems qualitatively different from anything that I've observed. Is that your observation?

Baron: Well, absolutely. Look—I mean, Trump, during his campaign, promised to seek retribution on his perceived political enemies. That's what he's doing right now. You can see that, of course, in his attacks on law firms that have represented individuals and institutions that were opposed to him, seeking to bar them from access to federal-government buildings, seeking to deny them any contracts with the federal government—basically, punish them in every conceivable way—and really, he's seeking to destroy those law firms. The same applies to universities, first with Columbia University and then now with Harvard, of course. You can see that he's applying all of the not just threats, but actually, use of force and denying billions of dollars in grants to Harvard in an effort to force them to submit to his wishes.

So that's what's happening. It's qualitatively different from what we've seen before. And of course, the federal government has enormous power. And Trump is exercising that power—actually, not just exercising it; he's abusing it.

Frum: Why is it so much more effective now? One of the semi-remembered details of the Watergate scandal was that President Richard Nixon tried to put pressure on The Washington Post at that time because the Post was then seeking permission, or the Graham family was seeking permission, to acquire some radio stations, which required FCC approval. And there's a famous crude quote about it, We're going to put Katie Graham's tits through the wringer. And what that was referring to was that her family wanted to buy these radio stations—or maybe sell them; I can't remember which. But either way, they needed an FCC permission, and Nixon said, Aha! I have the brain wave. We'll use that as a pressure on the Post. And it spectacularly backfired. It didn't work for Nixon at all.

Now, a half century later, similar kinds of threats do seem to be working, at least for now. What's the difference? Why was the press so much more robust in the 1970s than the prestige press seems to be in the 2020s?

Baron: Well, I don't know if it was more robust. Certainly, in the case of The Washington Post, they resisted. And I wish that Jeff Bezos would do the same. As I said, I think the news department continues to operate independently, and it's doing a great job, an admirable job of investigating what's happening in this administration. And yet he has sought to repair his relationship with Trump by doing all sorts of things, the first one being killing an endorsement of Kamala Harris and then, of course, donating to the inauguration, appearing at the inauguration, Amazon agreeing to a contract to buy the rights to a Melania Trump documentary about her own life for an extraordinary sum of money, and then Amazon agreeing to buy the rights to The Apprentice.

I think what's different now is, well, you don't have a Congress that's doing its job. I mean, at the time of Watergate, you actually had some confidence that the other pillars of government would stand up, would hold up. And in the case of Watergate, you had a Congress that conducted an investigation that obtained internal tapes, and that made all the difference in the world. And now you have a president who has control of both houses of Congress, and you have a Congress, a Republican Party, that is a completely servile.

Frum: Mm-hmm. Is there something different about the media institutions themselves? Have they changed in some way, as compared to what they were half a century ago?

Baron: Good question. Look—in the past, I think sometimes we romanticized what the media was like. Keep in mind: We used to have incredibly wealthy owners of media, people like Hearst, who often collaborated with government and abused their power.

I mean, the Chandler family, you know, remade Los Angeles, brought water from the Owens Valley in the north down to L.A. to essentially enrich themselves. So I think we romanticize what media ownership was in the past. I think that now, you know, a lot of media—big, institutional media—is owned by, first of all, very wealthy people who have other very substantial commercial interests.

And you have, also, these parent companies, which have other substantial commercial interests. And they're highly dependent on the federal government, and the federal government has probably more power today than it had back in the previous years, previous decades.

Frum: One reason it seems to me that media institutions are weaker in the 2020s was because they went through a self-imposed spasm of self-cannibalization in the late 2010s, culminating in the events of 2020. The most famous example of this is the forced resignation of James Bennett from The New York Times op-ed page for the sin of running an op-ed that some of the staffers thought was too interesting. They claimed that the op-ed would lead to violence, which was, on its face and certainly by the result, a false claim.

But Bennett was forced out, and other institutions saw these kind of little staff mutinies. You experienced many at The Washington Post, and the hypothesis is: Was there some kind of weakening of the sinew, some kind of weakening of the courage, some kind of weakening of the solidarity between staff and leadership at the institution that happened between 2015, culminating in 2020? And is that in any way responsible for the weakness of institutions today?

Baron: Well, I don't disagree with you that there has been a certain ideological rigidity within newsrooms and unwillingness to recognize nuance, a tendency on the part of, particularly, the younger generation, I think, to divide the world into victims and victimizers, oppressors and the oppressed, and basically see the world without a nuance, see it through sort of a binary separation. I think that what that has done—I don't know that it has weakened. Certainly, there have been rebellions within newsrooms. I did experience that due to my efforts to try to enforce social-media guidelines, for example, and then, also, in reaction to the George Floyd killing, the demand for greater diversity in the newsroom and in leadership.

But I think that the unwillingness to sort of recognize nuances has hurt our credibility with the general public. That's where I think it's done real damage, is that it has contributed to the decline in confidence in major news institutions. And that's a perilous place to be.

Frum: You know, diversity is a complex concept with many different meanings, and I think what it can sometimes mean and has sometimes meant for many institutions is that while the staff become more diverse in a series of biographical attributes, they become more monolithic in the way they think and more different from the people to whom they want to deliver their product.

So if you've got a newsroom that is all full of—from every background, every climb, but—all graduates of certain four-year institutions with certain common outlooks, and the readership doesn't meet those qualifications. I mean, they may, you know, have different biographies, but they have similar outlooks, and it's one that puts them increasingly at odds with who their consumers are, in a way that just wasn't the case when you went to a newspaper from high school, not from college.

Baron: I think that's true. I think that we do not have a certain level of diversity that we should have. It's people from a lot of different backgrounds, people who didn't go to all the same sorts of schools.

I certainly didn't, by the way. I did not go to an Ivy League school, and I grew up in Florida and not in the Washington area. And I just ended up there because I was approached about taking on the editorship of The Washington Post, which was a surprise to me. So I've always seen Washington as a bit of a bubble, and I think it is.

Look—we did work when I was at the Post to increase the diversity, in and in respects other than demographic. We tried to hire more military veterans. We thought that was important. The country had been at war for so many years, and yet we had very few military veterans in our newsroom. We needed more. We hired people who came from evangelical Christian colleges. I thought that was really important, given the importance of religion in this country, and particularly evangelicalism in this country. And to try to get more people from working-class backgrounds as well. And we need to do more of that. There's no question. I think there are a lot of people in the newsroom who don't understand the struggles and lives of ordinary people in the middle of the country, and we need to work harder at that. There's no question about that.

Frum: One thing I think that gets lost sight of—and I'm old enough to remember it, and maybe you are too—was: In the middle of 1970s, most of the people who worked for a newspaper were engaged in a form of manufacturing. The paper, yes, it was written. But after it was written, it was then composed by people who worked for the newspaper, and it was then physically printed and then physically distributed. It was a giant manufacturing enterprise, and most of the staff were blue-collar people who had nothing to do with the content of the paper and everything to do with the physical existence of the paper.

And this was brought home when my wife's stepfather created a newspaper in Toronto—which was created in the early 1970s, The Toronto Sun—which was like this. You saw it when you went to the athletic events, or the picnics, the softball games that the reporters might have had a slightly more-educated background. But most people who were there were blue-collar people when they played softball together, when they did picnics together, when they socialized together—that the newspaper affirmed its identity as part of the culture of the city, and it was a manufacturing enterprise.

Well, technology has changed that. Newspapers don't manufacture anymore. They deliver a nonphysical product. The people who produce the product are highly educated. The production staff are probably even more technically skilled than the content staff. And all of them are more and more unlike the rest of the people of the city or country in which they serve.

Baron: Well, I agree with you on that. Look—this was evident prior to Trump being elected. People have asked me what our failures were prior to Trump being elected, and I always say, It wasn't the coverage of the campaign. It was what occurred prior to that—years prior to that. It's that we didn't understand the country well enough.

We just did not understand people's struggles, their expectations, their aspirations, and we needed to do that better. And there's no question that—look: Everybody, people talk about their life experiences these days, but everybody's life experiences, by definition, are narrow. It's just them. Our job as journalists is to get outside of our life experience and understand the life, the experiences of other people. And we need more people in our newsrooms who come from a variety of different backgrounds. And I think we should get to work doing that.

Frum: A point I made in my first Trump book about this is a way of driving it home. So the great opioid toll begins in 2014. By 2016, it's killing more Americans than Vietnam. I went to The New York Times search engine and typed in, for the year from January 1, 2016, to the end of 2016, the two words opioid and transgender. And I don't want to derogate from the importance of any issue. If I remember right, there were, like, 80 or a hundred times more stories about transgender issues in The New York Times in 2016 than there were about the opioid epidemic. Now, that would change the following year, but it just marked that something could be happening in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire in 2014, 2015, and 2016, and it was invisible to the people who produced the country's most elite newspapers.

And one of Trump's secret weapons in the campaign of 2016 was he would campaign in these places and just say the word opioid. He had no plan. He had no concept. And indeed, the problem would continue to get dramatically worse under his presidency, but at least he knew it was there, which other people seem not to know.

Baron: That's a very interesting data point, that research that you did. And I think it does highlight just how sorely disconnected we are from so much of what is happening in the country, and I think that's something that definitely needs to be corrected, and corrected quickly. It's cause for a lot of self-reflection on the part of all of us who are in the media, and we need to make sure that that doesn't continue.

Frum: As we talk about media, of course, people of a certain generation have an idea of what media is, and we often have a way of using that phrase to mean institutions that were important in 1972—The Washington Post, The New York Times, CBS News. And it's a little hard to absorb that everybody who has one of these devices, which everybody has, can communicate instantly any image or any language to anybody on the planet on a scale that would've staggered the editors of The Washington Post in 1972, or even the CBS Evening News.

And I suppose one of the questions we have to think more philosophically about is: What is media in the 2020s? I mean, TikTok shapes more minds than The New York Times, and Joe Rogan has a bigger audience than 60 Minutes. And we have a kind of anti-media that creates relationships with its consumers by presenting itself as non-media, by attacking the institutions that were important in 1972 but that are themselves also forms of media, obviously, and that are different from the traditional institutions only in that they seem to have no code of conduct, no code of ethics whatsoever.

Baron: Well, clearly the definition of media has expanded tremendously. We've seen a radical change in the kind of media there is, and a radical change in the way that media is consumed.

And a lot of the new media is communicating with a level of authenticity—or at least perceived authenticity—that institutional media has been unable to deliver. We in the traditional media have always focused on our authority, the reporting that we do, the verification process—all of which, of course, is essential and core to who we are and what we ought to be doing, what our mission is. At the same time, we are not communicating the same level of authenticity that a lot of the new media are. And because we don't do that, because we don't communicate authenticity, we're not getting credit for the authority that we have. And people who do communicate authentically, or perceived authentically—a lot of the new media—they're being given credit for authority that frequently they don't deserve. Not always. There are people who are quite capable who are doing that, but a lot of them don't deserve the authority.

And look—this is a huge challenge. I mean, it's an opportunity, of course, to reach more people. But it is a huge challenge to traditional news institutions, and that's one that we clearly have to confront and we have to change.

Frum: Well, you're very polite about it when you call it authenticity. I think one of the lessons I think from a media-business point of view: The media of the 1970s ignored large parts of demand. It turns out, there's a much bigger demand for virulent anti-Semitism in America than anyone in 1975 thought there was. There's much more demand for crackpot medical advice than people used to think.

And in 1975, if you'd said to The New York Times or The Washington Post or CBS, You know, you could make more money by serving the anti-Semitic market or the medical crackpot market, they would say, You know what? We're making enough money. Thanks, but no thanks. We don't need to tell people the polio vaccine is no good. But people, entrepreneurs have discovered there is a big market for anti-Semitism. There is a big market for The polio vaccine is no good, and you can get very rich—or at least selected individuals can—meeting that demand, which is not infinite but large. And we are in a world that is, you know—the price of the internet may be the return of infectious diseases that had been banished in 1998.

Baron: Look—they are an enormous number of bad actors. By using the word authenticity, I don't suggest that many of them aren't bad actors. There are good actors too. There are people who are doing really good work. And I think there's a reason you have a podcast, that you developed a podcast because you saw it as a better way of communicating with people or, at least potentially, a more-effective way of communicating with people. And there are a lot of other people who are doing that as well.

So I don't want to discredit everybody who's in new media, because they don't deserve to be discredited, because many of them are quite good. But there are a lot of bad actors in spreading crazy conspiracy theories and a lot of hate. And that is the nature of the internet these days, is that it allows for that because it's a highly fragmented market, and people are going to exploit that fragmented market for their own personal, professional, political, or commercial gain.

And that's exactly what's happening. I would say, however, that traditional media is not irrelevant, as is often claimed by people in that new-media field, by a lot of our politicians today, including Trump and Musk and whoever. The reality is that we remain relevant. There's a reason why Trump is completely obsessed with traditional media. He would not be obsessed with traditional media if it were irrelevant; that would be insane. And by the way, when Elon Musk just recently stepped away from the White House, who did he give interviews to? Amazingly, traditional media, the very media that he had denigrated all along.

Frum: How should we think about what is and what isn't media? A person offering makeup advice on TikTok to a million viewers, is that media? I don't know anymore.

Baron: Yeah, it's media. I mean, I think it is media—media writ large. Absolutely. People who are on TikTok are having an enormous impact. I mean, people are forming their opinions of what's happening, let's say in the Middle East, based on a 15-second TikTok. They think they know everything based on the 15 seconds that they saw on TikTok. Now, that is appalling, of course. Anytime you're dealing with a complex subject, like the Middle East, which has centuries of history behind it, you don't want to think that you've absorbed everything you need to know based on something you saw in 15 seconds on TikTok. But there's no question. That's media. That is how people are receiving their information, like it or not.

Frum: Let me offer you a last question, some advice for the viewers: How does one become a better consumer of media content in this day and age? Are there any guidelines or advice you can offer to the viewer who is not selling makeup tips to a million people, but who has a phone, uses it, looks at it. How do we use this incredible new device, this incredible new power, responsibly and effectively to live better and more informed lives as citizens and individuals?

Baron: Well, look. I mean, one of the biggest challenges today, a huge challenge and problem for us, is that we can't agree on a common set of facts. We can't even agree on how to determine what a fact is. All of the things that we've used in the past—education, experience, expertise, and actual evidence—have all been discredited. Not discredited, but denied and dismissed and denigrated.

I think that consumers should be looking at that. They ought to be looking: Does this person actually have an education in the field? Does this person have experience in the field? Does this person have expertise? Is there actual evidence? Can I see the evidence? Who is behind this? Use your critical faculties to judge the quality of information and the quality of the people who are disseminating that information, and determine whether in the past you've relied on them.

I mean, one of the interesting things about traditional media is that when there's a natural disaster, guess where people turn? They turn to traditional media. They don't turn to some of these fringe outfits to tell them where the hurricane's going to hit and what they ought to be doing, or where the tornado is, or anything like that, or where the flooding is going to be. They turn, typically, to traditional media because, look—there's a reserve of confidence in them because they know that they're going to get accurate information. And so I think consumers of information need to look for that education, expertise, experience. And what is the evidence that they are providing? Are you just relying on your beliefs, or are you confusing your beliefs with actual facts?

Frum: Maybe the good news or the bad news of the same, which is we all have many more opportunities, but we're all going to have to work a lot harder to make sure that we are accurately and truthfully informed. And while it's never been easier if you have some medical symptom—never been easier to find out for yourself what that probably is—it's also never been easier to be deceived by people who, for reasons of gain or sociopathy, want to make you sicker or want to deny you the medicine you really need.

And so we have seen the decline in vaccinations. It's still more than 90 percent that are properly vaccinated. So nine out of 10 people are doing the right thing. But five or eight out of 100 are doing the wrong thing, and they pose risks not only to their own children, but to everybody's children.

Baron: And I think the consumers of information have to work harder, but also, those of us who are delivering information have to work harder to show people our work, to show people why they should believe us—not just to tell them what's happening but to show them the work that we've done, the evidence that we're relying upon. Be as transparent as possible, communicate more effectively, and make sure that we're covering the entirety of our communities and our society and our country, and do a better job of that.

Frum: Marty, thank you so much for your time. Thank you for your candid memoir—it's going to be an important resource for anyone who wants to understand the Trump era, and also the transformation of media under new kinds of ownership, and, above all, your extraordinarily important institution, The Washington Post, which you led to such heights, and which we hope is able to retain at least most of the glory that you delivered for it.

Baron: Thank you, David. I appreciate it.

Frum: Thank you. Bye-bye.

[Music]

Frum: Thanks so much to Marty Baron for joining me today. If you appreciate this dialogue and the others like it, I hope you will subscribe to this podcast on whatever platform you use. I hope you'll also consider subscribing to The Atlantic, in print or in text form. That is how we under support all the work of this podcast of myself and of all my Atlantic colleagues.

As we wrap up this all-media day today, I want to delve into one final topic, and that is: the way this scandal, this outrage, this outcry that has been womped up about the age of former President Joe Biden.

Everyone saw the debate that President Biden had obviously become infirm, and now there is a lot of accusation that this was somehow covered up or neglected, and that not only were the people around President Biden culpable, but that somehow the press was implicated, too, in its failure to address the question sufficiently and in time. This strikes me as something with a kernel of truth to it, but more distraction and misleading than truth. And let me explain what I mean.

Now, I'm proud to say that The Atlantic was early and direct on the Biden age story. We ran a piece in June of 2022 by my Atlantic colleague Mark Leibovich saying Biden was too old and should not run again. Had Leibovich's advice been followed, history would've taken a very different course. And I think you'll find many other examples in many other places—Olivia Nuzzi at New York Magazine—of people who brought attention to the President Biden's gathering infirmity.

Obviously, there were people around him who tried to put the best face on the president's health. That's always true. President Kennedy was much sicker than anybody knew at the time when he was president in the early '60s, when he seemed to be a model of physical fitness. President Eisenhower, the severity of his heart attacks—again, that was not known to people at the time. The full seriousness of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981—his recovery, it was much more touch and go than people were allowed to think at the time.

People are invited to think of the president as healthier than the president often is. It is a body-killing job, and nobody comes out of it in the same shape that they went into it. And surely, the people around President Biden tried to represent him as healthier than perhaps he was, especially toward the end. And it is an important news story to cover the capability of the president. Kudos to those who dig into that topic, who separate what is true from what is rumored, and who alert people when the president isn't as capable as the president should be, or as those around him want to be.

That's a job that continues even after the presidency. As I said, with these previous presidents, the full degree of their infirmity was often not known until sometime afterwards. Woodrow Wilson was struck down by a stroke in October of 1919. Now, people understood that he was ill and was invalided, but how radically invalided he was, that was something—and he was invalid from October of 1919 until he left the presidency, in March of 1921, almost a year and a half—that was covered up by his wife and his doctor. And the full truth was not known for a long time, and that really did change the course of history.

Many of the worst acts of the Wilson presidency happened after the stroke of October 1919, and it's not clear whether Wilson approved of them, authorized them, or even was aware of them. The Palmer Raids, for example, where immigrants were rounded up and deported without much of a hearing, if any—those started in November of 1919 and were at their peak in January of 1920. Not clear that Wilson even ever knew about it. So bringing the truth retrospectively, also an important task. And I understand that journalists, when they follow these stories, can sometimes lose perspective.

You know, if the school superintendent is stealing pencils from the supply cabinet, that's probably not the most important story in the world. But the only way you're ever going to find out about it is if one person in the local paper decides that for him or for her, that story will be the most important story in the world for however long it takes to get to the bottom of it. And only a person who acts as if the superintendent stealing the pencils is the most important story in the world will bring the story to light at all and give it whatever attention it deserves. So their tunnel vision is kind of a bona fide job qualification for being a reporter.

But when you consume and read and react to news, that's where the perspective comes in. And you need to say, Okay, maybe the people around Biden did try to hush up how sick he was. And maybe not every journalist worked as hard as Mark Leibovich to get the truth. Not every journalist worked as hard as Olivia Nuzzi to get the truth. Not every journalist was willing to brave the blowback that Mark Leibovich and Olivia Nuzzi got for their reporting of the truth.

But how important was this story, really? And today—when there is an effort to make it seem like this is the biggest scandal in American history, or at least the biggest scandal going today—at a time when the present president is pillaging billions of dollars, the story now that is the overwhelming story here in Washington is corruption on a post-Soviet, postcolonial Africa scale. Billions of dollars going into and affecting everything, every decision that this administration makes, from pardons to foreign policy. That's the story. Everything else, also interesting. But don't oversell it, and don't overbuy it.

Thanks very much. I hope to see you next week here on The David Frum Show.

What slaughtering animals all day does to your mind.

by  Kenny Torrella

In The Dying Trade, a forthcoming documentary film about slaughterhouse workers, a man named Tom describes a moment during his career that still haunts him many years later: the time he skinned a cow alive while she was giving birth. 

Tom worked at slaughterhouses across Europe from the late 1990s to the mid-2010s, and one of his jobs on the production line was to remove the skin from animals after they had been hung up, stunned unconscious, and bled out. That's how it's supposed to work in theory. 

But slaughterhouses operate at a rapid, hectic pace, with animals sometimes stunned improperly and butchered while still alive and conscious. If a cow remained conscious once they got to Tom — as was the case with this cow in particular, whose calf was partially hanging out of her birth canal — he was unable to stop the line to ensure they were properly killed. So, as the cow kicked at him, mid-birth, he had no choice but to skin her alive. The calf didn't survive.

“It takes 25 seconds,“ to skin them, he said in The Dying Trade, “but it stays with you for the rest of your life.”

Tom, who calls himself a “devout animal lover,” said that it's “very difficult watching animals being killed.” But the job desensitizes you: “You become a robot.” Other slaughterhouse workers have made similar remarks. 

To cope, Tom spent most of his slaughterhouse career as a functioning alcoholic, drinking as soon as he got off work until he went to bed. He took magic mushrooms on weekends to escape. He also dissociated at work, spending much of his time on the production line “thinking I was on holiday…I would dream I was in Spain somewhere — just anywhere but what I was doing.” Now, he said, he lives like a hermit and still dreams about slaughterhouses six to seven nights a week. He also has violent thoughts of hurting people, which he had never had prior to working in meat processing. 

“I suffer with PITS as a result,” Tom said, referring to perpetration-induced traumatic stress, a subcategory of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, in which the cause of the trauma is being a perpetrator of violence — in this case, slaughtering animals for food — rather than being a victim of it.

Physical injury rates are high in slaughterhouses, making it one of the more dangerous occupations. But much less is known about the mental and emotional toll of slaughterhouse work. Psychology researchers have difficulty accessing slaughterhouse worker populations, and so we're left with a handful of small studies. As a result, it's unknown exactly what share of the world's millions of slaughterhouse workers suffer from PTSD or other mental health conditions. 

But what's certain is that many do — surveys of slaughterhouse workers show high rates of anxiety and depression, and many have shared stories of mental health struggles with researchers and journalists. The problem is likely to worsen in the years ahead, as more and more slaughterhouses are built around the world to satisfy increasing meat consumption. 

Two years ago, the American Medical Association's Journal of Ethics even devoted an entire issue to the meat industry's effects on societal health, including its impact on workers. One article by social psychologist Rachel MacNair, who coined the term PITS, put the psychological toll of slaughterhouse work — and society's complicity in the problem — in blunt terms: “Public demand for meat creates ongoing, present, and future exposure to trauma and continual retraumatization.”

The concept of PTSD stems from studies of combat veterans, research that accelerated in the post-Vietnam War era in the US. It was officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a mental health condition in 1980.

But it took time for psychologists to recognize that being the one who perpetrates violence — as opposed to experiencing or witnessing it — can also be highly traumatic, or even more so. 

In a 1998 study, MacNair told me, she observed that Vietnam War veterans who directly killed people had higher trauma scores than those who only witnessed killing. In 2002, she published the first book on the issue — Perpetration-Induced Traumatic Stress: The Psychological Consequences of Killing — which went beyond war and into other arenas of violence, including policing, death penalty executions, torture, homicide, and slaughterhouse work. The idea has since expanded how psychologists think about traumatization from violence.

Slaughterhouse work can also deeply impact those who don't directly kill animals but still play a critical role in meat production, like David Magna, a former slaughterhouse inspector for the Canadian government.

For six years, Magna worked at a major chicken plant, where one of his jobs entailed standing behind employees on the slaughter line — which operated at the breakneck speed of 180 birds per minute — to check for signs of disease and other issues. He also inspected crates of chickens as they were unloaded to be slaughtered; sometimes, hundreds would arrive dead from exposure to extreme heat or cold during transportation from the factory farm. 

After six years at the chicken slaughterhouse, Magna developed severe respiratory problems, requiring him to take time off (it's not uncommon for poultry workers to complain about the toxic, bacteria-killing chemicals used in slaughterhouses). 

Over the next decade, Magna went on to work as an inspector at other plants along with a desk job in which he reviewed animal welfare violation reports, including a number of disturbing cases. In one, a farmer branded some of his pigs a dozen or so times each with a hot iron all over their bodies, but was only penalized with a fine and was allowed to continue to raise animals for meat. In another case, a truckload of pigs froze to death after a driver fell asleep. One report involved a pregnant dairy cow who gave birth on a slaughterhouse-bound truck. Because the trailer was so crowded, the calf's head was smashed in by other cows.

“I'm a shell of what I was when I walked in that [first] day,” Magna told me. Throughout his career, he'd try to improve conditions, but the deck was stacked against him: regulations are weak, violators face little to no penalties, and higher-ups often didn't take his concerns seriously. 

Like Tom, the slaughterhouse worker in Europe, Magna drank excessively to cope. He also had dreams in which he was a chicken packed in a crate and then slaughtered. His mother, who had briefly worked on the slaughter line, had similar dreams. 

Objects like a plate of meat or a truck can trigger flashbacks for Magna. He's dealt with suicidal ideation, and a few years ago, he was diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar disorder. 

Gathering broader data on the experiences of people who work in slaughterhouses has proven difficult, but there is some. A few years ago, a literature review by psychologists Jessica Slade and Emma Alleyne at the University of Kent found slaughterhouse workers have higher rates of anxiety and depression, and a higher propensity for physical aggression. A small study of slaughterhouse workers in South Africa found that each had recurring nightmares, like Tom and David, and some workers have reported high rates of alcoholism in the workplace. 

But there's been no large-scale study investigating PTSD rates among slaughterhouse workers, and there's a good reason why: It would be hard to conduct such a study without cooperation from meat companies. And many slaughterhouse workers are undocumented immigrants who might be reluctant to share their stories, even if they were anonymous.

Some people who live near factory farms, which produce vast amounts of animal manure that pollutes the air and water, call their communities “sacrifice zones” for the meat and agricultural industries. In low-income and disproportionately immigrant communities, the meat industry has found its sacrifice populations — people with few economic opportunities who must kill animals for hours on end and suffer whatever physical or psychological trauma may come.

“It is unnatural and inhumane for someone to kill for hours every day,” Susana Chavez, a former slaughterhouse worker in Mexico, wrote in a 2022 op-ed. 

And as MacNair has noted, our high demand for cheap meat creates ever more trauma — trauma that is outsourced to these sacrifice populations. 

And killing isn't the only potential source of trauma. Employees can also experience physical or sexual violence from colleagues, something some women in slaughterhouses have reported, and experience or witness severe accidents among other workers. In The Dying Trade, Tom recalled a time when a coworker got stuck in a machine and was essentially cut in half: “I can still hear him screaming.”

Magna, along with many other former meat industry workers (including Chavez), has since become vegan — and an animal rights activist.

Activism “has given me a new lease on life,” he said. “I'm fortunate; I got out of this system. For whatever reason, I'm here today doing this, and I think of the people that aren't so lucky.” He mentioned a former coworker, Maria, who had to get carpal tunnel surgery like many other slaughterhouse workers, due to intense wrist pain from making repetitive cuts to animal carcasses. When Magna asked her why she's still working at the plant, she told him that because she doesn't speak English, she doesn't have many options. She said she has to continue on to provide for her kids — that her own life doesn't matter. 

“This system,” Magna said, “oppresses everyone.”

How a Catholic theocrat started speaking for Trump's State Department.

by  Zack Beauchamp

Last week, the State Department published a strikingly radical screed on its official Substack. Titled “The Need for Civilizational Allies in Europe,” the piece accused Europe's governments of waging “an aggressive campaign against Western civilization itself.”

These Western nations, according to author Samuel Samson, have turned on their own heritage: abandoning democracy in favor of a repressive liberalism that threatens to snuff out the heart of their own civilization.

“The global liberal project is not enabling the flourishing of democracy. Rather, it is trampling democracy, and Western heritage along with it, in the name of a decadent governing class afraid of its own people,” Samson writes.

Samson asserts that German and French criminal investigations into far-right factions are politically motivated repression, but provides no evidence to support this extraordinary claim about the internal politics of key allies. He inflates the (real) problems with free speech law in Britain, while whitewashing the only authoritarian state in the European Union (right-wing Hungary). He presents a bizarre intellectual history of the Declaration of Independence, replacing Jefferson's chief influences (Enlightenment liberals) with Aristotle and Saint Thomas Aquinas.

The essay isn't just poorly argued: It has policy implications. Samson both insults and threatens allied governments, implying there will be some kind of US punishment if European states do not change their policies on free speech, election administration, and (for some reason) migration.

“Secretary Rubio has made clear that the State Department will always act in America's national interest. Europe's democratic backsliding not only impacts European citizens but increasingly affects American security and economic ties, along with the free speech rights of American citizens and companies,” he writes. “We will not always agree on scope and tactics, but tangible actions by European governments to guarantee protection for political and religious speech, secure borders, and fair elections would serve as welcome steps forward.”

Samuel Samson's title is “Senior Advisor for the Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor,” but he is not an experienced diplomat. In fact, he is a 2021 college graduate with no background in European affairs or foreign policy. His last job was “Director of Strategic Partnerships” (a fundraising position) for American Moment, a right-wing organization dedicated to identifying Trump-aligned young people for junior staff jobs. 

But while Samson's path to shaping US-European relations is unconventional, it is hardly unintended. His own publicly available writing suggests that it is the result of a deliberate strategy — an effort to seed the US government with radical opponents of philosophical liberalism who aim to replace it with a form of illiberal Christian government.

Samson described this strategy, in a 2021 essay, as “the infiltration of liberalism's powerful institutions by right-wing post-liberal agents.” He said the strategy was worth pursuing, and that American Moment was an organization dedicated to turning the basic idea into “tangible action.” (Neither State nor American Moment responded to requests for comment.)

His ascent in the State Department is concrete evidence that this radical right strategy of “entryism” — a small group trying to join another organization with the attempt of changing it from within — is yielding dividends.

So when the State Department published Samson's piece on its Substack, it sent an unmistakable message not just to Europe but to likeminded right-wing radicals: They could begin more openly planting their flag atop conquered territory.

About a decade ago, Harvard Law School professor Adrian Vermeule became famous for advocating an idea called “integralism:” basically, a right-wing Catholic doctrine that calls for the abolition of the barrier between church and state.

He viewed liberalism, in the philosophical sense, as an abomination, its obsession with rights and freedoms fundamentally corrosive of the “traditional” moral values that Vermeule believes are essential for human flourishing. The only solution was to infuse the state with religious values — specifically, conservative Catholic ones.

But how could you possibly get to such a society in the United States, where 20 percent of the population is Catholic — most of whom are themselves not Vermeule disciples? His answer, which he calls either “ralliement” or “integration from within,” is an entryist campaign targeting the bureaucracy. You get a few key people into positions of power, and then they quietly nudge the citizenry toward a place where they will accept some kind of “postliberal' state.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

“The vast bureaucracy created by liberalism in pursuit of a mirage of depoliticized governance may, by the invisible hand of Providence, be turned to new ends, becoming the great instrument with which to restore a substantive politics of the good,” Vermeule wrote in a 2018 essay.

These arguments helped make Vermeuele a leading voice in the so-called postliberal movement: a loose group of right-wing religious conservatives who shared his radical critique of our current political institutions (if not his integralist solution). Postliberal ideas became particularly popular among young conservatives, who felt that the pre-Trump conservative consensus was exhausted and out of date.

Samuel Samson was one of them.

After graduating from the University of Texas at Austin in 2021, he took a one-year junior fellowship at the Thomistic Institute — a Catholic think tank in Washington, DC, associated with the Dominican order of monks. During that fellowship, he penned a piece for the American Spectator in which he endorsed Vermeule's strategy for taking liberalism down.

Calling Vermeuele's ideas “the popular blueprint for America's burgeoning post-liberal right,” Samson wrote that “I believe the offensive strategy is…worth our effort.” His concern, however, is that the strategy risks corruption: that young bureaucrats and Hill staffers residing in Washington will be corrupted by living in a place defined by liberal values.

“The strategy's offensive nature requires its agents to dwell for extended periods, even lifetimes, within the nucleus of American liberalism,” he writes. “As such, the strategy brings agents into full contact with the temptations of liberalism — sirens singing alluring songs of pleasure, sexual license, material gain, power, prestige, and social inclusion — beckoning the agent to direct the project to new, less-wholesome ends.”

It is a sign that a truly radical ideological movement has begun successfully executing on its stated strategy for entering the political mainstream.

Samson's solution to this danger is for radical entryists to engage in study. “Read great books of the Western, Christian, and Classical traditions — as well as those that oppose them,” he writes. “Yes, the practical skills of networking, legislating, and orating are important too, but detached from speculative truth, they are all functionally worthless.”

Somewhat ironically, Samson's next move was to become a fundraiser. But the organization he would work for, American Moment, was one that Samson believed furthered the Vermeule mission.

Founded in 2021 by three young conservatives — Saurabh Sharma, Nick Solheim, and Jake Mercier — American Moment was inspired by an essay written in 2020 by now-Vice President JD Vance.

Vance argued that the conservative movement was trapped by its own donors: that the entire professional infrastructure of the right was forced, by power of money, into organizations who supported the open approach to trade and migration that the Trump movement opposed.

“Real change,” Vance wrote, would require that we come to grips with the fact that so much of Conservatism, Inc. depends on the status quo.”

Sharma, Solheim, and Mercier built American Moment to try and end that dependence: to build a cadre of populist junior staffers. With Vance on their board, they created a database of like-minded young people to hire for early career positions, a fellowship program to bring young right-wing populists to DC, and even hosted social events to create a more robust right-wing youth culture in the capital.

Their efforts have been reasonably successful. American Moment worked on Project 2025, and Sharma is currently serving as a special adviser to the Presidential Policy Office (which supervises hiring of executive branch political appointees).

American Moment is not exactly as Samson described it before he worked there. While his 2021 essay claimed it was built to implement Vermeule's integralist ideas, its leaders took a more ecumenical approach. They elevated conservatives from all sorts of different right-wing subcultures, not just Catholic postliberals, so long as they had the right Trump-friendly policy views.

“The basic approach of, ‘Well, we're going to do our -ism and do politics that way' falls apart,” Sharma told Politico's Ian Ward in 2023. “You're basically signing yourself up to be a loud but ultimately defeated minority.”

Yet the fact that an integralist like Samson was able to succeed there, and then use it as a jumping-off point to a senior position in the Trump administration, suggests it facilitated the success of Vermeule-inspired righties.

Attempts to build a more Trump-friendly set of conservative cadres would invariably create opportunities for radical young right-wingers, especially if they were already thinking about entryist strategies for politics. That elements of the top leadership were sympathetic — most notably Vance, a self-described “postliberal” deeply influenced by Vermeuele's ideological allies — surely helped things along.

The State Department op-ed, in short, is not a one-off. It is a sign that a truly radical ideological movement has begun successfully executing on its stated strategy for entering the political mainstream.

Men's beauty standards are getting increasingly bizarre.

by  Constance Grady

A small but curious sign of the deepening gender divide in our politically fraught times: Male beauty standards are getting really weird.

In the latest salvo, young boys on TikTok are shaving off their eyelashes, ostensibly because long eyelashes are girly. This new phenomenon joins a number of other perplexing masculine trends from the last few years, including doing tongue exercises known as “mewing” in order to achieve the squarest jaw possible, and “going to Turkey” for hair transplants. Somewhat relatedly, a Republican congressman bragged recently that he refuses to drink out of straws because that's “what the women in my house do” (not quite a beauty standard as much as a sort of inscrutable new gender norm). 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

To be clear, we don't know how many people are actually participating in these practices: enough for a few viral TikToks and mystified trend stories, not enough for an academic study. But it does seem that male beauty standards, infected by the ethos of the newly ascendant manosphere and incel-adjacent spaces, are evolving to focus far more on being masculine for its own sake than to attract and appeal to women. The point, it seems, is to impress other men, and a certain amount of ambient misogyny is part of the package deal. 

There's long been a divide between what men consider admirable on another man and what women consider attractive on men. That's why actors who show off rippling muscles on men's magazine covers emphasize a charming smile in women's media. A 2005 study found that men consistently overestimate the degree of muscularity that is attractive to women, while women, in turn, overestimate the degree of thinness that is attractive to men.

Manosphere spaces, which blend self-help and fitness advice with uncompromising messaging about traditional masculinity, have made that divide starker than ever. Just look at the recent dustup on X (which has increasingly become a right-wing echo chamber since Elon Musk's takeover in 2022), when a researcher invited men and women to vote in an anonymous poll about which photo of British pop star Olly Murs they found more appealing. In a “before” photo, Murs's muscles are prominent but undefined; in the “after” photo, he is shredded, with visible abs. 

Not only did men and women diverge on which photo they preferred (men far more often chose the “after” photo), but a certain subset of men insisted that women were mistaken, or outright untruthful, about their own preferences. “Women in this poll are lying. I know from experience how women feel about 6 packs,” went one characteristic response. Another poster tried to dissect what was really going on: “What I'm getting from these replies is that men confuse their own sexuality for that of women.” 

An emphasis on hypermasculinity is perhaps the natural end result of the sensibilities of the manosphere circulating and gaining traction for over a decade. Misogynist influencers like Andrew Tate believe so stridently in the dominance and supremacy of men that they will go to extreme lengths to eschew anything they consider feminine. 

An emphasis on hypermasculinity is perhaps the natural end result of the sensibilities of the manosphere circulating and gaining traction for over a decade.

Which leads of course to trends like eyelash-shearing. Long, thick, heavily mascara'ed and false eyelashes are particularly trendy for women right now. Anecdotally, a lot of straight women like long eyelashes on a man. Perhaps perversely, that makes it more attractive now than ever for men to get rid of them. 

It's notable that one of the projects of feminism over the last 20 years has been to help girls create relationships with their bodies that don't depend on men: to dress for themselves or for other women, and to exercise their bodies to become strong and healthy, rather than to reach for men's approval.

Some of the decoupling of male physical ideals from what straight women like borrows the same rhetoric and suggests the same sense of working toward healthy self-love. A recent Daily Beast article on body-building as a ramp to the alt-right quotes a 26-year-old body-builder as saying, “People who lift a lot know that having a really just huge physique, or being super lean, is not that attractive to the average woman. But they're doing it more for their own body image's sake…or to impress other men. Most people would not understand a really defined back, but if you lift around other men, they would absolutely notice that.”

But the attitude of “do it for you” among certain communities of men online is never very far off from the denigration of women. Two clicks away from self-love body building on an algorithmic feed are the “gymcels,” an off-shoot of incels who obsessively go to the gym. They, in turn, are a subset of Men Going Their Own Way, a group of male separatists one member described as holding the view, “It's not you, it's women that are the problem. You do whatever YOU want to do to better yourself. Disregard those wenches.'” 

Ironically, the pursuit of nonsensical and often contradictory beauty standards have led young men to the same place that young women have long found themselves: with crippling body dysmorphia. A 2019 study found that 22 percent of males displayed traits of disordered eating behaviors geared toward an obsessive desire to build muscle. Another study showed that looking at social media content that glorifies muscle-building is heavily correlated with muscle dysmorphia among young men.

It's a self-sabotaging act, targeted at a bodily attribute vital for eye health, because of its alleged girliness.

The shaving off the eyelashes comes with a similar aggressive strain of contempt toward women as the gymcel self-conception. It's a self-sabotaging act, targeted at a bodily attribute vital for eye health, because of its alleged girliness. In opposition to the layers of mascara and false lashes that beauty influencers pile on, some young men simply shave their eyelashes down to stumps, rejecting everything about their appearance that could be described as girly — especially if girls like it.

It's an example of how confusing the body standards are for young men right now, as they begin to find, like their female peers, that it is increasingly impossible for them to either see their bodies clearly or make their bodies live up to the standards in their heads — a troubled form of equality that no one wanted.

﻿Your partner's parents are not your family. But you should still be nice to them.

by  Allie Volpe

Anna can't exactly pinpoint when her relationship with her sister-in-law started to sour. Rather, it was a slow unraveling. 

When the two met over 20 years ago through their now-husbands, who are brothers, Anna actually preferred spending time with her future sister-in-law. “We would hang out all the time,” says Anna, who is being referred to by her middle name so she can speak freely about her family. “I would get through being with him just to hang out with her.”

Anna and her sister-in-law also had a common enemy: their husbands' parents. At family gatherings, they'd steal away with a glass of wine and whisper, “Can you believe they said that?” The women could compare notes about their mother-in-law's latest insult or how their father-in-law constantly belittled his wife.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Unlike Anna, 47, who largely kept her concerns to herself, her sister-in-law was vocal about her dislike for their in-laws. This rubbed Anna's husband the wrong way and ultimately drove a wedge between the two families. 

Now, they live an hour away and only see each other a handful of times a year. And when they do, it's awkward, Anna says. Her kids are no longer close with their cousins. Whenever Anna's sister-in-law invites her family on trips to amusement parks, they decline but end up going anyway — without them — and then lying about why they couldn't coordinate plans. 

“I just hate the dishonesty,” Anna says. “The worst part for me is pretending everything is fine when clearly everybody in the room knows it's not fine.”

The relationship one has with their in-laws can be fraught and perplexing, friendly and intimate, polite and distant.

The relationship one has with their in-laws can be fraught and perplexing, friendly and intimate, polite and distant. They're not the people you've chosen to bind yourself to, but you're still inextricably linked as long as you're with your partner. In-laws enjoy all the trappings and status of family, but aren't quite. Spending time with them can feel obligatory and not totally enjoyable. At the same time, there are no clearly defined expectations for what in-law relationships should look like, beyond the stereotypes. 

So what do you owe your partner's families of origin? They may not be your family, but they're probably going to be in your life in some form or fashion. They might never be a proxy for your own mother or sibling, but that doesn't mean they can't come close. 

As long as people have married, they have inherited their spouse's family. For centuries, parents aimed to pair their children based on the reputation, power, and wealth of a neighboring family, to create alliances through marriage. In many cultures worldwide, newlyweds typically moved in or near the husband's family. “The aim of marriage was to acquire useful in-laws or gain political or economic advantage,” writes Stephanie Coontz in the 2005 book Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage. By the 1920s, Coontz writes, “marital privacy was more important than adults' ties with their parents” and, as a result, the number of couples who lived with their parents dropped precipitously over the first half of the 20th century. 

As couples established themselves as independent entities, in-laws — especially mothers-in-law — came to be seen as prying interlopers, as evidenced in the 1954 book In Laws, Pro & Con. “Many a mother-in-law sounds baffled, bewildered, and bitter in her role,” wrote the book's author Evelyn Millis Duvall. “She reports that anything she does is misconstrued by her sons- and daughters-in-law. If she leaves them alone, she is being neglectful; if she is nice to them, she is being twofaced; if she appears interested in what they are doing, she is meddling; if she keeps out of their affairs, she is not interested in them — she just can't win!” 

Since then, the cultural view of in-laws in America has stayed remarkably consistent, says Sylvia Mikucki-Enyart, an associate professor of communication studies at the University of Iowa. The caricature of the overbearing mother-in-law still has strong cultural sway — TV and movie representations abound. In real life, there are entire Reddit communities dedicated to meddlesome “MILs.” Now, try to think of a single well-known father-in-law joke.

“In-law relationships are this weird between place of being family but not being the same intensity of family as family origin.”

Beyond these broad stereotypes, cultural and familial expectations and traditions influence the in-law relationship. For instance, daughters-in-law in Asian American families reported feeling anxious, angry, and confused as a result of their in-laws' traditional cultural expectations to be subservient and deferential, according to one study. Other research found that among Black families, sons-in-law sharing interests with their fathers-in-law and making an effort to engage in family activities helped strengthen their bond.

The way you interact with your in-laws is largely shaped by your partner's example. After all, if it weren't for them, you probably wouldn't have any connection to these people at all. Marrying someone who has a history of regularly spending time with their family of origin is a strong indication that you'll likely see more of these people in the future. “I would take my guide from my wife,” says Geoffrey Greif, a distinguished university professor at the University of Maryland School of Social Work and co-author of In-Law Relationships: Mothers, Daughters, Fathers, and Sons. “How close does she want me to be with her father and mother?”

These expectations shouldn't come as a surprise — they're almost certain to come up while a couple is dating. As the relationship progresses and you gain insight into your partner's familial ties, you may learn how much they value weekly hangouts with their siblings or big gatherings for holidays. A close-knit family dynamic can, for some, be a green flag.

Early on in his relationship with his now-wife Melli, Steven Schenberg, a 37-year-old in transportation logistics in Chicago, realized they'd not only be marrying each other but also each other's families. 

Within the first few months of dating, Schenberg grabbed dinner with one of Melli's sisters, attended the family's annual New Year's Day brunch, and slept on the floor of the hotel room Melli shared with her sisters at a wedding. Melli's brother is now one of Schenberg's best friends — a friendship that likely wouldn't have happened had they not met through Melli. Schenberg credits the closeness he maintains with his wife's family as part luck, part shared values. “I was raised in a tight family nucleus,” he says. “Melli was the same way.”

Just because in-laws occupy a place of prominence in your partner's life doesn't necessarily guarantee them a similarly intimate space in yours. After all, you lack a deep shared history. There's always a degree to which you'll always play catch-up. “In-law relationships are this weird between place of being family but not being the same intensity of family as family origin,” says Gretchen Perry, an associate professor of social work at the University of Northern British Columbia. “When you have conflict, often, there's less tolerance for the intensity of that conflict [than] with your own family of origin.”

And these relationships can be primed for conflict: too involved in-laws, absent in-laws, pushy in-laws, cheap in-laws, too-invested-in-their-traditions in-laws. Because there are fewer cultural norms offering a clear example of normative in-law relationships in Western societies, Mikucki-Enyart says, uncertainty abounds. “Versus other cultures where when you get married, you go live with your husband's family and you're deferential to your mother-in-law,” she says. “There are other cultures where it's very clearly outlined how these in-law relationships go, and in the US, we really don't have that.”

In her research, Mikucki-Enyart has observed two types of uncertainty arise within in-law relationships: relational uncertainty (What kind of relationship do I want with this person? How often do we interact?) and family level uncertainty (How do we balance time with each family? How will grandparents interact with children?) The latter is usually more impactful, Mikucki-Enyart says, especially when grandchildren enter the picture. If a parent-in-law is uncertain about how best to help their adult child and their spouse care for their own kids, they may sacrifice closeness with their grandkids. 

“There are other cultures where it's very clearly outlined how these in-law relationships go, and in the US, we really don't have that.”

Mother-in-law relationships are typically the ones that are more fraught, at least in heterosexual relationships. This is because mothers have more points of contact within families. Women are still socialized and are expected to carry the bulk of child rearing and kin keeping, Mikucki-Enyart says, and a scarcity mindset pits mothers against their child's partner. “There's not enough for all of us,” she says. “We have to fight for a position and a spot, which leads to…it's either her or me. Not ‘no, we can both love him and have individual relationships with this linchpin person.'” The recent “boy mom” phenomenon only further ties a mother's identity to her male children — the trope suggests that relinquishing her son to a romantic partner means a woman losing a part of herself, too. 

Fathers-in-law, meanwhile, are seen as protectors. “Men aren't involved in these relational roles, or their protectiveness is fulfilling their role,” Mikucki-Enyart says. 

The more you buy into the cliches, the more they become self-fulfilling prophecies. “Parents, especially mothers-in-law, are really in this damned if they do, damned if they don't position,” Mikucki-Enyart says. “They're very aware of the negative stereotype surrounding them. So sometimes then they'll go to the extreme and really, give the couple space. ... Then children are like, ‘Well, my mother-in-law doesn't even reach out, she doesn't even care,' and when she does, it's too much.”

Whether an in-law falls under the umbrella of kin depends on how you define family. Those with a more narrow view of family — spouse and children — may be less inclined to bend over backwards to appease their mother-in-law. Still, in most cases, it's worth maintaining at least a cordial relationship with your in-laws for the benefit of your spouse or children. 

That's assuming you're treated with the same respect.

Rina, a 31-year-old who works in hotel customer service in Toronto, used to consider her husband's sister someone reliable, someone worth confiding in. But over time, Rina's sister-in-law cut off contact with her, despite maintaining daily calls with her brother. At family gatherings, Rina's sister-in-law would ignore her and never told her kids to call her Aunt Rina. Recently, Rina's sister-in-law introduced her new baby to everyone in the family — except Rina. She was heartbroken. 

Rina, whose last name is being withheld so she can speak freely about her family, told her husband that his sister's actions made her feel like an outcast. “He sees the problem,” Rina says in an email, “and really wanted to help out.” He offered to talk to his sister, but Rina stopped him. It would only cause more drama.

Knowing your in-laws, flaws and all, helps blunt the pain of any slights. In her research examining relationships between mothers- and daughters-in-law of East Asian descent, psychologist Angela Gwak found that though they were stressed by their mothers-in-law, daughters-in-law learned to cope with them over time. “They've learned to accept them, but not like [their] family of origin,” Gwak says, “but just learn to coexist together. The stress is less jarring because they know and can predict how they would respond to certain circumstances or situations.”

Proof (and perhaps solace) that you may not be able to completely live without your in-laws, but you can learn to live with them.

A smaller government would not necessarily protect American democracy from Trump.

by  Abdallah Fayyad

It's easy to look at President Donald Trump's second term and conclude that the less power and reach the federal government has, the better. After all, a smaller government might provide Trump or someone like him with fewer opportunities to disrupt people's lives, leaving America less vulnerable to the whims of an aspiring autocrat. Weaker law-enforcement agencies could lack the capacity to enforce draconian policies. The president would have less say in how universities like Columbia conduct their business if they weren't so dependent on federal funding. And he would have fewer resources to fundamentally change the American way of life.

Trump's presidency has the potential to reshape an age-old debate between the left and the right: Is it better to have a big government or a small one? The left, which has long advocated for bigger government as a solution to society's problems, might be inclined to think that in the age of Trump, a strong government may be too risky. 

Say the United States had a single-payer universal health care system, for example. As my colleague Kelsey Piper pointed out, the government would have a lot of power to decide what sorts of medical treatments should and shouldn't be covered, and certain forms of care that the right doesn't support — like abortion or transgender health — would likely get cut when they're in power. 

That's certainly a valid concern. But the dangers Trump poses do not ultimately make the case for a small or weak government because the principal problem with the Trump presidency is not that he or the federal government has too much power. It's that there's not enough oversight.

Reducing the power of the government wouldn't necessarily protect us. In fact, “making government smaller” is one of the ways that Trump might be consolidating power.

When Americans are polled about how they feel about “big government” programs — policies like universal health care, social security, welfare for the poor — the majority of people tend to support them. Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe the government should be responsible for ensuring everyone has health coverage. But when you ask Americans whether they support “big government” in the abstract, a solid majority say they view it as a threat.

That might sound like a story of contradictions. But it also makes sense because “big government” can have many different meanings. It can be a police state that surveils its citizens, an expansive regulatory state that establishes and enforces rules for the private sector, a social welfare state that directly provides a decent standard of living for everyone, or some combination of the three. 

In the United States, the debate over “big government” can also include arguments about federalism, or how much power the federal government should have over states. All these distinctions complicate the debate over the size of government: Because while someone might support a robust welfare system, they might simultaneously be opposed to being governed by a surveillance state or having the federal government involved in state and local affairs.

As much as Americans like to fantasize about small government, the reality is that the wealthiest economies in the world have all been a product of big government, and the United States is no exception. That form of government includes providing a baseline social safety net, funding basic services, and regulating commerce. It also includes a government that has the capacity to enforce its rules and regulations.

A robust state that caters to the needs of its people, that is able to respond quickly in times of crisis, is essential. Take the Covid-19 pandemic. The US government, under both the Trump and Biden administrations, was able to inject trillions of dollars into the economy to avert a sustained economic downturn. As a result, people were able to withstand the economic shocks, and poverty actually declined. Stripping the state of the basic powers it needs to improve the lives of its citizens will only make it less effective and erode people's faith in it as a central institution, making people less likely to participate in the democratic process, comply with government policies, or even accept election outcomes.

But what happens when the people in power have no respect for democracy? 

The argument for a weaker and smaller government often suggests that a smaller government would be more constrained in the harm it can cause, while big government is more unrestrained. In this case, the argument is that if the US had a smaller government, then Trump could not effectively use the power of the state — by, say, deploying federal law enforcement agencies or withholding federal funds — to deport thousands of immigrants, bully universities, and assault fundamental rights like the freedom of speech. 

But advocating for bigger government does not mean you believe in handing the state unlimited power to do as it pleases. Ultimately, the most important way to constrain government has less to do with its size and scope and more to do with its checks and balances. 

In fact, one of the biggest checks on Trump's power so far has been the structure of the US government, not its size. Trump's most dangerous examples of overreach — his attempts to conduct mass deportations, eliminate birthright citizenship, and revoke student visas and green cards based on political views — have been an example of how proper oversight has the potential to limit government overreach. To be sure, Trump's policies have already upended people's lives, chilled speech, and undermined the principle of due process. But while Trump has pushed through some of his agenda, he hasn't been able to deliver at the scale he promised. 

But that's not because the federal government lacks the capacity to do those things. It's because we have three equal branches of government, and the judicial branch, for all of its shortcomings in the Trump era, is still doing its most basic job to keep the executive branch in check. 

The biggest lesson from Trump's first term was that America's system of checks and balances — rules and regulations, norms, and the separate branches of government — wasn't strong enough. As it turned out, a lot of potential oversight mechanisms did not have enough teeth to meaningfully restrain the president from abusing his power. Trump incited an assault on the US Capitol in an effort to overturn the 2020 election, and Congress ultimately failed in its duty to convict him for his actions. Twice, impeachment was shown to be a useless tool to keep a president in check.

But again that's a problem of oversight, not of the size and power of government. Still, oversight mechanisms need to be baked into big government programs to insulate them from petty politics or volatile changes from one administration to the next. Take the example of the hypothetical single-payer universal health care system. Laws dictating which treatments should be covered should be designed to ensure that changes to them aren't dictated by the president alone, but through some degree of consensus that involves regulatory boards, Congress, and the courts. Ultimately, social programs should have mechanisms that allow for change so that laws don't become outdated, as they do now. And while it's impossible to guarantee that those changes will always be good, the current system of employer-sponsored health insurance is hardly a stable alternative.

By contrast, shrinking government in the way that Republicans often talk about only makes people more vulnerable. 

Bigger governments — and more bureaucracy — can also insulate public institutions from the whims of an erratic president. For instance, Trump has tried to shutter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a regulatory agency that gets in the way of his and his allies' business. This assault allows Trump to serve his own interests by pleasing his donors.

In other words, Trump is currently trying to make government smaller — by shrinking or eliminating agencies that get in his way — to consolidate power. 

“Despite Donald Trump's rhetoric about the size or inefficiency of government, what he has done is eradicate agencies that directly served people,” said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation who previously served as an associate director at the CFPB. “He may use the language of ‘government inefficiency' to accomplish his goals, but I think what we're seeing is that the goals are in fact to open up more lanes for big businesses to run roughshod over the American people.” 

The problem for small-government advocates is that the alternative to big government is not just small government. It's also big business because fewer services, rules, and regulations open up the door to privatization and monopolization. And while the government, however big, has to answer to the public, businesses are far less accountable. One example of how business can replace government programs is the Republicans' effort to overhaul student loan programs in the latest reconciliation bill the House passed, which includes eliminating subsidized loans and limiting the amount of aid students receive. The idea is that if students can't get enough federal loans to cover the cost of school, they'll turn to private lenders instead. 

“It's not only cutting Pell Grants and the affordability of student loan programs in order to fund tax cuts to the wealthy, but it's also creating a gap where [private lenders] are all too happy to come in,” Margetta Morgan said. “This is the small government alternative: It's cutting back on programs that provided direct services for people — that made their lives better and more affordable — and replacing it with companies that will use that gap as an opportunity for extraction and, in some cases, for predatory services.”

Even with flawed oversight, a bigger and more powerful government is still preferable because it can address people's most basic needs, whereas small government and the privatization of public services often lead to worse outcomes.

So while small government might sound like a nice alternative when would-be tyrants rise to power, the alternative to big government would only be more corrosive to democracy, consolidating power in the hands of even fewer people (and businesses). And ultimately, there's one big way for Trump to succeed at destroying democracy, and that's not by expanding government but by eliminating the parts of government that get in his way.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Middle manager jobs are changing — and it's a career opportunity for millennials and Gen Z","https://www.businessinsider.com/how-middle-managers-can-adapt-to-job-changes-per-linkedin-exec-2025-6","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:26:00 GMT","

Companies are cutting middle management positions, and the roles that remain could change significantly in the years ahead.

Aneesh Raman, LinkedIn's chief economic opportunity officer, believes AI adoption — and the broader economic transformation he expects it to drive — will fundamentally change what it means to be a middle manager over the next decade.

In addition, Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart have announced plans to reduce the number of managers. These cuts to midlevel roles are part of a trend some have dubbed the ""Great Flattening,"" and reflect a broader push to reduce costs and bureaucracy — moves some corporate executives say will make their organizations more efficient. At the same time, companies are grappling with the rise of AI tools and how they might reshape their operations and workforces.

I asked Raman which management skills he thinks will be most critical going forward — and how millennials, many of whom are now in management roles, might navigate their next career challenge: adapting to the evolving role of middle managers. Below are excerpts from our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Are you a middle manager? Please fill out this quick form, or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com or Signal at jzinkula.29.

We're entering a new world of work. Every job is going to look different in five to 10 years.

It's not going to play out in the same way everywhere on the same timeline, but I think every company is trying to figure out how to build organizations that are able to adapt more than we have before — organizations that are less hierarchical and built more around projects.

One of the biggest things that's going to look and feel different in five to 10 years is what it means to be a middle manager in the knowledge economy. The job of the manager was to manage the tasks of the people they managed. The role of the manager in this new economy is to be a coach.

Managers are going to have to think about managing people — not the tasks of people, but the energy of people. How to make sure you've got teams that have psychological safety to test, and try, and fail in the service of building new things. How you're being mindful of where people's skillset and energy are best used in the course of a project as it gets built. It's a whole different way to manage than the old way.

Over the past few years, we've seen change come in waves: remote work, shifting generational values, and rising worker expectations. But AI is different. It's a force, alongside breakthroughs in robotics and quantum computing, that's reshaping every job, in every sector, all at once.

Over the next decade, AI will be the single biggest driver of work transformation and one of the most profound shifts the labor market has ever seen. We have a window right now to shape that shift — to make work more human, not less — but only if we act with urgency and intention.

The reason I think the role of manager is going to change is the same reason I think we're entering a new economy, which is that the role of humans at work is going to be more about coming up with new ideas, coming up with new inventions, coming up with new ways of work as an employee or new businesses as an entrepreneur. That's going to be what will make work linger for humans.

In that world, if you're a manager at a company, you're trying to create the best environment for people to imagine and invent, and that's a different set of tasks than in the previous economy of just tracking people's tasks and making sure those tasks were moving forward.

I think every single person is having their career clock reset right now. Everyone's job is changing on them, even if they aren't changing jobs, and everyone's career trajectory is changing on them, even if they have no plans to change their career trajectory.

That is something that people can approach with anxiety and fear, because we're biologically wired to be anxious and fearful of change, or it can be something that people see opportunity in so that they can start driving their career and their job in ways that give them more agency and more unique contribution than ever before.

If I look at millennials and Gen Z, they have the ""it"" credential right now. They have resilience that is undoubtedly part of how those generations have approached work. They have an adaptability that they've had no choice but to learn, given all the atmospherics that they've had to contend with. Those are really important behaviors that everyone is going to want in their organization.

If you can start by thinking about ""What are my strengths?' And then, ""How do I want to apply those strengths to the job I want to create, the career I want to build?"" There's a great deal of opportunity for people to figure out how they want to lean into that change.

I try to remind people: Remember the early nineties, when no one was quite sure what was coming with the internet and the knowledge economy? Well, imagine if you could go back then and you knew everything that was going to come. What would you do? There are a bunch of opportunities to completely change the trajectory of your career.

I encourage people to think about understanding their strengths, including strengths like resilience and adaptability, and then figuring out how they want to maximize the opportunity that's coming as everything gets remade.

Correction: June 4, 2025 — This story has been updated to clarify that Amazon has not announced middle manager layoffs this year. In September, it said it would flatten team structures and increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers, which could include role eliminations. No terminations have been announced.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Elon Musk slammed Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill.' The stakes are high for Tesla if it becomes law.","https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-big-beautiful-bill-impact-tesla-xai-elon-musk-2025-6","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 02:17:00 GMT","

Tesla could take a hit if President Donald Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" becomes law.

Elon Musk's AI company, however, may get a boost.

Many of Musk's companies rely largely on federal regulations, subsidies, or contracts. That means the GOP's federal spending bill, if signed into law, could directly affect his businesses.

While Musk has previously shared his disapproval of the bill, the billionaire ratcheted up his criticism this week.

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore,"" Musk posted on X on Tuesday. ""This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.""

""Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong,"" he said in criticism directed at the Republican politicians who voted in favor of the bill.

Musk's sharp words for Trump's bill come just days after he officially left his position as the de facto head of the DOGE office, ending his formal work at the White House. In recent weeks, both Trump and Musk have looked to assure the public that their relationship remains intact, even if they disagree on some issues.

The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a briefing on Tuesday that the President already knew where Musk stood on the spending bill and that the Tesla CEO's recent comments criticizing it wouldn't change Trump's stance.

The bill, which champions Trump's agenda, includes cuts to Medicaid and the extension of the tax cuts that the president signed into law during his first term in 2017. It also includes administration priorities, including removing taxes on tips and overtime.

In regard to the companies Musk leads, the bill could have a mixed impact. While Tesla stands to lose, companies such as SpaceX and xAI may benefit from the president's massive spending bill.

The bill, as written, makes big changes to the Biden-era EV tax credits, which are intended to encourage more Americans to buy electric vehicles. It would largely phase out the clean vehicle credit, which lets people buying a new EV claim up to $7,500, and up to $4,000 for used EVs.

Electric vehicles would no longer qualify for the tax credit if the automaker sold more than 200,000 previously qualifying EVs between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025, if the bill became law. Tesla delivered more than 336,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025 alone.

Musk has previously said eliminating the EV tax credit would devastate Tesla's competitors and affect the automaker as well. He said, however, that the move would probably help Tesla in the long term. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Others don't seem sold on Musk's rationale.

Seth Goldstein, an equity strategist at Morningstar, told Business Insider that the expedited elimination of the EV tax credit would be ""the biggest area that could impact Tesla.""

""Consumers have increased long-range EV choices at similar price points as Tesla,"" Goldstein said. ""It's on Tesla to make the case for consumers to even slightly pay up today versus some other EVs.""

Goldstein said that tax credit elimination could lead to a decrease in sales volume, which the automaker has been struggling with.

The JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in an investor note that Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" combined with other proposed legislation, including ending the California Air Resources Board Program, threatened more than half of Tesla's 2025 profits.

Brinkman wrote in the note that the $7,500 consumer tax made up 19% of Tesla's 2024 earnings before interest and tax and could result in a $1.2 billion headwind. He added that the automaker could face a $2 billion headwind from the removal of CARB ZEV credit sales, which encourage the sales of zero-emission vehicles.

Tesla is betting big on AI and robotics as it pushes to reach full autonomy, in part through its coming robotaxi service, efforts that Musk has said are key to growing the company's valuation. Brinkman said any material benefit from Tesla's autonomous robotaxi business was years away, while the headwind from EV subsidy removal would most likely hit the automaker in 2025 and 2026.

""We expect estimates to come down as the impact of Trump Administration EV subsidy removal becomes clearer,"" Brinkman wrote.

Goldstein said the removal of the tax credit could ""accelerate"" Tesla's transition to an AI and robotics company.

It's also possible that the expiration of the EV tax credit on Tesla vehicles could spur some short-term demand from buyers looking to purchase one of the company's EVs before the window closes.

Trump's spending bill wouldn't only change existing taxes and fees. Under its current language, it would also impose a $250 yearly fee for EV drivers through the Federal Highway Administration, and a $100 yearly fee for hybrid vehicles.

As written, the bill also scraps a loan program that Tesla utilized in 2010, long before Trump entered the political scene.

The spending bill also threatens Tesla's energy business, which Musk has said is ""growing like wildfire,"" by ending energy tax credits. The automaker's energy generation and storage business, which includes Tesla's Megapack and Powerwall battery systems, brought in $2.73 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a 67% increase from the year prior.

Musk shared a post on X from the official Tesla Energy account that said, ""Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America's energy independence and the reliability of our grid.""

Tesla Energy also added that it was urging the Senate to enact legislation with a ""sensible wind down"" to continue speedy deployment that supports AI and domestic manufacturing.

""This bill would hurt Tesla around the energy tax credits going away,"" Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst who's a noted Tesla bull, told BI.

Trump's spending bill, if signed into law, may also help his AI company, xAI.

One section of the bill prohibits states and local governments from regulating AI for the next decade in an effort to remove legal barriers related to deploying and adopting AI.

That could allow Musk to develop and advance xAI with less red tape on the regulatory side to slow the company down.

The bill also allocated funds toward modernizing the federal IT system with AI and improving the cybersecurity of its systems. With the government setting money aside to improve its systems, xAI, one of the companies at the forefront of the AI race, could be contracted to power the modernization efforts.

The House-passed version of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill would add $2.42 trillion to US budget deficits over the next decade, according to a new estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

The CBO's calculation, released Wednesday in its so-called scoring of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” reflects a $3.67 trillion decrease in expected revenues and a $1.25 trillion decline in spending over the decade through 2034, relative to baseline projections. The score doesn't account for any potential boost to the economy from the bill, which could offset some of the revenue losses.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

War in Ukraine:

The US is refusing to provide air defenses to back the “reassurance force” the UK and France are planning in a postwar Ukraine, people familiar with the matter said.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has insisted a US so-called backstop is essential to deter Russia from breaching any future ceasefire deal. But European allies have concluded during discussions with their American counterparts that President Donald Trump won't provide the guarantees they have sought to back the Europe-led ‘coalition of the willing,' according to the people, who requested anonymity disclosing private discussions.

Russian intelligence was behind an arson attack on a London warehouse supplying goods to Ukraine — including Starlink satellite equipment — prosecutors alleged at the opening of a trial against six men accused of pushing Moscow's agenda on home soil.

The men live streamed the attack at the east London business, where the SpaceX-made devices and generators were stored in March last year, the prosecutors said. The firm was also involved in organizing humanitarian aid to Ukraine. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Washington will not reciprocate even if Hanoi removes all tariffs on American goods, according to US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, as he said Vietnam re-exports a significant volume of Chinese products to the US.

“Absolutely not, absolutely not. That would be the silliest thing we could do,” Lutnick said when Republican Senator John Kennedy asked him whether the US will respond in kind if Vietnam decides to eliminate all tariffs and trade barriers against American imports, and calling a potential agreement like that “a terrible deal.” ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The costs of the reconciliation bill — as with so many of the GOP's current policies — will be paid by the youngest. And they have no say in the matter.

Not so fast.

The highest price for President Donald Trump's second-term plans will be paid by those who are not yet born.

Yes, it's true that today's lower- and middle-income families will shoulder a large share of the cost — and that's what's getting most of the attention as Republicans push through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a budget reconciliation plan that, for all Trump's populist rhetoric, pursues a mostly conventional Republican approach. It offers a tax policy that rewards the affluent far more than working- or middle-class families and targets substantial spending reductions at programs that mostly benefit blue-collar households.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin for well over an hour about Ukraine's latest attack on Russian airplanes and nuclear talks with Iran.

Putin in that call vowed retaliation against Ukraine for the stunning surprise attack, which Kyiv said resulted in strikes on more than 40 Russian bombers, Trump said.

""It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,"" the president added. 

Trump's post did not say if he discouraged Putin from taking that action during their 75-minute conversation.

""We also discussed Iran, and the fact that time is running out on Iran's decision pertaining to nuclear weapons, which must be made quickly!"" Trump wrote. 

""I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement.""

Putin ""suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion,"" Trump wrote.

The U.S. president said that he believes Iran has been ""slowwalking"" its decision, adding, ""we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!""

In this article

Amazon plans to spend $10 billion on new data centers in North Carolina to expand its artificial intelligence infrastructure, the company said Wednesday.

Amazon has earmarked up to $100 billion this year on capital expenditures, with the lion's share going to AI-related projects. Like other major tech companies, Amazon is racing to build out its capacity to power AI tasks in order to keep pace with rivals including Microsoft, Google and OpenAI.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has called generative AI a ""once-in-a-lifetime type of business opportunity.""

The investment in North Carolina will create roughly 500 jobs in the state, Amazon said.

""Generative AI is driving increased demand for advanced cloud infrastructure and compute power, and our investment will support the future of AI from AWS data centers in the Tar Heel State,"" the company wrote in a blog post.

The company said in January it would spend at least $11 billion in Georgia to build new data centers to support cloud computing and AI demand.

Amazon has announced a slew of generative AI products in the past year, including its own language models, Trainium chips, a shopping chatbot and a marketplace for third-party models called Bedrock. It's also invested $8 billion in AI startup Anthropic, which is known for its Claude chatbot.

Microsoft is giving LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky a bigger job, expanding his role to include oversight of Office productivity software, CNBC has learned.

Roslansky, who took over LinkedIn five years ago, is becoming executive vice president of Office, reporting to Rajesh Jha, Microsoft's executive vice president for experiences and devices, according to a person familiar with the matter. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella informed employees about the change in an email on Wednesday, said the person, who asked not to be named because the email was internal.

In his role as LinkedIn CEO, Roslansky will continue to report to Nadella, the person said.

LinkedIn, which Microsoft acquired in 2016 for $27 billion, will keep operating as a subsidiary, after generating more than $17 billion in revenue over the past year. Roslansky joined LinkedIn in 2009 and previously worked at Yahoo.

In 2022, Microsoft rebranded its Office 365 productivity software bundle, which includes applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams, to Microsoft 365. In addition to overseeing those products, Roslansky's portfolio will also include the M365 Copilot app, which lets users edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. Jha's group released the app in 2020.

""Office is one of the most iconic product suites in history,"" Roslansky wrote in a LinkedIn post. ""It has shaped how the world works, literally. The reach and impact of Office are unmatched. I'm coming into this role in a new, exciting era. Productivity, connection, and AI are converging at scale. Both Office and LinkedIn are used daily by professionals globally, and I'm looking forward to redefining ourselves in this new world.""

As part of the organizational change, Microsoft said Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president for business and industry Copilot products, and his team will move to Jha's unit. They were previously part of Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie's cloud and artificial intelligence group.

Lamanna supervises Dynamics 365 sales and customer service products that compete with Salesforce, as well as the Copilot Studio tool for easily building artificial intelligence agents.

In December, Nadella said that AI agents might become the way that people eventually interact with software systems that were designed for use inside large organizations.

""When was the last time any of us really went to a business application?"" he told investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley on their podcast. He said the company pays for a bunch of cloud software applications, but ""we hardly use them and somebody in the org is sort of inputting data into it.""

""In the AI age, the intensity goes up because all that data now is easy, right?"" Nadella said.

The company's Productivity and Business Processes segment, anchored by Microsoft 365 subscriptions and LinkedIn, has turned more profitable in the past decade. The unit's operating margin in the fiscal third quarter exceeded 58%, compared with 33% in 2017. Revenue was up 10% from a year earlier.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday angrily urged Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates, minutes after the payroll firm ADP reported its lowest monthly private sector jobs number in years.

""ADP NUMBER OUT!!! 'Too Late' Powell must now LOWER THE RATE,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""He is unbelievable!!!"" the president said of the central bank chairman, whom he has frequently pressured to shave borrowing rates in hopes of spurring economic growth.

""Europe has lowered NINE TIMES!"" Trump added.

ADP's report showed that private payrolls ticked up by just 37,000 in May, far below the Dow Jones forecast for 110,000.

It was the lowest monthly reading from ADP since March 2023.

The weak result came two days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release its own monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which is much more closely watched than ADP's figure.

The two reports don't usually mirror each other, largely due to the different ways they collect data. But this can be a good thing, by giving economists a fuller picture of what's happening in the labor market.

Economists polled by Dow Jones expect the upcoming BLS report for May to show an increase of 125,000 jobs.

Trump met with Powell at the White House last week to discuss the economy, but readouts from both sides suggest that the private meeting turned confrontational.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump told Powell that the Fed chairman was ""making a mistake by not lowering interest rates, which is putting us at an economic disadvantage to China and other countries."" The Fed said that Powell stressed to Trump that monetary policy must be guided by objective economic data, not politics.

Trump has attacked Powell regularly since retaking office, calling him a ""major loser"" and branding him with the derisive nickname ""Too Late"" as a criticism of the Fed continuing to hold rates steady.

Trump has repeatedly hinted that he was considering firing the Fed chair before his term expires in May 2026, even as Powell maintains that the president cannot legally remove him.

Trump appeared to back down from his threat in April, saying he had ""no intention"" of firing Powell. But he has continued to publicly vent his frustrations about the Fed chair.

As Powell keeps his powder dry, the European Central Bank on Thursday is likely to lower rates again, marking the eighth cut since last June.

The expected move comes as the euro zone experiences easing inflation and tepid growth, teeing up more interest rate cuts even as Trump's mercurial tariffs and other geopolitical forces stoke global economic uncertainty.

U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies have rocked global equities in recent weeks, driving investors to seek out pockets of safety in financial markets.

One of the beneficiaries of the market volatility has been the Swiss franc, widely seen as a safe haven asset in times of macroeconomic or geopolitical uncertainty. The Swiss currency has appreciated 10% against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year – but inside Switzerland's borders, rising demand for the franc is stirring up challenges for policymakers.

The Swiss franc was last seen trading 0.2% higher against the greenback, with $1 buying around 0.82 Swiss francs. Switzerland's currency, which was trading flat earlier on Wednesday, rallied after ADP data showed hiring slowed to a two-year low in America's private sector last month.



A strong franc puts deflationary pressure on Switzerland. As the currency appreciates, imports – which play a significant role in the country's economy – become cheaper.

For some countries, this effect might be a welcome reprieve from sticky inflation. But while many developed markets, such as the U.S. and the U.K., are still working to bring inflation down to their 2% targets, Switzerland is facing the opposite problem: prices are falling too much.

Swiss inflation turned negative in May, with the country's Consumer Price Index falling by 0.1% year-on-year. The price of imported goods contracted significantly, falling by 2.4% on an annual basis after staying flat in the previous month.

Charlotte de Montpellier, senior France and Switzerland economist at ING, noted the role the currency rally was playing in the country's inflation picture.

""The latest decline is largely driven by external factors,"" she said in a note on Tuesday. ""A strong Swiss franc has significantly reduced the cost of imported goods ... Given that imports make up 23% of the CPI basket, this has a notable impact on overall inflation in Switzerland.""

The May data marked Switzerland's first return to deflation since the Covid-19 pandemic. It could push the Swiss National Bank toward utilizing two key policies previously implemented to address what De Montpellier labeled a ""persistent headache"" for the central bank.

The SNB ended a seven-year stretch of negative interest rates in 2022 — an unpopular policy with savers and lenders, as they eliminate returns on savings deposits and squeeze banks' margins and profitability.

At its most recent meeting in March, the central bank cut its key rate by 25 basis points to 0.25%.

In the wake of this week's inflation data, the SNB is expected to ""seek to combat the appreciation of the Swiss franc with the weapons at its disposal,"" De Montpellier said.

ING expects the SNB to cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points at its next meeting later this month — and De Montpellier argued that further cuts will likely follow.

""Based on current data, a return to negative interest rates before year-end appears increasingly probable,"" she said. ""Our base case includes a second 25bp cut in September, bringing the policy rate to -0.25%. While the SNB would prefer to avoid deeper cuts, a 50bp reduction in June cannot be ruled out.""

While ING expects Swiss policymakers to stop cutting rates at -0.25%, De Montpellier said a further strengthening of the Swiss franc ""could force [the SNB's] hand,"" leaving it with little choice but to take rates further into negative territory.

Lily Fang, a professor of finance at business school INSEAD, told CNBC that current conditions were likely to push Switzerland back into a negative rates environment — a move that SNB Chair Martin Schlegel has stressed remains on the table.

""The Swiss authorities are clearly concerned, because … it's a small, open economy that relies on international trade, and the U.S. in particular is their single most important trading partner beyond the EU bloc,"" Fang said in a phone call.

""Switzerland has already gone ahead and lowered rates ahead of the EU. I think it is very likely to go to zero and even negative.""

Another tool the SNB has previously used to cool the Swiss franc is intervening in the foreign exchange market by selling the franc and purchasing foreign currencies.

However, with U.S. President Donald Trump back in the White House, this strategy now comes with political challenges.

Back in 2020, the U.S. Treasury, under the first Trump administration, labeled Switzerland a currency manipulator, accusing it of deliberately devaluing the Swiss franc against the greenback. The SNB denied those allegations at the time.

Trump's full list of so-called reciprocal tariffs said ""currency manipulation and trade barriers"" had been factored into calculating the levies individual countries were imposing on the United States. The administration said it had calculated that Switzerland — which abolished all industrial tariffs last year — charged tariffs of 61% to the U.S., and it would therefore slap new tariffs of 31% onto Swiss goods.

While ING's De Montpellier acknowledged that any possible FX intervention from the SNB risked ""provoking the ire of the US administration,"" she argued it was likely the central bank would intervene in markets in the coming months.

Alex King, a former FX trader and founder of personal finance platform Generation Money, agreed that any direct purchase of foreign currencies by the SNB was ""unlikely to sit well with the US administration.""

""When Switzerland was labelled a currency manipulator in 2020 the threat of tariffs wasn't such a major factor, but it now has a dilemma on its hands,"" he told CNBC in an email. ""If it was to intervene directly again in FX markets, it could get hit with higher US tariffs, and the negative impact of this could be worse than short term inflationary pressures.""

Last month, SNB's Schlegel said Swiss officials had held constructive talks with the U.S. on the central bank's FX interventions, in comments cited by Bloomberg.

""We have never influenced the exchange rate to get us an advantage,"" he reportedly told an audience in the Swiss city of Lucerne.

""I'm not sure that they will immediately go and use currency intervention, market intervention, because the U.S. tends to be … labeling countries 'manipulators,'"" added INSEAD's Fang. ""I don't think that they really want to be labeled as a manipulator again, [so] I think that they will use that probably as a last resort tool.""

Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa on Wednesday said the short-term focus is to fix the struggling automaker, as it undergoes major restructuring efforts to get back on a solid footing.

""I think in the short term, the focus that we have is to fix ourselves,"" Espinosa told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""We are convinced that the plan is enough and robust,"" he added.

Espinosa, who only assumed leadership of the Japanese automaker in April, faces an uphill battle to change the tide of Nissan's whittled down fortunes.

The firm has been contending with declining sales, the transition to electric vehicles and steep global competition, particularly from Chinese rivals. 

These challenges have now been exacerbated by U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping 50% global tariffs on steel and aluminum, along with other so-called reciprocal levies on individual countries that are briefly reduced under a reprieve set to expire in July.

Last month, Espinosa revealed the company's plans to slash 11,000 jobs and shut down seven plants, amid expectations of a 3% drop in sale volumes in the current fiscal year.

At the end of last year, the company fleetingly flirted with a possible tie-up with Japanese peer Honda in talks that could have created the world's third largest automaker by sales — but negotiations broke down in February.

""The size of the task is big,"" Espinosa said.

""Our landing was not good in 2024, and thus we have a transformation that has to come. But this is a problem that did not start like two years ago, it's a fundamental problem that we're fixing. If you take a step back, eight to 10 years ago, the company had very lofty goals for growth.""

Nissan's management had previously targeted annual sales of 8 million cars per year, and, as such, the company invested heavily on capacity, human resources and capital expenditure.

Ultimately, however, the company peaked at annual sales of 5.6 million — back in 2016 — and Nissan is now running at sales of 3.3 million to 3.4 million cars per year, Espinosa said.

""We are re-sizing the company and this is why we have accelerated our efforts on cost, both fixed cost [and] viable cost. So, we have very deep initiatives under our new Re:Nissan plan and we're devoted to it,""  Espinosa said.

Tokyo-listed shares of Nissan are down 24% year-to-date.

The Social Security Administration has now processed about 91% of cases related to a new law that is prompting higher benefits and lump-sum retroactive payments for nearly 3 million people, according to a new update from the agency.

The Social Security Fairness Act, which was signed into law in January, eliminated two provisions — the Windfall Elimination Provision, or WEP, and the Government Pension Offset, or GPO — that previously reduced benefits for individuals who also receive income from public pensions that did not require the payment of Social Security payroll taxes.

At the start of the year, the Social Security Administration said affected beneficiaries may have to wait more than one year to see their payments adjusted.

The agency credits automation for helping it to expedite those payments.

The Social Security Administration currently plans to update all beneficiary records affected by the law by early November.

However, the agency is ""working to exceed its estimate"" under new commissioner Frank Bisignano, a Social Security Administration official said via email.

""Commissioner Bisignano committed to senators during his confirmation process that this would be finished 'while the weather is warm' and he will keep his promise,"" the Social Security Administration official said.

Here's the latest on the Fairness Act payments.

The Social Security Fairness Act, which was signed into law on Jan. 5, affects certain individuals who are eligible for Social Security benefits, but who also receive pensions from work that did not require the payment of Social Security payroll taxes.

Examples of those affected include teachers, firefighters and police officers; federal employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement System; and people who are covered by a foreign social security system, according to the Social Security Administration.

Notably, not everyone in those groups will receive a benefit increase, according to the agency. About 72% of state and local public employees pay Social Security taxes, and therefore were not affected by the new law, according to the agency.

The provisions that had previously been in place reduced Social Security benefits for more than 2.8 million people, according to SSA. To date, the agency has processed about 2.5 million cases, the agency said in its latest update.

Railroad Retirement Board beneficiaries also stand to receive adjusted annuity payments because of the law. New monthly annuity amounts for most individuals will begin in July, and one-time retroactive payments are due to arrive by the end of July, according to a Railroad Retirement Board spokeswoman.

Individuals affected may see monthly Social Security check increases ranging from ""very little"" to more than $1,000 per month, according to SSA.

The changes will result in higher monthly payments ranging from $360 to $1,190, depending on individual circumstances, the Congressional Budget Office previously estimated. 

Affected beneficiaries will also see lump-sum payments dating back as far back as January 2024. Notably, Social Security benefit payments for January 2024 were received by beneficiaries in February 2024, according to the Social Security Administration.

For each beneficiary, the monthly benefit increases and any back payments are processed together, the Social Security official said.

The Social Security Administration is now prioritizing the remaining complex cases that could not be automated, according to the Social Security official.

Those cases require additional time to manually update records to process both the retroactive and new benefits.

The roughly 300,000 individuals who are still waiting may have unique circumstances, notes David A. Weaver, a former Social Security Administration executive who currently teaches statistics at the University of South Carolina.

For example, some eligible beneficiaries who have recently died may qualify for the lump-sum retroactive payments, Weaver said. In those circumstances, the Social Security Administration would likely try to issue that money to survivors.

Others may be affected by overpayments, whereby the Social Security Administration issued benefit payments that were too high. In those cases, the agency will generally seek reimbursement for the excess sums that were issued.

In addition to the cases that require manual processing, there are people who are now newly eligible to apply for Social Security benefits as a result of the law, Weaver said.

Those individuals may need to file an application, according to the Social Security Administration. The date of the application may determine benefit start date and benefit amount.

As the implementation of the Social Security Fairness Act moves to completion, it may be wise for Congress to ask the Government Accountability Office to audit that process, Weaver said.

That may allow for an evaluation of the final administrative costs for processing the benefit changes due to the law, including both the manual cases and additional new claims, as well as phone calls from the public about the changes, he said.

That investigation could also evaluate whether other agency work was sidelined as the benefit changes were processed, he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","The European Central Bank is almost guaranteed to cut rates. Here's what could happen next","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/04/the-ecb-is-almost-guaranteed-to-cut-rates-what-could-it-do-next.html","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 08:29:45 GMT","



The European Central Bank is all but guaranteed to trim its key interest rate on Thursday.

Markets were last pricing in an around 99% chance of a 25-basis-point cut, according to LSEG data. That would take the deposit facility rate to 2% — half of the mid-2023 high of 4%.

But Europe faces a highly uncertain economic outlook, raising the question of what the ECB could do beyond Thursday's meeting.

Inflation is now hovering around the central bank's 2% target again, with flash data on Tuesday showing consumer prices in the euro zone rose just 1.9% in May. Meanwhile, economic growth has still been sluggish: The gross domestic product in the euro zone grew by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, according to the latest estimate.

The bloc faces many unknowns, both at home and abroad. That includes U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff agenda — widely regarded as having a negative impact on growth — and potential retaliatory moves from the European Union, as well as how the EU's major rearmament plans and Germany's big fiscal shift could play out.

Here's what analysts say about the central bank's potential next steps, and what they might mean for consumers.

Analysts and economists are widely expecting more interest rate cuts from the ECB later in the year, but aren't counting on the bank to give a strong indication of where exactly rates could be headed.

Tuesday's inflation figures increased chances that, after this week, the next rate trim could come as soon as July, said Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist.

Others struck a more cautious tone, with Barclays economists suggesting in a note last week that rate cuts are on the horizon but won't be implemented as soon.

""We believe the ECB will remain non-committal on its policy path and continue to follow a meeting-by-meeting approach to maintain flexibility and optionality in policy calibration,"" they said.

They're also expecting more rate cuts from the ECB, forecasting two more 25-basis-point reductions in September and December — meaning the ECB would hold rates steady over the summer months.

Elsewhere, a BofA Global Research report published earlier this week said the ECB was now ""running out of reasons not to go below 2%,"" echoing the suggestion of further rate cuts on the horizon.

But, it noted, the ECB is unlikely to give hints about just how low it could go.

""We expect some acknowledgment that door is open to move rates below 2%, but a very explicit signal is unlikely. Uncertainty on tariffs will give the Governing Council enough cover to not pre-commit to more,"" the report said.

Crucially, the ECB will also publish its latest staff projections this week, highlighting what it expects for inflation and economic growth. That comes after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's latest Economic Outlook report, which forecast 1% growth and 2.2% inflation for the euro area this year.

For consumers, more ECB rate cuts would mainly affect borrowing and savings rates.

Exactly how it plays out for them depends on what type of products they hold, and how long the rates on them are set for, Bas van Geffen, senior macro strategist at RaboResearch, told CNBC.

For example, he said, a 10-year fixed mortgage and a demand deposit would be affected in different ways.

""The interest rate on short-term deposits tends to follow the deposit rate quite closely,"" he said.

""A week after the ECB meeting, the policy rate goes into effect. So, if the ECB cuts the deposit rate Thursday, banks will receive 0.25% lower interest on their deposits with the central bank. This may cause them to lower the interest rate they pay on savings accounts as well,"" van Geffen explained.

Products with fixed longer-term rates have a more complicated relationship with central bank interest rates, he said, as they're not only determined by the current policy rate — which often changes — but also by future expectations.

""The market has long been expecting the ECB to cut rates this week. So, that may already be included in long-term interest rates to some extent. That also means that these long-term rates do not necessarily change after this week's policy decision,"" van Geffen said.

Oops, something went wrong

Michael Saylor's imitators are multiplying fast.

Dozens of publicly traded companies, a media firm controlled by President Trump's family, and meme stock poster child GameStop (GME) are all piling into a bet that Saylor used to turn a business intelligence software firm into a bitcoin juggernaut called Strategy (MSTR).

The blueprint developed by Saylor is to use a combination of debt and equity to add bitcoin to a company's balance sheet — and lots of it.

Since Saylor first announced his plans to do so in August 2020, Strategy has spent $40.7 billion to amass more than 580,000 bitcoins and become the largest corporate holder of the world's largest cryptocurrency.

His company's stock has climbed more than 2,900%, far ahead of the S&P 500's 76% gain.

Now, many imitators are trying to replicate that stock price success with their own big bets, adding bitcoin to their balance sheets even if their companies initially operated outside the cryptocurrency industry.

Since 2023, public companies have increased their exposure to the digital asset by 160% and now hold roughly 3.4% of all bitcoins in circulation, according to Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani.

In all, 80 companies have adopted the so-called “bitcoin standard” by holding bitcoin as part of their treasury reserves, according to Bernstein and data tracked by Coinkite. Many of them are issuing equity, leveraging debt, or a combination of both to fund their investments.

Recently, the limits for investor interest in such a play were tested. Last week, the stocks of Trump's namesake media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), and video game retailer GameStop each fell about 10% following separate announcements to amass bitcoin.

Trump Media unveiled plans to raise $2.5 billion to create what it claims will be one of the largest bitcoin treasuries held by any public company, noting it is part of a broader strategy to integrate digital assets across its media and financial ecosystem.

""We view bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom,"" Trump Media CEO and chair Devin Nunes said in the release.

GameStop, perhaps the best-known meme stock embraced by everyday investors during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, said it purchased 4,710 bitcoin — an investment valued at over $500 million at the time of the announcement.

GameStop and Trump Media — the parent company of social media platform Truth Social and streaming service Truth+ — are not the only firms outside of the cryptocurrency world making a pivot to Saylor's approach.

Of the 80 firms that now hold bitcoin as part of their treasury reserves, at least 36 originated in sectors other than cryptocurrency, according to a Yahoo Finance review of company websites and filings.

That includes companies involved in everything from coal production and auto insurance to video gaming and online retail.

“It's not complicated, it's not even risky, in my opinion, it's just novel,” Saylor last month said to an audience that showed up for an Orlando, Fla., conference focused on showing other firms how to adopt his bitcoin treasury strategy.

“If you want to 10x your money, you buy bitcoin,” he added. “If you want 100x your money, you buy bitcoin with someone else's money. If you want to 1000x your money, you buy bitcoin with someone else's money and then you leverage the bitcoin.”

The stock market's consolidation into the major tech giants has eliminated the chances for smaller firms to give their shareholders returns in line with major stock indexes, he told the audience of corporate treasurers, financial officers, and other executives.

Bitcoin, Saylor explained, was their best chance out of this predicament.

“MSTR's Bitcoin acquisition playbook demonstrates how small-low growth companies can optimize capital allocation from a low growth business to a high yielding BTC treasury,” Bernstein's Chhugani wrote in a May report.

“Since there is no visible road ahead for value creation” at those firms, and “the success of the MSTR model offers them a rare value creation path, these companies are uniquely positioned to adopt Strategy's Bitcoin playbook,” Chhugani added.

There are risks to this approach, however, since bitcoin can be volatile.

The price of bitcoin is up roughly 57% over the past year and rose as high as over $109,000 in January. But the price also plummeted below $80,000 in April as Trump's trade war roiled the stock market before it recovered again.

“The main risk in running a leveraged 'bitcoin treasury' strategy is that a rapid drop in the price of bitcoin would lead to a possibility of bankruptcy,” NYU Stern School of Business professor David Yermack told Yahoo Finance.

Another challenge is that “MSTR's scale is hard to replicate,” Chhugani wrote. “Not every Bitcoin treasury will be successful simply replicating MSTR's playbook, in our view.”

The risks aren't dimming the enthusiasm of investors who have poured billions into companies making some version of Strategy's bets in the past several months, and some of the biggest players haven't even launched.

“I'm personally curious to see how the market is going to figure us out,” Jack Mallers, CEO of Twenty One Capital Inc., a soon-to-be public company imitating Saylor's Strategy with backing from Japanese investment firm SoftBank, stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings, and Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald LP.

Twenty One has raised $685 million in capital from private investors by issuing both debt and equity, making it the third-largest bitcoin holding company.

It plans to list via a special purpose acquisition vehicle spun up by Cantor called Cantor Equity Partners (CEP).

The stock price for this investment vehicle has climbed 300% since its April announcement.

While admitting doubts that all firms imitating Strategy will make it, Mallers pointed to bitcoin's 16-and-a-half-year track record as the clearest signal for his firm's future success.

“Investors should always be careful assuming they're intellectually superior to the market,"" Mallers said. ""That's how you get yourself burned.""

Another Strategy follower, Nakamoto Holdings, wants to add another layer of complexity to the bitcoin treasury scheme when it officially launches in the third quarter through a reverse merger. The plan is to acquire and become a maker of more Strategy imitators.

David Bailey, a crypto adviser to Trump and founder of BTC Inc., will run the company as CEO post-merger. He said in an interview last month that Nakamoto is seeking to turn 25 separate public companies into Strategy imitators “within the year.""

“We're inspired by Michael Saylor, but we're not just running the bitcoin treasury play,” Bailey told Yahoo Finance.

Nakamoto, which will trade under the ticker NAKA, saw its fundraising surge in reaction to Twenty One Capital's announcement. Through a mix of equity and short-term loans from private investors, including Chinese crypto billionaire Jihan Wu, the company has raised $710 million, according to its press release.

KindlyMD, the healthcare software company Nakamoto is using as a vehicle for quick public listing, has seen its stock climb 370% since the May 12 announcement.

“Frankly, it's almost like the meme stock phenomenon where we know people are piling in just because it has worked for MicroStrategy,” Columbia Business School professor Omid Malekan said.

“Whatever benefit there is to be had in a number-go-up market could become problematic in a number-go-down market.”

In this article

President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform moved a step closer to having a bitcoin exchange-traded fund available to everyday investors. 

NYSE Arca, the all-electronic arm of the New York Stock Exchange that handles most ETF trading, filed on Tuesday to list a bitcoin fund linked to the president's media company, the latest sign of Trump's expanding push into the crypto world. Known as a 19b-4 form, the filing is required before regulators can decide whether to allow the fund to launch and trade on a U.S. exchange.

Called the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, the fund is designed to track the price of bitcoin and offer a simpler way for investors to gain exposure without holding the asset directly. The filing follows an announced partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com in March to bring a suite of digital asset products to market later this year, pending regulatory approval.

Those planned offerings include baskets of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and Crypto.com's native Cronos token, combined with traditional securities. The products will be branded under Trump Media and made available to global investors through major brokerage platforms and the Crypto.com app, which serves more than 140 million users worldwide.

Since the January 2024 launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, the market has swelled to more than $130 billion in total assets. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) accounts for the lion's share, with nearly $69 billion in assets, making it the largest digital asset manager in the world.

Trump is the majority owner of Truth Social's parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group, which has made a series of crypto-aligned moves in recent months — from trademarking digital asset products to unveiling a $2.5 billion bitcoin treasury plan last week in Las Vegas. If approved, the ETF would represent one of the most politically connected entries into the booming market for bitcoin funds.

 Since the IBIT ETF futures are only available to accredited investors, the latest crypto developments in Russia left many retail players unimpressed. 

Moscow Exchange (MOEX), Russia's largest stock exchange, launched futures trading for BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), as the fund climbed into the world's top 25 ETFs by assets under management (AUM).

MOEX introduced a futures contract tied to IBIT on June 4, according to an announcement by the exchange.

The new investment product is accessible exclusively to accredited investors, with MOEX planning to introduce qualification testing from June 23.

The launch comes as IBIT entered the list of top 25 ETFs by assets worldwide, with an AUM of $72.4 billion, according to Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

Moscow Exchange's IBIT futures trading debut is the latest crypto investment product launch in Russia since the Bank of Russia authorized financial institutions to offer crypto products to qualified investors in May.

Following the green light, major local commercial banks, including Sber and T-Bank (formerly Tinkoff Bank), have started offering investment tools tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).

Despite this expansion, the Russian central bank remains cautious about direct crypto investments and continues to advise against retail participation in digital asset markets.  

Since products like IBIT ETF futures are only available to accredited investors, many retail investors are unimpressed by the latest crypto developments in Russia.

“Not real ETFs from the US, just a copy. Which does not affect the crypto market in any way,” one disgruntled observer commented to the news on the DeCenter channel on Telegram.

Another commentator hinted that they'd rather directly trade cryptocurrencies on exchanges like Binance than crypto investment products on MOEX.

According to official MOEX data, the number of individuals with brokerage accounts on MOEX amounted to 36.9 million as of May. Last month, at least 3.6 million people made transactions on the MOEX stock market, with 315,000 individuals representing qualified private investors.

BlackRock's IBIT has continued its meteoric rise since its launch in January 2024. On June 3, the ETF entered the global top 25 list by assets under management, a feat achieved in just over a year.

“At 1.4 years old, IBIT is the youngest on the list by nine times,” Bloomberg's ETF expert Balchunas wrote on X on Tuesday.

“It's like an infant hanging out with teenagers and twenty-somethings. Quite possibly the most insane IBIT stat yet,” he added.

BlackRock's IBIT Bitcoin ETF has been breaking records since its historical launch in January 2024. In just three months, IBIT raked in nearly $15.5 billion of inflows, which placed it among the top 10 longest inflow streaks for any ETF in history.

Ethereum is suddenly the belle of the crypto ball once again, leaving rivals like Solana in its wake.

After stagnating for more than a year, Ethereum has clawed its way back into relevance this quarter. 

Its price is up 44% in the last month, massively outperforming Solana's modest 7% and even besting Bitcoin's 26% uptick during the period.

And the main reason why? Ethereum, once again, is winning the confidence of investors that it can rewire finance.

“The recent rally in Ethereum's price isn't just about short-term positioning, but rather is a reflection of a deeper shift in the market's understanding of what the future of blockchain infrastructure will look like,” Dom Harz, cofounder of BOB, a hybrid layer 2 blockchain, told DL News.

That proposition is appealing to institutional investors.

Ethereum exchange-traded funds have consistently notched positive daily flows in the last month. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $1.2 billion in outflows this week.

There's more. Ethereum has drawn attention for its recent Pectra upgrade, and investors are taking note of the “narrative shift.”

“Ethereum is the likeliest platform choice for many financial institutions due to its superior security and stability,” Sygnum analysts wrote in the bank's monthly investment outlook report for June.

There's onchain data to support that.

Ethereum has recorded more than $1 billion in flows into the network in the last three months, dwarfing all other blockchains, including its layer 2 networks. 

This massive inflow spike coincided with the Pectra upgrade, which analysts say has helped Ethereum regain the initiative from layer 2 networks that some critics said were economically strip-mining it.

Meanwhile, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has laid out plans to increase Ethereum's scalability tenfold by next year. 

Buterin has proposed expanding the network's ability to handle more transactions per block and also implementing stateless clients, network nodes that don't store Ethereum's entire history, a move that could reduce hardware demands for some participants.

Still, the question remains whether Ethereum's recent sprint will translate into sustained momentum for the blockchain marathon. 

Despite the price uptick this quarter, Ethereum is still 46% below its all-time high of over $4,800.

A staking-based ETF, previously seen as a regulatory long shot, could be the catalyst to boost Ethereum's price prospects. Such products suddenly seem possible thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission softening its stance on staking-based vehicles not qualifying as securities.

But Ethereum isn't lapping the field just yet as its rivals are looking to reclaim lost ground. Despite losing its edge amid backlash over the memecoin-fuelled craze, Solana proponents say the network is working to course-correct.

Solana is working on a major network overhaul, Alpenglow, that is expected to be rolled out in stages. The Alpenglow upgrade aims to reduce local fees markets and make the network 100 times faster.

XRP is also quietly gaining traction as a crypto asset for corporate balance sheets. Companies like VivoPower and Webus have announced plans to begin stockpiling XRP.

Berachain is gearing up to be the first non-Ethereum Layer-1 blockchain to fully activate Pectra's new execution-layer features.

Its Bectra hard fork goes live Wednesday, giving more than 100 apps on the chain access to tools that could enhance how users and developers interact with the platform.

This a step forward for Berachain, an EVM-identical chain that uses a unique Proof-of-Liquidity consensus model.

Because Berachain's consensus model is different from Ethereum's, it doesn't include Pectra's consensus changes. But since it's EVM-compatible, developers don't need to rewrite existing contracts — a relief for the 200-plus apps already live on the network.

Proof of Liquidity (PoL) is a way for blockchains like Berachain to secure their network by rewarding users who provide liquidity, like money or tokens, instead of just staking coins to secure the network (like in Proof of Stake).

This makes the system strong and stable because it encourages people to put their assets to work, which helps the blockchain grow and be more secure.

For users, the Bectra upgrade means every wallet can now work like a smart account. They will be able to batch transactions in one click, set spending limits, pay gas with HONEY (Berachain's stablecoin), or even set up recurring payments. Previously, these features needed custom contracts or third-party implementations (which have security concerns).

The Bectra upgrade demonstrates how chains like Berachain are striving to keep pace with Ethereum's rapid development, particularly as rollups gain momentum and other chains seek to differentiate themselves in the crowded EVM landscape.

Berachain's BERA is down 2% in the past 24 hours alongside with a slight drop in the broader market.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are showing signs of recovery after a period of consolidation and bearish pressure. BTC, ETH and XRP prices rebound slightly, approaching their key resistance levels; a daily close above could open the door for further upside.

Bitcoin price declined and closed below its daily level of $106,406 last week. However, it recovered slightly during the weekend and also on Monday. BTC faced resistance again around the $106,406 level the next day. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it recovers slightly, approaching this resistance level.

If BTC recovers and closes above $106,406, it could extend the rally toward its all-time high of $111,980.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 54 and points upwards after rebounding from its neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum is gaining traction.

BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC fails to close above the $106,406 daily resistance, it could extend the decline to retest its next key support level at $100,000, a psychological level.

Ethereum price has been consolidating between $2,461 and $2,724, its 200-day EMA and daily resistance levels, respectively, for 26 consecutive days. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades slightly above, nearing its upper consolidation level at $2,724.

If ETH breaks and closes above its upper consolidation level at $2,724, it could extend the rally toward its psychologically important level at $3,000.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 62, above its neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum.

ETH/USDT daily chart

However, if the 200-day EMA at $2,461 fails to hold as support, ETH could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $2,329, its 50-day EMA.

XRP price closed below its daily support at $2.23 on Friday and declined by 4.65%. However, it recovered from its fall in the next four days. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it is approaching its key resistance at $2.23.

If XRP breaks above the $2.23 level and closes above its 50-day EMA at $2.27, it could extend the recovery to retest its next resistance level at $2.72.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 47 and points upward toward its neutral level of 50, indicating a weakening of bearish momentum.

XRP/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if XRP faces rejection from its $2.23 level, it could extend the decline to retest its next daily support at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Aave gains toward $270 after testing support at $240, backed by a solid bullish structure. Aave ecosystem voted in favor of a decentralized risk mitigation mechanism called Umbrella, designed to protect Aave suppliers from bad debt.

Bitcoin recovery is limited between support at around $103,000 and resistance at approximately $106,800. The number of Bitcoins on exchanges continues to drop, reaching the lowest level since August 2018.

Uniswap (UNI) edges higher by over 2% at press time on Wednesday after Spark Finance goes live on Unichain, deploying sUSDC stable yield for users. UNI bounces off a crucial support level, while increasing whale activity adds to the bullish potential.

Bitcoin price faces rejection around the $106,406 key level on Wednesday, hinting at a potential correction ahead. On-chain data shows that BTC's profit-taking activity reached record levels on Tuesday, signaling growing selling pressure.

Bitcoin (BTC) is stabilizing around $106,000 on Friday, following three consecutive days of correction that have resulted in a near 3% decline so far this week. The correction in BTC prices was further supported by the profit-taking activity of its holders, which has reached a three-month high.

The Bitcoin price is still ping-ponging between support and resistance, but is still moving in favor of the bulls at this point. This is due to the fact that the price is still holding well above $100,000, and this is a psychological level that could be a determinant of a bull or bear move. Amid this, crypto analyst Xanrox believes that the Bitcoin price is headed down after hitting its new all-time high close to $112,000, and this downtrend would push altcoins down further.

Why The Bitcoin Price Is Breaking Down

The reason for the Bitcoin price decline, as outlined by the crypto analyst, is that the leading cryptocurrency is actually breaking down out of an ascending parallel channel that was formed while the price moved from $74,000 to $112,000. This was seen in the initial downtrend that sent Bitcoin from $111,000 down to $103,000, before the relief rally.

In addition to the ascending channel, the crypto analyst also points out the formation of a symmetrical triangle inside the channel. This is also important to keep an eye on since symmetrical triangles are known for sweeping liquidity. While these liquidity sweeps are not one-sided, it is still notable as it can sweep liquidity above and below the triangle. Probabilities of the direction of the liquidity sweep increase in a direction depending on whether the bears or bulls are currently dominating.

Xanrox also explains that the Bitcoin price has already completed the five full waves of the Elliot Wave theory, and as such, the next thing is a corrective ABC wave. In this case, it is expected to fall back to the 0.382, 0.500, and 0.618 Fibonacci levels again.

Where To Start Buying

With the expectation that the Fibonacci levels will fall to 0.382, then 0.500, and then 0.618, the first culprit for where the Bitcoin price is expected to fall to is just below $98,000. At this level, the crypto analyst believes that it is time to start buying. In addition to the chart formations, Xanrox also calls out an unfilled Fair Value Gap (FV) at this level, and once it fills, it is a great level to start buying before the next wave to the upside.

If this decline does happen, then altcoins are expected to actually fall further from here. This would put them at great buy levels as well, especially as altcoins are sitting so close to all-time low levels. However, after the first FVG is filled and there isn't strong momentum, the second Fibonacci level at 0.500 puts the Bitcoin price at $92,000.

Meanwhile, the third and last Fibonacaill level at 0.618 puts it as low as $87,500. “Usually we want to look for a buying opportunity at the 0.382, 0.500, or 0.618 FIB levels,” the crypto analyst explained.

 Blockchain has already played a role in protecting consumers against food fraud, but there are lessons to be learned before it starts to truly pay off. 

Food fraud siphons up to $50 billion from the global food industry every year and endangers public health. When deployed rigorously and realistically, blockchain could prevent this shadowy crime.

The problem? It comes with a high price tag. Scalability, cost, interoperability and integration pose significant barriers. Not to mention the privacy concerns, regulatory uncertainty and long path to stakeholder adoption.

But food fraud isn't going anywhere. As David Carvalho, CEO of Naoris Protocol, observed: 

So, what's to be done? And how can blockchain implementation truly be achieved?

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) outlines that food fraud involves purposefully deceiving customers about the quality or content of the food they buy.

Essentially, it's the intentional substitution, addition or removal of materials for economic gain.

The typologies of fraud are diverse and sophisticated. These include mislabeling, theft, counterfeiting and dilution.

Real-world examples abound. Melamine has been added to milk in China to falsify protein content. Horsemeat has been sold as beef in Europe. Olive oil is often diluted with cheaper vegetable oils.

The economic toll is staggering. But the actual cost is far higher when accounting for reputational damage, regulatory compliance, legal battles and the erosion of consumer loyalty. 

In some cases, the human cost can be far more devastating; the 2008 melamine scandal in China harmed over 300,000 infants.

Temujin Louie, CEO of Wanchain, highlighted the vicious cycle created by food fraud: 

The damage is not calculated as the sum of individual losses. It should be calculated as a systemic weakening of the food industry's foundation.

The complexity and opacity of global supply chains create fertile ground for fraud. The cold chain is particularly vulnerable.

Failures in cold chain logistics can lead to spoilage. These failures allow fraudsters to misrepresent storage conditions or sell compromised goods as fresh.

Fraud is not limited to high-profile cases or luxury goods. Dairy, spices, seafood, organic products, honey and fruit juices are frequent targets. 

Carvalho added that fragmented data systems are a major Achilles' heel: 

Fraudulent products enter and move through the system undetected without shared, reliable data.

Blockchain technology can serve as an antidote to this growing crisis. Yet Louie cautioned that attempts in blockchain-based accountancy have had their share of challenges.

“In the 10+ years since Ethereum launched, we've yet to witness any true disruption,” Louie warned. “One reason why the promise of blockchains in supply chains has been largely unfulfilled is that early adopters were guilty of oversimplifying the problem.”

Blockchain technology's core principles can create a more transparent and trustworthy system. Decentralization ensures that no single entity controls the data. And immutability guarantees that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted.

The benefits don't end there. Selective transparency enables sharing relevant information with authorized stakeholders without exposing sensitive commercial data. Meanwhile, smart contracts can automate processes and enforce agreements. 

Ultimately, cryptography ensures the integrity and security of the ledger. And to take it even further, integrating Internet-of-Things sensors with blockchain creates an immutable audit trail of environmental conditions, crucial for cold chain integrity.

Real-world implementations are beginning to bear fruit. In collaboration with IBM, Walmart uses Hyperledger Fabric to trace pork in China and mangos in the US, reducing trace times from days to seconds. TE-Food and Provenance offer blockchain-based traceability solutions that improve food safety and transparency. Major food companies like Nestlé and Carrefour and platforms like Seafood Souq are exploring blockchain to enhance supply chain transparency.

Louie emphasized the paradigm shift: 

Carvalho explained the deterrent effect:

Despite its promise, blockchain is not a panacea. Scalability, cost, interoperability and integration with legacy systems pose significant barriers to adoption.

The “garbage in, garbage out” problem remains a fundamental limitation. Blockchain can only ensure the integrity of data once it is onchain — but it cannot be held responsible for the accuracy of the data entering the chain.

Oracles and IoT devices that feed external data onto the blockchain are vulnerable to tampering and technical failure. Manual data entry is also susceptible to error or manipulation. A perfect traceability record does not prevent a compromised oracle from feeding false data or a colluding party from entering fraudulent details at the point of origin.

Privacy concerns, regulatory uncertainty and stakeholder adoption are additional hurdles. Food supply chains involve sensitive data that businesses are reluctant to expose.

Permissioned blockchains and selective transparency offer solutions. These do, however, require careful governance and clear data access protocols. Regulatory frameworks are evolving, and broad stakeholder participation is essential for success.

Louie advocates for a pragmatic approach. “Start with clearly defined use cases where blockchain can deliver demonstrable value, rather than attempting a broad, unfocused implementation,” Louie suggested. “Robust governance models, especially for consortium blockchains, are critical.”

Carvalho stressed the need for industry-wide standards, training and collaboration: 

The convergence of blockchain with IoT, AI and other innovations offers a promising path. IoT sensors provide real-time data on a product's journey, creating a tamper-proof record.

AI algorithms analyze large data sets to detect anomalies and optimize logistics. Rapid testing methods, smart packaging, robotics and digital certificates further enhance food integrity.

The infrastructure built to fight fraud yields broader benefits. These include improved operational efficiency, reduced food waste and substantiated sustainability claims.

Blockchain and its complementary technologies have become attractive even for companies less directly affected by fraud. Pilot projects are yielding valuable lessons. Industry consortia are forming, and standards are beginning to emerge. 

The potential rewards extend beyond reducing fraud to encompass improved food safety, reduced waste, enhanced consumer confidence and a more sustainable, equitable and resilient global food system.

The unseen bite of food fraud may be pervasive, but it is not invincible. If thoughtfully deployed and integrated, blockchain could be the trust layer that finally fixes the $50-billion food fraud problem.

Bitcoin BTC$105,250.66 holders have increased their profit-taking activity since the cryptocurrency's price averages flashed a key bullish signal two weeks ago.

BTC's 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crossed above its 200-day SMA on May 22, confirming a golden cross – a technical indicator signaling bullish long-term momentum, according to data from TradingView. On the same day, bitcoin's price hit a record high above $111,000, according to CoinDesk data.

Still, holders are increasingly locking in gains rather than holding for further upside, according to on-chain data tracked by Glassnode.

""Entity-adjusted realized profit spiked above $500M/hour three times in the past 24 hours, signaling intense profit-taking activity,"" Glassnode said on X on Tuesday.

The entity-adjusted realized profit represents the total USD profit of all coins that have been moved onchain, where the price at their last movement is lower than the latest transaction price.

The chart shows the profit-taking activity has steadily increased since the second half of May, topping the $500 million mark several times. That's the most intense profit taking operation since early February.

Other metrics, such as the entity-adjusted spent output profit ratio (SOPR), suggest the same. SOPR tracks the profit level of all moved coins during a given period. It's entity-adjusted version discards transactions between addresses of the same entity, providing a reliable indicator of real economic activity. 

""The recent ATH breakout has led to a notable uptick in profits locked in, with the average coin capturing a +16% profit. Fewer than 8% of trading days have been more profitable for investors, suggesting a meaningful transition into profit-taking activity is underway,"" Glassnode said in its weekly report.

The report added that profit-taking is still not as intense as seen during prior major price-topping patterns.

As of writing, BTC changed hands at $105,600 amid reports of President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform moving a step closer to offering a bitcoin exchange-traded fund to everyday investors.

VICTORIA, Seychelles, June  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitget, the leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company, has announced a partnership with the University of Zurich, the world's top #3 university (according to Coindesk's 2021/22 rankings) for blockchain education. The exchange will sponsor the 6th edition of International Summer School—Deep Dive into Blockchain 2025 program at the University of Zurich Blockchain Center (UZH BCC), offering scholarships and career opportunities to blockchain-curious students. This marks a new chapter in Bitget's commitment to blockchain education and youth empowerment.

The scholarship initiative, part of Bitget's broader $10M Blockchain4Youth (B4Y) program, aims to make high-impact blockchain education more accessible to bright, motivated students, presenting them with wider opportunities. Deep Dive into Blockchain (DDiB) is the University of Zurich's flagship international summer school, hosted by the Faculty of Business, Economics, and Informatics in collaboration with the Global Student Experience and organized by the UZH Blockchain Center under the academic leadership of its chairman, Prof. Dr Claudio J. Tessone. The three-week program offers an immersive, interdisciplinary exploration of blockchain from academic, technological, legal, and economic perspectives.

“We are delighted to partner with Bitget for Deep Dive into Blockchain. Their support empowers the next generation of blockchain professionals by making education all around the globe more accessible. This collaboration reflects our shared vision of fostering innovation, diversity, and global talent in the Web3 space,”  — Dr Claudio J. Tessone, Professor of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies, University of Zurich, and Director of Deep Dive into Blockchain.

In an ecosystem often defined by its complexity and speed, education remains the most enduring bridge between innovation and understanding. Built on these beliefs, Bitget is funding scholarships for up to 10 students who meet both the academic and financial criteria set by UZH. More than just a subsidy, the Bitget Blockchain4Youth Scholarship is a belief that the future of blockchain should be built by the most capable minds, not just the most privileged.

Each scholarship will fully cover tuition, accommodation, transportation within Zurich, access to academic materials and site visits, as well as participation in intercultural programs and events. This comprehensive support structure is designed to empower students to focus not on logistics but on learning, and to walk away not only with a certificate but with a deeper perspective.

“As someone who entered this industry from outside the traditional mold, I know what access and opportunity can unlock. This scholarship isn't just about learning blockchain—it's about equipping future leaders with the tools to question, to build, and to leave the space better than they found it. That's the kind of legacy we want to help shape,” said Vugar Usi Zade, COO at Bitget. 

“As much as the world needs more developers, lawyers, or economists, it needs more cross-disciplinary thinkers who understand the full societal impact of blockchain,” he added. 

The 2025 program will also feature a masterclass by Bitget COO, Vugar Usi Zade, offering students firsthand insight from one of the industry's leading operators. This academic-industry dialogue enables the long-term strategic partnership between Bitget and UZH, anchored in mutual goals of innovation, education, and responsible development.

With this partnership, Bitget isn't just funding education. It's shaping the future of the industry.

After acquiring some of the NFT world's biggest names, Yuga Labs is now offloading CryptoPunks, Moonbirds, and other brands as the market faces ongoing challenges.

Yuga Labs has recently started slimming down, handing over IP rights to several NFT collections — including CryptoPunks and Moonbirds — in what may signal a shift for the once-dominant NFT giant. The CryptoPunks IP now belongs to the Infinite Node Foundation, a non-profit focused on digital art preservation.

Meanwhile, Moonbirds — another blue-chip collection — has landed in the hands of a relatively unknown gaming company called Orange Cap Games.

While Natalie Stone, general manager of CryptoPunks, said the terms of the deal won't be disclosed, reports suggest the Infinite Node Foundation may have paid around $20 million. That's likely less than what Yuga paid in 2022, and a far cry from the hype-driven prices seen at the peak of the NFT boom.

Still, Yuga isn't walking away entirely as the firm still retains its rights under the standard IP license, Stone told The Verge.

Nicki Schiller, chief of staff at Yuga Labs, emphasized in a commentary for crypto.news that “with Punks, we remain the largest holder and chose Node for their ability to steward the legacy — we'll stay involved via the advisory council.”

“Moonbirds deserve a team fully dedicated to their world, and Orange Cap Games is the right fit to take them forward. With Punks, we remain the largest holder and chose Node for their ability to steward the legacy – we'll stay involved via the advisory council. These moves reflect a clear focus: Yuga is going all-in on Apes, Otherside, and what's next.”

Nicki Schiller

Even so, the sale marks a big shift. When Yuga Labs acquired CryptoPunks from Larva Labs in 2022, the NFT market was still glowing. Prices were sky-high and one CryptoPunk famously sold for over $23 million in Ethereum (ETH), and that sort of thing doesn't really happen anymore.

While the exact reason behind the acquisition remains unclear, Node Foundation chair Micky Malka noted that CryptoPunks “sparked a cultural movement,” adding that the firm is setting up a permanent exhibit space in Palo Alto and planning to show the full 10,000-piece collection at the Toledo Museum of Art to make it easier for “scholars, curators, and collectors to engage with it.”

So what happened? CryptoPunks were created by Matt Hall and John Watkinson of Larva Labs in 2017. Just 24×24 pixels, the 10,000 characters quickly became more than just JPEGs. They were status symbols, collector bait, and some say, the beginning of the NFT movement. Long before the Bored Apes took over Twitter profile pics, the Punks were already being auctioned by Christie's, an art and luxury auction house.

Yuga came in during peak hype, acquiring multiple NFT collections. But now, it's offloading those same assets — and not just CryptoPunks. Earlier in May, Yuga also sold the Moonbirds IP to Orange Cap Games, a low-profile outfit in the NFT gaming space. The deal includes not just Moonbirds, but also related spinoffs Mythics and Oddities.

https://t.co/dWNVvZKTuZ

Orange Cap Games described the acquisition in an X post as a chance to bring “beloved IPs to life through carefully crafted experiences that introduce them to new fans and deepen the connection with existing communities.” The company emphasized its excitement about taking over the Moonbirds franchise, stating that Moonbirds “have simply been nesting during the bear market, filled with untapped possibility, and under our stewardship, it is now time to take flight.”

Orange Cap Games has a track record in NFT gaming, having launched Vibes TCG, a collectible card game centered around the Pudgy Penguins IP, which “celebrates culture, community, and joy.” The studio prides itself on attention to detail, saying that “those who know us through Vibes know that we obsess over excellence, whether in game design, physical product development, or creative execution.”

“In fact, we're the only TCG studio we know of that developed its own custom paper stock for our upcoming physical release. Details matter. This is the attitude that we bring to everything we do.”

Orange Cap Games

Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano seemed optimistic. “Moonbirds deserve a team whose whole world is the birds,” he said, praising Orange Cap Games' execution so far.

Regarding the blockchain environment, Orange Cap Games pointed out that that future on-chain components of Moonbirds created by them will be on either mainnet or, if on a layer-2, will exclusively use ApeChain, a network which was also backed by Yuga Labs.

Still, it's hard to ignore the backdrop: NFTs aren't what they used to be. Market activity has dropped off a cliff. According to data from DappRadar, trading volumes for top NFT collections are down 95% from their peaks. Once-hyped projects have either vanished or turned to licensing deals, art exhibits, or physical merch, all in the name of staying alive.

Schiller pushed back on the idea that declining market conditions prompted the selloff, emphasizing that the deals “weren't driven by market volatility” but instead reflected “strategic clarity, not short-term conditions.”

Yuga Labs seems to be doubling down on what it sees as core, with Solano saying in an X post that the firm is “laser-focused on Apes, Otherside, and something special we've been cooking up.”

The company's Otherside metaverse — a gamified, immersive world tied to Bored Apes — remains a key focus. And maybe that's the real story. Whike Yuga isn't necessarily giving up, it certainly retreating from the idea that one company can own the NFT canon.

When Yuga acquired CryptoPunks' IP, “it wasn't just about ownership — it was about honoring a cultural icon we believed in,” said Yuga Labs co-founder Wylie Aronow, adding that giving the brand away was “a full-circle moment.”

Meanwhile, the Infinite Node Foundation seems to be pulling together a pretty serious team to steward the collection. Founders from both Larva Labs and Art Blocks are on its advisory board, and a live Ethereum node will run at its new facility to emphasize decentralization.

Looking ahead, Schiller confirmed that the “persistent Otherside experience begins this summer, marking a major new phase in the project,” and teased upcoming developments around ApeFest and the long-awaited real-life Clubhouse. “We'll be sharing more on all of this soon,” she added.

While some in the NFT community view this as a big win, others see it differently, likening the sale of a high-profile collection to a small gaming startup as the web3 version of a garage sale. But maybe that's simply the new reality, the NFT market isn't dead. It's just quieter, more mature, and, possibly, a bit wiser.

The FBI is warning about a new scam where cybercriminals exploit NFT airdrops on the Hedera Hashgraph network to steal crypto from cryptocurrency wallets.

Airdrops are a method of distributing cryptocurrency tokens for free to wallet addresses, usually as part of a marketing, community growth, or reward campaign, but they are also used as bait for scams.

""The Hedera Hashgraph is the distributed ledger used by Hedera. The airdrop feature was originally created by the Hedera Hashgraph network for marketing purposes; however, cyber criminals can exploit this tactic to collect victim data to steal cryptocurrency,"" explains the FBI advisory.

In the attacks targeting wallets on the Hedera Hashgraph network, the threat actors send unsolicited NFTs or tokens to users' wallets with memos prompting users to click on a URL to claim their reward.

Clicking the link takes victims to phishing sites or dApps that ask them to input sensitive information like account passwords and wallet recovery seed phrases.

The attackers can then use this sensitive information to hijack the victim's wallets and empty them.

Hedera Hashgraph is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) and public network, similar to Ethereum and Bitcoin, but built on a fundamentally different structure called a hashgraph rather than a blockchain.

Unlike blockchains that store data in sequential blocks, hashgraph uses a gossip protocol and virtual voting to achieve consensus, allowing for faster, more scalable, and more energy-efficient operations.

This technology was introduced in 2018 as a next-generation distributed ledger aiming to overcome the limitations of conventional blockchains, and scammers have started to target it more as its popularity and adoption rise.

FBI says that fraudsters currently promote their fraud campaigns beyond the unsolicited NFT airdrops, including phishing emails, social media advertisements, and fake websites.

When receiving airdrop alerts, it is advisable to always verify their legitimacy with the official source before engaging.

Verify using the official customer service number/email address, and never the ones listed on emails, as those could direct the communication to the scammers.

During the NFT claiming or minting process, it is crucial never to share passwords, seed phrases, or one-time passwords (OTPs), unless you initiated contact.

Finally, cryptocurrency accounts should be regularly monitored for signs of unauthorized activity/transactions and suspicious login attempts.

If you suspect you have been compromised by scammers, it is advisable to contact your account providers and report it as soon as possible.

Then, report the incident to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) with details such as cryptocurrency addresses and transaction information (ID, date, amount).

Manual patching is outdated. It's slow, error-prone, and tough to scale.

In a crypto market flooded with meme coins themed around dogs, cats, and frogs, Snorter is taking a fresh and innovative approach. 

This Solana-based meme coin features a powerful Telegram-integrated trading bot and is uniquely themed around an anteater. 

With a distinct brand identity and practical trading utility, Snorter is fast emerging as one of the best Solana meme coin presale opportunities to watch in 2025, with strong potential for 100x gains.

Summary

In a crowded market of meme coins, Snorter stands out as a Solana meme coin powered by a high-performance Telegram trading bot. The project's adventurous aardvark mascot “snorts out” hidden gems in the crypto space, combining viral appeal with meaningful utility.

Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Snorter offers a feature-rich, fast, and secure crypto trading bot accessible directly through Telegram. 

Source – Snorter Twitter

This bot is designed to help users navigate the Solana ecosystem and upcoming token launches with precision and built-in safety measures, making on-chain trading as effortless as “slurping up ants.”

While meme coins and trading bots are common, Snorter is the first to successfully merge both into one seamless platform. Here's what makes it a standout:

The platform's native token, SNORT, powers all trading activity and unlocks additional features, community perks, and future staking rewards. 

During the presale, investors can stake SNORT with APYs reaching up to 767%, backed by 5% of the total token supply (25 million SNORT) dedicated to staking rewards. Importantly, staking requires no long-term lockups, offering liquidity and flexibility.

As of this writing, the Snorter presale has raised over $416,000, signaling strong market interest and investor confidence. With plans for multi-chain support beyond Solana, SNORT aims to become a versatile utility token across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

To securely manage SNORT tokens and other crypto assets, the Snorter team recommends using “Best Wallet” — a privacy-focused, non-custodial wallet that supports over 60 blockchains and is fully compatible with the Snorter ecosystem. 

This makes it an ideal choice for privacy-conscious users active in the Solana network and beyond. But it's not just the technical infrastructure that stands out — Snorter also brings fresh energy to the meme coin space through creative branding. 

While most projects lean on overused animal tropes, Snorter introduces an anteater mascot and backstory that combine personality with practical value. 

Backed by a feature-rich Telegram trading bot and a robust Solana foundation, the project is quickly gaining traction. As investor interest rises and the presale progresses, SNORT could deliver substantial returns — potentially 5x, 10x, or even 100x for early supporters in 2025.

On 17 March 2025, the ICO unveiled a package of measures to support the government's growth agenda. The measures were announced as the government published a ""New approach to ensure regulators and regulation support growth"".

The government finds that the UK's regulatory landscape is not functioning as effectively as it should, often holding back growth and inhibiting innovation.

In particular:

The government proposes addressing these challenges by overhauling the regulatory system as it applies to all regulators (to the extent regulators in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland are under the policy remit of the UK government or UK Parliament) to ensure it:

There are three limbs to the action plan:

An annex to the action plan sets out actions committed to by some key regulators. The ICO made several commitments, also set out in its package of measures to support the government's growth agenda, published on 17 March 2025.

These include:

In fact, many of the initiatives announced above are extensions of existing activities and priorities. The ICO set out its online tracking strategy for 2025 in January, as we discuss here, which set out proposed reforms to PECR consent among other issues. The ICO has also led the way on AI guidance and there were already plans for statutory guidance in this area. Additionally, it has been producing guidance and tools aimed at SMEs for some time. Similarly, the pilot experimental regime is an extension of the existing regulatory sandbox scheme and updated guidance on data transfers has been on the horizon for some time as a result of the incoming Data (Use and Access) Bill.  This means that the announcements made by the ICO are not so much new as re-framed for the growth agenda.

In its announcement, the ICO focused on activities within its sole purview, but of course, the ICO also has a role to play as part of the Digital Regulatory Cooperation Forum, and its fellow DRCF regulators Ofcom, the FCA and the CMA all produced their own proposals to support the government's growth agenda. The ICO is collaborating with Ofcom on the Online Safety Act, particularly in relation to content moderation and data protection, and age assurance, producing guidance on the former in February 2024, and an updated Opinion on age assurance in January 2024 to take account of the OSA. Interestingly, however, the OSA did not feature in Ofcom's commitments to the government on growth.  Perhaps more synergy from a growth perspective will come from sharing experiences and best practice with the FCA on its own regulatory sandbox and, importantly, from the work all the DRCF regulators are doing on AI.

Once the DUA Bill becomes law, the ICO will become the Information Commission with a board. The Information Commissioner's role will become that of the non-executive Chairman of the board. The IC will be equipped with an updated regulatory toolkit and enhanced enforcement powers, but we don't expect this to change priorities.    As the ICO pointed out in a blog, also published on 17 March, growth is one of its strategic priorities, and the ICO has a statutory duty to consider the economic impact of its actions on businesses.

The Bank of Japan has no immediate plans to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC), according to Director Kazunari Kamiyama. Speaking at the ninth CBDC Liaison Council meeting with private sector partners, Kamiyama cited Japan's continued high cash usage as a primary factor in the decision.

His comments came ten days after the central bank released a second progress report on its digital yen pilot program, which involves seven working groups and 64 private companies through the CBDC Forum. These groups are tackling different aspects of digital currency development through both technical implementation and theoretical research.

One working group is examining how CBDCs might integrate with emerging technologies like distributed ledger technology (DLT). As part of this exploration, researchers considered deploying a CBDC on a public blockchain. However, they concluded this approach isn't currently viable due to scalability limitations, privacy concerns and governance challenges.

The group did identify potential future pathways, including layer 2 blockchain solutions that offer greater control and future iterations of zero knowledge proof technologies. They also explored issuing a cryptocurrency backed by a CBDC – essentially creating a stablecoin – though this would require strict wallet and smart contract whitelisting.

Another avenue under consideration involves using CBDCs to settle security token transactions on permissioned blockchains, though this approach would require pre-funding mechanisms.

Drawing inspiration from the UK's Project Rosalind, another working group focused on application programming interfaces (APIs). Their research emphasized the need for modular, basic APIs that could be combined like building blocks to create more sophisticated applications.

While APIs offer valuable functionality, the researchers noted that excessive usage could create performance bottlenecks. For instance, frequent API calls to verify transaction completion could strain the system. Instead, the central bank favors webhook technology, which reverses the data flow by pushing notifications to users when transactions are completed – similar to how smartphone notifications work.

The working groups have so far examined features in isolation, but the central bank plans to explore how different elements interact across the system. Despite having no immediate issuance plans, Japan will continue its CBDC research efforts.

Beyond domestic considerations, Japan participates in Project Agorá, a BIS-led international initiative involving seven central banks and 41 institutions. This project aims to enhance cross border payments by combining CBDCs, tokenization, and correspondent banking.

The Bank of Japan's measured approach reflects a careful balance between staying current with digital currency developments while addressing the practical realities of Japan's cash-reliant economy.

While Japan explores digital currency possibilities, its timeline remains tied to actual market demand rather than technological capability.

By Leika Kihara

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan currently has no plan to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) but must continue innovating its payment and settlement system in an increasingly cash-less society, a senior central bank official said on Wednesday.

Although banknote issuance remains high in Japan, usage of notes could fall significantly in the future amid rapid digitalisation, said Bank of Japan (BOJ) Executive Director Kazushige Kamiyama.

“As such, Japan must consider what steps it can take now to ensure its retail settlement system is convenient, efficient, accessible universally, while being safe and resilient,” he said in a speech.

While the BOJ currently has no plan to issue a CBDC, it must keep up efforts to enhance the safety and efficiency of Japan's payment and settlement system, Kamiyama said in a meeting with  private firms on a pilot programme for developing a digital yen.

The BOJ has said no decision has been made yet on whether Japan will actually issue a CBDC, which must be made by the government and parliament.

But the central bank has been conducting experiments and exchanging views with private firms on a digital yen, to be ready in case Japan decides to issue a CBDC.

CBDCs are back in the spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump banned work on a digital dollar in one of his first moves after regaining power in January.

Don Jr. and Eric Trump say they aren't involved in the ""Official $TRUMP Wallet.""

A digital asset company has collaborated with the firm behind President Donald Trump's $TRUMP meme coin to launch what it's calling the ""Official $TRUMP Wallet"" -- but the president's sons, who run Trump's crypto businesses, say they have no involvement with the offering.

In a post on X Tuesday, Jack Lu, the CEO of a digital asset marketplace called Magic Eden, said his firm had collaborated with GetTrumpMemes -- the firm behind the $TRUMP meme coin -- on $TRUMP Wallet, a digital app that allows users to conduct financial transactions. Lu said the venture would allow users to trade the $TRUMP coin and other cryptocurrencies.

But within hours, Eric Trump wrote on social media that ""I run @Trump and I know nothing about this project!""

Donald Trump Jr. added that he ""has zero involvement with this wallet product,"" and teased plans for a separate digital asset wallet under a different Trump-affiliated crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.

Despite those disavowals, the $TRUMP Wallet that launched Tuesday claimed to be the ""First and Only Crypto Wallet for True Trump Fans.""

""Our partnership with the $TRUMP team to build @TrumpWalletApp represents our commitment to onboarding mainstream audience deeper into crypto,"" Lu wrote on X.

ABC News has reached out to Magic Eden for clarification on the venture.

As of Tuesday afternoon, X -- the social media company run by Trump ally Elon Musk -- had suspended the account for @TrumpWalletApp. It was not immediately clear why the account was removed.

The $TRUMP Wallet website contains little information about the platform itself, but invites visitors to sign up for a waitlist ahead of a formal launch at some later date. Joining the waitlist also allows users to enter a sweepstakes for a share of $1 million worth of $TRUMP rewards.

Once a crypto skeptic, Trump and his family have fully immersed themselves in the cryptocurrency marketplace in recent months, developing not only the $TRUMP meme coin -- a type of digital currency that's often based on an internet meme -- but also a bitcoin mining firm, a stablecoin firm, and a crypto reserve.

Last month Trump held a black tie event for the winners of a contest that awarded invitations to the top investors in his $TRUMP coin -- with at least some of the funds flowing directly into the Trump family's coffers.

Critics have raised concerns about the Trump administration's regulatory role over cryptocurrencies while the president stands to personally benefit from cryptocurrency ventures.

Asked Tuesday about the potential conflicts of interest in the Trump family's nascent crypto empire, Donald Trump Jr. said on CNBC that the family ""got into [crypto] out of necessity,"" claiming the Trump family had been ""de-banked.""

""We got into politics and all of a sudden [the banks] wouldn't take our call,"" he said. ""We went all in on a concept that makes total sense because we'd actually been the recipients of how quickly that can be shut off.""

DungCoin is the future of finance, fresh from the farm, hand-scooped for authenticity, and aged for that perfect bouquet of bovine brilliance

It was the shock of the season.

Donald Trump, once a vocal critic of Pakistan's double games, has suddenly discovered a soft spot for the nation he once called a “safe haven for terror.”

The reason? A flashy new Pakistani crypto scheme offering him 60% ownership in “PakiBit“, a blockchain-powered, camel-backed, security-enhanced coin with zero real-world use and infinite national pride.

Naturally, I was alarmed. How could a man who once said, “Pakistan is not our friend” be swayed by digital funny money minted in Rawalpindi's basement?

Simple. He's Trump. And he loves ownership. So I thought India should hit back. Not with missiles. Not with sanctions. But with something much harder to ignore…

If you thought cryptocurrencies were strange, complex, and just a tad ridiculous, wait till you meet their brown, smelly cousin: DungCoin, offered exclusively to lure The Donald back from Islamabad to Indraprastha.

Unlike PakiBit, DungCoin isn't based on just speculative virtual nonsense. It's based on speculative real nonsense, which also stinks. Literally.

Welcome to the latest breakthrough in digital currency. Forget block chains. Forget mining rigs. Forget Elon Musk tweets.

DungCoin is the future of finance, fresh from the farm, hand-scooped for authenticity, and aged for that perfect bouquet of bovine brilliance.

India's offer to Trump:

Because unlike PakiBit, which is backed by hot air and mined by computers, DungCoin has real substance. It's mined manually. It's backed by India's massive bovine economy. And best of all, it's shaped like tiny brown Trump Towers once sun-dried.

DungCoin (Ticker: DGC) is a digital currency that's mined from the ground, literally. Born from the humble cow patty, it's everything crypto fans love:

In short, it's exactly like Bitcoin, except it's more organic. And compostable.

And DungCoin screams everything Trump loves:

Transactions are irreversible. So is the trauma.

Because I wanted to parody cryptocurrencies, but I may have accidentally created a more stable one.

Plus, unlike other crypto currencies, DungCoin is biodegradable. If the market crashes, just throw your wallet into the compost pit and grow tomatoes.

MooFTs: Non-Fungible Turds (Poops), each one a unique creation, shaped by the tail-wag of destiny.

FarmDAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organization): A decentralized “Cowmittee” that governs which species can poop legally on the chain. Buffalo lobbyists are pushing hard.

PastureSwap: Trade DungCoin for GoatCoins, PigTokens, or HayShares. Or if you're feeling wild, take a leveraged position on Compost Futures.

DungCoin isn't a joke. It's a satirical cowpie flung at the idea that anything can have value if:

So next time someone asks, “You don't understand crypto?” you can proudly say, “I do. I mine DungCoin.”

Make no mistake. DungCoin is crypto diplomacy at its finest.

When Pakistan tries to bait leaders with digital junk, India counters with earthy, grassroots tokens. Quite literally.

“They offered you 60% of a fantasy. We're offering you 100% of the future fertilizer of global finance.” – Anonymous Indian Diplomat.

Crypto bros may call it BSCoin. And they'd be right. But DungCoin at least knows what it is, and doesn't pretend to be anything more.

Because sometimes, to see the absurdity of the future, you just have to look behind a cow.

In a world of synthetic algorithms and crypto currencies, India's DungCoin brings something rare to the table: authenticity, effort, and a mildly disturbing stench of truth.

It may not revolutionize the blockchain world. But it just might revolutionize Trump's Twitter feed.

And in diplomacy, especially in Trump diplomacy, that's the only coin that counts.

Mai Huy Tuan, CEO of SSI Digital, believes the establishment of a virtual asset trading platform is a promising development, which could make virtual assets a significant resource for the Vietnamese economy.

""In the digital age, virtual assets can be exported globally, generating foreign currency for Vietnamese people. In fact, there are already several tech unicorns in Vietnam operating in this field, with numerous domestic projects valued at hundreds of millions of USD,"" said Tuan, speaking at Vietnam Investment Forum 2025: Mid-Year Update in Hanoi on June 3.

Tuan added that many Vietnamese enterprises stand ready to participate in the pilot phase, revealing that his company has prepared more than 200 specialised personnel, made investments in infrastructure and software, and established partnerships with international players and custodians to operate a virtual asset trading platform.

""We are only waiting for the official legal framework to launch immediately. We have already explored all models, both centralised, decentralised, and international security standards"" he said.

""SSI Digital has also established the SSI Digital Ventures investment fund and committed $200 million to blockchain and AI projects, with a particular focus on those originating from Vietnam.""

Also attending the forum, Doan Mai Hanh, head of Sales and Trading – Markets Division at Techcom Securities remarked that recent moves by regulatory bodies to build a digital technology infrastructure reflect a proactive and positive approach, recognising virtual assets as a legitimate asset class.

""This will open opportunities for all market participants, from service providers and firms seeking new fundraising channels to investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Currently, commercial banks, securities firms, insurance companies, asset management firms, and tech companies hold distinct advantages to participate in this market,"" said Hanh.

Hanh noted that banks should be the first to get involved due to their strong financial capacity and ability to act as liquidity backstops, saying, ""They already have effective identity verification, risk assessment procedures, and anti-money laundering mechanisms in place. Even insurance companies can contribute by offering insurance solutions to help investors mitigate risks and losses in this volatile market. As for tech firms, their role is indispensable because blockchain technology is precisely their domain.""

Hanh also cited the Draft Resolution on the Pilot Implementation of the Virtual Asset Market in Vietnam, which includes a provision requiring businesses to have at least $400 million in charter capital to obtain a licence for providing virtual asset exchange services.

""This is a significant barrier, not only a matter of capital mobilisation but also of governance; how to ensure liquidity, manage risk, and generate returns amid an unclear regulatory landscape,"" she added.

To Tran Hoa, deputy director of the Securities Market Development Department at the State Securities Commission of Vietnam, said that while such requirements are appropriate, they are not yet sufficient.

""Firstly, in addition to the requirement that 35 per cent of the $400 million must come from two out of five designated types of institutions, the remaining 65 per cent must also come from organisations, not individuals. That's a crucial point,"" said Hoa. ""A virtual asset service provider essentially functions as a combination of an exchange, a custodian, and a brokerage firm, covering roles such as market operation, custody, clearing, and issuance. Therefore, the capital scale of such enterprises must be sufficiently large to ensure comprehensive operations.""

Hoa also referred to international practices, noting that many countries require virtual asset exchanges to provide proof of reserves or purchase insurance to protect investors. However, he admitted that these conditions are currently not feasible in Vietnam, as no local insurance company offers such coverage, and there is no clear regulation on virtual asset reserves.

""That's why we opted for capital requirements instead. With $400 million, a company can invest in infrastructure, purchase proprietary assets, or serve as a market maker. It's a flexible approach that keeps capital active while still managing risk,"" said Hoa.

Phan Duc Trung, chairman of the Vietnam Blockchain Association also emphasised the urgent need to pass a legal framework defining virtual assets.

""With strong public demand and widespread fear of missing out on digital asset opportunities, the government and National Assembly must promptly pass the Law on the Digital Technology Industry to facilitate the flow of capital into securities and asset allocation,"" said Trung.

""Many countries have already enacted various laws governing blockchain applications. These typically revolve around four pillars; taxation policy, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism measures, investor protection, and licensing. The impact of blockchain on the economy is undeniable; how it impacts depends on how we apply it. In Vietnam, though the blockchain market is growing, we still lack a dedicated law. However, the government is taking bold steps, for example, through Resolution 57, and we hope the Law on the Digital Technology Industry will soon be passed,"" added Trung.

While the rising popularity of digital assets may pressure stock market liquidity, it also presents opportunities for businesses to adjust models to stay ahead, securities firms acknowledge.

As digital assets gain increasing prominence, many experts believe that exchange-traded funds could be the safest and most feasible approach.

New regulations surrounding the pilot of a digital asset exchange will help legitimise crypto assets, entice institutional involvement, and foster regional innovation, opening up a new stream of investment to Vietnam.

Vietnamese financial institutions are exploring digital assets with growing seriousness, positioning the banking sector at a critical juncture where innovation, regulation, and risk management must converge.

Building a suitable legal framework for digital assets could help Vietnam generate an additional $100 billion to boost innovation and digital economic development. Phan Duc Trung, chairman of the Vietnam Blockchain Association, explained how with VIR's Hoang Oanh.

								A Journal of Analysis and News							



Kazakhstan's Minister of Digital Development, Innovations and Aerospace Industry, Zhaslan Mädiyev

By Derya Soysal 

At the Astana International Forum, Kazakhstan's Minister of Digital Development, Innovations and Aerospace Industry, Zhaslan Mädiyev, laid out a sweeping vision for the country's future in a detailed conversation covering everything from cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence to aerospace and global partnerships. Mädiyev described how Kazakhstan is rapidly becoming a regional and global leader in digital innovation by creating a regulatory and technological framework designed for the challenges of the 21st century.

“Kazakhstan is quite active in terms of developing the crypto ecosystem and trying to promote a crypto-friendly environment for changing organizations and promoting innovative solutions in the whole value chain,” Mädiyev said. “We are one of the top 10 countries in terms of crypto mining. The Digital Ministry is the regulator of crypto mining, and we are also regulating mining pools.” The country's digital infrastructure includes over 60 operating mining firms and more than 10 officially licensed exchanges, among them global giants like Binance, Bybit, Bitfinex, and Binone. Mädiyev emphasized that this ecosystem is supported by the Astana International Financial Center, which regulates crypto exchanges, and Astana Hub, a dedicated innovation zone where crypto and blockchain startups benefit from zero tax incentives.

“Because of that, we see the inflow of more and more foreign players who want to tap the Kazakhstani market and the whole Central Asian market through Kazakhstan,” he explained. According to the Minister, the government is now entering a new phase by amending laws to allow crypto ATMs, crypto exchange shops, and crypto card circulation. One of the most ambitious plans is to establish a crypto city. “The President's idea is to define a crypto city that will be completely crypto-friendly, where crypto can be a legal tender — you can pay in restaurants, in cafes, purchase real estate, invest in crypto,” Mädiyev said. “That could be a magnet for developers, the IT community, and the blockchain ecosystem, giving new momentum to economic diversification.”

On concerns that crypto might threaten the national currency, Mädiyev was reassuring. “We believe, as per my expectation, it shouldn't have a huge negative impact on the currency. Why? Because we are not starting from scratch,” he said. “We already established official crypto-fiat channels, and we didn't see a massive run on deposits or on the national currency.” He added that there is still a technological and psychological barrier among the public. “A person has to be tech-savvy to use it — open wallets, understand custodial and non-custodial tools, and learn to avoid scams. Also, the availability of local currency instruments with good yields makes crypto less attractive for many citizens.”

Asked about Kazakhstan's broader digitalization priorities, Mädiyev pointed to impressive achievements. “For the last 10 years Kazakhstan has been investing a lot into digital transformation,” he said. “We became a top 24 country in terms of the UN's e-government development index and top 10 in terms of online service quality. Over 90% of public services are available online, and 90% of transactions in Kazakhstan are cashless.” The Minister highlighted that the country is among the first to pilot a Central Bank Digital Currency, and that most personal documents are now fully digital and legally equivalent to physical ones.

Looking forward, artificial intelligence is at the center of the government's new strategy. “We are developing AI through three pillars: creating an institutional framework, building infrastructure, and developing human capital,” Mädiyev said. A dedicated Committee for the Development of AI and the Crypto Industry has been established. A five-year conceptual framework is already being implemented and will soon be formalized as the national AI strategy. “We are forming an AI Council under the President, with international experts like Peter Norvig, Kai-Fu Lee, and Laura Tyson as members,” he noted. A draft AI law is also expected this year, setting out terminology, ethical standards, product labeling, and risk management.

In terms of infrastructure, Mädiyev announced that Kazakhstan is about to launch a supercomputer cluster this July. “The supercomputer chips are already in Kazakhstan. We opened a first cluster in the U.S. to train Kazakh LLMs — on Lama, YeLightning, DeepSeek, Falcon — and now we are bringing that power home,” he said. A national AI platform is already in place, giving public employees access to tools like GPUs, data sets, and low-code environments to create their own AI engines. “By the end of next year, 50 AI engines will be operating in the public sector,” he added.

Mädiyev also revealed a massive human capital development program. “We announced a plan to train one million people over five years in AI — 500,000 schoolchildren, 300,000 university students, 90,000 public sector employees, 80,000 corporate sector employees, and 30,000 from other areas,” he said. AI education has been embedded in school curricula and extracurricular programs that include 3D modeling, robotics, and generative AI. “We opened the first AI school in the region — Tomorrow School — a peer-to-peer model created with Nicolas Sadirac, founder of École 42,” Mädiyev said. “Over 50 projects, 20 programming languages, and a fully immersive experience — we already have three batches, with over 3,500 applicants for just 400 spots.”

At the heart of this vision is the International AI Center. “It will be a center of excellence with big tech companies, startups, public and event spaces, hackathon zones, an AI museum, café, cinema, and kids' zone,” Mädiyev described. “There will also be an AI-driven government office and collaboration hubs for science, business, and education.” He hopes to replicate the success of Astana Hub, which has already expanded to 20 cities and opened branches in Silicon Valley, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the UK, and most recently Dubai.

On Kazakhstan's growing cooperation with the UAE, Mädiyev emphasized strong ties in logistics, renewables, and digital technology. “We're working with Masdar on energy and with Abu Dhabi Ports in logistics. In our sector, we have two key projects — a supercomputer cluster and a Smart City initiative with G42, an AI company from the UAE,” he said. G42's Presight AI has hired over 40 Kazakh specialists and is developing a smart control center with thousands of cameras, due to be finalized by the end of the year. Mädiyev also invited UAE's AI Minister Omar Al Olama to join Kazakhstan's AI Council.

Kazakhstan's aerospace industry is also undergoing a transformation. “We're vertically integrated: we run the world's largest cosmodrome, have launch pads, and started producing our own launch vehicles and satellites,” Mädiyev said. “For the first time, we began exporting satellites — to Mongolia, Congo, and others. Buyers benefit from our full constellation and monitoring tools for forests, waste, illegal mining, and more. All production is certified by Airbus through our joint venture.” The country is now testing AI applications in image labeling and processing, with long-term ambitions to embed AI capabilities directly onto satellites.

Mädiyev concluded by emphasizing the international reach of Kazakhstan's tech ecosystem. “We have over 1,500 startups — in blockchain, medtech, edtech, defense tech, and more. Our IT hubs in Saudi Arabia, Silicon Valley, and Europe are giving them global access,” he said. One standout example is Higgsfield AI, a Kazakh startup working on text-to-video generation. “They raised $16 million from Menlo Ventures, with a valuation of over $100 million. We believe we can create many more such success stories.”

With its bold national strategies, international partnerships, and homegrown talent, Kazakhstan is emerging as a digital powerhouse — not just in Central Asia, but on the global stage.

Opinion by: Jillian Friedman, chief operating officer, Symbiotic

Since the Canadian federal election, there's been little clarity on where this country is heading with digital asset innovation. Crypto regulation and policy didn't make it into any of the parties' campaign platforms. It's a missed opportunity at a time when Canada ​​needs swift action about whether it wants to be a competitor in this space or simply a bystander.

Early-stage investments are already showing signs of strain.

A recent Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (CVCA) report shows Canadian seed deals dropped to pandemic-era lows during Q1 2025. Canada risks falling behind by not embracing the tools to unlock global trade and innovation elsewhere without a shift in approach. This stands in stark contrast with American, European and Asian jurisdictions, where regulators are acting decisively to provide regulatory clarity and de-block the industry. 

The recent appointment of Evan Solomon as minister of artificial intelligence and digital innovation, a former news anchor with no obvious connection to the topic, could help accelerate that growth, but only if the Liberals take a broader view that enables businesses building with modernizing technologies like blockchain. The Canadian government should focus on some key priority areas. 

Plug Canada's brain drain 

Even though Canada has an outsized advantage with top-tier institutions, like the Vector Institute (AI) in Toronto, the Institute for Quantum Computing at Waterloo and MILA (AI), tech businesses are increasingly globally mobile and choose to work from anywhere but Canada. Canada has lots to offer scientific researchers — those looking to commercialize enterprises struggle with a lack of access to capital and onerous tax regimes. Talent migration among STEM graduates is high, with as many as two-thirds of software engineering graduates leaving Canada.

Recent: How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy

Canada needs to get creative with a workforce that can work from anywhere. Many tax incentives could help. Portugal offers tax relief to young and foreign professionals in high-value sectors, including technology and engineering. It's time to explore bold, targeted policies to keep digital talent anchored here. Canada must seek to stop penalizing people who take economic risks and start celebrating entrepreneurs. Canadians need fewer increases in capital gains taxes and more relief like small business sales exemptions and the Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive. 

Canada and stablecoins 

Stablecoins are one of the most promising tools to emerge from crypto. They make payments as easy as email, financial transactions programmable and provide easier market access to prominent fiat currencies. Stablecoins enable businesses to send global payments instantly at a fraction of the cost of a traditional bank wire.

Yet regulators are against this technology, restricting Canadians' access to stablecoins. This also results in a missed opportunity to open the Canadian dollar to new global markets with a Canadian dollar-denominated stablecoin. The provincial policies are inconsistent, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) have incorrectly classified stablecoins as securities, and federal leadership is absent. If other jurisdictions have figured out how to regulate these assets without killing them, Canada can, too. Canada has long been a leader in financial services and payments, but restricting this technology is bad for the Canadian dollar and Canadians. 

Banking for crypto businesses 

Canadian businesses doing anything remotely related to crypto, even where Anti-Money Laundering (AML) risk is remote, still struggle to access basic banking like deposit accounts, credit cards and payment services. The financial institutions of other G7 countries, subject to similar AML regulations as Canadian banks, have found ways to de-risk blockchain and crypto businesses. It's time for the Canadian banks to do the same. 

New financial services in payments, lending and cash flow management are taking off elsewhere, but Canadian regulators' reticence and lack of political will are holding us back.

The previous Liberal government's stance toward crypto ranged from disinterest to disdain. Will it be any different now?

NYSE Arca, which is part of the New York Stock Exchange, has filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a fund issued by U.S. President Donald Trump's media company Truth Social.

On Tuesday, the exchange filed a 19b-4 document with the SEC for a fund that would track the price of bitcoin BTC$105,266.29, similar to the already existing spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The filing was made on behalf of crypto asset manager Yorkville America Digital, which is a partner of Trump Media & Technology Group, the owner of Truth Social.

The custodian for the fund, if approved, would be Foris DAX Trust Company, which also serves as the custodian for Crypto.com's assets.

A 19b-4 filing is required to be filed by self-regulatory organizations (SROs) to propose a rule change. A second document by the issuer, called the S-1, is also required to make the proposal official.

The fund would trade under the name Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, according to the filing.

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.

Keep an eye on ETH$2,639.12, is what fund manager March Zheng is telling investors.

As Asia begins its business day, ETH is trading above $2,500, down 0.4%. While this might not seem like a lot in the volatile world of crypto, ETH has defied the odds and is up 40% on-month, which is impressive because its performance is only matched by memecoin stalwarts like PEPE$0.0₄12392, and Decentralized Finance lending protocols like AAVE$268.86. The latter's performance has helped push up Total Value Locked (TVL) in Ethereum past $60 billion.

Zheng, the co-founder and managing partner of Bizantine Capital, is bullish on ETH because he argues that Ethereum might dominate as the primary layer-one blockchain due to its superior scalability compared to Solana, thanks to the recent Pectra upgrade, and persistently lower inflation rate than Bitcoin BTC$105,266.29.

""It may be reaching an inflection point where both of these leads continue to grow,"" Zheng said in a note to CoinDesk. ""It will be a very interesting year.""

Still, there are potential limits to ETH's growth story this year. Bettors on Polymarket are only giving it a 26% chance of breaking its all-time high of $4,868 in November 2021.

Meanwhile, CoinDesk Market Insight Bot notes institutional interest in Ethereum is growing sharply, with exchange balances dropping to seven-year lows and ETH-focused investment products seeing significant inflows, signaling bullish long-term accumulation.

Artificial Intelligence tokens are one of the year's growth stories, with the market cap of the token category worth over $27 billion according to CoinGecko data.

But there's a problem, as analyst Teng Yang from the Crypto-AI research house Chain of Thought argued in a thread on X.



Decentralized compute networks (DCNs) offer cheap GPUs.But enterprises aren't touching them (mostly).WHY? WHY? A 🧵



The decentralized compute infrastructure, known as Decentralized Compute Networks (DCN) needed to make decentralized AI a reality, isn't keeping pace.

In Semianalysis' March 2025 rankings of GPU cloud providers, decentralized compute platforms barely registered. Only Akash and Prime Intellect appeared, stuck at the very bottom of the list.

Most decentralized platforms didn't even make the cut, underscoring the deep challenges these projects face in competing with centralized hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud.

Coordination, the ability to organize scattered computing resources into a seamless service, remains a critical weak spot.

Unlike centralized services, decentralized platforms struggle with basic tasks such as predictable job routing, efficient data transfers, and built-in fault tolerance, essentials for enterprises accustomed to the streamlined functionality of Kubernetes or Slurm – software tools that enterprises use to easily manage and schedule large computing tasks.

Security and technical reliability present additional hurdles. Most decentralized networks lack essential certifications, such as SOC2 or ISO 27001, leaving their systems prone to fragile networking, storage inconsistencies, and frequent latency spikes.

As Yan notes, decentralized networks suffer from dashboards that feel cumbersome, unclear payment systems, and confusing onboarding processes, failing the straightforward ""spin-up-and-scale"" benchmark enterprises expect.

Finally, economic sustainability remains elusive. Current decentralized networks are overly reliant on temporary token incentives, risking collapse when emissions slow down or halt altogether. Aethir's token, after all, is up 70% in the last month which adds inflationary pressures if someone is subscribing to cloud services denominated in ATH – its eponymous token.

Yan argues decentralized platforms don't need to entirely replace AWS, but they must at least be stable, economical, and easy enough to compete meaningfully. Until then, the ambitious growth of decentralized AI will remain dependent on centralized computing infrastructure.

The Trump Organization has distanced itself from a newly announced cryptocurrency wallet called the ""$TRUMP Wallet,"" despite promotional branding explicitly linked to the former president, CoinDesk previously reported.

A spokesperson stated unequivocally that the organization ""knows nothing"" about the wallet, contradicting announcements made by Magic Eden CEO Jack Lu, who had confirmed a partnership via social media. Donald Trump Jr. and Barron Trump separately clarified that the Trump Organization has ""zero involvement,"" although Trump Jr. mentioned a forthcoming official wallet from World Liberty Financial, a separate stablecoin project associated with the family.

The $TRUMP Wallet's website is currently active, inviting users to a waitlist while promising digital asset trading features, yet provides no substantial technical details or release timeline. The confusion around the project highlights Trump's controversial but ongoing entanglement with crypto, previously illustrated by ventures such as World Liberty Financial and memecoins like Trump Coin and Melania Coin.

Revolut is exploring an expansion into cryptocurrency derivatives, as indicated by a new job listing seeking a general manager to launch and scale a related offering, CoinDesk previously reported.

This development follows the successful rollout of its professional-focused crypto exchange, first in the U.K. in May 2024 and later across the European Union.

The U.K. market for crypto derivatives has recently gained traction, highlighted by the launch of GFO-X, the country's first FCA-regulated, centrally-cleared derivatives platform. Additionally, Galaxy's U.K. subsidiary, led by Mike Novogratz, received FCA approval in April, positioning itself to compete in the growing market segment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","61 publicly listed companies hold over 3% of total Bitcoin supply","https://cointelegraph.com/news/61-corporate-bitcoin-strategy-standard-chartered","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 14:03:45 GMT","

 At least 60 Bitcoin strategy adopters among publicly listed companies collectively doubled BTC holdings in the past two months, outstripping the buying speed of Michael Saylor's Strategy. 

Update (June 4, 1:00 pm UTC): This article's headline and the piece have been updated to emphasize that Standard Chartered's sample included 61 out of a total of 124 publicly listed companies that have adopted Bitcoin treasury strategies, as reported by BitcoinTreasuries.

The Bitcoin reserve strategy trend has led to 61 publicly listed firms now holding a combined 3.2% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist, according to Standard Chartered.

Just 61 public companies out of a total of 124 now own a combined 673,897 Bitcoin (BTC), Standard Chartered's global head of digital asset research, Geoff Kendrick, said in a June 3 report shared with Cointelegraph.

In the report, Kendrick focused on the implications of Bitcoin's growing popularity as a treasury asset, warning about potential risks stemming from rapid corporate adoption.

“Bitcoin treasuries are adding to Bitcoin buying pressure for now, but we see a risk that this may reverse over time,” the analyst said.

According to the report, 58 out of the analyzed 61 corporate treasuries have net asset value (NAV) multiples above 1, meaning that their market valuation is greater than the value of their net assets.

“For now, we think this is justified by market inefficiencies, including regulatory hurdles to investor access and conservative investment committee processes,” Kendrick wrote, adding:

Additionally, Bitcoin's volatility itself may drive the BTC price below the average purchase prices of many new treasures, as 50% of the companies have average purchase prices above $90,000. The figure is significantly higher than the average cost of Strategy's 580,955 Bitcoin holdings acquired at the price of $70,023 per BTC.

Kendrick also observed that a large portion of Strategy “imitators” have started Bitcoin accumulation recently, with holdings rising significantly in the past few months.

Specifically, the amount of Bitcoin held by those 60 companies has doubled in the past two months, from below 50,000 BTC to about 100,000 BTC, the report said.

Kendrick said that such a pace of buying notably outstrips the speed of buying by Strategy, which added 74,000 BTC in the past two months, versus 47,000 by the others.

Standard Chartered's report came amid a new batch of companies announcing Bitcoin strategy adoption, including Canada's renewable energy developer SolarBank.

SolarBank officially announced its Bitcoin treasury strategy on June 3, reporting it has filed an account opening application with Coinbase Prime to provide secure custody, USDC (USDC) services and a self-custodial wallet for its Bitcoin holdings.

On the same day, Paris-based crypto firm Blockchain Group announced a $68 million Bitcoin acquisition, following in the footsteps of Norwegian crypto brokerage firm K33, which raised $6.2 million to buy BTC in late May.

While Standard Chartered focused on 61 public companies holding Bitcoin, the actual number is more than twice as big.

According to data from BitcoinTreasuries, there are 124 companies holding Bitcoin at the time of publication.

While Standard Chartered's concerns about the risks of increasing corporate Bitcoin adoption in the volatility context may look alarming, Strategy, the key Bitcoin strategy inspirer, is optimistic about its BTC stash no matter the price.

According to Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor, the company's capital structure is constructed to remain stable even if Bitcoin falls 90% and “stays there for four or five years.”

“It wouldn't be a good outcome for the equity holders. The people at the top of the capital structure would suffer because they're levered, but everybody else in the capital structure would get paid out,” Saylor said in a Financial Times documentary in May.

According to some prominent industry figures, such as former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, the companies that add Bitcoin to their balance sheets are definitely taking risks, but these risks are manageable.

“Not taking risks is a risk in itself,” Zhao concluded in an X post on Tuesday.

 Pump.fun has yet to confirm or deny rumors of a $1 billion token sale and 10% airdrop, but the community is split on whether the potential launch would help or harm the crypto space. 

Solana-based memecoin launchpad Pump.fun is rumored to be preparing for a $1 billion token sale at a $4 billion valuation.

On June 3, a community member posted on X about a Pump.fun token launch within the next two weeks, with listings on multiple centralized exchanges and a 10% airdrop allocated to community members.

Speculation intensified following a Blockworks report citing anonymous sources saying the launchpad — known for its instant token creation feature — would raise $1 billion through a token sale. The report claimed three sources confirmed the sale would be valued at $4 billion.

Pump.fun has yet to confirm or deny the reports on its official channels and has not provided details regarding the token's utility or launch mechanics. 

Cointelegraph reached out to Pump.fun but had not received a response by publication. 

Reaction across the crypto community was mixed.

Crypto influencer Ansem said he “can't wait” for the token, citing its potential listing on the perpetual futures decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. 

Social media personality Ash Crypto said Pump.fun turned altcoin investors into memecoin gamblers. “PumpFun has ruined crypto space,” they wrote, adding that the platform had already “extracted” $700 million while a majority lost money from tokens launched. 

As of June 4, data aggregator DefiLlama showed that the Pump.fun protocol had earned a cumulative revenue of about $677 million. 

Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher said there's a good and bad side to a potential Pump.fun token launch. The analyst said it's good for making money if users are skilled. However, Deutscher said the token launch is a net bad for crypto: 

DefiLlama developer 0xngmi questioned the potential raise. The pseudonymous developer asked how the platform would invest the funds if they were sitting on nearly $700 million they hadn't spent yet. “What are they planning to do with 1bn?,” the developer asked.

The rumored raise comes amid a steep decline in monthly revenue for Pump.fun. In May, the platform generated $46.6 million, down 66% from January's $137 million, according to DefiLlama. 

The rumors also came amid a slowdown in the memecoin space. Traders have been questioning the long-term viability of memecoins as the tokens have experienced sharp declines in value. CoinMarketCap data showed that the overall market capitalization for meme-based tokens has dropped $64 billion on June 4, down over 54% from December's $137 billion.

 Bitcoin price eyes a breakout as a weakening dollar, US debt concerns, and gold limits shift investor focus. 

Key takeaways:

Gold's upside is limited by potential US sales and lack of domestic production.

Bitcoin gains momentum as US dollar weakens and fiscal concerns grow.

Gold price rose 3% between May 29 and June 2, reaching its highest level in over three weeks, while Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $105,000. 

Although this short-term underperformance might seem negative at first glance, several macroeconomic indicators suggest Bitcoin could break out sooner than expected.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped to its lowest level in six weeks, signaling that investors are reducing their exposure to the US currency. Typically, this trend reflects declining confidence in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and/or growing concerns about the sustainability of US government debt.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CBS on May 1 that the country “is never going to default,” adding that “we are on the warning track.” 

These remarks came after JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised alarms following a House of Representatives bill proposing an additional $4 trillion increase to the debt ceiling.

A weaker DXY Index encourages holders of the $31.2 trillion in outstanding US federal debt to seek returns elsewhere. While fixed-income investments offer predictable returns, the value of the US dollar remains volatile. If foreign currency-based investments deliver better yields, capital is likely to shift away from the dollar.

Despite gold's appeal, there are a few factors that could limit investor demand. The US government is the largest holder of the precious metal, meaning the Treasury could sell part of its reserves to strengthen its fiscal position. Repurchasing some of its debt, especially long-term bonds, would likely boost the US dollar.

Even if the US were to divest 17% of its gold reserves, equivalent to $171.8 billion at current prices, it would still lead global rankings by a wide margin of over 100%. However, while substantial, that amount would only cover around three weeks of the federal deficit, making the effort relatively ineffective.

Related: Blockchain Group adds $68M in Bitcoin to corporate treasury

In contrast, a $171.8 billion investment in Bitcoin would firmly establish US dominance in the asset, easily surpassing China's estimated holdings of 190,000 BTC. More importantly, this scenario is already plausible following the signing of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Executive Order by President Donald Trump in March 2025.

Although the US holds the world's largest gold reserves, it is not among the top four producers. Data from the World Gold Council ranks China, Russia, Australia, and Canada as the leading gold-producing nations. As a result, the US has little incentive to promote rising gold prices, particularly during ongoing trade disputes and heightened geopolitical tensions.

Additionally, data shows net outflows from gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) despite the recent price increase, while spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $3 billion in net inflows since May 15. This doesn't necessarily mean that gold investors are shifting to cryptocurrencies, but it does reflect a lack of confidence in gold's short-term upside.

Gold has grown into a $22.7 trillion asset class, making it less appealing compared to stocks and alternative investments. In contrast, Bitcoin's $2.1 trillion market capitalization suggests significant room for growth. 

Rather than positioning itself as a direct competitor, Bitcoin is gaining traction as concerns mount over the US government's fiscal stability—something that also fuels gold's rise.

Our World Is Getting More Complicated. Here's the 19th-Century Math That Proves It

Nothing in the cosmos is in equilibrium, which means entropy is on the rise

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

Whether we're considering global trade, new technologies or scientific research, everything seems to become more complex over time. In the past, polymaths became well versed in various disciplines and made important contributions to each. But today it is far more difficult for a person to excel in multiple domains, in part because of greater specialization.

This is not an “everything used to be better” rant. It's just a sober observation: the world used to be simpler. And that is true from a mathematical point of view. Physicist and philosopher Ludwig Boltzmann recognized it back in 1872.

Boltzmann studied the behavior of gases and liquids, among other things. Just decades earlier, it had been proposed that everything in the world was made up of tiny building blocks—specifically, atoms and molecules.

If you wanted to describe how liquids and gases behave, you would have to track every single particle. Boltzmann knew that this was not feasible. He therefore developed an equation to describe the movement of particles on average. But this led to a mysterious insight: the individual atoms and molecules seem to follow completely different laws than their collective body. How can this be?

Imagine I show you a short video of balls colliding several times and rolling along a magical, friction-less billiard table. (For the purposes of this thought experiment, imagine there are no holes on the table.)

Now I ask you, “Did I play the video forward or backward?” It is actually impossible to answer my question.

Newton's laws of motion, which describe the elastic impacts of billiard balls, do not depend on the direction of time. They give the same result both forward and backward. In the 19th century, experts assumed that the particles that make up gases or liquids would also move like small balls through empty space, bumping into one another from time to time and following Newton's laws of motion, just like the aforementioned billiard balls.

Today we know that the truth is more complicated. Atoms and molecules obey quantum mechanics, which is much more complex. But interestingly, quantum mechanics is also often assumed to be invariant under time reversal. That means that, like our hypothetical billiard balls, at the atomic and subatomic scale, such as that of molecules of gas, it makes no difference whether you look at the process forward or backward.

At the macro level, however, things look quite different. If you zoom out of this microscopic representation, the direction of time plays a decisive role. Imagine pouring milk into coffee. The different substances mix over time to form a homogeneous liquid. That process cannot be reversed. You cannot remove the milk from the coffee.

This fundamental difference between the micro and macro worlds was Boltzmann's main concern. How can it be that countless equations that describe the movements of individual particles and are invariant under time reversal cause irreversible behavior? If every collision between individual particles can be theoretically reversed, why can't the milk be separated from the coffee?

The phenomenon can be explained intuitively. The particles within a gas or liquid collide again and again. This slows down fast particles, while slow particles are accelerated. If you wait long enough, an equilibrium is reached at some point, and the particles all move at the same speed on average. There may be individual outliers, but on average, the particles have roughly the same speed and are evenly distributed in space.

Boltzmann was able to express parts of this behavior with an equation that is now named after him. This so-called Boltzmann equation shows how the speed and distribution of particles in space changes depending on time and place. He also introduced a “collision operator,” which, depending on conditions such as density or temperature, takes into account the effects of elastic collisions on the particles.

The Boltzmann equation is a differential equation. This means that it contains derivatives, among other things. Such equations are usually difficult to solve. Nevertheless, Boltzmann managed to use this equation to prove that our world is becoming increasingly complex.

To do this, he first had to define what was meant by the term “complex.” A homogeneous mixture of milk and coffee does not seem particularly complex at first. From a mathematical and physical point of view, however, it is. There are countless different ways in which the microscopic particles in the mixture could move and behave, and each of them would produce the same macroscopic result. This means that even if the temperature, density, volume and mixing ratio of the mixture are known precisely, it is not possible to deduce exactly how the molecules are arranged or what their respective speeds are. Many different microscopic states lead to the same end result.

Boltzmann referred to this complexity as “entropy.” The higher the entropy of a system is, the more possibilities there are for its microscopic components to cause the same macroscopic phenomenon. If milk and coffee are separate, their system's complexity—and therefore the entropy—is low. This is because the molecules of the milk are still separate from those of the coffee. If the liquids are poured together, they gradually mix more and more. Their system's complexity and entropy therefore increase steadily over time. As soon as a state of equilibrium is reached, the entropy remains constant.

Boltzmann both described this qualitatively and derived it mathematically with his equation. He thus proved beyond doubt that the complexity of a system increases on the way to equilibrium.

This principle applies to our universe as a whole. Viewed holistically, nothing in the cosmos is in equilibrium, not even the universe itself, which continues to expand. This means that entropy—and therefore complexity—is constantly and inexorably increasing over time.

Are We Ready for Death in Space?

NASA has quietly taken steps to prepare for a death in space. We need to ask how nations will deal with this inevitability now, as more people start traveling off the planet

By Peter Cummings 

SciePro/Science Photo Library/Getty Images

In 2012 NASA stealthily slipped a morgue into orbit.

No press release. No fanfare. Just a sealed, soft-sided pouch tucked in a cargo shipment to the International Space Station (ISS) alongside freeze-dried meals and scientific gear. Officially, it was called the Human Remains Containment Unit (HRCU). To the untrained eye it looked like a shipping bag for frozen cargo. But to NASA it marked something far more sobering: a major advance in preparing for death beyond Earth.

As a kid, I obsessed over how astronauts went to the bathroom in zero gravity. Now, decades later, as a forensic pathologist and a perennial applicant to NASA's astronaut corps, I find myself fixated on a darker, more haunting question:

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

What would happen if an astronaut died out there? Would they be brought home, or would they be left behind? If they expired on some other world, would that be their final resting place? If they passed away on a spacecraft or space station, would their remains be cast off into orbit—or sent on an escape-velocity voyage to the interstellar void?

NASA, it turns out, has begun working out most of these answers. And none too soon. Because the question itself is no longer if someone will die in space—but when.

No astronaut has ever died of natural causes off-world. In 1971 the three-man crew of the Soviet Soyuz 11 mission asphyxiated in space when their spacecraft depressurized shortly before its automated atmospheric reentry—but their deaths were only discovered once the spacecraft landed on Earth. Similarly, every U.S. spaceflight fatality to date has occurred within Earth's atmosphere—under gravity, oxygen and a clear national jurisdiction. That matters, because it means every spaceflight mortality has played out in familiar territory.

But planned missions are getting longer, with destinations beyond low-Earth orbit. And NASA's astronaut corps is getting older. The average age now hovers around 50—an age bracket where natural death becomes statistically relevant, even for clean-living fitness buffs. Death in space is no longer a thought experiment. It's a probability curve—and NASA knows it.

In response, the agency is making subtle but decisive moves. The most recent astronaut selection cycle was extended—not only to boost intake but also to attract younger crew members capable of handling future long-duration missions.

If someone were to die aboard the ISS today, their body would be placed in the HRCU, which would then be sealed and secured in a nonpressurized area to await eventual return to Earth.

The HRCU itself is a modified version of a military-grade body bag designed to store human remains in hazardous environments. It integrates with refrigeration systems already aboard the ISS to slow decomposition and includes odor-control filters and moisture-absorbent linings, as well as reversed zippers for respectful access at the head. There are straps to secure the body in a seat for return, and patches for name tags and national flags.

Cadaver tests conducted in 2019 at Sam Houston State University have proved the system durable. Some versions held for over 40 days before decomposition breached the barrier. NASA even drop-tested the bag from 19 feet to simulate a hard landing.

But it's never been used in space. And since no one yet knows how a body decomposes in true microgravity (or, for that matter, on the moon), no one can really say whether the HRCU would preserve tissue well enough for a forensic autopsy.

This is a troubling knowledge gap, because in space, a death isn't just a tragic loss—it's also a vital data point. Was an astronaut's demise from a fluke of their physiology, or an unavoidable stroke of cosmic bad luck—or was it instead a consequence of flaws in a space habitat's myriad systems that might be found and fixed? Future lives may depend on understanding what went wrong, via a proper postmortem investigation.

But there's no medical examiner in orbit. So NASA trains its crews in something called the In-Mission Forensic Sample Collection protocol. The space agency's astronauts may avoid talking about it, but they all have it memorized: Document everything, ideally with real-time guidance from NASA flight surgeons. Photograph the body. Collect blood and vitreous fluid, as well as hair and tissue samples. Only then can the remains be stowed in the HRCU.

NASA has also prepared for death outside the station—on spacewalks, the moon or deep space missions. If a crew member perishes in vacuum but their remains are retrieved, the body is wrapped in a specially designed space shroud.

The goal isn't just a technical matter of preventing contamination. It's psychological, too, as a way of preserving dignity. Of all the “firsts” any space agency hopes to achieve, the first-ever human corpse drifting into frame on a satellite feed is not among them.

If a burial must occur—in lunar regolith or by jettisoning into solar orbit—the body will be dutifully tracked and cataloged, treated forevermore as a hallowed artifact of space history.

Such gestures are also of relevance to NASA's plans for off-world mourning; grief and memorial protocols are now part of official crew training. If a death occurs, surviving astronauts are tasked with holding a simple ceremony to honor the fallen—then to move on with their mission.

So far we've only covered the “easy” questions. NASA and others are still grappling with harder ones.

Consider the issue of authority over a death and mortal remains. On the ISS, it's simple: the deceased astronaut's home country retains jurisdiction. But that clarity fades as destinations grow more distant and the voyages more diverse: What really happens on space-agency missions to the moon, or to Mars? How might rules change for commercial or multinational spaceflights—or, for that matter, the private space stations and interplanetary settlements that are envisioned by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and other tech multibillionaires?

NASA and its partners have started drafting frameworks, like the Artemis Accords—agreements signed by more than 50 nations to govern behavior in space. But even those don't address many intimate details of death.

What happens, for instance, if foul play is suspected?

The Outer Space Treaty, a legal document drafted in 1967 under the United Nations that is humanity's foundational set of rules for orbit and beyond, doesn't say.

Of course, not everything can be planned for in advance. And NASA has done an extraordinary job of keeping astronauts in orbit alive. But as more people venture into space, and as the frontier stretches to longer voyages and farther destinations, it becomes a statistical certainty that sooner or later someone won't come home.

When that happens, it won't just be a tragedy. It will be a test. A test of our systems, our ethics and our ability to adapt to a new dimension of mortality. To some, NASA's preparations for astronautical death may seem merely morbid, even silly—but that couldn't be further from the truth.

Space won't care of course, whenever it claims more lives. But we will. And rising to that grim occasion with reverence, rigor and grace will define not just policy out in the great beyond—but what it means to be human there, too.

The “people of the cloud forest” developed the high-altitude site

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Rio Abiseo National Park sits over 10,000 feet above sea level in Peru's San Martin region of the Andes Mountains. Plenty of its land is known to hold ancient discoveries, and archaeologists are still uncovering more. Recently, a team located over 100 previously unknown structures, all part of the Chachapoya civilization from sometime between the seventh and 16th centuries. 

According to a release from the World Monuments Fund, a team of archaeologists explored the Gran Pajatén area within the Rio Abiseo National Park, a UNESCO Mixed World Heritage site recognized for both cultural richness and natural beauty. The area was first rediscovered in the 1960s, and in the 1980s—the national park was officially founded in 1983—archaeological teams found 26 ancient structures. This new discovery of over 100 additional structures expands our understanding of the Chachapoya civilization, the members of which were known as the “people of the cloud forest.”

The civilization was known for sophisticated urban centers, ceremonial platforms, cliffside burial structures, and agricultural terraces. The regional chiefdom society also had a distinctive architectural and artistic language that remains on display in circular buildings, geometric friezes, and decorated burials.

From 2022 through 2024, researchers used aerial and manual LiDAR scanning, photogrammetry, topographic registration, and technomorphological analysis to create a detailed map of Gran Pajatén—a site with ceremonial buildings decorated with high-relief friezes, views of the cloud forest, and stone mosaics depicting human figures. The technology allowed archaeologists to see through the forest canopy, map the area, and interpret construction techniques and layout. 

“What makes this moment so meaningful is not only the scale of what's been uncovered, but how we were able to do it,” Benedicte de Montlaur, president and CEO of WMF, said in a statement. “By using advanced technology, our team was able to gather extraordinary visual and scientific documentation that brings Grant Pajaten to life—all while preserving its delicate environment.”

On the ground, investigations have confirmed the Chachapoya presence at Gran Pajatén stretches back as far back as the 14th century, with soil layer analysis hinting at even earlier use of the site. Adding to the discovery is a nearby network of pre-Hispanic roads connecting the site to others in the region, supporting the theory that the civilization was part of a well-connected territory full of hierarchical systems. 

“This discovery radically expands our understating of Gran Pajaten and raises new questions about the site's role in the Chachapoya world,” Juan Pablo de la Puente Brunke, executive director of WMF in Peru, said in a statement. “Evidence now confirms that it is not an isolated complex but part of an articulated network of pre-Hispanic settlements from different periods.” 

The park's remote location means that the rich archaeological sites have been subject to minimal human intervention, helping protect the history with a high degree of authenticity. Many of the sites, though, are fragile, overgrown by vegetation. 

While there, the archaeological team undertook conservation interventions to reinforce stairs and stone reliefs, along with a partial reassembly of a perimeter wall. Ricardo Morales Gamarra, head of the conservation component of the project, said that the work can serve as a model for future efforts in the area. 

The Museo de Arte de Lima in Peru is now offering a free exhibition on the Chachapoya culture and the recent WFM discoveries. “Though the site itself remains out of reach for most,” de Montlaur said, “these tools will allow us to share its stories widely through thoughtful, immersive digital storytelling.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Millions of new solar system objects to be found and 'filmed in technicolor' -- studies predict","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250603213454.htm","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 02:01:23 GMT","

A group of astronomers from across the globe, including a team from the University of Washington and led by Queen's University Belfast, have revealed new research showing that millions of new solar system objects will be detected by a brand-new facility, which is expected to come online later this year.

The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory is set to revolutionize our knowledge of the solar system's ""small bodies"" -- asteroids, comets and other minor planets.

The Rubin Observatory, under construction on the Cerro Pachón ridge in northern Chile, features the 8.4-meter Simonyi Survey Telescope with a unique three-mirror design capable of surveying the entire visible sky every few nights. At its heart is the world's largest digital camera -- the 3.2 gigapixel Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Camera -- covering a 9.6 square-degree field of view with six filters, roughly 45 times the area of the full moon. Together, this ""wide-fast-deep"" system will generate 20 terabytes of data every night -- creating an unprecedented time-lapse ""movie"" of the cosmos over the next 10 years, and an incredibly powerful dataset with which to map the solar system.

The team of astronomers, led by Queen's University's Meg Schwamb, created Sorcha, an innovative new open-source software used to predict what discoveries are likely to be made. Sorcha is the first end-to-end simulator that ingests Rubin's planned observing schedule. It applies assumptions on how Rubin Observatory sees and detects astronomical sources in its images with the best model of what the solar system and its small body reservoirs look like today.

""Accurate simulation software like Sorcha is critical,"" said Schwamb, a reader in the School of Mathematics and Physics at Queen's University. ""It tells us what Rubin will discover and lets us know how to interpret it. Our knowledge of what objects fill Earth's solar system is about to expand exponentially and rapidly.""

In addition to the eight major planets, the solar system is home to a vast population of small bodies that formed alongside the planets more than 4.5 billion years ago. Many of these smaller bodies remain essentially unchanged since the solar system's birth, acting as a fossil record of its earliest days. By studying their orbits, sizes and compositions, astronomers can reconstruct how planets formed, migrated and evolved.

These objects -- numbering in the tens of millions -- -- provide a powerful window into processes such as the delivery of water and organic material to Earth, the reshaping of planetary orbits by giant planets and the ongoing risk posed by those whose paths bring them near our planet.

In addition to Queen's University and the UW, the international team includes researchers from the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

A series of papers describing the software and the predictions have been accepted for publication by The Astronomical Journal.

Beyond just finding these new small bodies, Rubin Observatory will observe them multiple times using different optical filters, revealing their surface colors. Past solar system surveys typically observed with a single filter.

""With the LSST catalog of solar system objects, our work shows that it will be like going from black-and-white television to brilliant color,"" said Joe Murtagh, a doctoral student at Queen's University. ""It's very exciting -- we expect that millions of new solar system objects will be detected and most of these will be picked up in the first few years of sky survey.""

The team's simulations show that Rubin will map:

127,000 near-Earth objects -- asteroids and comets whose orbits cross or approach Earth. That's more than tripling today's known objects, about 38,000, and detecting more than 70% of potentially hazardous bodies larger than 140 meters. This will cut the risk of undetected asteroid impact of catastrophic proportions by at least two times, making a tremendous contribution to planetary defense.

Over 5 million main-belt asteroids, up from about 1.4 million, with precise color and rotation data on roughly one in three asteroids within the survey's first years. This will give scientists unprecedented insight into the characteristics and history of the solar system's building blocks.

109,000 Jupiter Trojans, bodies sharing Jupiter's orbit at stable ""Lagrange"" points -- more than seven times the number cataloged today. These bodies represent some of the most pristine material dating all the way back to the formation of the planets.

37,000 trans-Neptunian objects, residents of the distant Kuiper Belt -- nearly 10 times the current census -- shedding light on Neptune's past migration and the outer solar system's history.

Approximately 1,500-2,000 Centaurs, bodies on short-lived giant planet-crossing orbits in the middle solar system. Most Centaurs will eventually be ejected from the solar system, but a few lucky ones will survive to become short-period comets. The LSST will provide the first detailed view of the Centaurs and the important transition stage from Centaur to comet. 

Rubin Observatory's LSST is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fill in the missing pieces of our solar system, said Mario Juric, a member of the Sorcha team and a UW professor of Astronomy. Juric also is a team lead of Rubin's Solar System Processing Pipelines and a director of UW's DiRAC Institute.

""Our simulations predict that Rubin will expand known small-body populations by factors of 4-9x, delivering an unprecedented trove of orbits, colors and light curves,"" Juric said. ""With this data, we'll be able to update the textbooks of solar system formation and vastly improve our ability to spot -- and potentially deflect -- the asteroids that could threaten Earth.""

It took 225 years of astronomical observations to detect the first 1.5 million asteroids, and researchers found that Rubin will double that number in less than a year, said Jake Kurlander, a doctoral student at the UW.

""Rubin's unparalleled combination of breadth and depth make it a uniquely effective discovery machine,"" Kurlander said.

Siegfried Eggl, an assistant professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign added: ""Only by debiasing LSST's complex observing pattern can we turn raw detections into a true reflection of the solar system's history -- where the planets formed, and how they migrated over billions of years. Sorcha is a game changer in that respect.""

The Sorcha code is open-source and freely available with the simulated catalogs, animations at https://sorcha.space. By making these resources available, the Sorcha team has enabled researchers worldwide to refine their tools and be ready for the flood of LSST data that Rubin will generate, advancing the understanding of the small bodies that illuminate the solar system like never before.

Rubin Observatory is scheduled to unveil its first spectacular imagery at its ""First Look"" event on June 23, offering the world an early glimpse of the survey's power. Full science operations are slated to begin later this year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New mRNA vaccine is more effective and less costly to develop","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250603114825.htm","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 02:02:40 GMT","

A new type of mRNA vaccine is more scalable and adaptable to continuously evolving viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1, according to a study by researchers at University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health and the Pennsylvania State University. The study was published today in npj Vaccines.

Though highly effective at inducing an immune response, current mRNA vaccines, such as those used to prevent COVID-19, present two significant challenges: the high amount of mRNA needed to produce them and the constantly evolving nature of the pathogen.

""The virus changes, moving the goal post, and updating the vaccine takes some time,"" said senior author Suresh Kuchipudi, Ph.D., chair of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology at Pitt Public Health.

To address these challenges, the researchers created a proof-of-concept COVID-19 vaccine using what's known as a""trans-amplifying"" mRNA platform. In this approach, the mRNA is separated into two fragments -- the antigen sequence and the replicase sequence -- the latter of which can be produced in advance, saving crucial time in the event a new vaccine must be developed urgently and produced at scale.

Additionally, the researchers analyzed the spike-protein sequences of all known variants of the SARS-CoV-2 for commonalities, rendering what's known as a ""consensus spike protein"" as the basis for the vaccine's antigen.

In mice, the vaccine induced a robust immune response against many strains of SARS-CoV-2.

""This has the potential for more lasting immunity that would not require updating, because the vaccine has the potential to provide broad protection,"" said Kuchipudi. ""Additionally, this format requires an mRNA dose 40 times less than conventional vaccines, so this new approach significantly reduces the overall cost of the vaccine.""

The lessons learned from this study could inform more efficient vaccine development for other constantly evolving RNA viruses with pandemic potential, Kuchipudi said. ""We hope to apply the principles of this lower-cost, broad-protection antigen design to pressing challenges like bird flu.""

Other authors on the study were Abhinay Gontu, Padmaja Jakka, Ph.D., Maurice Byukusenge, D.V.M., Ph.D., D.A.C.V.M., Meera Surendran Nair, Bhushan M. Jayarao, M.V.Sc., Ph.D., M.P.H., Marco Archetti, Ph.D., and Ruth H. Nissly, Ph.D., all of Pennsylvania State University; and Sougat Misra, Ph.D., Shubhada K. Chothe, Ph.D., M.V.Sc., B.V.Sc., Santhamani Ramasamy, Ph.D., D.A.C.V.M., and Lindsey C. LaBella, all of Pitt.

This research was supported by chair funds from the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences and Interdisciplinary Innovation Fellowship at the One Health Microbiome Center at Pennsylvania State University.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","‘Big Balls' Is Officially a Full-Time Government Employee","https://www.wired.com/story/big-balls-young-doge-converted-into-full-time-government-employees/","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 15:08:00 GMT","

Although Elon Musk has said that he is largely exiting his role at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), at least three of his early operatives and key lieutenants throughout his government takeover have recently become full-time government employees.

Edward Coristine, Luke Farritor, and Ethan Shaotran's employment designations at the General Services Administration (GSA) have been officially converted to full-time from the restricted special government employee classification that limited their time in government to a period of 130 days, according to documentation viewed by WIRED.

Coristine, who has gone by “Big Balls” online and previously worked for a telecommunications firm known for hiring former blackhat hackers, was converted to full time on May 31, along with Farritor. Shaotran became full time on April 10.

WIRED first reported in early February that Coristine, Farritor, and Shaotran were brought on by Musk's DOGE. They then gained unprecedented access to government systems. Before joining DOGE, they had connections to Musk-owned companies: Farritor interned at SpaceX, Coristine worked at Neuralink for three months, and Shaotran participated in an xAI hackathon last October.

Since January, all three have obtained access to dozens of federal agencies in addition to GSA, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and many others. They have also been tied to major changes to the federal government apparatus: Farritor was closely linked to the dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development, and Coristine has reportedly been one of the leaders of the initiative related to President Donald Trump's “gold card” visas that are sold for $5 million.

It's not immediately clear if the new designations affect their abilities to maintain access to other agencies outside of GSA.

Coristine, Farritor, and Shaotran, according to documentation viewed by WIRED, each maintain their “senior adviser” titles. Coristine and Farritor are drawing some of the largest salaries possible for government employees through the “General Schedule” employee rankings. They have a salary grade of GS-15, one of the highest grades, and Shaotran is one step below at GS-14. When they were special government employees, Coristine, Farritor, and Shaotran did not appear to be drawing salaries at all through GSA, WIRED reported in March.

Kyle Schutt, another early DOGE operative, has also appeared to change employment classification at least twice but currently seems to be listed as a special government employee in documentation seen by WIRED.

The White House and GSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Despite Musk's apparent departure from the Trump administration last week, DOGE has shown no signs of pausing its work in government agencies. Last week, WIRED reported that there has been a renewed urgency for DOGE-style work at agencies including the Office of Personnel Management, US Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Interior. Federal workers told WIRED they were asked to quickly review and potentially slash contracts, especially those pertaining to IT and human resources.

Farritor and Coristine, along with other members of Musk's early DOGE team like Sam Corcos and Gavin Kliger, have met with a number of departments in recent days, while new DOGE affiliates have been detailed to different agencies.

DOGE, WIRED reported, also appears to be actively recruiting.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Perplexity's CEO Sees AI Agents as the Next Web Battleground","https://www.wired.com/story/perplexitys-ceo-sees-ai-agents-as-the-next-web-battleground/","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:25:00 GMT","

Perplexity has tapped into the power of generative artificial intelligence—with all its problematic tendencies—in an effort to challenge Google as the dominant way people find information online.

The AI search tool rose in prominence in 2024 and was lauded as a promising alternative to Googling. Like other AI players though, the service has been sued for alleged copyright infringement. It has been accused by Forbes of plagiarizing its news articles, closely paraphrasing other websites, and hallucinating incorrect information.

Despite the furor, Perplexity today says that its service gets 650 million queries per month and is said to be chasing investment that would value the company at $18 billion. The company is pushing AI assistants for mobile devices and working on its own web browser. In April, Motorola announced that Perplexity would come bundled with its new Razr Ultra phones. Last month the company partnered with PayPal to make it easier for users to buy products using its assistant. Samsung is also said to be in talks to possibly include Perplexity on its devices, according to a report from Bloomberg. (Perplexity declined to comment on this after the interview.).

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas spoke with Will Knight, senior writer at WIRED, by phone and email.

This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

WIRED: The PayPal deal seems important to the vision that everyone has for agents. Is ecommerce the killer “agentic” app?

Aravind Srinivas: Agents are the killer app for everything. Agents allow users to have the experience that's best for them. Some people like shopping and researching, and some people want it done for them. There's a spectrum in between, and our focus is what is the best experience for the user.

Speaking of the experience, agents still make mistakes. What happens when they buy something by accident?

Merchants and buyers have adapted to every new technology since ancient times. We just show both of them what is possible, and they choose. Every successful technology has had to take security and error-resolution very seriously, and that won't change.

Integrating AI with personal devices is another big theme. Why does the Motorola deal matter to you?

It's a big deal because Motorola is one of the largest phone brands in the world. This partnership gives us the ability to make trustworthy AI more accessible than ever. Now, by introducing Perplexity to millions of people around the world, in a native and seamless way, more people will get to see how much more really is possible with search.

Would you consider developing your own devices eventually?

We are focused on building the best AI assistant and answer engine.

Motorola will offer other AI assistants, so how will Perplexity distinguish itself?

As AI assistants become more common, accuracy and trust will become even more important. An assistant isn't very useful if it's unreliable. Worse, if an assistant is misleading or sycophantic, then it isn't an assistant—it's a manipulator. That's not just useless, it's dangerous. Inaccurate AI has a negative compounding effect, and we have always been the leader in developing AI and AI assistants focused on accuracy and verifiability. That will have a positive compounding effect.

Wait though … Perplexity—like other AI search engines—has been criticized for hallucinating and getting things wrong.

We welcome this criticism, because it's the best way for us to continually improve. In reality, errors account for a small fraction of results, and our answers are far more accurate than 10 blue links polluted by decades of SEO-optimized content. [In response to a follow-up request, Perplexity did not provide further details on error rates, but Jesse Dwyer, a spokesman, said that reliability is improving constantly]. But the fact is, accuracy and trust will only become more important as AI integrates into more of our lives, so this is something we're relentlessly focused on. We can't get there without this feedback.

Perplexity also cribs from copyrighted news articles with its “discover” section. Do you understand why some publishers are upset?

We've answered that before. See our blog post on how we respect robots.txt [a file added to websites that specifies whether web crawlers should access their content].

The Perplexity assistant for Android and iOS seems “agentic” because it can take actions. How big of a shift is this?

AI is pretty good at answering questions now. What really needs to be done is get AI to take actions. People use the word “agents”; you can go with whatever you want—“agent” or “assistant”—but in the end, it needs to string together tools and execute actions. That's why we're [also building a] browser, and an assistant on iOS, Android.

Do Apple and Google have too much control over their mobile platforms compared to outsiders looking to build agents?

With iOS it's particularly challenging, because you have to string together a bunch of event APIs. On iOS, Mail, Calendar, Reminders, Podcasts, all that stuff is natively available through the Apple SDK [software development kit used to build applications], so you can actually at least draft emails, schedule meetings, move meetings, set reminders, all this stuff, open podcasts pretty easily. You can do searches for podcasts … “get me the one where Mark Andreessen discusses de-banking with Joe Rogan.” It can get you that pretty quickly.

It's mostly difficult because you cannot access other apps. iOS is not very different from Android, because AI cannot access most apps on Android either (meaning that the Perplexity assistant can interact with some apps more easily than others). [But] third-party apps can build their SDKs to be accessible on the Android SDK. For example, our Android system can display a song on Spotify. On iOS, you can only link to a specific Spotify song, and you have to manually start playing the audio.

Oh, so it's app-makers that are holding AI agents back?

That's the challenge. If people are offering us APIs—say, Open Table, Uber, DoorDash, or Instacart—where we can access information within the app without even having to open the app. On the back end, that's pretty powerful. For example, if we can access information on Uber and find that Uber comfort doesn't cost more than 5 or 10 percent of Uber X, then we can just book Uber comfort for you—if that's a preference that you set on Perplexity.

Or similarly [we can] find the best Thai place near you and get me a dash [delivery] a lot faster than going to DoorDash app, searching for Thai food and scrolling through all these options, reading all those reviews and then putting your address, doing the checkout, all that stuff. We could honestly do all that in our system and just make the experience a lot more seamless and simple. I think that's where things are headed, but people need to open up their apps to us, and we'll have to see who's willing to do what.

Isn't the biggest problem that AI agents just aren't very smart and useful yet?

My analogy [for AI agents] is that we are at a point where Perplexity was in 2022 [just before it took off]. It's not like we got all the answers right, people made fun of hallucinations and some people call it “Google in macro seconds.” It was not quite there.

It only took off many months later, when models got better, and I expect the same trend with the agents and assistants. There's going to be some set of things that really work, daily use cases, and there'll be a long tail of things that don't work, that we're going to keep fixing over time.

But that's exactly why we are building a [web] browser, because the browser front end will let you do the work on your own too, if you're not happy with what the AI did. So, then we can learn from that and fix that over time. Waymo and Tesla self driving did not work for a long time. Now, people take them for granted. I think it is a similar trajectory for us.

Is this why you floated the idea of Perxplexity taking control of Chrome—if Google were forced to divest it?

We're not saying we're interested in buying Chrome. We're saying that if there's no other path, if Google is put in a situation where they have to divest Chrome, then we'd be open to running it. But Google should not have to divest Chrome, because Chrome and Chromium are tied to each other.

Chromium is an open source project that's being run very [well] by Google, and it is the reason for Microsoft Edge and the Brave browser.

OpenAI has also shown an interest in taking control of Chrome.

Giving ownership of Chrome or Chromium to a company like OpenAI would be a disaster, because open source and OpenAI are an oxymoron at this point. [OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. The company says it will release an open source AI model this summer.]

There are only two companies that can really potentially run Chrome: Microsoft and Meta. Honestly, Microsoft would spoil it, just like it spoiled Edge. And transferring Chrome to Meta is transferring Chrome from one monopoly to another. [The FTC has filed a lawsuit that accuses Meta of acting as a social networking monopoly; the company argues this is not the case.]

What do you expect agents to be useful for first?

I think [they will make] a lot of your personal searches a lot better.

Like asking, “What was the article I read last week about this one particular company?” or “Can you summarize my X feed for me so that I know what's trending?” because you don't want to go to X and get distracted by it. Or “Can you schedule this meeting for me with this person and if there's a conflict send them an email asking for a different time?” All these boring things, I feel we will be able to automate [them] pretty quickly [in future].

In the near future one hacker may be able to unleash 20 zero-day attacks on different systems across the world all at once. Polymorphic malware could rampage across a codebase, using a bespoke generative AI system to rewrite itself as it learns and adapts. Armies of script kiddies could use purpose-built LLMs to unleash a torrent of malicious code at the push of a button.

Case in point: as of this writing, an AI system is sitting at the top of several leaderboards on HackerOne—an enterprise bug bounty system. The AI is XBOW, a system aimed at whitehat pentesters that “autonomously finds and exploits vulnerabilities in 75 percent of web benchmarks,” according to the company's website.

AI-assisted hackers are a major fear in the cybersecurity industry, even if their potential hasn't quite been realized yet. “I compare it to being on an emergency landing on an aircraft where it's like ‘brace, brace, brace' but we still have yet to impact anything,” Hayden Smith, the cofounder of security company Hunted Labs, tells WIRED. “We're still waiting to have that mass event.”

Generative AI has made it easier for anyone to code. The LLMs improve every day, new models spit out more efficient code, and companies like Microsoft say they're using AI agents to help write their codebase. Anyone can spit out a Python script using ChatGPT now, and vibe coding—asking an AI to write code for you, even if you don't have much of an idea how to do it yourself—is popular; but there's also vibe hacking.

“We're going to see vibe hacking. And people without previous knowledge or deep knowledge will be able to tell AI what it wants to create and be able to go ahead and get that problem solved,” Katie Moussouris, the founder and CEO of Luta Security, tells WIRED.

Vibe hacking frontends have existed since 2023. Back then, a purpose-built LLM for generating malicious code called WormGPT spread on Discord groups, Telegram servers, and darknet forums. When security professionals and the media discovered it, its creators pulled the plug.

WormGPT faded away, but other services that billed themselves as blackhat LLMs, like FraudGPT, replaced it. But WormGPT's successors had problems. As security firm Abnormal AI notes, many of these apps may have just been jailbroken versions of ChatGPT with some extra code to make them appear as if they were a stand-alone product.

Better then, if you're a bad actor, to just go to the source. ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are easily jailbroken. Most LLMs have guard rails that prevent them from generating malicious code, but there are whole communities online dedicated to bypassing those guardrails. Anthropic even offers a bug bounty to people who discover new ones in Claude.

“It's very important to us that we develop our models safely,” an OpenAI spokesperson tells WIRED. “We take steps to reduce the risk of malicious use, and we're continually improving safeguards to make our models more robust against exploits like jailbreaks. For example, you can read our research and approach to jailbreaks in the GPT-4.5 system card, or in the OpenAI o3 and o4-mini system card.”

Google did not respond to a request for comment.

In 2023, security researchers at Trend Micro got ChatGPT to generate malicious code by prompting it into the role of a security researcher and pentester. ChatGPT would then happily generate PowerShell scripts based on databases of malicious code.

“You can use it to create malware,” Moussouris says. “The easiest way to get around those safeguards put in place by the makers of the AI models is to say that you're competing in a capture-the-flag exercise, and it will happily generate malicious code for you.”

Unsophisticated actors like script kiddies are an age-old problem in the world of cybersecurity, and AI may well amplify their profile. “It lowers the barrier to entry to cybercrime,” Hayley Benedict, a Cyber Intelligence Analyst at RANE, tells WIRED.

But, she says, the real threat may come from established hacking groups who will use AI to further enhance their already fearsome abilities.

“It's the hackers that already have the capabilities and already have these operations,” she says. “It's being able to drastically scale up these cybercriminal operations, and they can create the malicious code a lot faster.”

Moussouris agrees. “The acceleration is what is going to make it extremely difficult to control,” she says.

Hunted Labs' Smith also says that the real threat of AI-generated code is in the hands of someone who already knows the code in and out who uses it to scale up an attack. “When you're working with someone who has deep experience and you combine that with, ‘Hey, I can do things a lot faster that otherwise would have taken me a couple days or three days, and now it takes me 30 minutes.' That's a really interesting and dynamic part of the situation,” he says.

According to Smith, an experienced hacker could design a system that defeats multiple security protections and learns as it goes. The malicious bit of code would rewrite its malicious payload as it learns on the fly. “That would be completely insane and difficult to triage,” he says.

Smith imagines a world where 20 zero-day events all happen at the same time. “That makes it a little bit more scary,” he says.

Moussouris says that the tools to make that kind of attack a reality exist now. “They are good enough in the hands of a good enough operator,” she says, but AI is not quite good enough yet for an inexperienced hacker to operate hands-off.

“We're not quite there in terms of AI being able to fully take over the function of a human in offensive security,” she says.

The primal fear that chatbot code sparks is that anyone will be able to do it, but the reality is that a sophisticated actor with deep knowledge of existing code is much more frightening. XBOW may be the closest thing to an autonomous “AI hacker” that exists in the wild, and it's the creation of a team of more than 20 skilled people whose previous work experience includes GitHub, Microsoft, and a half a dozen assorted security companies.

It also points to another truth. “The best defense against a bad guy with AI is a good guy with AI,” Benedict says.

For Moussouris, the use of AI by both blackhats and whitehats is just the next evolution of a cybersecurity arms race she's watched unfold over 30 years. “It went from: ‘I'm going to perform this hack manually or create my own custom exploit,' to, ‘I'm going to create a tool that anyone can run and perform some of these checks automatically,'” she says.

“AI is just another tool in the toolbox, and those who do know how to steer it appropriately now are going to be the ones that make those vibey frontends that anyone could use.”

Imagine you meet someone new. Be it on a dating app or social media, you chance across each other online and get to talking. They're genuine and relatable, so you quickly take it out of the DMs to a platform like Telegram or WhatsApp. You exchange photos and even video call each over. You start to get comfortable. Then, suddenly, they bring up money.

They need you to cover the cost of their Wi-Fi access, maybe. Or they're trying out this new cryptocurrency. You should really get in on it early! And then, only after it's too late, you realize that the person you were talking to was in fact not real at all.

They were a real-time AI-generated deepfake hiding the face of someone running a scam.

This scenario might sound too dystopian or science-fictional to be true, but it has happened to countless people already. With the spike in the capabilities of generative AI over the past few years, scammers can now create realistic fake faces and voices to mask their own in real time. And experts warn that those deepfakes can supercharge a dizzying variety of online scams, from romance to employment to tax fraud.

David Maimon, the head of fraud insights at identity verification firm SentiLink and a professor of criminology at Georgia State University, has been tracking the evolution of AI romance scams and other kinds of AI fraud for the past six years. “We're seeing a dramatic increase in the volume of deepfakes, especially in comparison to 2023 and 2024,” Maimon says.

“It wasn't a whole lot. We're talking about maybe four or five a month,” he says. “Now, we're seeing hundreds of these on a monthly basis across the board, which is mind-boggling.”

Deepfakes are already being used in a variety of online scams. One finance worker in Hong Kong, for example, paid $25 million to a scammer posing as the company's chief financial officer in a deepfaked video call. Some deepfake scammers have even posted instructional videos on YouTube, which have a disclaimer as being for “pranks and educational purposes only.” Those videos usually open with a romance scam call, where an AI-generated handsome young man is talking to an older woman.

More traditional deepfakes—such as a pre-rendered video of a celebrity or politician, rather than a live fake—have also become more prevalent. Last year, a retiree in New Zealand lost around $133,000 to a cryptocurrency investment scam after seeing a Facebook advertisement featuring a deepfake of the country's prime minister encouraging people to buy in.

Maimon says SentiLink has started to see deepfakes used to create bank accounts in order to lease an apartment or engage in tax refund fraud. He says an increasing number of companies have also seen deepfakes in video job interviews.

“ Anything that requires folks to be online and which supports the opportunity of swapping faces with someone—that will be available and open for fraud to take advantage of,” Maimon says.

Part of the reason for this increase is that the barriers for creating deepfakes are getting lower. There are a lot of easily accessible AI tools that can generate realistic faces and a lot of tools that can animate those faces or create full-length videos out of them. Scammers often use images and videos of real people, deepfaked to slightly change their faces or alter what they're saying, to target their loved ones or hijack their public influence.

Matt Groh, a professor of management at Northwestern University who researches people's ability to detect deepfakes, says that point-and-click generative AI tools make it much easier to make small, believable changes to already-existing media.

“If there's an image of you on the internet, that would be enough to manipulate a face to look like it's saying something that you haven't said before or doing something you haven't done before,” Groh says.

It's not just fake video that you need to be worried about. With a few clips of audio, it's also possible to make a believable copy of somebody's voice. One study in 2023 found that humans failed to detect deepfake audio over a quarter of the time.

“ Just a single image and five seconds of audio online mean that it's definitely possible for a scammer to make some kind of realistic deepfake of you,” Groh says.

Deepfakes are becoming more pervasive in contexts other than outright scams. Social media has been flooded over the past year with AI-generated “influencers” stealing content from adult creators by deepfaking new faces onto their bodies and monetizing the resulting videos. Deepfakes have even bled over into geopolitics, like when the mayors of multiple European capital cities held video calls with a fake version of the mayor of Kyiv, Ukraine. People have started using deepfakes for personal reasons, like bringing back a dead relative or creating an avatar of a victim to testify in court.

So, if deepfakes are everywhere, how do you spot one? The answer is not technology. A number of technology companies, including OpenAI, have launched deepfake detection tools. Researchers have also proposed mechanisms to detect deepfakes based on things like light reflected in a person's eyes or inconsistent facial movements, and have started investigating how to implement them in real time.

But those models often cannot reliably detect different kinds of AI fakes. OpenAI's model, for example, is specifically designed only to report content generated with the company's own Dall-E 3 tool but not other image generation models.

There's also the risk that scammers can abuse AI detectors by repeatedly tweaking their content until it fools the software.

“ The major thing we have to understand is that the technology we have right now is not good enough to detect those deepfakes,” Maimon says. “ We're still very much behind.”

For now, as video deepfakes get more popular, the best way to detect one relies on humans. Studies on deepfake detection show that people are best at distinguishing whether videos are real or fake, as opposed to just audio or text content, and are in some cases even better than leading detection models.

Groh's team conducted one study which found that taking more time to determine whether an image was real or fake led to a significant increase in accuracy, by up to eight percentage points for just 10 seconds of viewing time.

“ This sounds almost so simple,” Groh says. “But if you spend just a couple extra seconds, that leads to way higher rates of being able to distinguish an image as real or fake. One of the ways for any regular person to just be a little bit less susceptible to a scam is to ask, ‘Does this look actually real?' And if you just do that for a few extra seconds, we're all going to be a little bit better off.”

Deepfakes' popularity could be a double-edged sword for scammers, Groh says. The more widespread they are, the more people will be familiar with them and know what to look for.

That familiarity has paid off in some cases. Last summer, a Ferrari executive received a call from someone claiming to be the CEO of the company. The person convincingly emulated the CEO's voice but abruptly hung up the call when the executive tried to verify their identity by asking what book the CEO had recommended just days earlier. The CEO of WPP, the world's biggest advertising agency, was also unsuccessfully targeted by a similar deepfake scam.

“I think there's a balancing act going on,” Groh says. “ We definitely have technology today that is generally hard for people to identify. But at the same time, once you know that there's a point-and-click tool that allows you to transform one element into something else, everyone becomes a lot more skeptical.”

If you buy that artificial intelligence is a once-in-a-species disruption, then what Demis Hassabis thinks should be of vital interest to you. Hassabis leads the AI charge for Google, arguably the best-equipped of the companies spending many billions of dollars to bring about that upheaval. He's among those powerful leaders gunning to build artificial general intelligence, the technology that will supposedly have machines do everything humans do, but better.

None of his competitors, however, have earned a Nobel Prize and a knighthood for their achievements. Sir Demis is the exception—and he did it all through games. Growing up in London, he was a teenage chess prodigy; at age 13 he ranked second in his age group worldwide. He was also fascinated by complex computer games, both as an elite player and then as a designer and programmer of legendary titles like Theme Park. But his true passion was making computers as smart as wizards like himself. He even left the gaming world to study the brain and got his PhD in cognitive neuroscience in 2009. A year later he began the ultimate hero's quest—a journey to invent artificial general intelligence through the company he cofounded, DeepMind. Google bought the company in 2014, and more recently merged it with a more product-oriented AI group, Google Brain, which Hassabis heads. Among other things, he has used a gamelike approach to solve the scientific problem of predicting the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence—AlphaFold, the innovation that last year earned him the chemistry Nobel.

Now Hassabis is doubling down on perhaps the biggest game of all—developing AGI in the thick of a brutal competition with other companies and all of China. If that isn't enough, he's also CEO of an Alphabet company called Isomorphic, which aims to exploit the possibilities of AlphaFold and other AI breakthroughs for drug discovery.

When I spoke to Hassabis at Google's New York City headquarters, his answers came as quickly as a chatbot's, crisply parrying every inquiry I could muster with high spirits and a confidence that he and Google are on the right path. Does AI need a big breakthrough before we get to AGI? Yes, but it's in the works! Does leveling up AI court catastrophic perils? Don't worry, AGI itself will save the day! Will it annihilate the job market as it exists today? Probably, but there will always be work for at least a few of us. That—if you can believe it—is optimism. You may not always agree with what Hassabis has to say, but his thoughts and his next moves matter. History, after all, will be written by the winners.

This interview was edited for clarity and concision.

When you founded DeepMind you said it had a 20-year mission to solve intelligence and then use that intelligence to solve everything else. You're 15 years into it—are you on track?

We're pretty much dead on track. In the next five to 10 years, there's maybe a 50 percent chance that we'll have what we define as AGI.

What is that definition, and how do we know we're that close?

There's a debate about definitions of AGI, but we've always thought about it as a system that has the ability to exhibit all the cognitive capabilities we have as humans.

Eric Schmidt, who used to run Google, has said that if China gets AGI first, then we're cooked, because the first one to achieve it will use the technology to grow bigger and bigger leads. You don't buy that?

It's an unknown. That's sometimes called the hard-takeoff scenario, where AGI is extremely fast at coding future versions of themselves. So a slight lead could in a few days suddenly become a chasm. My guess is that it's going to be more of an incremental shift. It'll take a while for the effects of digital intelligence to really impact a lot of real-world things—maybe another decade-plus.

Since the hard-takeoff scenario is possible, does Google believe it's existential to get AGI first?

It's a very intense time in the field, with so many resources going into it, lots of pressures, lots of things that need to be researched. We obviously want all of the brilliant things that these AI systems can do. New cures for diseases, new energy sources, incredible things for humanity. But if the first AI systems are built with the wrong value systems, or they're built unsafely, that could be very bad.

There are at least two risks that I worry a lot about. One is bad actors, whether individuals or rogue nations, repurposing AGI for harmful ends. The second one is the technical risk of AI itself. As AI gets more powerful and agentic, can we make sure the guardrails around it are safe and can't be circumvented.

Only two years ago AI companies, including Google, were saying, “Please regulate us.” Now, in the US at least, the administration seems less interested in putting regulations on AI than accelerating it so we can beat the Chinese. Are you still asking for regulation?

The idea of smart regulation makes sense. It must be nimble, as the knowledge about the research becomes better and better. It also needs to be international. That's the bigger problem.

If you reach a point where progress has outstripped the ability to make the systems safe, would you take a pause?

I don't think today's systems are posing any sort of existential risk, so it's still theoretical. The geopolitical questions could actually end up being trickier. But given enough time and enough care and thoughtfulness, and using the scientific method …

If the time frame is as tight as you say, we don't have much time for care and thoughtfulness.

We don't have much time. We're increasingly putting resources into security and things like cyber and also research into, you know, controllability and understanding these systems, sometimes called mechanistic interpretability. And then at the same time, we need to also have societal debates about institutional building. How do we want governance to work? How are we going to get international agreement, at least on some basic principles around how these systems are used and deployed and also built?

How much do you think AI is going to change or eliminate people's jobs?

What generally tends to happen is new jobs are created that utilize new tools or technologies and are actually better. We'll see if it's different this time, but for the next few years, we'll have these incredible tools that supercharge our productivity and actually almost make us a little bit superhuman.

If AGI can do everything humans can do, then it would seem that it could do the new jobs too.

There's a lot of things that we won't want to do with a machine. A doctor could be helped by an AI tool, or you could even have an AI kind of doctor. But you wouldn't want a robot nurse—there's something about the human empathy aspect of that care that's particularly humanistic.

Tell me what you envision when you look at our future in 20 years and, according to your prediction, AGI is everywhere?

If everything goes well, then we should be in an era of radical abundance, a kind of golden era. AGI can solve what I call root-node problems in the world—curing terrible diseases, much healthier and longer lifespans, finding new energy sources. If that all happens, then it should be an era of maximum human flourishing, where we travel to the stars and colonize the galaxy. I think that will begin to happen in 2030.

I'm skeptical. We have unbelievable abundance in the Western world, but we don't distribute it fairly. As for solving big problems, we don't need answers so much as resolve. We don't need an AGI to tell us how to fix climate change—we know how. But we don't do it.

I agree with that. We've been, as a species, a society, not good at collaborating. Our natural habitats are being destroyed, and it's partly because it would require people to make sacrifices, and people don't want to. But this radical abundance of AI will make things feel like a non-zero-sum game—

AGI would change human behavior?

Yeah. Let me give you a very simple example. Water access is going to be a huge issue, but we have a solution—desalination. It costs a lot of energy, but if there was renewable, free, clean energy [because AI came up with it] from fusion, then suddenly you solve the water access problem. Suddenly it's not a zero-sum game anymore.

If AGI solves those problems, will we become less selfish?

That's what I hope. AGI will give us radical abundance and then—this is where I think we need some great philosophers or social scientists involved—we shift our mindset as a society to non-zero sum.

Do you think having profit-making companies drive this innovation is the right way to go?

Capitalism and the Western democratic systems have so far been proven to be the best drivers of progress. Once you get to the post-AGI stage of radical abundance, new economic theories are required. I'm not sure why economists are not working harder on this.

Whenever I write about AI, I hear from people who are intensely angry about it. It's almost like hearing from artisans displaced by the Industrial Revolution. They feel that AI is being foisted on the public without their approval. Have you experienced that pushback and anger?

I haven't personally seen a lot of that. But I've read and heard a lot about that. It's very understandable. This will be at least as big as the Industrial Revolution, probably a lot bigger. It's scary that things will change.

On the other hand, when I talk to people about why I'm building AI—to advance science and medicine and understanding of the world around us—I can demonstrate it's not just talk. Here's AlphaFold, a Nobel Prize–winning breakthrough that can help with medicine and drug discovery. When they hear that, people say of course we need that, it would be immoral not to have that if it's within our grasp. I would be very worried about our future if I didn't know something as revolutionary as AI was coming, to help with those other challenges. Of course, it's also a challenge itself. But it can actually help with the others if we get it right.

You come from a gaming background—how does that affect what you're doing now?

Some of that training I had when I was a kid, playing chess on an international stage, the pressure was very useful training for the competitive world that we're in.

Game systems seem easier for AI to master because they are bound by rules. We've seen flashes of genius in those arenas—I'm thinking of the surprising moves that AI systems pulled off in various games, like the Hand of God in the Deep Blue chess match, and Move 37 in the AlphaGo match. But the real world is way more complex. Could we expect AI systems to make similar non-intuitive, masterful moves in real life?

That's the dream.

Would they be able to capture the rules of existence?

That's exactly what I'm hoping for from AGI—a new theory of physics. We have no systems that can invent a game like Go today. We can use AI to solve a math problem, maybe even a Millennium Prize problem. But can you have a system come up with something as compelling as the Riemann hypothesis? No. That requires true inventive capability, which I think the systems don't have yet.

It would be mind-blowing if AI was able to crack the code that underpins the universe.

But that's why I started on this. It was my goal from the beginning, when I was a kid.

To solve existence?

Reality. The nature of reality. It's on my Twitter bio: “Trying to understand the fundamental nature of reality.” It's not there for no reason. That's probably the deepest question of all. We don't know what the nature of time is, or consciousness and reality. I don't understand why people don't think about them more. I mean, this is staring us in the face.

Did you ever take LSD? That's how some people get a glimpse of the nature of reality.

No. I don't want to. I didn't do it like that. I just did it through my gaming and reading a hell of a lot when I was a kid, both science fiction and science. I'm too worried about the effects on the brain, I've done too much neuroscience. I've sort of finely tuned my mind to work in this way. I need it for where I'm going.

This is profound stuff, but you're also charged with leading Google's efforts to compete right now in AI. It seems we're in a game of leapfrog where every few weeks you or a competitor comes out with a new model that claims supremacy according to some obscure benchmark. Is there a giant leap coming to break out of this mode?

We have the deepest research bench. So we're always looking at what we sometimes call internally the next transformer.

Do you have an internal candidate for something that could be a comparable breakthrough to transformers—that could amount to another big jump in performance?

Yeah, we have three or four promising ideas that could mature into as big a leap as that.

If that happens, how would you not repeat the mistakes of the past? It wasn't enough for Google engineers to discover the transformers architecture, as they did in 2017. Because Google didn't press its advantage, OpenAI wound up exploiting it first and kicking off the generative AI boom.

We probably need to learn some lessons from that time, where maybe we were too focused on just pure research. In hindsight we should have not just invented it, but also pushed to productionize it and scale it more quickly. That's certainly what we would plan to do this time around.

Google is one of several companies hoping to offer customers AI agents to perform tasks. Is the critical problem making sure that they don't screw things up when they make some autonomous choice?

The reason all the leading labs are working on agents is because they'll be way more useful as assistants. Today's models are basically passive Q and A systems. But you don't want it to just recommend your restaurant—you'd love it to book that restaurant as well. But yes, it comes with new challenges of keeping the guardrails around those agents, and we're working very hard on the security aspects, to test them prior to putting them on the web.

Will these agents be persistent companions and task-doers?

I have this notion of a universal assistant, right? Eventually, you should have this system that's so useful you're using it all the time, every day. A constant companion or assistant. It knows you well, it knows your preferences, and it enriches your life and makes it more productive.

Help me understand something that was just announced at the I/O developer conference. Google introduced what it calls “AI Mode” to its search page—when you do a search, you'll be able to get answers from a powerful chatbot. Google already has AI Overviews at the top of search results, so people don't have to click on links as much. It makes me wonder if your company is stepping into a new paradigm where Google fulfills its mission of organizing and accessing the world's information not through traditional search, but in a chat with generative AI. If Gemini can satisfy your questions, why search at all?

There's two clear use cases. When you want to get information really quickly and efficiently and just get some facts right, and then maybe check some sources, you use AI-powered search, as you're seeing with AI Overviews. If you want to do slightly deeper searches, then AI Mode is going to be great for that.

But we've been talking about how our interface with technology will be a continuous dialog with an AI assistant.

Steven, I don't know if you have an assistant. I have a really cool one who has worked with me for 10 years. I don't go to her for all my informational needs. I just use search for that, right?

Your assistant hasn't absorbed all of human knowledge. Gemini aspires to that, so why use search?

All I can tell you is that today, and for the next two or three years, both those modes are going to be growing and necessary. We plan to dominate both.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Texting Network for the End of the World","https://www.wired.com/story/youre-not-ready-for-phone-dead-zones/","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Hypothetical: You wake up tomorrow morning to find a superstorm that developed overnight thanks to climate change has sparked a chain of events that abruptly ushers in a new ice age and alters human society as we know it. (Yes, this is the plot of The Day After Tomorrow. Stick with us.) All the communication networks you relied on are down. Your phone is basically worthless. The internet has functionally ceased to exist. But you need to connect with people you trust to get help and survive. What do you do? More importantly, how did you prepare?

Less Hollywood-esque versions of having no cell service or Wi-Fi happen all the time, of course; maybe you're hiking in a secluded area, white-knuckling through a major natural disaster, or living under a repressive regime that cuts internet access to quash public protests. Fortunately, for all these scenarios, there's a low-budget solution: Meshtastic.

Meshtastic is a program that enables devices to send text messages over long distances without needing Wi-Fi or cell service. Long range radio (LoRa) nodes help pass messages along, forming a network of devices that can talk to each other even in remote areas. Messages hop from device to device, with each node relaying messages it hasn't seen before—extending the network's reach across miles using minimal power. That is to say, Meshtastic is designed specifically for sending text messages over free-to-use radio frequencies to both groups and individuals, even when cell service and internet connections are nowhere to be found.

“The cool thing about Meshtastic is that it's like a radio infrastructure without the infrastructure. It's ad hoc,” says Eric Kristoff, a volunteer member of the Chicago chapter of the Mars Society, a nonprofit that advocates for the human exploration and colonization of Mars.

Kristoff says the group has been testing the use of Meshtastic as a way to give Mars Society “analog astronauts” the ability to communicate and keep track of each others' locations without the use of earthly infrastructure.

“We have a set of Meshtastic T-Echo radios, about the size of a deck of cards, and they are worn on the person of the analog astronaut,” he says.

The radios that use Meshtastic cost roughly $30 (though you can spend two, three, or four times that if you want to). And because they operate over unlicensed radio frequencies on a network created by personal devices, they're essentially free to use. Each message is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring privacy while it's relayed through the network. And Meshtastic's optional location-tracking capabilities give people a way to monitor their communities and keep tabs on their kids—or fellow analog astronauts—without using invasive, data-hungry apps.

Kirstoff says that Mars Society members will take weeks-long excursions in remote areas with little cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity, which creates additional risks.

“There is heat stroke. We are two hours from the nearest hospital. If you go too far from the campus, it can get dangerous,” Kirstoff says of the experience. “So anytime there's a risk, the risk is made worse if people don't know where you are.”

Most Meshtatic devices currently on the market need to pair with a phone over Bluetooth to function as a texting alternative. Some devices are just a radio, antenna, and battery, with the expectation that you'll make the housing yourself. The radio does all the device-to-device communication, while the iOS and Android apps or the web client let you read and compose messages that are received or sent over the network—no service plan needed.

The apps also allow you to see the approximate location of nearby nodes and a map of the Meshtastic network. But fancier stand-alone devices are already available, like a line of Meshtastic-enabled gadgets from maker-friendly tech firm LilyGo that, in addition to the T-Echo model used by Mars Society members, includes Blackberry-like handhelds with their own keyboards, a smartphone-like device with an e-paper screen, and even a Meshtastic-enabled smartwatch.

Meshtastic was created by technologist Kevin Hester in early 2020 as a way to communicate while doing “any hobby where you don't have reliable internet access,” and it remains a grassroots endeavor, with established local communities spanning from Argentina to China that are ripe with a DIY ethos. The software itself is open source, meaning anyone can theoretically contribute, and hundreds have. Still, as with many open source projects, a core group of volunteer developers help maintain the Meshtastic firmware, mobile apps, and more.

Jonathan Bennett, a self-described “Linux guy” who upgraded Meshtastic to stronger end-to-end encryption for direct messaging and keeps the software working on Linux, says he first got involved in the project after a listener of one his podcasts wanted a way to communicate with friends while attending a festival where the cell network could get overloaded.

“I put my open source enthusiast hat on and I went looking, and I came across Meshtastic,” he says. “And it immediately tickled my interest.”

Bennett says he ultimately connected with Garth Vander Houwen, a C# developer who wrote Meshtastic's iOS app, and Ben Meadors, another C# developer who took on maintaining the Android app, web client, firmware, and other parts of the Meshtastic ecosystem after Hester needed to step back due to health issues.

Like Bennett, Vander Houwen and Meadors got involved with Meshtastic while looking for solutions to real-life problems. Vander Houwen, an iPhone user, says he found Meshtastic while on the hunt for a way to communicate as he hiked on remote trails in the Seattle area, just to find that it only had an Android app. He decided to write the iOS app himself. “So the fact that there was not an iOS app for Meshtastic was kind of how I got started,” he says, “and it's been a lot of fun.”

Meadors says he came to Meshtastic after a dangerous tornado hit his home state of Arkansas, causing major damage. “My kind of initial use case was honestly a backup communication for storm-related outages,” Meadors says. After taking part in the cleanup effort around Little Rock, he realized the value of a decentralized, off-grid communication network like Meshtastic. “It's just really handy to have anywhere where you've got a limited connection to the grid.”

None of which is to say you should throw your cell phone in the sea and go all-in on Meshtastic. At least not yet. First, getting into the world of LoRa remains a little bit technical, so if the idea of “flashing” your device with new firmware makes you instinctively pick up your phone to scroll TikTok, it might not be the hobby for you. Even if you are tech savvy, the system has some notable limitations.

Using the decentralized mesh network requires having your Meshtastic device in range of at least one other radio; obstructions like buildings, trees, and hills or mountains can prevent the line-of-sight communication needed to join the mesh network. This means it may only be reliable when there's a variety of other Meshtastic nodes in the area.

Next is what Meadors calls the “narrowness” of the network's technical capabilities. “One of the most frequent things that we get is, ‘Can I replace the internet with this?' No, no you cannot,” he says. “You can send text messages.” Mercifully, that does include emoji.

This may be obvious, but you also need to have a network set up before disaster hits, Meadors says. So, set up anyone who you might need to communicate with during a cell and internet blackout before it actually happens. And, due to relatively frequent firmware updates, you can't just toss your device in a bug-out bag and forget about it. But “if it's something that you actually use, like if you pull it out and use it once a month, you'll be good to go,” Bennett says.

Then there's the issue of raw bandwidth. This limitation can cause issues when a lot of people are trying to use the network at the same time. At a ham radio convention in Dayton, Ohio, last year (yes, it's called Hamvention), the Meshtastic network crashed after someone ran a program that flooded the network with additional traffic, pushing the Meshtastic network to its limits.

“Because literally one person turned on this MQTT bridge, which then joined the rest of us into this mesh in a metal building in Dayton, it crashed the whole mesh immediately,” Vander Houwen says.

After this incident, Vander Houwen, Bennett, and Meadors went to work to prepare for the upcoming Defcon hacker convention in Las Vegas, ultimately releasing a special firmware for the much larger event that Vander Houwen estimates allows “somewhere between 2,000 and 2,500 nodes” to operate on the network simultaneously. A similar firmware released ahead of the 2025 Hamvention in May drew praise from the community.

Despite Meshtastic's limitations, its promise as a backup communication system—and the sheer fun you can have with it—continues to pull in new enthusiasts. The Android app alone has drawn thousands of reviews, and the Meshtastic subreddit has grown to nearly 50,000 members. Some municipalities are even hoping to launch Meshtastic networks to help protect their communities in the event of natural disasters.

For Bennett, Meadors, and Vander Houwen, they're excited to not just see the number of Meshtastic nodes increase, but to see the technology develop into something anyone can use without having to become an enthusiast or “analog astronaut” at all.

“I think the biggest thing for me too is that it's not just accessible from the aspect of the hardware being available to more people. I want to make the software more accessible,” Meadors says. “I want to make the experience such that I can hand this device to anybody and have them download the app and start messaging. We've come a long way. I think there's still some room to grow there.”

Updated at 10:25 am ET, June 4, 2025: Corrected a misspelling of Ben Meadors' surname.

Airtime, the video startup from Evernote's founder Phil Libin, has laid off dozens of employees, TechCrunch has learned, and Airtime confirmed.

According to the company, 25 people were let go from the 58-person team — a change Airtime described as “bigger than usual.”

While Airtime characterizes the departures as part of its typical seasonal approach to employment, sources inside the company said staff were surprised by the announcement. Many were under the impression the startup intended to raise funds this year and were previously told no cuts were planned, they said.

Formerly known as mmhmm, Airtime was launched in 2020 by Libin, whose Evernote, a note-taking startup, was valued at nearly a billion at its height before being sidelined by newer competitors like Notion. (The company later sold to Bending Spoons in 2022 for a decidedly smaller figure.)

First launched amid the COVID pandemic, when all office work had suddenly shifted to video, Airtime today offers two key tools for online meetings. Its “Airtime Creator” lets users present a deck while appearing on screen at the same time, while its “Airtime Camera” allows users to create custom looks to stand out in meetings.

The startup introduced a “seasons”-focused employment structure in late 2022, following a layoff of around 10%-15% of the staff, which had capped the company's headcount at 100 while it searched for product-market fit.

The idea was introduced so staff wouldn't face any surprise firings or layoffs. Instead, the company would decide roughly every six months who would be invited back for the next “season.” This plan allowed Airtime to give staff a longer heads-up if they weren't going to return, so they had time to seek other employment. And ideally, employees would work throughout a full season before choosing to quit.

Such a structure, as you can imagine, was controversial. But the deal had been honored on both ends since its launch. 

The recent layoffs have frustrated staff because, typically, their “season” would have ended on the last day of June, according to what their managers told them, sources told us. But impacted employees have been given an end date of Friday, June 6. That means their severance covers at least some of what would have normally been offered if they were employed through the period they were promised under the “seasons” arrangement.

Libin, however, says that people's departure dates vary. Some stay an extra two weeks to finish up, and others leave sooner. And everyone is receiving six weeks of severance from their last day, so the issue here could be employee confusion or miscommunications. 

The layoffs themselves were hashed out by leadership over two 8-hour sessions at Nobu in Palo Alto, sources claim. Staff were told on Tuesday, June 3, while their managers were told the night prior.

An unknown number of independent contractors were also let go, they said.

As to what necessitated the cuts, company insiders said Airtime's product never really took off and experienced quite a bit of churn. User acquisition ad spend also cost Airtime high tens of thousands of dollars per month, and employees report that Libin was often absent from day-to-day decisions as he focused his attention on his restaurant in Arkansas.

Airtime, meanwhile, said the larger cuts had to do with the company's changing focus. 

In an emailed statement attributed to Libin, Airtime said the following:

Since 2022, Airtime has operated on a ‘seasonal' structure: two five-and-a-half-month work seasons per year, with a shared two-week break in between. Near the end of each season, we decide who comes back based on plans for the following season. The company invites some people back, and they decide whether they want to return. There's a mutual commitment that people who return will not leave mid-season and that the company won't terminate anyone mid-season other than for serious misbehavior. We treat everyone who departs at the end of a season equally, whether or not they were invited back. Product releases, hiring, departures, promotions, and other events are also timed around the seasons to provide people with a predictable cadence. We're currently in our sixth seasonal transition, and we've made changes to the team every time. This change is bigger than usual because our focus changed more than usual. Of 58 employees, we've asked 33 to come back next season to work on our new products and partnerships.

To date, Airtime has raised nearly $135 million in venture funding across multiple early-stage rounds.

Some of those funds were used for M&A, as with the deal to acquire filter-maker Mexmix in 2020, then acquire Macro, a maker of filters and reactions for online meetings, in 2021. The latter deal was focused on bringing in founders with product chops, Ankith Harathi and John Keck. (The pair has since left Airtime, according to their LinkedIn profiles.) Airtime parent All Turtles also brought in Alexander Pashintsev, who previously worked on AI at Evernote, but Airtime itself has not yet made a significant AI push.

Sarah Perez can be reached at sarahp@techcrunch.com and @sarahperez.01 on Signal. TechCrunch also offers secure tip lines here.

Correction: Airtime raised ~$135M, not $235M. The typo was corrected after publication; additional information about severance was also added.

Elon Musk spent the last several months knee-deep in government, sidelining his companies to pursue a long-standing Republican quest to weed out alleged waste and fraud. 

Then, a few weeks ago, House Republicans passed a bill with provisions that would kneecap Tesla. 

Now Musk is fuming that the bill is “a disgusting abomination.”

Plenty has been written about Musk's motivations for cozying up to President Donald Trump; for spending 130 days as a special government employee; for spending time away from Tesla, the main source of his wealth. Whatever his reasons, Musk did come away with some wins: He managed to secure some free advertising for Tesla, and Starlink is slowly embedding itself into the federal government.

But his time roaming the halls of power and standing alongside the president hasn't exempted Tesla from Republicans' desire to sink clean energy and electric vehicles.

On Tuesday, Musk let loose. “I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore,” he wrote on X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.

“Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”

I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore.This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.

The Congressional Budget Office has yet to score the bill and its impact on the deficit, but this week the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit organization, estimated that the legislation would add $3 trillion in debt.

Musk might be publicly denouncing the reconciliation bill for its inability to rein in federal deficits — there's no reason to think he doesn't believe its a problem — but it's hard to imagine he doesn't feel personally slighted by the legislation. 

An Axios report backs up that take on the situation, saying that Musk was “frustrated at failing to win favorable treatment in the bill and the administration at large.”

“Elon was butthurt,” a source with knowledge of Musk's feelings told Axios.

It's not just Musk's feelings that could be bruised: His fortune could be dented if provisions hostile to Tesla survive the Senate.

Tesla's biggest hit would come from revisions to the EV tax credit. Today, consumers who buy an eligible EV can claim up to $7,500, a provision that runs through 2032. Republicans want to end it in 2026 and reinstate the per-manufacturer cap of 200,000 vehicles. The cap almost feels targeted at Tesla, since the automaker was among the first to exceed that figure.

But Republicans didn't stop there. They also took a hammer to clean energy, severely constraining the ability of rooftop solar installations to qualify for 30% tax credits. If passed, the changes would undercut Tesla's energy division, which recently has grown 67% year-over-year. The business line has already been threatened by Trump's tariffs, which “will have a relatively larger impact on our energy generation and storage business compared to our automotive business,” Tesla said in its quarterly report.

In a parting shot, the White House announced Saturday, the day after Musk's departure, that it was pulling Jared Isaacman's nomination to be NASA administrator, something Musk had championed.

Welcome to politics, Elon.

Lee Enterprises, the newspaper publishing giant that was hit by a ransomware attack in February, causing widespread disruption to dozens of U.S. media outlets, has confirmed the cyberattack resulted in the theft of employees' personal data.

The company confirmed in a letter filed with Maine's attorney general that the personal information of 39,779 people was stolen in the cyberattack, including Social Security numbers. The data breach mostly affects former and current employees at the company.

Lee is one of the largest newspaper publishers in the U.S., and provides publishing technology and web services to more than 70 publications. The ransomware attack paralyzed newspaper printing, disrupted operations at media outlets across the country for weeks, and affected payments to freelancers and contractors.

Qilin, a prolific ransomware gang known for destructive cyberattacks, took credit for the breach. 

A spokesperson for Lee did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.

American streets are incredibly dangerous for pedestrians. A San Carlos, California-based startup called Obvio thinks it can change that by installing cameras at stop signs — a solution the founders also say won't create a panopticon. 

That's a bold claim at a time when other companies like Flock have been criticized for how its license plate-reading cameras have become a crucial tool in an overreaching surveillance state. 

Obvio founders Ali Rehan and Dhruv Maheshwari believe they can build a big enough business without indulging those worst impulses. They've designed the product with surveillance and data-sharing limitations to ensure they can follow through with that claim.

They've found deep pockets willing to believe them, too. The company has just completed a $22 million Series A funding round led by Bain Capital Ventures. Obvio plans to use those funds to expand beyond the first five cities where it's currently operating in Maryland. 

Rehan and Maheshwari met while working at Motive, a company that makes dashboard cameras for the trucking industry. While there, Maheshwari told TechCrunch the pair realized “a lot of other normal passenger vehicles are awful drivers.” 

The founders said they were stunned the more they looked into road safety. Not only were streets and crosswalks getting more dangerous for pedestrians, but in their eyes, the U.S. was also falling behind on enforcement. 

“Most other countries are actually pretty good at this,” Maheshwari said. “They have speed camera technology. They have a good culture of driving safety. The U.S. is actually one of the worst across all the modern nations.”

Maheshwari and Rehan began studying up on road safety by reading books and attending conferences. They found that people in the industry gravitated toward three general solutions: education, engineering, and enforcement. 

In their eyes, those approaches were often too separated from each other. It's hard to quantify the impact of educational efforts. Local officials may try to fix a problematic intersection by, say, installing a roundabout, but that can take years of work and millions of dollars. And law enforcement can't camp out at every stop sign.

Rehan and Maheshwari saw promise in combining them. 

The result is a pylon (often brightly-colored) topped with a solar-powered camera that can be installed near almost any intersection. It's designed not to blend in — part of the education and awareness aspect — and it's also carefully engineered to be cheap and easy to install.

The on-device AI is trained to spot the worst types of stop sign or other infractions. (The company also claims on its website it can catch speeding, crosswalk violations, illegal turns, unsafe lane changes, and even distracted driving.) When one of these things happen, the system matches a car's license plate to the state's DMV database. 

All of that information — the accuracy of the violation, the license plate — is verified by either Obvio staff or contractors before it's sent to law enforcement, which then has to review the infractions before issuing a citation.

Obvio gives the tech to municipalities for free and makes money from the citations. Exactly how that citation revenue will get split between Obvio and the governments will vary from place to place, as Maheshwari said regulations about such agreements differ by state.

That clearly creates an incentive for increasing the number of citations. But Rehan and Maheshwari said they can build a business around stopping the worst offenses across a wide swath of American cities. They also said they want Obvio to remain present in — and responsive to — the communities that use their tech.

“Automated enforcement should be used in conjunction with community advocacy and community support, it shouldn't be this camera that you put up that does revenue grab[s] and gotchas,” Maheshwari said. The goal is to “start using these cameras in a way to warn and deter the most egregious drivers [so] you can actually create communitywide support and behavior change.”

Cities and their citizens “need to trust us,” Maheshwari said. 

There's also a technological explanation for why Obvio's cameras may not become an overpowered surveillance tool for law enforcement beyond their intended use.

Obvio's camera pylon records and processes its footage locally. It's only when a violation is spotted that the footage leaves the device. Otherwise, all other footage of vehicles and pedestrians passing through a given intersection stays on the device for about 12 hours before it gets deleted. (The footage is also technically owned by the municipalities, which have remote access.)

This doesn't eliminate the chance that law enforcement will use the footage to surveil citizens in other ways. But it does reduce that chance.

That focus is what drove Bain Capital Ventures partner Ajay Agarwal to invest in Obvio.

“Yes, in the short term, you can maximize profits, and erode those values, but I think over time, it will limit the ability of this company to be ubiquitous. It'll create enemies or create people who don't want this,” he told TechCrunch. “Great founders are willing to sacrifice entire lines of business, frankly, and lots of revenue, in pursuit of the ultimate mission.”

Journaling app Rosebud has raised $6 million in seed funding as it seeks to further flesh out its app as an AI mentor for self-reflection and personal growth. 

Rosebud uses AI to analyze your journal entries, identify patterns over time, and provide insights, questions, and guidance. The company says its goal is to help users better understand themselves, build new habits, and track goals, just like a human mentor would. 

Since its launch, Rosebud says, users have journaled 500 million words and spent more than 30 million minutes on its platform.

Rosebud was founded in 2023 by Chrys Bader, a Y Combinator alum and co-founder of Secret, and Sean Dadashi, a UC Berkeley Cognitive Science graduate. The pair met at a men's group, and came up with the idea for Rosebud based on their own experiences with therapy and coaching. 

“Everybody is different, and everyone has different languages, not just spoken languages, but different emotional language, different ways of communication,” Bader said in an interview with TechCrunch, explaining that AI allows for a level of personalized coaching and support that wasn't available so far.

“So one person might want validation and a soft approach, whereas somebody might want the really hard, like, ‘hey, challenge me, call me out on my BS' approach,” he continued. “Part of understanding somebody is using that understanding to best support each individual. That's what AI unlocks; that's never been possible before, to scale that kind of personalized advice or support where every individual could have this wildly different experience than the other, depending on what they shared.”

Rosebud says it isn't looking to replace therapists, and instead wants to open up access to quality mentorship.

The company plans to use the new funding to expand its team of four with engineering and product talent, and invest more into marketing. The startup also plans to invest more in its proprietary memory technology, and build out the app's features. 

In addition, Rosebud wants to explore ways to make its AI journal more accessible, possibly through partnerships with schools, businesses, and clinics. 

The seed round was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from 776, Initialized Capital, Fuel Capital, Avenir, Tim Ferriss, and other investors.

Rosebud states that all journal data is encrypted, and that journal entries are never shared with third parties or used to train AI models.

Looking forward, Bader and Dadashi envision Rosebud as a mentor, teacher, and partner that can develop strategic, long-term engagement plans with users. For instance, if someone is about to become a father, Rosebud could create personalized content around that milestone with journaling and other resources. 

“What if everybody had something that was looking out for what's best for them? Or something that's helping them become their best self? I think that's the exciting thing that AI enables,” Dadashi said. “I benefited so much from having mentorship throughout my life at various times, and I've suffered in times when I haven't had that mentorship. I think what we're seeing is a future where this can be available to everybody in a way that it just wasn't possible for it to be available before. You can have something that's actually thinking about you, actually trying to understand you, and is aligned with who you want to become.” 

Rosebud's basic journaling features are free to use, but the startup offers a $12.99 monthly subscription that unlocks premium features, such as long-term memory, and voice and call modes. 

The AI journal is accessible via the web, and on iOS and Android.

The last year has seen rapid progress in the ability of large language models to tackle math at high school level and beyond. Is AI closing in on human mathematicians?

MIT Technology Review's What's Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

The way DARPA tells it, math is stuck in the past. In April, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency kicked off a new initiative called expMath—short for Exponentiating Mathematics—that it hopes will speed up the rate of progress in a field of research that underpins a wide range of crucial real-world applications, from computer science to medicine to national security.

“Math is the source of huge impact, but it's done more or less as it's been done for centuries—by people standing at chalkboards,” DARPA program manager Patrick Shafto said in a video introducing the initiative. 

AlphaEvolve uses large language models to find new algorithms that outperform the best human-made solutions for data center management, chip design, and more.

The modern world is built on mathematics. Math lets us model complex systems such as the way air flows around an aircraft, the way financial markets fluctuate, and the way blood flows through the heart. And breakthroughs in advanced mathematics can unlock new technologies such as cryptography, which is essential for private messaging and online banking, and data compression, which lets us shoot images and video across the internet.

But advances in math can be years in the making. DARPA wants to speed things up. The goal for expMath is to encourage mathematicians and artificial-intelligence researchers to develop what DARPA calls an AI coauthor, a tool that might break large, complex math problems into smaller, simpler ones that are easier to grasp and—so the thinking goes—quicker to solve.

Mathematicians have used computers for decades, to speed up calculations or check whether certain mathematical statements are true. The new vision is that AI might help them crack problems that were previously uncrackable.  

But there's a huge difference between AI that can solve the kinds of problems set in high school—math that the latest generation of models has already mastered—and AI that could (in theory) solve the kinds of problems that professional mathematicians spend careers chipping away at.

On one side are tools that might be able to automate certain tasks that math grads are employed to do; on the other are tools that might be able to push human knowledge beyond its existing limits.

Here are three ways to think about that gulf.

Large language models are not known to be good at math. They make things up and can be persuaded that 2 + 2 = 5. But newer versions of this tech, especially so-called large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI's o3 and Anthropic's Claude 4 Thinking, are far more capable—and that's got mathematicians excited.

This year, a number of LRMs, which try to solve a problem step by step rather than spit out the first result that comes to them, have achieved high scores on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), a test given to the top 5% of US high school math students.

At the same time, a handful of new hybrid models that combine LLMs with some kind of fact-checking system have also made breakthroughs. Emily de Oliveira Santos, a mathematician at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, points to Google DeepMind's AlphaProof, a system that combines an LLM with DeepMind's game-playing model AlphaZero, as one key milestone. Last year AlphaProof became the first computer program to match the performance of a silver medallist at the International Math Olympiad, one of the most prestigious mathematics competitions in the world.

And in May, a Google DeepMind model called AlphaEvolve discovered better results than anything humans had yet come up with for more than 50 unsolved mathematics puzzles and several real-world computer science problems.

The uptick in progress is clear. “GPT-4 couldn't do math much beyond undergraduate level,” says de Oliveira Santos. “I remember testing it at the time of its release with a problem in topology, and it just couldn't write more than a few lines without getting completely lost.” But when she gave the same problem to OpenAI's o1, an LRM released in January, it nailed it.

Does this mean such models are all set to become the kind of coauthor DARPA hopes for? Not necessarily, she says: “Math Olympiad problems often involve being able to carry out clever tricks, whereas research problems are much more explorative and often have many, many more moving pieces.” Success at one type of problem-solving may not carry over to another.

Others agree. Martin Bridson, a mathematician at the University of Oxford, thinks the Math Olympiad result is a great achievement. “On the other hand, I don't find it mind-blowing,” he says. “It's not a change of paradigm in the sense that ‘Wow, I thought machines would never be able to do that.' I expected machines to be able to do that.”

That's because even though the problems in the Math Olympiad—and similar high school or undergraduate tests like AIME—are hard, there's a pattern to a lot of them. “We have training camps to train high school kids to do them,” says Bridson. “And if you can train a large number of people to do those problems, why shouldn't you be able to train a machine to do them?”

Sergei Gukov, a mathematician at the California Institute of Technology who coaches Math Olympiad teams, points out that the style of question does not change too much between competitions. New problems are set each year, but they can be solved with the same old tricks.

“Sure, the specific problems didn't appear before,” says Gukov. “But they're very close—just a step away from zillions of things you have already seen. You immediately realize, ‘Oh my gosh, there are so many similarities—I'm going to apply the same tactic.'” As hard as competition-level math is, kids and machines alike can be taught how to beat it.

With hopes and fears about the technology running wild, it's time to agree on what it can and can't do.

That's not true for most unsolved math problems. Bridson is president of the Clay Mathematics Institute, a nonprofit US-based research organization best known for setting up the Millenium Prize Problems in 2000—seven of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics, with a $1 million prize to be awarded to the first person to solve each of them. (One problem, the Poincaré conjecture, was solved in 2010; the others, which include P versus NP and the Riemann hypothesis, remain open). “We're very far away from AI being able to say anything serious about any of those problems,” says Bridson.

And yet it's hard to know exactly how far away, because many of the existing benchmarks used to evaluate progress are maxed out. The best new models already outperform most humans on tests like AIME.

To get a better idea of what existing systems can and cannot do, a startup called Epoch AI has created a new test called FrontierMath, released in December. Instead of co-opting math tests developed for humans, Epoch AI worked with more than 60 mathematicians around the world to come up with a set of math problems from scratch.

FrontierMath is designed to probe the limits of what today's AI can do. None of the problems have been seen before and the majority are being kept secret to avoid contaminating training data. Each problem demands hours of work from expert mathematicians to solve—if they can solve it at all: some of the problems require specialist knowledge to tackle.

FrontierMath is set to become an industry standard. It's not yet as popular as AIME, says de Oliveira Santos, who helped develop some of the problems: “But I expect this to not hold for much longer, since existing benchmarks are very close to being saturated.”

On AIME, the best large language models (Anthropic's Claude 4, OpenAI's o3 and o4-mini, Google DeepMind's Gemini 2.5 Pro, X-AI's Grok 3) now score around 90%. On FrontierMath, 04-mini scores 19% and Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 13%. That's still remarkable, but there's clear room for improvement.     

FrontierMath should give the best sense yet just how fast AI is progressing at math. But there are some problems that are still too hard for computers to take on.

Squint hard enough and in some ways math problems start to look the same: to solve them you need to take a sequence of steps from start to finish. The problem is finding those steps. 

“Pretty much every math problem can be formulated as path-finding,” says Gukov. What makes some problems far harder than others is the number of steps on that path. “The difference between the Riemann hypothesis and high school math is that with high school math the paths that we're looking for are short—10 steps, 20 steps, maybe 40 in the longest case.” The steps are also repeated between problems.

“But to solve the Riemann hypothesis, we don't have the steps, and what we're looking for is a path that is extremely long”—maybe a million lines of computer proof, says Gukov.

Finding very long sequences of steps can be thought of as a kind of complex game. It's what DeepMind's AlphaZero learned to do when it mastered Go and chess. A game of Go might only involve a few hundred moves. But to win, an AI must find a winning sequence of moves among a vast number of possible sequences. Imagine a number with 100 zeros at the end, says Gukov.

But that's still tiny compared with the number of possible sequences that could be involved in proving or disproving a very hard math problem: “A proof path with a thousand or a million moves involves a number with a thousand or a million zeros,” says Gukov. 

No AI system can sift through that many possibilities. To address this, Gukov and his colleagues developed a system that shortens the length of a path by combining multiple moves into single supermoves. It's like having boots that let you take giant strides: instead of taking 2,000 steps to walk a mile, you can now walk it in 20.

The challenge was figuring out which moves to replace with supermoves. In a series of experiments, the researchers came up with a system in which one reinforcement-learning model suggests new moves and a second model checks to see if those moves help.

They used this approach to make a breakthrough in a math problem called the Andrews-Curtis conjecture, a puzzle that has been unsolved for 60 years. It's a problem that every professional mathematician will know, says Gukov.

(An aside for math stans only: The AC conjecture states that a particular way of describing a type of set called a trivial group can be translated into a different but equivalent description with a certain sequence of steps. Most mathematicians think the AC conjecture is false, but nobody knows how to prove that. Gukov admits himself that it is an intellectual curiosity rather than a practical problem, but an important problem for mathematicians nonetheless.)

Gukov and his colleagues didn't solve the AC conjecture, but they found that a counterexample (suggesting that the conjecture is false) proposed 40 years ago was itself false. “It's been a major direction of attack for 40 years,” says Gukov. With the help of AI, they showed that this direction was in fact a dead end.   

“Ruling out possible counterexamples is a worthwhile thing,” says Bridson. “It can close off blind alleys, something you might spend a year of your life exploring.” 

True, Gukov checked off just one piece of one esoteric puzzle. But he thinks the approach will work in any scenario where you need to find a long sequence of unknown moves, and he now plans to try it out on other problems.

“Maybe it will lead to something that will help AI in general,” he says. “Because it's teaching reinforcement learning models to go beyond their training. To me it's basically about thinking outside of the box—miles away, megaparsecs away.”  

Thinking outside the box is exactly what mathematicians need to solve hard problems. Math is often thought to involve robotic, step-by-step procedures. But advanced math is an experimental pursuit, involving trial and error and flashes of insight.

Forget one-click creativity. These artists and musicians are finding new ways to make art using AI, by injecting friction, challenge, and serendipity into the process.

That's where tools like AlphaEvolve come in. Google DeepMind's latest model asks an LLM to generate code to solve a particular math problem. A second model then evaluates the proposed solutions, picks the best, and sends them back to the LLM to be improved. After hundreds of rounds of trial and error, AlphaEvolve was able to come up with solutions to a wide range of math problems that were better than anything people had yet come up with. But it can also work as a collaborative tool: at any step, humans can share their own insight with the LLM, prompting it with specific instructions.

This kind of exploration is key to advanced mathematics. “I'm often looking for interesting phenomena and pushing myself in a certain direction,” says Geordie Williamson, a mathematician at the University of Sydney in Australia. “Like: ‘Let me look down this little alley. Oh, I found something!'”

Williamson worked with Meta on an AI tool called PatternBoost, designed to support this kind of exploration. PatternBoost can take a mathematical idea or statement and generate similar ones. “It's like: ‘Here's a bunch of interesting things. I don't know what's going on, but can you produce more interesting things like that?'” he says.

Such brainstorming is essential work in math. It's how new ideas get conjured. Take the icosahedron, says Williamson: “It's a beautiful example of this, which I kind of keep coming back to in my own work.” The icosahedron is a 20-sided 3D object where all the faces are triangles (think of a 20-sided die). The icosahedron is the largest of a family of exactly five such objects: there's the tetrahedron (four sides), cube (six sides), octahedron (eight sides), and dodecahedron (12 sides).

Remarkably, the fact that there are exactly five of these objects was proved by mathematicians in ancient Greece. “At the time that this theorem was proved, the icosahedron didn't exist,” says Williamson. “You can't go to a quarry and find it—someone found it in their mind. And the icosahedron goes on to have a profound effect on mathematics. It's still influencing us today in very, very profound ways.”

For Williamson, the exciting potential of tools like PatternBoost is that they might help people discover future mathematical objects like the icosahedron that go on to shape the way math is done. But we're not there yet. “AI can contribute in a meaningful way to research-level problems,” he says. “But we're certainly not getting inundated with new theorems at this stage.”

Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that machines still lack what you might call intuition or creative thinking. Williamson sums it up like this: We now have AI that can beat humans when it knows the rules of the game. “But it's one thing for a computer to play Go at a superhuman level and another thing for the computer to invent the game of Go.”

“I think that applies to advanced mathematics,” he says. “Breakthroughs come from a new way of thinking about something, which is akin to finding completely new moves in a game. And I don't really think we understand where those really brilliant moves in deep mathematics come from.”

Perhaps AI tools like AlphaEvolve and PatternBoost are best thought of as advance scouts for human intuition. They can discover new directions and point out dead ends, saving mathematicians months or years of work. But the true breakthroughs will still come from the minds of people, as has been the case for thousands of years.

For now, at least. “There's plenty of tech companies that tell us that won't last long,” says Williamson. “But you know—we'll see.”  

Forget one-click creativity. These artists and musicians are finding new ways to make art using AI, by injecting friction, challenge, and serendipity into the process.

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

In a test run, a unit of Marines in the Pacific used generative AI not just to collect intelligence but to interpret it. Routine intel work is only the start.

Spending any time on social media? There's a high chance that you've seen this tumbler making the rounds. The Stanley Quencher H2.0 Tumbler has become something of a hydration status symbol. It's less of a vessel than an accessory you'll find in everything from desk setups to car cup holders and even gym selfies. It's not just the trendy colors or sleek look that make it a must-have, though. It's the fact that it's actually useful, keeps your drinks cool, and it's kind of fun to drink out of.

See at Amazon

Go to Amazon now and get the Stanley Quencher H2.0 Tumbler for just $21, down from its usual price of $35. That's a discount of 40%. This discount applies to the Blue Spruce color, and the 30 oz version of the cup.

This tumbler gives you a whopping 30 ounces of water to drink each time you refill. That's especially helpful if you're trying to increase your daily water intake without lugging around something that feels like a small keg. It has a pretty narrow base, which makes it car cup holder-friendly, and the sturdy handle gives you a solid grip. And if you want to accessorize, you've probably seen all of the different ways you can carry this bottle around with you. There are purses made for that specific purpose even,

You'll especially like using the lid. Stanley's FlowState lid rotates to offer three modes: a straw opening, a wide opening for sipping or chugging, and a full cover to keep things sealed. Paired with a reusable straw and durable stainless-steel build, it's perfect for cold drinks, smoothies, or even iced coffee. And thanks to vacuum insulation, whatever you pour in stays at just the right temp for hours.

That means it's cold for up to 11 hours, iced for up to 2 days, and still usable by the time you're ready for a refill. Personally, I like to keep mine on my bedside table, where it really does last and last, and by morning I still have ice floating around in my drink.

For just $21, which is nearly half off, this is a solid deal for a tumbler that gets as much use as your favorite coffee mug, but with a whole lot more style and capacity. If you've been thinking about upgrading your drinkware, this is one of the best ways to do it. And if your kids have been clamoring for one, now you can grant their wish.

In two days, Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 comes out, and the universe as we know it will never be the same again. Just about every analyst is expecting the successor to the hit handheld/console to break launch day sales records. The Switch 2 release won't merely be a tidal wave coming for the PS5 and Xbox Series S / X—it's gonna be a tsunami with Mario Kart World riding on top. Gizmodo had a chance to get even closer and more personal with the Switch 2 last week. You can check out our hardware impressions here, thoughts on Mario Kart World here, and first play with GameChat using the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera and voice chat here. Keep scrolling if you want to see how the Switch 2 physically compares to the original Switch and the Steam Deck.

If you're used to the portability of the Switch / Switch OLED, you may be surprised to unbox the Switch 2 and see that it's noticeably larger, which also shouldn't be shocking at all, considering the display has jumped up from 6.2 inches and 7 inches, respectively, to 7.9 inches. The Switch 2 is still not going to fit into 99.9% of pants (unless you're rocking deep-pocket JNCOs again), but at the very least it'll take up less space in a backpack or tote bag compared to larger handhelds. Whereas the Steam Deck has a thicker design (to accommodate an internal fan and larger, sculpted grips), the Switch 2 doesn't, and as a result, it retains its thin 13.9mm profile. To unlock better performance while in console mode plugged into a TV, you can drop the Switch 2 into its included dock, which does include a cooling fan.

Still, I like that the overall footprint is smaller than the Steam Deck's. There's no dispute that Valve's handheld is great (though aging poorly), but it's a Hummer no matter where you use it. Ever drop a Steam Deck on your chest while gaming in bed? I have—and my sternum hurt like hell.

As I already said, the Switch 2's screen is significantly larger than the 6.2-inch display on the original Switch. If you've got a Switch OLED or a Steam Deck LCD / Steam Deck OLED, the leap in display size is relatively minor. But for OG Switch owners like myself, the bigger screen is delightful. The panel is 1080p resolution, but it's an upgrade compared to the 720p on the Switch/OLED/Lite. I've played hundreds of hours of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Switch, and even in my limited few hours with Mario Kart World, I could tell that the Switch 2's display was more immersive. While blacks on the Switch 2 display are not as inky as devices with an OLED screen, colors are more vibrant and pop thanks to its support for HDR (and presumably increased brightness to qualify as HDR compatible). I regularly play on my Steam Deck OLED and feel the screen's dynamic range is lacking despite it being an OLED panel. To be fair, though, my Steam Deck OLED does have the matte screen that cuts down on reflections at the expense of vividness; colors pop more on the glossy model.

At the end of the day, the Switch 2's LCD screen is not a dealbreaker compared to an OLED. Sure, it would have been nice of Nintendo to go with an OLED, but the company's probably saving it for a mid-cycle refresh. Don't listen to the YouTubers who are waiting to fearmonger about how the Switch 2 LCD screen is inferior. I love OLED as much as the next nerd, but trust me when I say nobody is going to be fixated on black levels when they're trying to survive a chaotic 24-person round of elimination-style “Knockout Tour” in Mario Kart World.

Frankly, I'm relieved that the Switch 2 doesn't have a thick profile. I've tried many handheld PCs like the Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally X, and Lenovo Legion Go S—they're bulky handhelds that are a far cry from “portable.” Others may disagree with me, but I'm firmly of the belief that if you're going to make the dimensions of a device taller and wider, then at least keep it thin and light enough to not hurt while using it. Not everyone has Hulk-sized hands. In this regard, I'm appreciative of the Switch 2's thin profile. On the other hand, I can sympathize with gamers who feel Nintendo should have made the Switch 2 and shoved a bigger battery inside. Every device has tradeoffs…

The Switch 2's thinness also gives way to its weight: 535 grams (1.18 pounds). In comparison to Steam Decks, Nintendo's new handheld is lightweight. It's not as light as the original Switch or Switch OLED, but again, you need to remember that it's got a larger screen, larger Joy-Con 2 controllers, and a few extra components like a secondary USB-C port on the top for connecting additional accessories such as the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera.

This is where I have to remind everybody that hand feel really makes a big difference. You can look at the dimensions and weight of the Switch 2 and think you have a good idea of how it compares to other similar devices, but real life tells a different story. The density of components and the distribution of them to create a balanced feel in the hand is something you have to experience for yourself. As always, Nintendo has done a superb job making the tiniest of details on the Switch 2 so that they feel improved, familiar as the device is. I spent several stretches playing the Switch 2 in handheld mode for 30-45 minutes continuously and didn't feel it was ever too heavy or that I had to rest it on my lap or chest. Everybody is going to feel different, but generally, Nintendo has taken its decades of expertise designing hardware and applied it to the Switch 2.

As you probably already know, the Switch 2 has larger Joy-Con 2 controllers that attach magnetically to the device itself as opposed to the sliding mechanism on the original Switch. While it's impossible for me to confirm whether or not these new detachable controllers will suffer from joystick drift long-term from my brief hands-on time with them, I can tell you that their bigger size makes longer game sessions more comfortable. My fingers didn't feel as cramped trying to stretch across all of the buttons and joysticks. I especially liked the improved SL and SR buttons when using the Joy-Con 2 as individual controllers; the buttons are larger and clickier without the mushiness you get from the original Switch's Joy-Cons.

We've all been there: the feeling of despair when your phone battery symbol turns red and you're nowhere near an outlet. Running out of battery can be more than inconvenient and it can leave you without contact when you need your devices most. But what if you could provide yourself with the assurance that you'd never have to worry about that anymore?

The solution is simpler than you might have thought, and right now it's almost… free. Amazon has a breathtaking discount on a real XL portable power bank: the 56,800mAh Moihosso power bank (with 22.5W rapid charging) is now 85% off on Amazon, at just $34 down from $239. With a staggering $200+ markdown, this offer is better than anything you'll find on Black Friday or Prime Day.

See at Amazon

What truly sets this power bank apart is its staggering capacity, and it's a genuine rarity on the market for portable chargers. With 56,800mAh of juice, you've got enough power to keep your devices running day after day. That's an iPhone or Galaxy phone charged up to eleven times, or your tablet charged on a whole weekend adventure without ever seeking out a wall outlet. This is the kind of backup power that brings true peace of mind.

Speed is another big win here: Thanks to 22.5W fast charging, this power bank can bring your phone back to life in record time. If you're in a hurry before a meeting or need to top off your battery between flights, you'll appreciate how quickly and efficiently it delivers power. The advanced charging technology ensures your devices charge safely and at optimal speed, so you're never left waiting around.

Since it has three output ports (two USB-A and one USB-C), you can charge up to three devices at a time. In case you're charging your phone, earbuds, and tablet at the same time or with your friends, this power bank does the trick. Smart current distribution means that each device gets the correct amount of power so that you don't have to experience slow charging or overcharging the battery.

But probably the most impressive aspects of this deal is the current price: at just $34, you're getting an XL power bank for less than the cost of a dinner out. Considering how much you'd pay for cloud-based backup power solutions or even just replacing a phone battery, this is a bargain. It's simply a deal you can't refuse.

A YouTube modder and Redditor has successfully attached a CPU cooler to an Nvidia GTX 960 using a 3D-printed bracket, bringing temperatures compared to the stock cooler down by 10 degrees and breaking a 3DMark Fire Strike benchmark record in the process.

The daring tinkerer, whose modest YouTube channel trades under the name TrashBench, took to the platform to reveal how they used a CPU cooler, some zip ties, and eventually a 3D-printed bracket to create one of the most novel yet surprisingly effective GPU cooling solutions we've ever seen.

""Had a spare CPU cooler and figured I'd chuck it on my 960 for a laugh,"" they revealed on Reddit. The first solution? Remove the GTX 960's stock cooler and simply strap the CPU to the card using some zip ties. The video reveals a precariously poised Cooler Master heatsink bound by some luminous yellow cable ties, a hilariously rudimentary first attempt.

""It looked dumb, ran hot, and nearly rattled itself apart,"" TrashBench reveals. A second run of 3D Mark's Fire Strike test yielded temperature increases of more than 10 degrees, likely caused by poor contact with the GPU's heatsink.

Undeterred, TrashBench fired up the 3D printer and ""whipped up a proper bracket."" The third run with the 3D-printed mount finally showcased the awesome power of the CPU cooler when properly in contact with the GPU, delivering a 13-degree improvement over the GTX 960's stock cooler and a 20-degree improvement on the cable tie attempt.

What's more, the monstrous combination even broke the 3DMark Fire Strike record for GTX 960 and Intel Core i5-12600KF processors, with a new top overall score of 7642, beating out the previous record of 7458. Not only that, the CPU cooler solution runs quieter than the GTX 960's stock cooler, but TrashBench puts this down to the ""trash"" fan running at low speed.



While the hardware combination is something of an eyesore, the actual physics behind the performance makes perfect sense. GPU coolers, by nature, have a much lower profile than CPU air coolers, which are equipped with fins and can measure upwards of 15 centimeters in height. TrashBench confirmed the CPU cooler in play weighed 470 grams, compared to the 270-gram factory cooler taken from the GTX 960, a battle of physics with only one winner when it comes to shifting heat.

And TrashBench isn't done. ""I think I'll have to try it on a 4080 next,"" they quipped at the end of the video. Engaging further on Reddit, TrashBench also agreed that a GPU with a more sophisticated cooling system (the 960 is from 2015, after all) might not yield such a drastic improvement, promising to try a more potent cooler on a 2070 Super. In fact, TrashBench is even considering more thorough benchmarking to weigh stock GPU coolers, comparing them directly with similar-sized CPU coolers for fairer testing, a project that might even give our GPU Benchmarks Hierarchy a run for its money!

The green team desperately needs more staff to fuel its second R&D center on the island.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The media in Taiwan have highlighted the lucrative compensation packages purportedly being used to tempt engineers to fill key roles and fuel Nvidia's ambitious expansion plans. Senior engineers should aim to get more than NTD$5.5 million per annum, reports Taiwan's EBC News (via Ray Wang on X). Converted to USD, that's less than $185,000 annually, but potential employees will also be eyeing the traditional annual bonuses given to Taiwanese tech employees, and some enviable stock options.

Readers will probably be aware that Nvidia is tipped to open a second R&D center on the Silicon Island. Nvidia will need the most highly skilled personnel to make the most of this new facility, and that doesn't come cheap.



We have taken a closer look at the data shared via the wonders of machine translation (see above). The news in Taiwan certainly seems spicy, with the translation suggesting “Nvidia robs people,” but that is explained in more business-like terms elsewhere in the infographic: “Last year, Nvidia used high salaries to poach people from the industry.”

Nvidia's efforts to acquire more skilled engineers will have to continue apace, due to the R&D expansion plans. Nvidia postings on the company's jobsite, reviewed by Tom's Hardware, indicate the company has 97 jobs available in the country at the time of posting.

The headlining salary of NTD$5.5 million $185,000 per annum, is what EBC News says is being offered to poach or retain senior engineers. For an engineer with perhaps just two to three years' experience, the source hints that NTD$3 million (about $100,000) isn't hard to achieve. Last but not least, a postgrad (Master's level) engineer joining Nvidia fresh from their studies should be able to ask for a salary between NTD$1.5 to 2 million (roughly $50,000 to $83,000).

Remember, these salaries might seem low depending on where you live, but we should factor in some very generous annual bonuses traditionally given to Taiwanese tech employees, plus the potential of great stock options. The cost of living isn't bad in Taiwan, either. Numbeo data indicates that living in Taiwan is 24.9% cheaper than living in the U.S., excluding rent, or 37.9% cheaper when rent is factored in.

Taiwanese media has a relatively strong tech focus, and everyday news programs mix in lots of stories about companies such as TSMC, MediaTek, Acer, Asus, and others. Thus, alongside news of the latest soap star's sex scandal, you will see nuggets about the aforementioned companies, the semiconductor industry in general, (mostly tech) stocks and shares, and even the discussion of tech like CoWoS, HBM, and High-NA EUV. Oh, there's plenty of politics too, and always something about China's latest saber-rattling activities around the island.

That's a lot.

As TSMC is gearing up to start making chips on its N2 (2nm-class) process technology later this year, rumors have emerged regarding the pricing of N2 wafers, as well as the pricing of subsequent nodes. We already knew that TSMC reportedly plans to charge up to $30,000 per wafer processed using its N2 technology, but now Taiwan-based China Times reports that the company will charge up to $45,000 per wafer for 'more advanced nodes,' which allegedly points to the company's A16 (1.6nm-class) node.

""TSMC's wafer foundry price for 2nm chips has soared to $30,000 per wafer, with [more] advanced nodes rumored to reach up to $45,000,"" the report by China Times reads. This claimed price is 45% higher than the rumored cost of TSMC's N2 node, which is also rumored to have risen up to $30,000.



There are a few things you need to know about pricing at TSMC and other contract chipmakers. First up, pricing at foundries is heavily dependent on production volumes and the client.

Apple, being the largest customer of TSMC's most advanced process technologies, is believed to pay less than its industry peers for wafers. When it comes to other clients like AMD, Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm, their pricing depends on overall volumes, in addition to the proportion of that volume being based on a client's uptake of leading-edge nodes.

So, bear in mind that all reported quotes on TSMC's (or any foundry's) wafers are approximate at best. It certainly goes without saying that TSMC does not comment on pricing and volumes. So, the only points of comparison are other unofficial prices.

AMD recently confirmed that it had produced the first silicon for its next generation of EPYC server processors codenamed Venice, so did Fujitsu. The report says that MediaTek is scheduled to finalize its design work for its next-generation mobile system-on-chip (SoC) on TSMC's N2 node shortly. Qualcomm is also reportedly developing the third generation of its Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile platform on the same node.

Apple is expected to be among the first to adopt N2, though the company has not formally confirmed this. If this is the case, expect next-generation A20-series and M6-series processors to rely on the N2 node, though that's an educated guess on our part.

TSMC will ramp up production of N2-based chips later this year at two fabs more or less simultaneously, which is a rather unprecedented event (more on this later). The report claims that TSMC's internal targets for 2nm indicate a monthly production capacity of around 30,000 wafers by the end of this year.

While the alleged pricing of $30,000 per N2 wafer seems like a lot, the $45,000 for a 'more advanced' node seems a bit overwhelming. The report does not specifically mention A16 process technology, but since it is too early to discuss pricing of A14 and more advanced manufacturing nodes, it's very likely that the report points to the pricing of wafers processed using TSMC's 1.6nm-class technology.



You should take the $45,000 quote with a grain of salt. As we mentioned earlier, different customers pay different prices. But we can still speculate about why A16 wafers are rumored to be much more expensive than their N2 counterparts.

The reason might be simple: unlike N2 and N2P, A16 supports backside power delivery network (BSPDN) that is particularly useful for big near-reticle-sized processors aimed at AI and HPC applications, but is fairly expensive to produce.

The production of a BSPDN requires several additional steps in the manufacturing process, which significantly affect pricing.

First, chip fabrication proceeds as usual: transistors are built on the front side of a silicon wafer using traditional steps like deposition, lithography, etching, and doping to form the active devices. Once the transistors are built, the wafer is bonded face-down onto a blank carrier wafer using hybrid bonding techniques.

Then, the original wafer is carefully thinned out from the back side through grinding and chemical-mechanical polishing, reducing the silicon thickness to just a few micrometers, exposing the bottom of the active transistor layer.

Now that the backside is exposed, new metal interconnects dedicated solely to power delivery are deposited. TSMC uses the most efficient implementation of a BSPDN, but it's also the most difficult to produce.

The BSPDN connects thick copper lines to reduce resistance directly to transistors. After backside processing, the wafer proceeds through standard packaging steps.

The separation of power and signal wiring improves overall chip performance due to better power delivery, reducing voltage drops and freeing up space on the front side for faster signal routing.

However, the cost of backside power delivery will limit its usage to companies developing large and expensive processors, such as next-generation AI and HPC GPUs, which are expected to consume kilowatts of power and which greatly benefit from BSPDN.

The report claims that the development of a single 2nm chip is projected to cost approximately $725 million, which is a lot, and limits the usage of the technology to a handful of companies. However, there is a catch.

The eye-watering $725 million figure likely involves the development of a whole platform that relies on that particular technology and includes multiple chips.

For example, the list of Apple's products relying on TSMC's N3 process technologies includes nine products for now, including A17 Pro, A18, A18 Pro, M3, M3 Pro, M3 Max, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. Eventually, that list will likely expand with N3P-based A19, A19 Pro, M5, M5 Pro, and M5 Max.



Despite the rather extreme upfront cost, the number of new tape-outs in the second year of production is expected to be four times greater compared to what was achieved during a similar stage with N5. This factor highlights the importance of leading-edge nodes to multiple companies developing chips for AI, HPC, client computers, and smartphones.

To meet soaring demand for its N2 process technology and other nodes in the same process design kit (N2P, A16, N2X, etc.), TSMC is prepping its two N2-capable production facilities in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung. Eventually, the company will build additional N2-capable fabs in Taiwan and the USA.

Industry observers expect that this node could achieve record-setting capacity ramp-up speeds due to intense customer interest. TSMC itself is optimistic about AI accelerators driving future revenue, forecasting a five-year compound growth rate approaching the mid-40% range starting in 2024.

Intel's upcoming Nova Lake chips are expected to advance their modular design philosophy by bringing together future Xe3 and Xe4 IPs to handle different engines on the chip. Jaykihn, an avid Intel leaker, asserts that Nova Lake-S will allegedly use Celestial for its graphics engine. At the same time, Druid will handle media and display functions, likely on a separate SoC Tile.

The disaggregated chiplet design, introduced for consumers with Meteor Lake, provides Intel with the flexibility to manufacture less critical chip elements using mature and cheaper fabrication nodes. Meteor Lake splits the media and display capabilities from core graphics. The media and display units were placed on a separate System-on-Chip (SoC) chiplet, manufactured using TSMC's N6 process, while the graphics engine resided on a separate tile produced with TSMC's N5 technology.

A similar strategy has been observed in Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake, however, Nova Lake reportedly is poised to advance Intel's chiplet approach by using separate and specialized IPs for these blocks. Jaykihn claims that the integrated graphics (iGPU) on Nova Lake-S (S: Desktop) will be powered by Xe3 (Celestial), meanwhile, the graphics and media engine move to the more advanced Xe4 (Druid).

Xe3 graphics + Xe4 display & mediaJune 4, 2025

This means that while the integrated GPU will be impressive, the most notable improvements could be in hardware codec support, owing to the shift to a next-generation architecture. Meanwhile, Bionic_Squash reports that the graphics engine will utilize a slightly modified version of Xe3, for better or worse. Should it be an improvement over vanilla Xe3, which we'll see in Panther Lake, it might be comparable to the evolution from Meteor Lake's Xe-LPG to Arrow Lake's Xe-LPG+ (mobile-only), the latter of which introduced XMX engines.

Beyond Nova Lake, this is a positive indication for future graphics products from Intel. We could see the first Druid-powered engines by as early as 2026, while Celestial, which is already undergoing pre-validation, is slated to power Panther Lake CPUs next year. It is plausible to say Nova Lake might serve as a test vehicle for Druid, serving as a precursor to a full-fledged product in the future that employs Druid graphics as well.

Prenatal exposure to triptans, alone or with other migraine medications, was not associated with a significantly increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in children born to mothers with a history of migraine in a new study.

“These results are encouraging for people with migraine, who may be taking these drugs before they even know that they are pregnant, and this is helpful information for their physicians, who can make more informed decisions about treating people with debilitating migraine attacks,” study investigator Hedvig Nordeng, PhD, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway, said in a press release.

The study was led by Margherita Camanni, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy. It was published online on May 21 in Neurology.

The study relied on filled prescriptions instead of verified medication intake, potentially leading to exposure misclassification. The researchers could not assess the risk for specific NDDs in children after prenatal exposure to combined migraine treatments and individual triptans because of small sample sizes. Additionally, the study could not verify whether medication discontinuation at the last menstrual period was due to lower migraine severity. The possibility of live birth bias and confounding by other treatment indications could not be eliminated.

Camanni reported receiving a visiting scholarship from the Norwegian Research Council for this study. The other investigators reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

There is a natural decline in sociability as a result of aging influenced by brain changes, new research shows.

“Our study suggests that age-related changes in the functional wiring of the brain may impair certain abilities needed to maintain social relationships,” the study's lead study author Yuet Ruh Dan, Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School, told Medscape Medical News.

The findings were published online on May 28 in PLOS One.

Sociability, which is the capacity to communicate effectively, be socially assertive, and to manage emotions, is “critical” for maintaining and promoting health, especially as we age, said Dan.

Research has linked sociability to increased functional connectivity in and between intrinsic brain networks. Overall, the default mode network (DMN), ventral attention network, and limbic structures have been the most strongly correlated with sociability.

The aging process also involves changes in intrinsic brain networks. Studies have shown that aging results in lower within-network connectivity, as well as greater between-network connectivity.

For example, Dan noted that connectivity between the frontoparietal and DMNs decreases with age change that has been linked to poorer self-esteem and memory. Meanwhile, connectivity between the limbic and insular regions increases with age and has been shown to activate in situations involving social exclusion, she added.

“Intuitively, poorer self-esteem and an increased sensitivity to exclusion may be linked to a decreased ability to communicate with others and regulate our emotions,” she said.

This study is among the first — if not thefirst — to directly examine the relationship between age-related changes in functional connectivity and sociability, Dan added.

The study included 196 healthy participants aged 20-77 years (mean age, approximately 38 years), with 34.2% identifying as female, drawn from the Leipzig Study for Mind-Body-Emotion Interactions dataset. For the analysis, researchers grouped participants into 5-year age brackets (20-25, 25-30, etc.), Dan said.

In addition, the researchers obtained resting-state functional MRI data. Participants completed the sociability subscale of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire Short Form.

This six-question subscale measures social awareness, emotional management, communication effectiveness, and participation in social situations. The questionnaire is scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree), with higher scores indicating higher levels of sociability.

Researchers also collected data using the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), which measures neuroticism, extraversion, openness to new experiences, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. They found a strong positive correlation between sociability and extraversion (P < .001), highlighting a significant link between the two traits.

Researchers conducted network-based analyses to identify patterns of resting-state functional connectivity, grouping the data into an age-positive network (APN), which showed a positive correlation with age, and an age-negative network (ANN), which showed a negative correlation.

“Essentially, we found that with increased age, there is a group of functional brain networks that become more interconnected and a group that becomes less interconnected,” said Dan.

The subcortical-parietal connectivity and the within-limbic connectivity were the most negatively correlated in the ANN, while limbic-insular connectivity was the strongest positive correlation within the APN.

Within the positive connectivity network, ventral attention-somatomotor connectivity had the strongest correlation with age. Frontoparietal-DMN connectivity was the most negatively correlated with age.

Both ANN and APN may contribute to decreased sociability, but it's not yet clear which plays the more dominant role, Dan said.

However, she and her colleagues have some theories. They propose that reduced connectivity between the frontoparietal and DMN regions may be linked to impaired cognition and lower self-esteem, “thereby resulting in impaired social assertiveness, emotional regulation skills, and reduced sociability.”

Decreased connectivity of these regions could be linked to decreased sociability through impaired executive processing, they noted.

The study illustrates that as we age, “it may not be just a lack of social contact opportunities that prevents us from forming and maintaining relationships but also an inherent change in the brain's functional wiring,” Dan said.

A mediation analysis showed the effect of age on sociability was fully mediated via both APN and AAN.

“Generally, these statistical results meant that the networks that become more connected, for example APN, as well as less connected, for example, ANN, with age can explain decreased sociability seen across the lifespan,” said Dan.

Dan emphasized that sociability is just one factor related to loneliness — and one that is relatively easy to measure — whereas loneliness itself is a far more complex and deeply subjective experience.

“Intuitively, people with lower sociability scores may be more likely to be lonely, as they may find it harder to maintain relationships. In this sense, increased sociability may be a risk factor for increased loneliness with age.”

Dan said she hopes these preliminary findings will spur more longitudinal research into these relationships and help inform efforts to support healthy aging.

She noted the importance of physicians recognizing that declining sociability may be a natural part of aging. “Greater emphasis should be placed on community-based health promotion efforts,” she said.

The investigators did not analyze NEO-FFI personality trait variables, so “we can't draw any conclusions about whether they were related to changes in brain connectivity or sociability,” Dan said.

She also noted that the sample was heavily skewed toward younger participants, which may limit the reliability of the findings for older adults. Additionally, grouping subjects into 5-year age bins may have introduced “noise” into the statistical models.

Other limitations included an all-European study sample, and collection of sociability data exclusively via self-report, which may be less reliable than more objective measures like social network size.

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Dirk Scheele, PhD, professor of social neuroscience, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, German, said the paper addresses a “relevant” topic.

“The general question of how social interactions and the desire for social engagement change with age is undoubtedly important, particularly given strong evidence that the risk of social isolation and loneliness increases with advancing age,” he said.

However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain “surprisingly unclear,” he said. “For example, no study to date has directly compared the neural substrates of loneliness or social isolation between younger and older adults.”

Although the study “has the potential to inspire novel research questions,” its findings should be interpreted with “considerable caution” due to several limitations, he said.

“Most notably, it's an entirely exploratory study without preregistration, and its cross-sectional design prevents conclusions about causal relationships,” he added.

Scheele also noted the “sociability” construct was derived from a subscale of a questionnaire and “encompasses multiple facets, such as emotion regulation and social awareness, that may belinked to distinct neural mechanisms.”

The investigators and Scheele reported having no relevant financial disclosures.

In adults with psoriasis, adding methotrexate to adalimumab did not improve effectiveness or drug survival compared with adalimumab alone, according to a UK cohort study of patients with plaque psoriasis.

“This target trial emulation cohort study did not find evidence that adding methotrexate to adalimumab was beneficial for treating plaque psoriasis,” the study authors wrote. “Future studies evaluating the effect of concomitant methotrexate should either focus on high (> 10 mg/wk) dosing regimens with biologics other than adalimumab for treating plaque psoriasis or with adalimumab for other inflammatory skin diseases,” they added.

The study was led by Zenas Yiu, PhD, Centre for Dermatology Research, Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, England, and was published online on June 4 in JAMA Dermatology.

Most of the study participants deviated from treatment allocation and had missing outcome data, leading to inaccuracy of relative treatment effects measured by PASI and pharmacokinetic outcomes. Effect estimates in the intervention group lacked precision across all outcomes. Quality-of-life outcomes and baseline adjustment were omitted due to high levels of missing data. As an observational study, participants were unblinded to treatment allocation, introducing potential detection bias.

Dr Torres-Lockhart walks through the complex interplay between alcohol use and mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. Sometimes alcohol use is primary; other times, it's a coping mechanism for existing psychiatric conditions. Regardless of which came first, physicians must treat both simultaneously. She advocates for integrated care models that bridge addiction, mental health, and primary care — a shift that could transform outcomes for this highly comorbid population.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved single-agent darolutamide (Nubeqa, Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) for the treatment of metastatic castration–sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).

Darolutamide, an androgen receptor inhibitor, was previously approved in combination with docetaxel chemotherapy for mCSPC. The new single-agent approval is based on safety and survival outcomes in the randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 ARANOTE trial, which evaluated darolutamide without docetaxel, according to the FDA approval notice.

Median radiographic progression-free survival, a major efficacy outcome in the global double-blind trial, was significantly better in 446 patients with mCSPC who were randomized to the treatment group compared with 223 in the placebo group (not reached vs 25 months; Hazard Ratio [HR], 0.54).

No significant difference was observed between the groups in overall survival, an additional efficacy measure, at the final analysis (HR, 0.78).

Study participants were randomized 2:1 to receive 600 mg of darolutamide twice daily plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or placebo plus ADT.

All patients received a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog concurrently or had prior bilateral orchiectomy.

Adverse reactions were consistent with those seen previously with single-agent darolutamide. Current prescribing information, which can be found at Drugs@FDA, includes warnings and precautions for ischemic heart disease, seizure, and embryo-fetal toxicity.

The recommended dose of darolutamide is 600 mg given orally as two 300 mg tablets twice daily with food until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Artificial sweeteners have been in use for more than 130 years. They contain virtually no calories, do not promote tooth decay, and offer a sweet taste without elevating blood glucose levels. However, only recently — thanks to advancements in imaging techniques such as functional MRI — have researchers begun to understand how these sugar alternatives affect the brain.

A recent study involving researchers from the University of Tübingen, Germany, suggests that sucralose — a sweetener around 600 times sweeter than sugar — may have unintended neurological effects. The study found that sucralose can disrupt brain signaling and increase appetite.

Stephanie Kullmann, PhD, from the Institute for Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases of the Helmholtz Center Munich at University of Tübingen, was part of the research team. In an interview with Medscape's German edition, she shared current insights into the interactions between artificial sweeteners and sugar and offers guidance for healthcare professionals on how to advise patients who consume sweeteners.

Your  recent study shows that while sweeteners like sucralose are calorie-free, they stimulate appetite and affect brain regions involved in decision-making. Were you surprised by these findings?

Somewhat. Early studies had already suggested that the sweet taste alone can activate the brain. The brain contains sensitive sensors that detect glucose levels in the blood. In addition to cells that respond to whether we're eating carbohydrates or fats, there are neurons that specifically react to sweetness —whether something tastes sweet or not. The surprising part was the difference in responses between the groups we studied.

What did you discover?

People with obesity responded more strongly to sweet taste than participants of normal weight, regardless of whether the drink actually contained calories (from sugar) or was calorie-free (from sucralose). That was unexpected.

It is suspected that a type of mismatch or dissonance occurs. We've learned to expect that a sweet taste in the mouth signals real sugar and, therefore, calories. But sweeteners don't provide those calories. That mismatch likely triggers an expectation that something else is coming, which in turn stimulates appetite.

Sales of calorie-free artificial sweeteners have increased significantly in recent years. In Germany, every second person consumes products with artificial sweeteners daily. Why do you think sweeteners remain so popular?

The marketing message — “low calorie, but still sweet” — is very effective. For people trying to live healthily or lose weight, the promise of still enjoying sweetness while cutting calories is very appealing. Also, with the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes, many people need to limit sugar intake, and sweeteners seem like a viable alternative.

From my perspective, the problem is that we are exposed to sweet tastes very early in life, through sweet drinks and foods in childhood. This shapes our taste preferences. So, products with artificial sweeteners offer both: sweetness and fewer calories.

Unlike sugar, sweeteners contain no calories and don't cause tooth decay. What should doctors recommend to their patients?

We need to differentiate between people with type 2 diabetes and those without. For patients with type 2 diabetes who enjoy sweet foods, sweeteners can be a useful alternative. Not everyone has the same inclination toward sweet tastes. But if a patient doesn't want to give up soft drinks, for example, it's better to recommend a diet version with sweeteners than a full-sugar cola.

However, the focus should be on prevention. People with a healthy metabolism should drink water or beverages that are not sweet, regardless of whether they contain calories. This avoids developing a long-term habit of expecting everything to taste sweet. It's also important to educate patients that calorie-reduced products aren't automatically healthier.

My recommendation is: better to consume real sugar in moderation than to rely heavily on low-calorie, highly sweetened products with artificial sweeteners.

Are there differences between sweeteners? Is sucralose more concerning, while others like stevia are not?

We know the brain often responds similarly to different sweeteners. It seems the effect is less about the specific sweetener and more about the sweet taste itself, which activates sweet taste receptors throughout the body.

There is some early evidence that more natural sweeteners, like Stevia, may behave differently in the body. But whether Stevia leads to more positive effects isn't yet clear. We still need much more research before we can make firm recommendations.

Many people who use sweeteners still consume sugar — for example, when dining out. How do sweeteners and sugar interact?

It's important to remember that an interaction happens even between a sweetened drink and a meal. For instance, people who think “I'm drinking the healthier cola” may then be more likely to treat themselves to dessert. That could actually lead to higher overall sugar and calorie intake than intended.

Then there's the question: What happens when you combine a sweetened drink with a sugar-containing meal? This is a critical area that still needs research. Another open question is: What happens when multiple sweeteners are consumed together? We don't yet have answers to that either.

Are there other risks associated with sweeteners? A study in  Nature Medicine published in March 2023 linked erythritol consumption to increased risk of heart attack or stroke.

That study looked at a high-risk cohort over 3 years to examine whether erythritol was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events and found a connection. The researchers also evaluated, in a small group (n = 8), whether higher erythritol levels increased thrombosis risk — and even in that small sample, they found signs pointing in that direction.

However, we need further studies to confirm these findings for several reasons. First, that small group included only eight individuals. And importantly, the results may be confounded by other factors. People who consume large amounts of artificial sweeteners often have higher BMI, poorer metabolic health, and generally less healthy lifestyles.

To properly filter out these confounding variables and determine whether sweeteners are a true causal factor, we need long-term studies that track participants over time.

Is it too early to issue warnings about sweeteners?

At this stage, we don't know whether sweeteners directly cause health risks. I'm not aware of any evidence that proves a causal relationship. However, there are early concerns, and based on that, it would be reasonable to advise against excessive consumption.

So, when it comes to sweeteners, the same principle applies as with sugar: Moderation is key. And it's important to clarify that “low-calorie” products with artificial sweeteners should not be equated with healthy or health-promoting options.

DISCLOSURES |  June 04, 2025  

Though more common in pediatric populations, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) affects both children and adults, and it has several genetic subtypes that significantly affect prognosis and treatment decisions. Despite advances in treatment protocols, resistance mechanisms remain a significant challenge. However, some genetic subtypes are associated with more favorable prognosis, and the nuances of this disease are evident in the cascading treatment algorithm recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for pediatric and adult cases.

What do you know about B-ALL? Check your knowledge with this quick quiz.

The treatment of B-ALL involves a complex and intensive series of steps. In the induction phase, glucocorticoids are typically used to reduce tumor burden by clearing leukemic cells from the bone marrow. However, point mutations in the NR3C1 gene generally cause resistance to glucocorticoid therapy, which can significantly affect prognosis. Mutations in the CREBBP gene also cause resistance to glucocorticoids

DHFR, FPGS, and TYMS genes have been shown to generally cause resistance to methotrexate, not glucocorticoids. 

Learn more about corticosteroids in B-ALL.

In risk stratification for B-ALL, the NCCN notes that having a white blood cell count of > 30 x 109/L is considered a high-risk feature. This is consistent with European guidelines. The NCCN also states that age over 35 years is another high-risk feature for B-ALL. ETP phenotype is a high-risk feature for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia rather than the B-ALL subtype. Hyperdiploidy (a molecular subtype of B-ALL with 51-65 chromosomes) is considered standard risk by the NCCN; data have shown better prognosis for pediatric patients with this subtype.

Learn more about risk stratification for B-ALL.

TKIs are an important component of induction, consolidation, and maintenance treatment for Ph+ B-ALL. They are recommended by the NCCN for use in conjunction with other drugs, such as corticosteroids, blinatumomab, and inotuzumab ozogamicin (depending on treatment phase and disease severity) and as a treatment post-HCT. They recommend continuing TKI therapy for at least 2 years after HCT, although they note that the “optimal duration” is unknown for this population.

A recent review, however, notes that despite their success in patients with Ph+ B-ALL, approximately 25% of cases will develop resistance to TKIs. Given this possibility, the NCCN notes that clinicians should consider prior TKI intolerance, dose used, BCR::ABL1 mutations, and disease-related features when choosing a specific TKI; they specifically recommend bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib as options for TKI therapy.

Learn more about Ph+ B-ALL treatments.

The DUX4-rearranged subtype of B-ALL is considered to have a favorable prognosis in adolescents and young adults, compared with MEF2D-rearranged, CDX2/UBTF, and IDH1/2; these subtypes generally have inferior prognosis in the same populations (although MEF2D-rearranged has intermediate prognosis in adults). Specifically, DUX4-rearranged B-ALL has been associated with 93% event-free survival and overall survival in pediatric patients, and adolescent and young-adult patients also see longer disease-free survival after complete remission is achieved.

Learn more about B-ALL genomics.

Several genetic subtypes of B-ALL are associated with varying prognoses, and the outcomes differences seen between pediatric and adult patients can be partly explained by the different subtypes expressed by these populations. Further, new therapies have enabled high survival rates among pediatric patients with B-ALL, with long-term survival of up to 90% in this population. Prognosis for B-ALL in adolescents and adults is comparatively poor. For example, a population-based study reported the following declining survival rates with age: 74% for patients 15-19 years old, 59% for patients 20-39 years old, and 43% for those 40-59 years old. However, the researchers explained that these percentages still demonstrate improvements, as survival rates were overall lower in the 1980s and 1990s.

Historically, the presence of HIV infection in a patient with end-stage organ failure has been considered an absolute contraindication for organ transplantation. However, advances in antiretroviral therapy have significantly improved life expectancy for people living with HIV to the extent that the condition is now generally managed as a chronic disease. At the same time, a growing number of these individuals are experiencing or dying from end-stage organ failure, prompting renewed debate about this long-standing contraindication.

In addition, many national transplant policies require that organs from HIV-positive donors be discarded due to safety concerns. Even if the intended recipient is also HIV-positive, there is a risk of superinfection — acquiring a different strain of HIV from the donor, which may be resistant to certain antiretrovirals. There is also the potential for transmission of common coinfections.

These issues were addressed during a roundtable session at the 28th Congress of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC), held in Málaga, Spain, from May 22-25. The session, titled Advances in Solid Organ Transplantation in People Living With HIV: Use of HIV-Positive Donors, was moderated by Federico García, PhD, president of SEIMC, and Beatriz Domínguez, MD, PhD, managing director of Spain's National Transplant Organization.

Expert speakers included Josep Maria Miró Meda, MD, PhD, Infectious Diseases Service, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Christine Durand, MD, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore; and Paolo Grossi, MD, PhD, University of Insubria and ASST-Sette Laghi, Varese, Italy.

The objectives of the session were to:

According to Domínguez, while Spain is widely recognized as a global leader in organ donation and transplantation, the country has fallen behind in its approach to transplant access for people living with HIV.

International examples presented during the session, particularly from South Africa and the United States (under the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act), demonstrate that kidney and liver transplants from HIV-positive donors to HIV-positive recipients can have favorable short- and medium-term outcomes. These data, presented by Durand, support the reconsideration of long-standing transplant restrictions.

Miró Meda presented long-term outcomes from the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, where, between 2003 and 2024, 81 patients living with HIV received organ transplants from HIV-negative donors. Of these, 85% survived at least 10 years posttransplant.

These findings support a growing consensus that it is time to reconsider policies restricting the use of organs from HIV-positive donors and to recognize individuals living with HIV as eligible both to receive and donate organs. In late 2024, Spain began the legal process to repeal its longstanding ban on such transplants — a change expected to be finalized in the coming months.

Looking ahead, experts identified a new frontier in transplantation: The use of organs from HIV-positive donors for HIV-negative recipients. While still controversial, this practice has already been implemented in South Africa under exceptional clinical circumstances — specifically, cases where the lack of a transplant would result in death. In these instances, the immediate benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks, given that HIV is now a manageable chronic condition. Importantly, these transplants are performed only with the fully informed consent of the recipient.

This evolving field raises important clinical and ethical questions:

Although these approaches are far from standard clinical practice, experts agree that the topic deserves careful consideration and open discussion.

Emerging evidence and clinical experience suggest continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) may offer meaningful insights for patients with early type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, supporting behavior change and more personalized risk assessment.

“I am a strong advocate for the strategic use of CGMs in prediabetes,” said Mihail Zilbermint, MD, an associate professor of clinical medicine in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. “They have a great potential to transform how we engage patients who are at risk; they provide real-time feedback, making invisible things visible.”

Kevin Miller, DO, board-certified family physician and member of the American Diabetes Association's Primary Care Committee, said CGMs are here to stay. “I don't think there is any going back; we're going to be using them.”

Yet, there are barriers to accessing CGMs. There is also a lack of long-term data and consensus among experts on their broader use.

Available by prescription and over the counter, CGMs measure interstitial glucose levels via a small sensor placed under the skin. They enable trend analysis, time-in-range tracking, and identification of fluctuations in blood glucose levels.These features help patients link diet, sleep, stress levels, and activity with glycemic variability, ultimately unveiling patterns — perhaps their most critical role, said Anne Peters, MD, director of the University of Southern California's Clinical Diabetes Programs.

“I think CGMs are great because they make people aware of the composition of their food,” she said. If a patient starts to notice that eating cereal for breakfast increases their blood sugar level to 200 mg/dL, they may stop eating cereal for breakfast — and be healthier for it.Data suggest as much. “Some emerging studies suggest that intermediate CGM use can improve food choices, physical activity, and overall glycemic variability, even in people without diabetes,” Zilbermint said.

One study published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism found that CGMs paired with education led to weight loss and improved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in people with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Other research has found that CGM use with personalized nutrition therapy doubled weight loss and fat reduction in people with prediabetes.

Early studies and expert opinion suggest that CGMs may support behavior change and improve metabolic markers in people with prediabetes or early type 2 diabetes, yet data from long-term randomized controlled trials to support routine CGM use in these populations are lacking.

The American Diabetes Association and the Endocrine Society acknowledge the potential of CGMs in broader populations. Still, current guidelines do not recommend their routine use in those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin or other glucose-lowering agents.

Miller, currently involved in research on using CGMs in those with prediabetes and without diabetes with Abbott , said more research is necessary.

“We invented insulin 100 years ago; we've had fuel for the car, but we've had no speedometer, no way of gauging. I tease people that if a police officer pulled you over, you'd have no idea why. CGMs provide some of that data.”

CGMs, though, have cost and coverage barriers. Most insurance companies will not cover them unless a patient uses insulin, Peters said, and their cost over the counter can be prohibitive, which can be “very frustrating” in primary care settings.

“In an ideal world, we'd place continuous glucose monitors on individuals with a family history of diabetes or evidence of glucose intolerance,” Peters said.

But some of the very populations at highest risk for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes — Native American, Latino/Hispanic, Black, Asian American, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander — often come from underserved communities with limited access, she said. When she provided CGMs to patients in her East Los Angeles clinic, outcomes improved.

“Just seeing their glucose patterns made a difference. Regardless of education or health literacy, when patients can recognize a spike and realize, for example, that two tortillas are better than four, it changes behavior.”

Clinics like Peters' receive sample CGMs and use them intermittently with patients to support behavior change. Even short-term use — wearing a sensor for 2 weeks, then again 6 months later, for example — can help patients track changes even if they're not used regularly, Peters said.

Of course, another area where physicians struggle regarding CGMs is that there's no “standard” for what is normal, Peters said. A recent study Zilbermint was a part of evaluated how 18 expert clinicians interpreted CGM data in people without diabetes. More than half of the experts recommended follow-up for people who spent more than 2% of their time above the target range on a CGM, even when their A1c was below 5.7% and their fasting glucose level was < 100 mg/dL.

Yet, there was no consensus for recommending follow-up. Even experienced clinicians struggle to interpret CGM data in people without diagnosed diabetes, Zilbermint said.

“I think diabetes technology, including CGM, is one of the single best advancements for people with diabetes, but not every endocrinologist believes this,” he said. “Some of my colleagues have a more cautious approach, particularly in people without diabetes.”

One area of hesitation is around an overreliance on data. “We don't want to measure to the point where it can backfire and add distress,” Miller said.

CGMs can be powerful tools for select patients, particularly those with type 2 diabetes on medications. They can also be helpful for those with prediabetes or early diabetes, providing awareness that can prompt lifestyle changes.

Guided data interpretation is essential. Miller said he's seen TikTok influencers claim they'll never eat strawberries again after seeing a glucose increase.

It's also critical to consider CGM use within the broader context of a patient's lifestyle and capacity, ensuring usage supports health goals without creating additional burdens.

Follow-up appointments initiated by the provider are key to meaningful progress, too. “I don't want to be the inertia in someone's progress,” Miller said.

While he emphasizes the need for greater systemic physician education around CGM use, he also encourages physicians less familiar with CGMs to empower interested patients to explore over-the-counter options and check back in with data for shared decision-making.

Deregulate raw milk. Take fluoride out of water. Challenge vaccine safety. Create a registry of autistic people. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, promotes many ideas that much of the scientific community finds concerning. 

Unlike other positions held by Kennedy — most notably, unsubstantiated concerns about vaccine safety, fluoride, or the plan to deregulate raw milk — his focus on food safety and nutrition enjoys the support of many physicians and experts. Among the preferred targets of his proposed interventions are food dyes, additives, and ultra-processed foods, which he blames for the dramatic rise in chronic childhood conditions.

Whether health experts agree with the way he's getting there, however, is a different story. 

“[Kennedy] has the right diagnosis but the wrong prescription,” said Robert Lustig, a professor emeritus of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).

Some credit Kennedy for shining a brighter spotlight on some food and nutrition issues that have long been recognized by experts in the field. Jerold Mande, an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, and a former federal policy official, said interest in nutrition issues has gone from nearly “nonexistent” to a very high level since Kennedy took over at HHS. At this point in Kennedy's tenure, he sees an important focus on the priorities he shares.

“It's extraordinary that MAHA [Make America Healthy Again] is here, that Kennedy is on these food, nutrition, chronic disease issues and has made it a political priority because it hasn't been,” Mande said, referring to Kennedy's MAHA plan.

Longtime nutrition advocates see this as an encouraging step toward valuing the role of food in health, an idea that is not always embraced by physicians. “There's really good evidence that the medical training that we're giving to doctors includes very little on diet,” said Emily Broad Leib, director of the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation and the Food Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

Anna Herby, a nutrition education specialist at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization based in Washington, DC, agreed that diet is overlooked in medical training and noted that “it sometimes gets ignored [in favor of] medications and surgeries and procedures.”

Yet some question the focus of Kennedy's priorities on nutrition. While many health experts agree on the need to combat chronic disease, focusing on food additives and dyes “are not the things we should spend our time and energy on,” said Eric Shulze, an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and a former senior policy official at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture. 

UCSF's Lustig thinks Kennedy's program is unlikely to have much impact because it will not improve the nutritional quality of available food, something Lustig sees as the priority to improve the American diet. “[Kennedy] knows that the nutritional quality of the food is the problem,” he said. “He knows it, but he's not doing anything about it.”

Experts agree that ultra-processed foods are a major health concern for Americans but stress that any type of federal intervention must be based on sound science. While many processed foods, such as those containing meats and animal fats, are harmful, it is not a good idea to demonize all of them, said Neal Barnard, a cardiologist and adjunct professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine in Washington, DC. “What people are often missing…is that some processed foods are associated with health benefits,” he said. For example, an unprocessed breakfast of steak and egg is less healthy than a breakfast of processed cornflakes and soy milk.

Others say that blanket bans on ultra-processed foods may be counterproductive. “We have to feed 10 billion people by the year 2050, and we don't have enough land and ocean to do it,” said Lustig, who consults for an international food company working to produce nutritionally healthy processed foods. “Ultra-processed food is a fact of life, and it's not like we can just wish it away as much as I would like to.”

Many welcome what seems to be an overall philosophical shift toward a more cautious approach when it comes to regulating and allowing substances and products, more similar to what happens in peer countries, for instance, in the European Union.

One example is Kennedy's intention to reform the Generally Recognized as Safe process, which allows food companies to introduce ingredients without undergoing a formal FDA review if they are considered safe by experts or have been used for some time and enjoy broad support.

A more conservative approach, which is what Kennedy has been proposing so far, adopts the opposite perspective: Substances have to be proven safe before they can be added to foods or drugs. This finds broad support among many experts. Diana Zuckerman, the president of the National Center for Health Research, Washington, DC, and a former congressional investigator of the HHS, welcomes this shift. “There is more of that precautionary principle, which has been mostly rejected in this country,” she said. 

Shulze, however, defends the FDA's existing philosophy as the best suited to a country that wants to pursue innovation. “Risk-based systems work effectively,” he said, while “precautionary principle-based systems are extremely restrictive and promote tradition over any innovation.”

Whether Kennedy can transform his plans into effective policy remains to be seen. Mande said that a Republican administration seems less likely to introduce new regulations or funding for new programs that have been levers for implementing health policies.

“It's a big mismatch of theories of governance: All of these things require more regulation, and you're in an administration that across the board is saying we want less regulation,” said Leib. When it came to chemical food dyes, for instance, the food industry agreed to phase out several by 2026, but no regulation was introduced to force them. This leaves open the possibility of not complying, and some companies have already announced their intention to continue using dyes.

“I do think that asking industry to self-regulate or self-police is not going to get the job done,” said Dana Ellis Hunnes, a senior dietitian supervisor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. “I think governmental regulation has a place, and especially when it comes to trying to make foods healthier for all.”

Still, most are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Even skeptics recognize that something is moving, and the message that food is inextricably tied to chronic disease and health is becoming mainstream. “The fact that you're calling me about this and we are talking about food is already a change, isn't it?” said Lustig.

 June 04, 2025  

Findings on intestinal ultrasound (IUS) are useful for predicting remission in recent-onset Crohn's disease (CD), a prospective, population-based cohort of newly diagnosed patients in Denmark reported.

Adding to the growing body of evidence on the utility of this noninvasive imaging tool in monitoring disease activity in the newly diagnosed, the multicenter study published in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology characterized ultrasonographic features at diagnosis and evaluated IUS's prognostic value. Existing literature has focused on patients with long-standing disease.

Investigators led by first author Gorm R. Madsen, MD, PhD, of the Copenhagen Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Children, Adolescents and Adults at Copenhagen University Hospital, observed continued improvement in most IUS parameters throughout the first year. “Our findings thereby emphasize the role of IUS in improving patient management, and its use in patient risk stratification already at diagnosis,” the investigators wrote.

Some 38% of patients reached ultrasonic transmural remission within 3 months of diagnosis, an achievement associated with higher rates of sustained steroid-free clinical remission and reduced need for treatment escalation.

“Ultrasonic transmural remission is achievable early in Crohn's disease and is associated with favorable outcomes, underscoring the value of intestinal ultrasound in early disease management,” the researchers wrote.

While IUS is increasingly recognized for monitoring CD, little was known about its prognostic value early in the disease course. “We aimed to determine whether sonographic inflammation at diagnosis — and particularly the achievement pftransmural remission after 3 months — could predict future outcomes,” Madsen told Medscape Medical News. “This is important, as early identification of patients at risk of surgery or treatment escalation may help guide therapy decisions more effectively.”

From May 2021 to April 2023, 201 patients (mean age, 35 years; 54.2% men) with new adult-onset CD were followed by IUS and monitored with symptomatic, biochemical, and endoscopic evaluations.

After 3 months, transmural remission was achieved more often by patients with colonic disease, and no associations were found between sonographic inflammation at diagnosis and diagnostic delay.

“We were positively surprised. Nearly 40% of newly diagnosed Crohn's patients achieved transmural remission within 3 months — a higher proportion than seen in earlier studies, which mostly focused on long-standing or trial-selected populations,” Madsen said. “It was also striking how strongly early IUS findings predicted the need for surgery, outperforming endoscopy and biomarkers.”

In other findings, transmural remission at 3 months was significantly associated with steroid-free clinical remission at both 3 months and all subsequent follow-ups within the first year. It was also linked to a lower risk for treatment escalation during the follow-up through to 12 months: 26% vs 53% (P =.003). At 12 months, 41% had achieved transmural remission.

Higher baseline body mass index significantly reduced the likelihood of 12-month transmural remission. For overweight, the odds ratio (OR) was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.12-0.94), while for obesity, the OR was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.04-0.73).

The International Bowel Ultrasound Segmental Activity Score in the terminal ileum at diagnosis emerged as the best predictor of ileocecal resection during the first year, with an optimal threshold of 63 (area under the curve, 0.92; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 73%).

The use of IUS has expanded considerably in the past 3 years, and in 2024, the American Gastroenterological Association updated its clinical practice guidance on the role of this modality in inflammatory bowel disease.

IUS is noninvasive, radiation-free, inexpensive, and doable at the bedside with immediate results, Madsen said. “For patients, this means less anxiety and discomfort. For healthcare systems, it enables faster clinical decisions, reduced need for endoscopy or MRI, and closer disease monitoring, particularly valuable in treat-to-target strategies.”

In terms of limitations, however, IUS is operator-dependent and consistent training is crucial, he added. “Certain anatomical regions, particularly the proximal small bowel, can be more challenging to evaluate. Additionally, while IUS is highly effective for assessing inflammatory activity, it becomes more difficult to accurately assess disease involvement when inflammation extends beyond approximately 20 cm of the small bowel.”

Commenting on the Danish study from a US perspective, Anna L. Silverman, MD, a gastroenterology fellow at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, agreed the findings in adult patients with newly diagnosed, rather than long-standing, CD contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting IUS's applicability for both treatment monitoring and prognosis.

“By focusing on early-stage CD, the study provides clearer insights into initial disease activity and response to therapy, reinforcing the value of this noninvasive, point-of-care modality,” she told Medscape Medical News. “These findings enhance our understanding of IUS as a tool to help guide early management decisions in CD.”

Ashwin Ananthakrishnan, MBBS, MPH, director of the Crohn's and Colitis Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, both in Boston, concurred that this is an important study. “It includes newly diagnosed patients — so a very ‘clean' cohort in terms of not being influenced by confounders,” he told Medscape Medical News.

“We don't fully know yet the best treatment target in CD, and this study highlights the importance of early transmural healing in determining outcomes at 1 year,” he noted. In addition, the study highlighted a convenient tool that can increasingly be applied at point of care in the United States. “Colonoscopy at 3 months is not practical and has low patient acceptability, so using IUS in this circumstance would have value and impact.”

Ananthakrishnan pointed to several unanswered questions, however. “Are there patients who may not have healing early but may take some extra time to achieve transmural remission, and if so, what are their outcomes? What is the best timepoint for transmural healing assessment? What is the incremental value of measuring it at 3 vs 6 months?”

In addition, he wondered, how much is the added value of IUS over clinical symptoms and/or markers such as calprotectin and C-reactive protein? “In the subset of patients with clinical and transmural remission, there was no difference in endoscopic outcomes at 1 year, so this is an unanswered question,” Ananthakrishnan said.

This study was funded by an unrestricted grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation.

Madsen reported receiving a speaker's fee from Tillotts. Multiple coauthors disclosed having various financial relationships with numerous private-sector companies, including Novo Nordisk. Silverman and Ananthakrishnan reported having no competing interests relevant to their comments.

A wide-ranging majority of deputies in the National Assembly approved a bill authorising assisted suicide and euthanasia.

The phrase may be overused, but it is no exaggeration to call it a historic day for the Assembly — on par with the legalisation of abortion or same-sex marriage.

After 2 weeks of review and nearly 100 hours of debate, the lower house of Parliament passed the assisted dying bill by 305 votes in favour and 199 against. Right- and far-right Members of Parliament (MPs) largely opposed it, while those from the centre and left voted in favour.

However, as all political groups gave their members the freedom to vote on this extremely complex issue, some MPs did not hesitate to vote against their party's line.

Nineteen MPs from the National Rally, including Sébastien Chenu and Jean-Philippe Tanguy, and seven members of The Republicans voted in favour of legalising assisted dying.

Conversely, opposition to the bill came from the left: Sophia Chikirou, an MP from La France Insoumise, voted against the assisted dying bill; a Green MP; a Communist MP; and four Socialist MPs voted against it.

The bill authorises assisted dying through either assisted suicide or euthanasia in cases where the patient is physically unable to end their life, though these terms are not explicitly used in the text.

To access assistance in dying, a person must meet the following conditions:

The last two conditions have given rise to and will continue to give rise to significant terminological debates.

Immediately prior to the vote on assisted dying, MPs unanimously adopted a separate bill focused on palliative care.

This legislation outlines a 10-year strategy to enhance the provision of palliative care across France. Key measures include the establishment of “support and palliative care homes aimed at improving access to pain relief and end-of-life support for patients.”

“The vote by the National Assembly on the texts on the development of palliative care and assisted dying is an important step,” said French President Emmanuel Macron on social media platform X.

“Regarding sensitivities, doubts, and hopes, the path of fraternity that I wished for is gradually opening up. With dignity and humanity,” Macron said.

The Association for the Right to Die with Dignity expressed satisfaction that France has embarked on the path to freedom.

“I am thinking of all the patients and their loved ones. There are days you know you will never forget. I will never forget this day,” said Olivier Falorni, the general rapporteur of the bill and long-time advocate for legalising assisted suicide.

Despite this progress, the government remains divided. Health Minister Catherine Vautrin championed the bill, whereas Junior Health Minister Yannick Neuder, a cardiologist, expressed reservations. Speaking to France Info, Neuder stated he was “not certain he would have voted for the bill if he had been a member of parliament.”

“Active assisted dying must not become a fallback for inadequate palliative care or limited access to treatment,” he said.

“I have confidence in the parliamentary process to resolve all questions,” said Prime Minister François Bayrou, despite being known for his scepticism towards legalised assisted suicide.

The two bills will now proceed to the Senate, where the right-wing majority is expected to propose significant amendments to the assisted dying legislation, potentially limiting its scope or entirely rejecting it.

A joint committee and negotiations may be necessary to reconcile the differences between the two houses. President Macron has indicated that in the case of a parliamentary deadlock, he may resort to a referendum to resolve the issue.

Children with biliary atresia (BA) exhibited neurodevelopmental deficits and increased autism traits, with earlier surgery linked to better general neurodevelopment.

""High levels of neurodevelopmental difficulties in children with BA reveal a need for greater awareness and enhanced surveillance. That early identification and treatment of BA is linked to better general neurodevelopmental outcome and encourages proactive management,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by M. Earl, PhD, Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Science, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, England. It was published online on May 28, 2025, in The Journal of Pediatrics.

This study was limited by statistical power and generalisability for subgroup analyses because of the modest sample size. The cross-sectional design captured a snapshot of neurodevelopment but did not account for potential worsening over time. Pandemic-related constraints prevented ADOS-2 assessments in nine eligible infants, potentially underestimating the prevalence of autism traits.

Cannabis use in older adults is up, according to researchers who used a national survey database to study emergent patterns in older adult use of the substance.

Their results were published online in JAMA Internal Medicine.

After noting an upward trend in seniors using cannabis — from 1.0% in 2005 to 4.2% in 2018 — a group of investigators led by Benjamin H. Han, MD, from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the 2021-2023 cohorts from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

Their sample included 15,689 adults aged 65 years or older. More than half of the sample (54%) were women. Han and colleagues found that when compared with prior years, past-month cannabis use increased significantly across the cohorts, from 4.8% (95% CI, 3.9%-5.9%) in 2021 to 7.0% (95% CI, 6.2%-8.0%) in 2023.

In a subanalysis, the investigators found that increased prevalence in past month cannabis use was associated with multiple demographic factors. Both women and men showed increased trends, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.32 (1.10-1.59) in women and an OR of 1.18 (0.97-1.43) in men.

Increased past month cannabis use was also observed in older adults with a minimum $75,000 annual income, those with college or postgraduate degrees, those who were married, and those living in a state with legalized medical cannabis.

Further subanalysis of the survey respondents by race showed that persons who identified as “other” sustained the highest OR of increased use, OR = 2.26 (1.12-4.59).

Older adults with the highest incomes previously were found to have the lowest prevalence of cannabis use compared with other income levels, but by 2023, they had the highest usage increase. The study authors suggested this could be due to their ability to afford medical cannabis.

Although an increase in past-month cannabis use was associated with a number of medical conditions, the researchers wrote that they were unable to cleanly sort recreational from medical use. People with chronic diseases, especially those with multiple conditions, saw a spike in cannabis use. The most common medical condition recorded was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with heart conditions, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and two or more chronic conditions also noted to have increased prevalence (6.4%-13.5%).

“The substantial increased prevalence in states with legalized medical cannabis highlights the importance of structural educational support for patients and clinicians in those states,” Han and colleagues wrote. “The use of cannabis products, especially with psychoactive properties, may complicate chronic disease management among older adults.”

A cannabis researcher not involved in Han and colleagues' study agreed.

“One of the most important findings was that those in residence in a state where medical cannabis is legal at the time of interview also showed greater increases in cannabis use,” said Elise Weerts, PhD, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins Medical School, in Baltimore, in an interview with Medscape Medical News. Weerts is also a researcher at the Cannabis Science Laboratory at Johns Hopkins.

Meanwhile, in an accompanying editorial, experts pointed to how, despite a lack of consistent data on cannabis use in older age, its use is growing as it is increasingly legalized.

“Existing therapeutic evidence for medical cannabis in older adults has been inconsistent across several conditions, with many studies suggesting possible benefits, while others finding limited benefit,” the authors of the editorial wrote.

“The potential harms of cannabis use in older adults are apparent, with increased risks of cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal conditions, stroke, sedation, cognitive impairment, falls, motor vehicle injuries, drug-drug interactions, and psychiatric disorders,” they wrote.

The editorial authors stated concerns about scant evidence and a lack of standards around administering cannabis in this patient population.

“Existing therapeutic evidence for medical cannabis in older adults has been inconsistent across several conditions, with many studies suggesting possible benefits, while others finding limited benefit,” they wrote. “Much of the evidence for benefit derives from a single or a small number of studies with nonrandomized designs, and very few studies evaluated harms, making the benefit to risk ratio unclear.”

The editorialists also pointed to the frustration older adult users of cannabis feel around “the lack of awareness and education about age-related issues” at cannabis dispensaries and even in healthcare workers.

The study's findings did not surprise Weerts, who said she has been tracking similar data elsewhere. She said she agreed with the editorial writers that the gap between cannabis use and the understanding of its potential adverse effects or contraindications is widening.

“I am concerned that older adults using cannabis may not be aware of the risks, and that data supporting its efficacy for medical purposes are still not available,” Weerts said. “We need randomized placebo-controlled trials to demonstrate any potential benefits and also track any adverse effects and potential harms.”

Weerts disclosed she had received funds from MyMD Pharmaceuticals and MIRA Pharmaceuticals for contracted preclinical research and from Cultivate Biologics LLC, and Canopy Growth Corp for clinical research projects on cannabis products. Editorial author Lona Mody, MD, MSc, reported receiving grants from the National Institute on Aging, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Veterans Affairs, and NanoVibronix; and Kenneth E. Covinsky, MD, MPH, reported receiving grants from the National Institute on Aging. No other disclosures were reported.

A fully automated plasma biomarker panel detected amyloid-beta (Aβ) positivity and monitored early amyloid accumulation in middle-aged cognitively unimpaired (CU) adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.

""Fully automated immunoassay-based blood biomarkers offer significant diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring capabilities for CU individuals at risk of AD [Alzheimer's disease] even in a relatively short time span,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Armand González-Escalante, Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center, Pasqual Maragall Foundation, Barcelona, Spain. It was published online on May 24, 2025, in eBioMedicine.

This study was limited by unmeasured factors such as lifestyle factors, occupational exposures, or genetic variants, which may still influence plasma biomarker levels and Aβ accumulation. Results from a middle-aged, at-risk cohort with low progression to mild cognitive impairment limited the generalisability to older populations. As a single-centre study, the results need to be replicated in larger, independent cohorts.

This study was funded by the European Research Council, ERA PerMed-ERA NET, and the Generalitat de Catalunya. Some authors reported receiving consultancy/speaker fees from several pharmaceutical organisations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Early brain wiring holds clues to infant emotional development","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250603/Early-brain-wiring-holds-clues-to-infant-emotional-development.aspx","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 02:43:00 GMT","

In a comprehensive Genomic Press research article, scientists have uncovered remarkable insights into how the earliest brain connections shape infant emotional development, potentially offering new ways to identify children at risk for future behavioral and emotional challenges.

The groundbreaking study, led by Dr. Yicheng Zhang and Dr. Mary L. Phillips at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, examined 95 infant-caregiver pairs using advanced brain imaging techniques. Researchers discovered that the microstructure of white matter tracts – the brain's information highways – at just 3 months of age could predict how infants' emotions and self-soothing abilities would evolve over the following six months.

The research team employed sophisticated Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), a cutting-edge MRI technique that provides unprecedented detail about brain tissue organization. This technology allowed scientists to peer into the developing brain's architecture with remarkable precision, revealing how the arrangement of neural fibers influences emotional trajectories.

""What we're seeing is that the brain's structural organization in early infancy sets the stage for emotional development,"" explains the research team. The study focused on critical white matter pathways connecting regions responsible for self-awareness, attention to important stimuli, and cognitive control – networks that form the foundation of emotional processing throughout life.

The findings revealed distinct patterns linking brain structure to emotional outcomes. Infants with higher neurite dispersion in the forceps minor – a bundle of fibers connecting the brain's hemispheres – showed greater increases in negative emotionality between 3 and 9 months. This suggests that certain patterns of brain connectivity might predispose infants to heightened emotional reactivity.

Conversely, infants with more complex microstructure in the left cingulum bundle, which connects regions involved in executive control, demonstrated larger increases in positive emotions and improved self-soothing abilities. These discoveries raise intriguing questions about whether early interventions could potentially influence these neural pathways to promote healthier emotional development.

The ability to identify infants at risk for emotional difficulties before behavioral symptoms emerge represents a significant advance in developmental neuroscience. Previous research has established that high negative emotionality in infancy correlates with increased risk for future anxiety and behavioral disorders, while low positive emotionality links to later depression and social difficulties.

Dr. Phillips notes the potential impact: ""Understanding these early neural markers could transform how we approach infant mental health, allowing for targeted interventions during critical developmental windows."" The research team validated their findings in an independent sample of 44 infants, strengthening confidence in these brain-behavior relationships.

The study's use of NODDI technology marks a significant methodological advance in infant brain research. Traditional imaging methods often struggle to capture the nuanced organization of developing brain tissue. NODDI's ability to separate different tissue components provides researchers with a clearer picture of how neural pathways mature and organize during this crucial period.

The research examined three major white matter tracts: the forceps minor, cingulum bundle, and uncinate fasciculus. Each plays a vital role in connecting brain regions essential for emotional processing and regulation. How might variations in other brain connections influence infant development? What role do environmental factors play in shaping these neural pathways?

The findings have immediate relevance for pediatric care and early childhood development. By identifying objective neural markers of emotional development, clinicians could potentially screen for risk factors before behavioral problems emerge. This proactive approach could lead to earlier, more effective interventions.

The research team accounted for multiple factors that might influence brain development, including caregiver mental health, socioeconomic status, and infant characteristics. This comprehensive approach strengthens the study's conclusions and suggests that brain microstructure represents a fundamental contributor to emotional development independent of environmental influences.

While these findings represent a significant advance, they also open new avenues for investigation. How stable are these early neural patterns throughout childhood? Can targeted interventions modify white matter development to promote emotional resilience? The research team's ongoing work aims to address these questions through longitudinal studies following infants into later childhood.

The study also highlights the importance of the first year of life as a critical period for brain development. During this time, rapid changes in white matter organization lay the foundation for lifelong emotional and behavioral patterns. Understanding these processes at a neural level could inform everything from parenting practices to public health policies supporting infant development.

This research exemplifies the power of advanced neuroimaging to reveal previously hidden aspects of brain development. As technology continues to evolve, scientists gain increasingly sophisticated tools to understand how the brain's earliest organization shapes human behavior and experience.

The University of Pittsburgh team's findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that many aspects of emotional and behavioral development have roots in the brain's earliest structural patterns. By identifying these patterns, researchers move closer to developing targeted interventions that could prevent or mitigate future mental health challenges.

The implications extend beyond individual children to broader questions about human development. How do genetic and environmental factors interact to shape these early brain patterns? What evolutionary advantages might different patterns of emotional development confer? These fundamental questions drive continued research in this rapidly advancing field.

The study demonstrates that even in the earliest months of life, the brain's structural organization profoundly influences emotional development. This knowledge opens new possibilities for supporting healthy development from the very beginning of life.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","AI and clinicians compared in handling complex medical cases","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250604/AI-and-clinicians-compared-in-handling-complex-medical-cases.aspx","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:16:00 GMT","

A University of Maine study compared how well artificial intelligence models and human clinicians handled complex or sensitive medical cases. 

The study published in the Journal of Health Organization and Management in May evaluated more than 7,000 anonymized medical queries from the United States and Australia. The findings outlined where the technology showed promise and what limitations need to be addressed before AI is unleashed on patients - and may inform the future development of AI tools, clinical procedures and public policy. The study also informs efforts to use AI to support healthcare professionals at a time when workforce shortages are growing and clinician burnout is increasing.

The results showed that the accuracy of most AI-generated responses aligned with expert standards of information, especially with factual and procedural queries, but often struggled with ""why"" and ""how"" questions. 

The study also found that while responses were consistent within a given session, inconsistencies appeared when users posed the same questions in later tests. These discrepancies raise concerns, particularly when a patient's health is at stake. The findings add to a growing body of evidence that will define AI's role in healthcare.

This isn't about replacing doctors and nurses. It's about augmenting their abilities. AI can be a second set of eyes; it can help clinicians sift through mountains of data, recognize patterns and offer evidence-based recommendations in real time.""

C. Matt Graham, author of the study and associate professor of information systems and security management at the Maine Business School

The study also compared health metrics, including patient satisfaction, cost and treatment efficacy, across both countries. In Australia, which has a universal healthcare model, patients reported higher satisfaction and one-quarter of cost compared to those in the U.S., where patients also waited twice as long to see providers. Graham notes in the study that health system, regulatory and cultural differences like these will ultimately influence how AI is received and used and that models should be trained to account for these variations. 

While the accuracy of a diagnosis matters, so does the way it is delivered. In the study, AI responses frequently lacked the emotional engagement and empathetic nuance often conveyed by human clinicians. 

The length of AI responses were strikingly consistent, with most varying between 400 and 475 words. Responses by human clinicians showed far more variation, with more concise answers written in response to simpler questions. 

Vocabulary analysis revealed that AI regularly used clinical terms in its responses, which may be hard to understand or feel insensitive to some patients. In situations involving topics such as mental health or terminal illness, AI struggled to convey the compassion that is critical in effective patient-provider relationships. 

""Healthcare professionals offer healing that is grounded in human connection, through sight, touch, presence and communication - experiences that AI cannot replicate,"" said Kelley Strout, associate professor of UMaine's School of Nursing, who was not involved in the study. ""The synergy between AI and clinicians' judgment, compassion and application of evidence-based practice has the potential to transform healthcare systems but only if accompanied by rigorous standards, ethical frameworks and safeguards to monitor for errors and unintended consequences.""

The study arrives amid widespread and growing shortages in the U.S. healthcare workforce. Across the country, patients face long wait times, high costs and a shortage of primary care and specialty providers. These barriers are particularly acute in rural regions, where limited access often leads to delayed diagnoses and worsening health outcomes.

A report published by the Health Resources and Services Administration in 2024projected that nonmetro areas will face a 42% shortage of primary care physicians by 2037. While a growing number of nurse practitioners and physician assistants are stepping in to fill the gap, demand for care is growing faster. Between 2022 and 2026, the population of people 65 and older in the U.S. is projected to increase 54%, a trend harboring significant implications for the demand of health services. 

Strout said that while AI could help improve patient access and alleviate challenges - such as burnout, which affects more than half of primary care physicians in the U.S. - its use must be carefully approached.

AI-powered tools could support round-the-clock virtual assistance and complement provider-to-patient communication through tools like online patient portals, which have skyrocketed in popularity since 2020. The technology, however, also raises fears of job displacement, and experts warn that rapid implementation without ethical guardrails may exacerbate disparities and compromise care quality.

""Technology is only one part of the solution,"" said Graham. ""We need regulatory standards, human oversight and inclusive datasets. Right now, most AI tools are trained on limited populations. If we're not careful, we risk building systems that reflect and even magnify existing inequalities.""

Strout added that as health care systems integrate AI into clinical practice, administrators must ensure that these tools are designed with patients and providers in mind. Lessons from past integration of technology, which at times failed to enhance care delivery, offer valuable guidance for AI developers.

""We must learn from past missteps. The electronic health record (EHR), for example, was largely developed around billing models rather than patient outcomes or provider workflows,"" Strout said. ""As a result, EHR systems have often contributed to frustration among providers and diminished patient satisfaction. We cannot afford to repeat that history with AI.""

Other factors, such as accountability for mistakes and patient privacy, are top of mind for medical ethicists, policy makers and AI researchers. Solutions to these ethical questions may vary depending on where they are adopted to account for different cultural and regulatory environments.

As AI continues to develop, many experts believe it will enhance the service efficiency and decision-making that providers offer to patients. The study's findings support the growing consensus that AI's limited ethical and emotional adaptability means that human clinicians remain indispensable. Graham says that, in addition to improving the performance of AI tools, future research should focus on managing ethical risks and adapting AI to diverse healthcare contexts to ensure the technology augments rather than undermines human care.

""Technology should enhance the humanity of medicine, not diminish it,"" Graham said. ""That means designing systems that support clinicians in delivering care, not replacing them altogether.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Newsom's push to block law could save California nursing homes over $1 billion","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250604/Newsome28099s-push-to-block-law-could-save-California-nursing-homes-over-241-billion.aspx","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 10:52:00 GMT","

Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to block a California law from taking effect next year that will require nursing homes to have a 96-hour backup power supply, potentially giving the industry a reprieve from having to spend over $1 billion in capital investments.

The Democratic governor tucked the suspension into his budget update to address a projected $12 billion state deficit. If lawmakers go along, it will be the second time nursing homes have forestalled spending on generators or other power supplies required to keep ventilators, feeding and IV pumps, and medication dispensing machines running during emergencies, such as wildfires.

""Really? After what just happened earlier this year in Los Angeles, we think fire safety and emergency preparedness is where we want to make cuts?"" said Tony Chicotel, a senior staff attorney with the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. ""The timing is really just shocking.""

California law requires skilled nursing facilities to provide six hours of backup power, from generators or other sources, to run heating and cooling systems and lifesaving medical equipment when utilities shut off power to prevent wildfires or when power is lost. Federal guidelines require nursing homes to have emergency response plans that include backup power or building evacuation.

Starting next year, most of California's roughly 1,200 facilities must extend their backup power capability to 96 hours under AB 2511, which lawmakers passed and Newsom signed in 2022. The bill was a victory for patient advocates who for years had urged the state to stretch the requirement, with power shutoffs becoming more frequent and lasting longer. Shutoffs in October 2019 lasted days, cutting power to more than 100 nursing homes in the state.

The governor's office did not return multiple requests for comment.

Since the 96-hour bill became law, the long-term care sector has made multiple requests for an extension, citing costs over $1 billion to make capital investments. They won a two-year extension last year. Only 34 nursing homes comply with the law, according to the California Department of Health Care Access and Information.

Corey Egel, a spokesperson for the California Association of Health Facilities, said nursing facilities are asking for funding to make the changes. He said that between 800 and 900 of the state's 1,241 nursing facilities will need ""substantial modifications,"" costing at least $1 million per facility, to meet the requirements of AB 2511. He added that some building upgrades will cost as much as $3.2 million.

Adding backup power supplies often requires big changes to electrical and HVAC systems, all of which need state and local permits. The process can take years, and current supply chain constraints and tariff-related delays could add to those challenges, Egel said.

""A number of facilities, especially those in urban areas, were not constructed with adequate space for generators of this size. In some instances, accommodating a unit comparable in size to a semitruck is not feasible,"" Egel said.

Charlene Harrington, a professor and researcher at the University of California-San Francisco who studies nursing homes, said the industry's lobbying against stricter regulations and enforcement has succeeded largely because nursing home owners have been good at hiding their profits.

""When you have a governor who is running for president, they're susceptible to tremendous influence,"" Harrington said of Newsom, who is widely expected to launch a 2028 presidential bid. And nursing homes, she said, ""have been very effective in arguing that they're losing money.""

Nationally, efforts to more effectively regulate the nursing home industry or enforce tougher standards have often fallen flat, even as the quality of care in skilled nursing facilities has been a concern for years.

In April, a federal judge in Texas blocked a Biden administration rule to increase staffing at nursing homes, even though research has found low staffing to be at the root of many of the quality issues across such facilities. An investigation published in early May by Harrington and other researchers found that most facilities have nurse staffing levels ""well below"" the expected staffing based on resident needs and federal minimum staffing requirements.

""They're jeopardizing the safety of their patients,"" Harrington said.

While federal regulations require nursing homes to have emergency plans with options for backup power or evacuations, some states demand additional preparedness. After 12 people died in an overheated nursing home after Hurricane Irma knocked out the power, Florida in 2018 enacted legislation requiring nursing homes and assisted living facilities to have a generator capable of keeping patient areas at 81 degrees Fahrenheit or lower for at least four days. One report found most facilities were compliant by 2021.

Maryland requires assisted living facilities to maintain emergency generators that can run for 48 hours, and Virginia requires generators on-site. And this year, Texas lawmakers have filed bills to require generators in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

In California, it took groups representing about 400,000 nursing home residents several years to secure the rule for extended backup power, overcoming a veto by Newsom in 2020. ""Put simply, any loss of electrical power puts nursing home residents in peril, since most are extraordinarily vulnerable, and many rely on electrical-powered life support systems,"" state AARP director Nancy McPherson wrote in a December 2020 policy letter to the California Department of Public Health. ""Unsafe temperatures, unrefrigerated medications, and medical devices without power can all have deadly consequences for nursing home residents.""

It's unclear whether lawmakers will go along with Newsom's request. State senators are advancing separate legislation in committee that would mandate 72 hours of backup power at assisted living facilities that are home to 16 or more residents. Such facilities are not considered health care operations and have different regulations in California.

Democratic Assembly member Jacqui Irwin, who authored the 96-hour law, expressed frustration with the governor for ""attempting to bureaucratically veto"" her legislation, noting that climate-related threats, such as power shutoffs, have only increased.

Irwin said Newsom's budget proposal ""for an indefinite suspension of the requirement abandons California seniors and those recuperating from an illness or surgery.""

New research shows a clear link between ADHD and irritable bowel syndrome, suggesting gut health could be a key factor in understanding and managing ADHD symptoms.

Study: Association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders and intestinal disorders: A systematic review and Meta-analysis. Image Credit: ClareM / Shutterstock

Massive participant scope: The analysis combined data from 11 studies across 4 continents, covering a staggering 3.8 million people, equivalent to the population of Los Angeles, including 176,000 with ADHD.

In a recent review article published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers systematically identified and analyzed existing research to explore the link between attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and various intestinal disorders.

In addition to people with ADHD showing a slightly (but non-significantly) elevated risk of intestinal disorders, they also found evidence of a significant association between ADHD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Notably, when one outlier study was excluded in the sensitivity analysis, the overall association between ADHD and intestinal disorders became statistically significant (OR 1.47).

ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, typically beginning in childhood and often continuing into adulthood. It affects up to 14% of children and nearly 7% of adults worldwide, posing significant social and economic burdens.

Beyond its well-known psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, and learning disorders, ADHD has also been associated with medical issues like obesity, asthma, and sleep disorders.

Recently, there has been growing interest in understanding how ADHD may be linked to gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, particularly through the gut-brain axis, a complex communication network between the gut microbiota and the brain.

A well-known GI disorder is IBS, a multifactorial condition often involving gut microbiome imbalances, food sensitivities, or inflammation, all of which may also be relevant in ADHD. While the exact cause of IBS has not been ascertained, it can be triggered by stress, certain foods, and hormonal changes, resulting in bloating, abdominal pain, constipation, gas, and diarrhea.

Diverse intestinal conditions examined: Beyond IBS, the study assessed links between ADHD and 8 other conditions,  from celiac disease to Shigellosis and fecal incontinence.

An imbalanced gut microbiome (dysbiosis) has been implicated in neuropsychiatric and GI disorders. Children with ADHD often report more GI symptoms, such as constipation and flatulence, than those without ADHD, further supporting this link.

However, despite individual studies suggesting a possible relationship between ADHD and intestinal conditions, a comprehensive understanding remains limited.

This meta-analysis aimed to synthesize global data and assess whether individuals with ADHD have a higher risk of developing various intestinal disorders, such as IBS, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease, while also considering regional differences in these associations.

The meta-analysis included 11 studies (10 rated as good quality) examining the link between ADHD and various intestinal disorders. Overall, ADHD was not significantly associated with all types of intestinal disorders combined, with high variability across studies.

However, a significant positive association was found specifically between ADHD and IBS, suggesting that individuals with ADHD are more likely to experience IBS. No clear associations were found between ADHD and other gastrointestinal conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, or constipation.

Subgroup analysis hinted at regional differences. Studies from the Eastern Mediterranean Region showed higher odds than those from Europe or the Americas, though this difference was just shy of statistical significance.

This study is the first to offer a global pooled estimate of ADHD's link with intestinal disorders. While previous research yielded mixed findings, this analysis strengthens the case for a specific connection between ADHD and IBS.

There is growing evidence that the gut microbiome plays a central role in both ADHD and IBS. Specific bacterial alterations (e.g., higher Dialister/Megamonas, lower Anaerotaenia/Gracilibacter) have been linked to ADHD symptoms, and microbiota-targeted treatments (e.g., probiotics) may help alleviate inflammation and improve symptoms. These findings suggest the need to explore microbiome-based therapies in ADHD management further.

Similar microbial imbalances are seen in other gut disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. Though this study did not find strong links between ADHD and these conditions, the shared underlying mechanisms involving gut inflammation and microbial shifts remain of interest for future research.

The study highlights the possible role of the gut-brain axis, a communication pathway linking gut microbes to the brain, in explaining this relationship. Research shows that people with ADHD often have altered gut microbiomes, which could affect brain function and behavior through immune, metabolic, or neural pathways.

Clinicians should be aware that ADHD patients may experience gastrointestinal symptoms, especially IBS. Proper screening could improve diagnosis, management, and overall quality of life for these individuals. Interestingly, some ADHD treatments like methylphenidate can cause abdominal discomfort, complicating care.

Limitations of this study include geographic imbalances, as nearly half of the studies originated from Asia, which restricts the generalizability of the findings. The studies also varied widely in design, diagnostic criteria, methods, and the age of the studied populations. Small subgroup samples made subgroup analyses difficult to conduct. Studies were also predominantly retrospective, which may have introduced recall bias and incomplete data. Publication bias was assessed and found to be non-significant.

While ADHD was not strongly linked to all intestinal disorders, it was significantly associated with a higher risk of IBS. Changes may influence this connection in the gut microbiome. Future research should investigate the gut-brain link more closely, exploring how dysbiosis affects brain development and behavior in ADHD.

Large-scale, well-designed studies, especially focusing on gut microbial therapies, could offer new insights into improving outcomes for ADHD patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.

A new study in Genome Biology and Evolution, published by Oxford University Press, finds that the African Swine Fever virus, currently circulating in Europe, is not the result of a recent introduction. Instead, the virus has been present in the region since 2007. Its current dramatic spread appears to be driven largely by people within Europe traveling longer distances.

African Swine Fever virus is a highly virulent DNA virus that causes a severe hemorrhagic disease of the same name affecting both domestic pigs and wild boars. The disease is characterized by high mortality rates, leading to significant economic losses in the pork industry. According to estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization, the virus has led to approximately $2.1 billion in direct economic losses over the past 17 years. Additionally, the outbreak has destroyed many small and medium-sized farms, contributing to structural transformations in agricultural markets, notably in China. Currently, there is no vaccine against the virus available widely.

Initially limited to the sub-Saharan African region, the virus (specifically genotype II) spread globally and is now a major concern in Africa, Europe, Asia, the Pacific and, more recently, the Caribbean. In 2024, the World Organization for Animal Health reported African Swine Fever virus outbreaks in seven European countries, with over one million pigs lost since 2022.

The researchers here analyzed ten samples from domestic pigs and wild boar, collected between July 26, 2016, and August 23, 2019, as part of the State Food and Veterinary Service of the Republic of Lithuania surveillance activities in Lithuania. From these samples, they generated complete genome sequences of African Swine Fever Virus. Researchers used these new sequences to expand the existing dataset of African Swine Fever Virus genomes genotype II and study of the spread of the virus across the European continent.

The analysis shows the African Swine Fever Virus genotype II now circulating in Europe shares a single common ancestor with those circulating in Africa, with no evidence of recent viral exchanges between the two continents. Sequences from Europe are closely related to each other and some countries, particularly Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Germany, appear to have played important roles in the regional spread of the virus across the continent.

African swine fever virus continues to threaten domestic pig and wild boar populations in Europe. Each viral genome we sequence helps to deepen our understanding of the virus's circulation dynamics.""

A team of scientists led by the UAB has identified a new type of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) found in human proteins that are capable of selectively eliminating multidrug-resistant bacteria, particularly of the gram-negative type, responsible for serious hospital acquired infections. The discovery, published in Molecular Systems Biology, could pave the way for more effective treatments against infections resistant to conventional antibiotics.

The study focused on a group of proteins known as glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins (HBPs), which normally aid in processes of blood clotting and inflammation. Using computational tools, the research team coordinated by the UAB explored more than one hundred of these proteins.

The research is based on a curious observation. Certain proteins of our bodies that bind to heparin, a molecule regulating process such as blood clotting and inflammation, can also recognise similar structures found on the surface of dangerous bacteria"".

Marc Torrent, coordinator of the study, UAB Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology researcher 

Based on this idea, researchers identified and synthesised fragments of these proteins containing antimicrobial potential.

Among the candidates selected, five peptides synthesized in the laboratory showed to have potent activity against gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, all of them responsible for serious hospital-acquired infections.
One of the peptides, which has been named HBP-5, has shown particular promise: not only does it effectively kill bacteria in the laboratory even at very low concentrations, but it also acts as a model of sepsis in infected mice, where the treatment succeeded in significantly reducing the bacterial load in several organs.

""These peptides stand out for their potency and specificity, with a very low toxicity in human cells, indicating that they could be safe as a basis for future treatments"", explains Marc Torrent. ""This opens the door to a new family of antibiotics derived from the body's own proteins, with the advantage that they can act specifically against resistant bacteria without affecting healthy cells"", the UAB researcher concludes.

The research, published in Molecular Systems Biology, involved Marc Torrent, Roberto Bello-Madruga, Daniel Sandín and Jordi Gómez from the UAB Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology; Javier Valle and David Andreu from the Pompeu Fabra University; María Nieves Larrosa and Juan José González-López from the UAB Department of Genetics and Microbiology and the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital; and Laura Comas and María ángeles Jiménez from the IQS-CSIC.

A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting found that bedtime procrastination in young adults is associated with specific personality traits, including depressive tendencies.

Results show that bedtime procrastination was associated with higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness and extraversion. These results remained significant after statistically adjusting for chronotype.

Our study demonstrated that individuals who habitually procrastinate their bedtime were actually less likely to report seeking out exciting, engaging, or enjoyable activities. Instead, bedtime procrastinators reported having emotional experiences consistent with depression, specifically endorsing a tendency toward experiencing negative emotions and lacking positive emotional experiences.""

Steven Carlson, lead author, doctoral candidate in the psychology department, University of Utah in Salt Lake City

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, sleep is essential to health. The AASM recommends that adults should sleep 7 or more hours per night on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Bedtime procrastination - the tendency to delay bedtime in the absence of external obligations - reduces the opportunity to get sufficient sleep.

The study involved 390 young adults with an average age of 24 years. They completed a chronotype questionnaire to assess whether they are an ""evening type"" who prefers to stay up and sleep late or a ""morning type"" who prefers to go to bed and wake up early. Participants also completed a questionnaire to assess five personality traits: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. They completed a sleep diary for 14 days to assess bedtime procrastination.

According to Carlson, the study suggests that emotional health is a potential target for interventions to address the widespread problem of bedtime procrastination.

""Bedtime procrastination is not only associated with poor planning, low self-discipline, and time management problems, but also potentially due to difficulties managing negative affect and anxiety prior to bed,"" he said. ""Given the ubiquity of this behavior, and its impact on sleep health, we hope to extend this research to determine whether reducing negative emotions prior to bedtime can be an effective treatment for bedtime procrastination.""

The research abstract was published recently in an online supplement of the journal Sleep and will be presented Tuesday, June 10, during SLEEP 2025 in Seattle. SLEEP is the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, a joint venture of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.

A study conducted by researchers at the Center for Cell-Based Therapy (CTC) highlights key proteins and signaling pathways involved in the efficacy of immunotherapy based on CAR-T cells (lymphocytes modified in the laboratory to fight cancer).

The CTC is a Research, Innovation, and Dissemination Center (RIDC) funded by FAPESP and based at the Ribeirão Preto Medical School of the University of São Paulo (FMRP-USP) in Brazil.

The research, published in the Journal of Proteome Research, was carried out by John Oluwafemi Teibo, a doctoral student at FMRP-USP and FAPESP scholarship holder, under the supervision of Professor Vitor Faça.

""CAR-T cell therapy is innovative and has made incredible advances against hematological diseases. There are many CAR-T cell constructs being approved for clinical use. But we don't fully understand how these CAR-T cells work in terms of molecular mechanisms, or the signaling pathways and molecular effectors involved. And that's the motivation for this study,"" Teibo said in a video published on the São Paulo Blood Center YouTube channel.

The research sought to identify molecular effectors – molecules (usually proteins, but they can also be other molecules) that play a crucial role in responding to stimuli and carrying out specific cellular processes, such as the immune response or signal transduction – related to CAR-T cell therapy in databases such as PubMed and Scopus. The research resulted in the identification of proteins that could be key targets for improving therapy effectiveness.

""We found 14 proteins, which were classified into four categories. First are cytokines, which include interferon, CCL3, gamma interferon, and many others. We also have kinases, such as LCK, ITK, JAK2, as well as B-Raf, and receptors, such as CD80, CD20, which are involved in activating the therapy. Finally, there are proteases and chemical messengers, such as Granzyme B and TNF-α,"" said the doctoral student.

The use of proteomics (the analysis of the set of proteins in a sample) will allow for a deeper understanding of changes in these molecules, paving the way for new treatment advances.

For example, we have interferon gamma and also IL2, which can be used as a surrogate biomarker. This could help overcome some of the challenges of CAR-T cell therapy.""

John Oluwafemi Teibo, doctoral student at FMRP-USP

In addition, recent advances in mass spectrometry have made it possible to analyze the abundance, cellular localization, synthesis/degradation, and post-translational modifications of proteins. This allows for a more detailed and integrated understanding of physiological and cellular processes, which is essential for improving therapy.

Whole-class mental health sessions in schools have a small but significant effect in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms, according to new analysis led by researchers at UCL (University College London) and Anna Freud.

The analysis, published in the journal Frontiers in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, combined results from 71 existing studies involving 63,041 young people aged eight to 18.

The researchers found that sessions based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which helps people to recognise and challenge negative thoughts and behaviours, were more effective at reducing anxiety symptoms than mindfulness-based sessions or sessions drawing from other theories.

Lead author Dr. Daniel Hayes, based in UCL's Department of Behavioural Science & Health and Anna Freud, a mental health charity for children and young people, said: ""The value of whole-class mental health interventions has been contested. Past evidence has been mixed and some experts have argued that, given a lack of obvious benefit, schools should reconsider their use.

""Our findings, based on the most up-to-date evidence, show that whole-class sessions can work in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Although the effect is small on average for individuals, such small effects can be impactful once scaled up at a population level.

""Not all interventions are equal. Our analysis found that CBT-informed sessions, where young people learn to understand their thoughts and behaviours, as well as how to manage them, were significantly more effective at reducing anxiety symptoms than mindfulness-based classes.""

The mental health and wellbeing of children and young people has become a major public health concern, with increasing numbers in the UK and elsewhere in contact with specialist services.

School-based mental health interventions can reach a large number of people, including those who may not otherwise seek help. As long as the approach is careful and evidence-based, tackling the issue with everyone in a class can avoid stigmatising those experiencing mental health problems and help build the wellbeing of all students.

By increasing children's understanding of mental health and equipping them with techniques to help them cope with challenges, it is hoped that these interventions might help to prevent problems in later life.

However, it's important to remember the impact of these interventions alone is often small, and should be part of a wider, whole-school approach to mental health and wellbeing. This involves building supportive relationships and a sense of belonging across the whole school community, and providing more targeted support for those that need it.""

Professor Jessica Deighton, Senior Author, UCL's Division of Psychology & Language Sciences and Director of Applied Research and Evaluation at Anna Freud

As part of their analysis, the researchers reviewed hundreds of existing studies.

The 71 studies they selected took place in 22 countries, with more than half occurring in Australia (27) and the United States (10). Most were conducted in secondary schools (51) rather than primary schools (19). The interventions were mostly delivered by teachers (36) and psychologists (22) and ranged from a single 30-minute session to more than two hours a week over four school years.

The research team divided interventions into three groups: sessions drawing on CBT; sessions based on mindfulness, in which people are encouraged to be aware of their thoughts, feelings and surroundings, as they occur; and those based on other theories or multiple theories, such as yoga, physical education and self-determination theory.

They found that interventions were linked to a later reduction in self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms but not to a later reduction in self-reported internalising symptoms – a broader category encompassing a range of emotional difficulties, such as feeling low, feeling anxious or having peer problems.

The outcomes for depression and anxiety did not vary according to the length of session or who delivered it. CBT-based sessions had more benefit for anxiety symptoms, but depression symptoms did not vary according to the underlying approach informing the intervention.

The study was funded by the UK's Department for Education and involved researchers from UCL and Anna Freud, as well as from the University of York, the University of Exeter, the University of Manchester, Liverpool John Moores University, Edge Hill University in Lancashire, Newcastle University, the University of Dundee and the University of Bath.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers map DNA regions that activate liver regeneration","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250604/Researchers-map-DNA-regions-that-activate-liver-regeneration.aspx","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 13:43:00 GMT","

The mammalian liver has an extraordinary regenerative capacity, capable of fully restoring its mass and function after injury or partial resection. A study led by researchers at the University of Barcelona has identified the DNA regions that activate the regeneration of this organ. The study, published in the journal Cell Genomics, provides a genome-wide map of the interactions between these regulatory elements of liver regeneration and the key genes involved in this process. The results provide a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of regeneration and could have future implications for the development of regenerative medicine.

The paper is signed by researcher Palmira Llorens-Giralt — first author of the article — and professors Florenci Serras and Montserrat Corominas, all three from the Department of Genetics, Microbiology and Statistics of the Faculty of Biology and the Institute of Biomedicine of the UB (IBUB). Researchers from the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL) and the Area CIBER of Liver and Digestive Diseases (CIBEREHD), the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and the Institute of Molecular Biology of Barcelona (IBMB-CSIC) have also participated.

The study uses mouse liver after organ resection to analyze changes in chromatin, the structure in which DNA is organized within the cell nucleus, which plays a key role in regulating gene expression during regeneration. ""Resection or partial hepatectomy is a common clinical practice, both in the removal of liver tumours and in living donor transplants, where part of the liver is transplanted to a patient with liver dysfunction, so understanding how this process works can help to design strategies that optimize its response"", says Montserrat Corominas, who coordinated the study together with Isabel Fabregat, from the IDIBELL.

To obtain a global and dynamic view of the regeneration process, the researchers have analysed multiple genomic data that have allowed them, for example, to compare regeneration with embryonic development of the liver and to detect parallels between the two processes. With this approach, they have observed that the expression of key genes for regeneration is orchestrated by a wide variety of regeneration-responsive regulatory elements, including enhancers — DNA regions that activate gene expression — specific to regeneration, but also reactivated developmental enhancers. That is, re-used enhancers from various stages of embryonic development, with the aim of activating cellular processes essential for the proliferation of hepatocytes, the most abundant cells in the liver. Researchers have also discovered that liver regeneration involves the repression of enhancers that regulate specific metabolic functions of the liver, especially those involved in the metabolism of fats and other lipids.

This reveals that regeneration is a highly regulated process in which an inverse relationship is established: these proliferation programmes are prioritized while energy-intensive metabolic processes, such as the synthesis of bile acids and retinols, are temporarily inhibited.""

Palmira Llorens-Giralt — first author of the article

The study also identifies possible transcriptional regulators that orchestrate liver regeneration. At the start of this process, the AP-1 and ATF3 complexes would be responsible for activating the enhancers responsible for turning on transcriptional programmes, i.e. the gene activation sequences necessary for dormant hepatocytes to re-enter the cell and begin to proliferate. In a second phase, this regulation would be dominated by NRF2. These are three transcription factors, i.e. proteins that regulate the activity of genes by activating or repressing their transcription, which is one of the ways in which genes transmit information to direct the functional response of cells.

One of the highlights of this study is to provide a genome-wide map of enhancer-gene interactions. Together with the identification of key regulators in early liver regeneration, this could be a valuable resource for future studies focusing on regulatory elements involved in liver regeneration.

Although this is a basic research study and therefore aims to better understand the fundamental mechanisms of regeneration, with no immediate clinical application, the researchers stress that it may have implications for the development of regenerative medicine. ""It is this in-depth knowledge that can lay the groundwork for future medical advances and eventually translate into concrete therapeutic interventions, such as drugs that activate specific enhancers or modulate the regenerative response. Thus, studies like this one can act as a bridge to translational regenerative medicine"", the researchers conclude.

UC Irvine researchers conducted a study to better understand the molecular basis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder in which patients lose the ability to move, becoming weak and wheelchair bound before dying because they can no longer breathe.

""ALS is a devastating disease commonly striking patients in their 40s, 50s or 60s,"" says Distinguished Professor of pathology Albert La Spada, MD, PhD, who worked on the study with colleagues from UC Irvine; the University of Ulm, Germany; the Mayo Clinic; and NYU. ""We are in dire need of treatments to slow the progression of this disease, which is a death sentence for patients who have little hope of benefitting much from current approved therapies.""

Previous research into abnormalities of the processing of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) has shown that when TDP-43, a key protein involved in the pathogenesis of ALS, is lost from the nucleus of neurons, mRNAs do not get spliced properly.

We discovered that another aspect of RNA processing, known as polyadenylation, is also altered in ALS due to TDP-43 loss of function in the nucleus.""

The findings appear in a paper published in the June 2, 2025, issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation. ""When an RNA is transcribed from DNA, a long tail of adenine residues is added (the polyA tail), and the site where that happens determines the length of the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR),"" explains Arnold. The researchers found that there is pathological alternative polyadenylation (APA) in ALS resulting in abnormally long or short 3'UTRs, which affects the function of mRNAs.

""We identified one gene, MARK3, where pathological lengthening of the 3'UTR due to APA results in the MARK3 protein ending in the wrong place in the neuron, which will affect its ability to function normally,"" says Sebastian Michels, MD, a former postdoctoral fellow in the La Spada Lab. ""By identifying genes whose mRNAs become dysfunctional due to abnormal polyadenylation, we can examine if correction of the abnormal gene function might be a way to prevent motor neurons in ALS patients from not working properly and eventually dying.""

The next steps involve screening roughly 300 different genes identified in the study as undergoing abnormal polyadenylation in ALS. The researchers aim to determine whether any of the genes are candidates for therapeutic modulation in the hope of developing new treatments for patients suffering from ALS.

""Most patients die within two to three years of being diagnosed, and 90% of cases are sporadic, meaning they show up in patients without a direct family history of the disease,"" says La Spada. ""This is a perfect example of how basic research into the molecular underpinnings of a disease can yield targets for therapy development.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Can tech reduce drinking and boost sleep for young adults?","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250603/Can-tech-reduce-drinking-and-boost-sleep-for-young-adults.aspx","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 02:06:00 GMT","

Can smart wearables and personalized coaching boost sleep and lower risky drinking patterns in young adults? A Yale-led clinical trial offers hope for tech-driven health change.

Study: Wearable Intervention for Alcohol Use Risk and Sleep in Young Adults 

In a recent article published in JAMA Network Open, researchers examined the effectiveness of combining a wearable device, tailored coaching, and self-monitoring on drinking and sleep outcomes among young adult drinkers.

Young adults are at elevated risk for alcohol misuse, making them a key group for prevention efforts. Digital tools, especially wearable devices, offer appealing, accessible options for behavior change, as young adults often seek anonymous and self-directed health support.

While digital alcohol interventions have shown only modest effects, incorporating wearables may enhance outcomes, particularly by providing real-time feedback and promoting self-monitoring.

Wearables have proven helpful in physical health domains like sleep and fitness, but their potential to change drinking behavior remains largely untested. Alcohol-sensing wearables can detect drinking via transdermal alcohol levels but have mainly been studied in justice settings. Wrist-worn devices now offer less invasive monitoring and are suitable for broader populations.

Interventions integrating multiple health domains, such as sleep and alcohol, are promising. Sleep disturbances are often linked with heavy drinking in young adults and may contribute to poor emotional regulation and increased craving.

Improving sleep may indirectly reduce alcohol use. Additionally, young adults who engage in risky drinking tend to be receptive to sleep-related interventions, which may help build awareness and motivation to change drinking behaviors.

This study tested a novel digital intervention that combined personalized feedback from wearables, coaching, and daily monitoring to reduce alcohol use and improve sleep for young adults.

The research team recruited 120 young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 with recent heavy drinking and sleep concerns. Participants were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio into three groups.

The leading intervention group, comprising 60 participants, received wearable feedback, coaching, web-based sleep advice, and smartphone self-monitoring. The two control groups, consisting of 30 participants each, received web-based advice only, and the second received advice and self-monitoring. All participants wore sleep and alcohol biosensors for two weeks.

To be eligible for the study, participants had experienced at least three heavy drinking episodes in the two preceding weeks and a positive score on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test.

People with sleep disorders, psychiatric illness, or current alcohol/sleep treatment were excluded. Randomization was stratified by sex and handled via a secure web-based system.

The intervention group had two virtual coaching sessions during the first two weeks. Doctorate-level coaches used motivational interviewing to discuss feedback from wearable and diary data.

Visualizations linked alcohol use with sleep disruption and estimated blood alcohol concentration during sleep. Coaches provided tailored behavioral strategies and supported goal setting.

Self-monitoring groups completed daily smartphone diaries of alcohol and sleep. The primary outcome was total drinks from the fourth to twelfth week. Secondary outcomes included sleep-related impairment, sleep disturbance, and alcohol-linked consequences.

An exploratory outcome investigating changes in the World Health Organization (WHO) score for drinking risk was also included. The WHO's risk score ranges from 1 (the least risk drinking pattern) to 5 (the most).

Of the participants, 49% were men, and the mean age was 21. The individuals showed high adherence to daily diaries (95%) and wearable use (at least 95%). Nearly all participants completed the treatment and follow-up sessions.

For the primary outcome, all groups showed a significant decrease in total alcohol consumption over time, but there were no significant differences between intervention and control groups. Total drinking decreased by 31% and 49% from week 4 to weeks 8 and 12, respectively.

For the secondary outcomes, the intervention group reported significantly lower sleep daytime impairment compared to both control groups and lower sleep disturbance than the advice-only control group. The effect on the sleep disturbance was not significant when compared to the advice plus self-monitoring group, and the effect size was small.

Alcohol-related consequences decreased over time in all groups, but there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups for secondary outcomes.

In exploratory analyses, the intervention group had significantly greater odds of reducing WHO alcohol risk levels at week 4 than the advice-only with a medium effect size. This finding was not a pre-specified primary or secondary outcome.

A reduction in sleep disturbance was significantly associated with a risk reduction, suggesting a possible link between improved sleep and reduced drinking risk.

This study found that while all participants reduced drinking over time, the digital intervention combining wearables and coaching showed modest benefits specifically for sleep-related daytime impairment and WHO alcohol risk-level reduction, but not for the primary drinking outcome.

High adherence and satisfaction support the feasibility of this approach, especially among young adults motivated by sleep improvement.

Strengths of this study include the novel repurposing of alcohol wearables, integration of multimodal data, a rigorous experimental design, and minimal missing data. However, limitations include a homogeneous sample, short follow-up, limited power for minor effects, and the subjective nature of outcomes.

The intervention shows potential for scalable health behavior change among young adults, particularly when addressing sleep and drinking together. Future trials should test longer, more diverse implementations and explore the integration of digital coaching and feedback across multiple health behaviors for broader public health impact.

An 'AI scientist', working in collaboration with human scientists, has found that combinations of cheap and safe drugs – used to treat conditions such as high cholesterol and alcohol dependence – could also be effective at treating cancer, a promising new approach to drug discovery.

The research team, led by the University of Cambridge, used the GPT-4 large language model (LLM) to identify hidden patterns buried in the mountains of scientific literature to identify potential new cancer drugs.

To test their approach, the researchers prompted GPT-4 to identify potential new drug combinations that could have a significant impact on a breast cancer cell line commonly used in medical research. They instructed it to avoid standard cancer drugs, identify drugs that would attack cancer cells while not harming healthy cells, and prioritise drugs that were affordable and approved by regulators.

The drug combinations suggested by GPT-4 were then tested by human scientists, both in combination and individually, to measure their effectiveness against breast cancer cells.

In the first lab-based test, three of the 12 drug combinations suggested by GPT-4 worked better than current breast cancer drugs. The LLM then learned from these tests and suggested a further four combinations, three of which also showed promising results.

The results, reported in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, represent the first instance of a closed-loop system where experimental results guided an LLM, and LLM outputs – interpreted by human scientists – guided further experiments. The researchers say that tools such as LLMs are not replacement for scientists, but could instead be supervised AI researchers, with the ability to originate, adapt and accelerate discovery in areas like cancer research.

Often, LLMs such as GPT-4 return results that aren't true, known as hallucinations. But in scientific research, hallucinations can sometimes be a benefit, if they lead to new ideas that are worth testing.

""Supervised LLMs offer a scalable, imaginative layer of scientific exploration, and can help us as human scientists explore new paths that we hadn't thought of before,"" said Professor Ross King from Cambridge's Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, who led the research. ""This can be useful in areas such as drug discovery, where there are many thousands of compounds to search through.""

Based on the prompts provided by the human scientists, GPT-4 selected drugs based on the interplay between biological reasoning and hidden patterns in the scientific literature.

This is not automation replacing scientists, but a new kind of collaboration. Guided by expert prompts and experimental feedback, the AI functioned like a tireless research partner-rapidly navigating an immense hypothesis space and proposing ideas that would take humans alone far longer to reach.""

Dr. Hector Zenil, co-author from King's College London

The hallucinations – normally viewed as flaws – became a feature, generating unconventional combinations worth testing and validating in the lab. The human scientists inspected the mechanistic reasons the LLM found to suggest these combinations in the first place, feeding the system back and forth in multiple iterations.

By exploring subtle synergies and overlooked pathways, GPT-4 helped identify six promising drug pairs, all tested through lab experiments. Among the combinations, simvastatin (commonly used to lower cholesterol) and disulfiram (used in alcohol dependence) stood out against breast cancer cells. Some of these combinations show potential for further research in therapeutic repurposing.

These drugs, while not traditionally associated with cancer care, could be potential cancer treatments, although they would first have to go through extensive clinical trials.

""This study demonstrates how AI can be woven directly into the iterative loop of scientific discovery, enabling adaptive, data-informed hypothesis generation and validation in real time,"" said Zenil.

""The capacity of supervised LLMs to propose hypotheses across disciplines, incorporate prior results, and collaborate across iterations marks a new frontier in scientific research,"" said King. ""An AI scientist is no longer a metaphor without experimental validation: it can now be a collaborator in the scientific process.""

The research was supported in part by the Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).

ST. LOUIS (June 3, 2025) - Ally Sentnor recorded the first multiple-goal match of her career and Lynn Biyendolo followed that up with a brace of her own to lift the United States Women's National Team to a 4-0 win over Jamaica, extending the program's undefeated streak against the Reggae Girlz to six and giving the United States back-to-back clean sheets.

The victory at Energizer Park in St. Louis concludes a high-flying, successful window for the USWNT. A few days ago on May 31, the USA defeated China PR 3-0 in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Tuesday marked the second straight appearance in the starting XI for Naomi Girma. The stalwart center back returned to camp for this FIFA window after injuries held her back from international action during the first three events of this year. A world-class defender highly regarded by her teammates, Girma wore the captain's armband for the first time from the opening kick of a USWNT match. Emily Fox, coming off winning the UEFA Women's Champions League title with Arsenal, accompanied Girma in the defense.

With 113 caps between them, Fox and Girma brought balance to a starting backline that featured a pair of fresh 25-year-old defenders. Kerry Abello earned her first cap for the USWNT, becoming the 19th player to debut for the senior team under head coach Emma Hayes, while Tara McKeown earned her sixth cap and fifth career start.

Focused on a quick start, the United States was on the front foot early and piled up a big advantage in shots and possession over the match, though perhaps the squad was slightly too eager at times with the final pass.

With the United States knocking on the door, the passes did connect beautifully in the 19th minute to produce the opening goal. Midfielder Lily Yohannes, playing her final game for the USA as a 17-year-old, controlled the ball near the top of the box and opened up the field with a cross toward the far post. Fox ran under the service and, with a first-time touch, served the ball on a platter for Sentnor in the area. Sentnorstruck it first time with her right foot, bouncing it under a closing defender and into the left side netting to give the United States the early lead.

Sentnor's second goal arrived in the 29th minute. While forward Alyssa Thompson, Yohannes and midfielder Sam Coffey combined in a triangle, Sentnor slipped into the box, sneaking into perfect position to clean up Thompson's deflected shot. Sentnor's goals came just two minutes apart.

Up 2-0, the United States kept the foot on the pedal to start the second half. Right out of the gate, Catarina Macarion early caught Sentnoras the team's scoring leader this year after a promising sequence. The central striker unloaded a fierce shot on frame that required an outstretched reach from Jamaica goalkeeper Liya Brooksto push it over the crossbar. The United States followed up the play with back-to-back corner kicks, continuing to put heat on the Reggae Girlz.

Macario was soon taken off in a triple substitution, replaced by Lynn Biyendolo in the 57th minute. Lindsey Heaps and Lo'eau LaBonta entered the match in the 58th.

Those reinforcements would have an immediate impact. Midfielder Claire Hutton, playing in just her third cap, rose to meet the service on the corner kick and directed a testing header on frame. Brooks made the initial stop, but Biyendolo stayed with the rebound, expertly volleying home from close range to extend the lead to 3-0 in the 60th minute.

In the 80th minute, Abello very nearly scored a goal in her debut. After Jamaica intercepted her pass to Michelle Cooper from the left wing, Abello hustled after the ball and tracked it down. She regained possession, found some space, then ripped a shot from the laces of her left boot, but the confident strike drifted wide to the right.

In the match's dying moments, the United States showed increased zeal to add to the goal total, continuing to attack, which rewarded Biyendolo with her second goal of the night.

After the pair nearly connected minutes earlier, Avery Patterson chased down a ball on the right wing and sent a wonderful, rolling cross into the box for Biyendolo, who was running hard into the box. Biyendolo's left foot delivered from point-blank range, racking up the second brace of the night.

The crowd of 17,689 celebrated Becky Sauerbrunn Bobblehead Night, honoring the St. Louis native for her decorated 16-year international career. The hometown tribute before the match recognized the two-time FIFA World Cup champion, Olympic gold medalist and longtime USWNT captain, who announced her retirement in December.

Hayes's squad returns to action later this month for the second June window. First, it's back-to-back friendlies against Ireland on June 26 in Commerce City, Colorado and June 29 at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio. Then, the USWNT closes out their summer with the program's debut in the Allstate Continental Clásico when they clash with Canada at Audi Field in Washington, D.C. on July 2.

USA – Ally Sentnor (Emily Fox), 19th minute: Lily Yohannes opened up the field with an arching cross toward the far post. Emily Fox received the ball and teed it up for Ally Sentnor inside the box. Sentnor struck the ball toward the left side netting, well out of the reach of Jamaica goalkeeper Liya Brooks, for her third career goal.USA 1, JAM 0

USA – Ally Sentnor, 29th minute: After working together with Lily Yohannes and Sam Coffey in the United States' attacking third, Alyssa Thompson's shot from the edge of the box caught a deflection and spun toward goal. Sentnor, in the right place at the right time, finished off the loose ball with her left foot into the lower right corner to double the lead for the Americans. USA 2, JAM 0

USA – Lynn Biyendolo, 60th minute: Just moments after coming off the bench, Biyendolo found herself on the score sheet. After the Jamaican goalkeeper blocked a header on frame off a corner kick, Biyendolovolleyed in the rebound at the right post to score her 23rd career goal. USA 3, JAM 0

USA – Lynn Biyendolo (Avery Patterson), 88th minute: Avery Patterson and Lynn Biyendolo nearly connected twice earlier, and the two worked together to find the back of the net with just a few minutes left. Patterson raced to chase down a ball sent over the top, then sent a low cross on the ground into the box. Biyendolo, running hard at the goal, slammed it home to secure her brace. USA 4, JAM 0

Ally Sentnor and Lynn Biyendolo both scored twice to lead the United States to a 4-0 victory over Jamaica on Tuesday night at Energizer Park in St Louis. 

Sentnor, 21, opened the scoring in the 19th minute and added a second goal just 10 minutes later for her first career brace. And once Sentnor brought this energy, the U.S. were on their way. The Utah Royals FC striker now has four career goals for the U.S. in just nine appearances.

Biyendolo entered the match in the 57th minute, replacing the effective Catarina Macario, who broke open the scoring for the United States in Saturday's friendly against China. Three minutes after the substitution took place, Biyendolo was on the scoreboard. She added a second goal in the 80th minute to further solidify the victory for the United States, extending her career international total to 24. The final goal was assisted by Avery Patterson for the first helper of her international career (Tuesday's match was just Patterson's fourth cap).

Phallon Tulis-Joyce started in goal again,  and appears to have inched into the lead in the ongoing battle to identify which keeper will replace the formidable Alyssa Naeher. In earning a third clean sheet in as many caps, Tullis-Joyce became the first U.S. keeper since Naeher to play her first three games for the team without allowing a goal. 

Orlando Pride defender Kerry Abello started and played the full 90 minutes on Tuesday night. She became the 275th player to be capped by the United States Women's National Team. Abello is also the 19th player to debut under head coach Emma Hayes, who has prioritized experimenting with young talent during the first half of 2025. 

Prior to the match, St Louis native and two-time World Cup champion Becky Sauerbrunn was honored by the team. Sauerbrunn, who retired from soccer late last year, was a mainstay of the U.S. Women's National Team from 2008-2024. She earned 217 caps for the country and served as co-captain from 2016-2018 and captain from 2021-2023. Aside from her international career, Sauerbrunn played professionally for almost two decades. She finished her career with a 4-year tenure with the Portland Thorns.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Nike's Poster Campaign Heroes New Kits and US Women's Soccer Stars","https://lbbonline.com/news/Nike-MOX-US-National-Women-Soccer-League-NWSL","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 09:27:31 GMT","

Nike and MOX have turned sportswomen into stars plastered across city streets and bedroom walls, for the debut of the US National Women's Soccer League (NWSL)  2025 kit.

Elevating NWSL plays while heroing the new Nike kits, the digital and print campaign saw photographer Emily Lipson capture the players as star-status individuals, nostalgically recalling times when icons were found in fold-out magazine posters. But rather than framing the women's league through a reductive, dated lens, the digital and print campaign shows off their grit and toughness through an injection of movement and expression. 

Emily's work feels timeless and textural, which made her a great fit for the creative. Her work treads the line of appearing old school and analogue, but it always has a fresh, modern spin to it which is especially present in the way she's able to connect and capture her subjects.

Key to the campaign was MOX's all-women team, who ensured the NWSL athletes felt comfortable and confident enough to shine on set. As each player was to be photographed in full performance wear, the team found ways to introduce variation and personality through small styling cues, from rolled-up sleeves to ribbons in hair. 

MOX wanted to work with creatives who are linked to the football world, understanding the players style and their background which led them to work with stylist  Sam Herzog, co-founder of Systema Rosa  – a platform aiming to bridge football and fashion.

Transforming the soccer players into household names, the collection of images can be seen across Instagram, Nike live events, Mundial magazine, and in the wild around New York and LA.

​Vilde Røsjø Tobiassen, senior art director at MOX and lead creative on the campaign, commented, “We really wanted to showcase the strength of these athletes. So often, athlete shoots and particularly female athlete shoots feel very repetitive and very ‘cutesy' – they often feel a bit immature and like a college shoot. We wanted to elevate these press assets and create something that the players felt confident in and that represented their spirit on and off the pitch. We hope that we achieved this with many of the women updating their Instagram profile pictures and pinning their posts to the top of their pages.""​

...

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — The U.S. men's national team failed its first competitive test of the Mauricio Pochettino era in rather embarrassing fashion, losing to Panama 1-0 in a CONCACAF Nations League semifinal here at a half-empty SoFi Stadium.

The Americans played timidly, unimaginatively and laboriously for 90 scoreless minutes. They were booed off the field at halftime. They looked uninspired, even with a home-soil World Cup on the horizon. They seemed destined for extra time against a team they were heavily favored to beat — and one that, based solely on talent, they should have beaten.

But they couldn't. And then, in the 94th minute, the seemingly unthinkable happened.

Cecilio Waterman beat U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner.

[You could win $25K in the Women's Bracket Mayhem contest. Enter now!]

Panama prevailed, and jumped for joy at midfield as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and the rest of the USMNT's golden generation trudged out of sight, into Sunday's third-place match. Panama will face Mexico, which beat Canada 2-0 in Thursday's late game, in the final on Sunday.

They played just as they had toward the tail end of the Gregg Berhalter era. Berhalter was fired following the Copa América, largely because the U.S. lost to Panama 2-1 after playing most of a group-stage match with 10 men.

Pochettino replaced Berhalter last fall. His mandate was to revive a plateauing program. His early results were largely positive.

But in his first true elimination game, with 11 men, the U.S. suffered a familiar fate.

And in a sense, they regressed. The Americans had won all three prior editions of the Nations League. Under Berhalter, in semifinals and finals, they'd beaten Mexico three times, and Canada, Jamaica and Honduras once apiece.

But Panama posed different problems. Under head coach Thomas Christiansen, Los Canaleros are now 4-1 against the U.S. in competitive games. They frustrated the USMNT yet again on Thursday, and earned a famous result.

And they gave Pochettino, and players, and fans a lot to chew on at the start of this last full calendar year before a landmark World Cup.

""The way we approached the game and started the game wasn't in the right way,"" Pochettino said.

""We played too slow,"" he added. ""We didn't show aggression with the ball"" — nor without it. ""The first half was really painful to see,"" Pochettino said.

They played with none of “the grit, the desire, the nastiness” that McKennie said Pochettino has been trying to instill, and as a result, they have relinquished their grip on regional supremacy; they flunked one of only two competitions that they'll have between now and June 2026; and they got this critical phase of World Cup preparations off to a downright dreadful start.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Mauricio Pochettino compares himself to USMNT star after viral moment","https://www.themirror.com/sport/soccer/mauricio-pochettino-usmnt-diego-luna-1189195","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:15:00 GMT","

Mauricio Pochettino's tenure as head coach of the U.S. Men's National Team has been rocky thus far, guiding his side to a 5-0-3 record, including back-to-back defeats in their failed defense of the CONCACAF Nations League.

However, while many of the USMNT's biggest stars have failed to impress of late, with many being criticized for lacking pride and effort on the pitch, one young attacker has stood out for all the right reasons.

Real Salt Lake star Diego Luna received just his second national team call-up in January, joining Pochettino's camp for their friendlies against Venezuela and Costa Rica.

The latter game proved a turning point for Luna, who came off bloodied and bruised with a broken nose after taking an elbow to the face, only to force his way back into the game to immediately provide an assist during the USMNT's 3-0 win.

Luna's determination and grit have shone through ever since, proving a standout performer in their Nations League third-place playoff loss to Canada, as he once again received plaudits for his fight and effort.

And it seems Pochettino has been equally impressed by the 21-year-old, telling Landon Donovan and Tim Howard in a recent interview on their Unfiltered Soccer podcast that the RSL star reminds him of himself.

“When Diego in the game in Orlando received an elbow in his nose, I saw he was like this…blood. And the doctor said to me (to substitute him),” Pochettino recalled.

“But he said, 'Coach I want to play.' I said, 'But it's a friendly game. Diego it's a friendly game. Your nose.' I didn't want to worry him. But I was like scared, you know, it was like this (bloodied and broken), but it was amazing.

“And he convinced the doctor, 'Doctor, I can play. If you allow me to play, I want to play. Coach, I want to play. And then in the half-time, we'll see.' And then goes… fight. Crash with one guy after one was one of these. And then take the ball. Assist.

“That is what I want. It's not, 'Ah, Ciao.' No, that is what I want. That is the mentality. That is that you feel that the players play for nothing more than the pride to be a player. To defend their shirt.”

Pochettino went on to add that during his playing days, in which he made 20 appearances for Argentina, he “was like this. I played because of that. Not because of my quality.”

Reflecting on the incident, Luna recently told reporters that he felt it may have served as a reminder to others of the level of commitment that should be given to the USMNT.

“I think that experience for me was, I could say life changing as it gave me,” he said. “I think it added an opportunity for me to come back into more camps and show the type of the grit and the hunger that I have to play and represent for my country.

“And I think, yeah, it showcases, Mauricio really liked that about me and really liked the fight that I had. And I think that shows other players that that's what's needed in this team and to fight through everything.”

Luna will soon have another opportunity to show Pochettino just what he's made of when the USMNT hosts Turkey in a friendly on June 7, before taking on Switzerland three days later. Focus will then turn to the CONCACAF Gold Cup, where the USMNT will look to win its first title under Pochettino.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Mauricio Pochettino Hands Christian Pulisic Lionel Messi Challenge","https://www.si.com/soccer/mauricio-pochettino-christian-pulisic-lionel-messi-challenge","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 14:00:14 GMT","

As pressure builds and time runs out on the U.S. men's national team and head coach Mauricio Pochettino, the coach prepares for an important summer. He's not just focusing on building team chemistry and installing a tactical system, also emphasizing how important Christian Pulisic is to his team but also the country they're representing.

Christian Pulisic won't feature for the USMNT this summer after the player and federation discussed giving him a rest after a lengthy European season with AC Milan. It is a decision to keep Pulisic fit, but one that's been scrutinized given the finite opportunities before 2026 for the Argentine coach to get the team firing on all cylinders.

Pochettino sat down with USMNT legends Tim Howard and Landon Donovan on their Unfiltered Soccer podcast ahead of the Concacaf Gold Cup.

Pochettino went as far to compare the game's biggest and greatest star, Lionel Messi, to Pulisic, but not in regards to their skill on the pitch. More highlighting the importance of how he's a connecting factor between growing and fostering the relationship between the sport and the country.

The current USMNT coach managed Messi during their time at Paris Saint-Germain together.

“First of all, I think Christian in the last year was showing great quality. He's performing in Europe, and also he's performing here in the national team. He's a very talented player that can help us win. 

“You say people compare Messi with Pulisic. I don't want to be disrespectful with Messi or Pulisic, but I think in this country, Pulisic should be our Messi, because he's an iconic player, the kids on the street for sure if you ask one soccer players in the country, it's Pulisic,” Pochettino said to Donovan and Howard.

Pulisic is just one of many USMNT stars slated to miss the Gold Cup. Antonee Robinson, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Folarin Balogun and Gio Reyna will all be absent for a myriad of reasons.

Howard called out the national team and coach last week amid multiple absences given the Gold Cup is arguably the team's final opportunity in a competitive setting to show what they're made of. Pressure will be put, rightfully so or not, on this squad and coach to deliver in the Gold Cup without a group of their core talent.

Pochettino highlighted how prioritizing the medium-to-long term is sometimes important over the present, but time is running out as we build toward the 2026 World Cup on U.S. soil. Gold Cup is an extended camp, and an important one, that the coach will have to navigate without a slew of names.

Yet, it's also an opportunity for burgeoning talent like Diego Luna to step up. Pochettino is facing pressure less than a year into the job to deliver results after a demoralizing Concacaf Nations League ending.

“I feel the responsibility. We all feel the responsibility. Knowing that it's soccer or football, it's about the joy, it's about not to put too much pressure on the players, because the players need to perform...

“You need to show that you are brave, that you are a winner, but not talking like I am now. It's easy to talk. The most important [thing] is go and to show. Show on the pitch when you need to defend your flag there, fighting and being a team, that is a moment to say ‘Yes we have quality, I am a good player, but now it's about [defending] your country.'”

The USMNT play Turkiye and Switzerland in international friendlies on June 7 and 10 before kicking off their Gold Cup run against Trinidad and Tobago on June 15.

...

'He Should Be Our Messi': Pochettino Gives 'Lionel Messi' Value to US Soccer Star originally appeared on Athlon Sports.

Mauricio Pochettino says he's fully invested in the U.S. Men's National Team ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The Argentine coach is preparing the US Soccer National Team for the CONCACAF Gold Cup this summer.

In an interview with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard on The Unfiltered Soccer podcast, Pochettino hopes that U.S. soccer fans view soccer star Christian Pulisic as their Lionel Messi.

It wasn't a direct comparison between the players' ability but their status within the national team and their respective countries. This is despite not counting on Pulisic for the upcoming summer tournament.

Donovan avoided a direct comparison but asked whether Pochettino can handle the USMNT without a player like Christian Pulisic. This comparison comes as Pulisic is viewed as the best player on the national team, just like Lionel Messi is with Argentina.

Mauricio Pochettino: ""People compare Messi with Christian Pulisic. I don't want to be disrespectful to Messi. Or with Pulisic with Messi. But I think in this country, Pulisic should be our Messi. He's an iconic player. If you ask one soccer player from this country, it's Pulisic.""

Pulisic remains an important part of the USMNT despite withdrawing from the Gold Cup tournament this summer. Pochettino claims that Pulisic remains part of the plans for the World Cup next year.

The U.S. Men's National Team will play two friendly matches ahead of the Gold Cup in the next few days.

On Saturday, the U.S. Men's National Team will take on Turkiye at the Pratt & Whitney Stadium. Next Tuesday, Pochettino's team will take on Switzerland at Geodis Park.

The Gold Cup starts on June 14, and Team USA is in group D. They will play Trinidad and Tobago on June 15. They then play against Saudi Arabia on June 19. Their last group stage match is against Haiti on June 22.

Lionel Messi is undoubtedly one of the greatest players in soccer history. His achievements and talent have led him to be compared to other greats of the game like Diego Maradona.

There is a debate between the two players in Argentina, and Pochettino was asked who he thinks is the greatest Argentinian player of all time. He picked Maradona due to the joy he brought him growing up.

Mauricio Pochettino: ""Maradona was my hero. It's difficult for Messi to fight with my hero. But I think both are amazing. But Maradona is because emotional. Because when I was a kid, I grew [up] watching Maradona. And that emotion that you build inside yourself, that is for the rest of your life.""

The bitter taste of the Concacaf Nations League—where the U.S. finished in fourth place—is now behind Mauricio Pochettino, the new head coach of the United States Men's National Team. His focus has shifted to the upcoming Gold Cup, hosted on home soil, and the major long-term goal: the 2026 FIFA World Cup, where the U.S. will co-host alongside Mexico and Canada.

Despite not having team captain and star player Christian Pulisic for this summer's tournament, Pochettino fully recognizes the No. 10's importance and the key role he'll play at the World Cup.

“Christian has shown great quality this past year, both in Europe and with the national team. He's a talented player who can help us win. I don't mean to disrespect Messi or Pulisic, but I believe Christian should be our Messi in this country,” said the coach during a relaxed conversation with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard on their podcast Unfiltered Soccer.

Addressing Pulisic's absence from the Gold Cup, he explained: “We're in constant communication with him. He's fully committed, wants to help, and is focused on being in top shape for the World Cup. Every player is in a different situation, and this was a collective decision made in the best interest of both the player and the team long-term. You can't force someone to come. You have to think beyond just the short term.”

Pulisic has worn the U.S. jersey 78 times, scoring 32 goals and providing 20 assists. He was the team's standout player at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. After successful stints at Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea, he's now one of the top figures at AC Milan. In the recently concluded season, he played 50 matches for the Rossoneri, recording 17 goals and 12 assists.

FIFA Club World Cup

Jack Grealish is likely to be left out of Manchester City's squad for the Club World Cup.

The 29-year-old only appeared in 20 Premier League games in 2024-25 and started just seven with manager Pep Guardiola now expected to leave him at home when the squad head to the United States for FIFA's newly-expanded competition, which kicks off later this month.

He was an unused substitute as City were beaten by Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final in May and was left out of the squad entirely for City's final league game of the season, a 2-0 win over Fulham.

Guardiola said the decision to not select Grealish against Fulham was “not personal” and explained the club would hold talks with his representatives over his future this summer.

Grealish joined City in 2021 from Aston Villa for a then-British record fee of £100million and has made 157 appearances for the club, scoring 17 goals and assisting 23.

He has won three Premier League titles and played an important role in City's treble-winning campaign in 2022-23 as the club lifted the Champions League for the first time.

Guardiola has previously spoken of his desire to see Grealish return to the level that he displayed in that season.

“Do I want the Jack that won the treble? Yeah, I want it, but I try to be honest with myself,” Guardiola said in January.

“I fought a lot for him, fought a lot to be here. I know that he can do it because I saw him. I saw his level and I want that, every single training session and every single game.”

Grealish is a product of Villa's academy and made his senior debut for the team in 2014 after a loan spell at Notts County. He played 213 games for Villa and was named club captain in 2019 after helping the team return to the Premier League following their relegation in 2016.

He has been capped 39 times by England and most recently featured in a 3-1 Nations League win over Finland in October under interim manager Lee Carsley but is yet to be called up by new head coach Thomas Tuchel.

City begin their tournament against Wydad AC on June 18, before games with Al Ain (June 22) and Juventus (June 26) in Group G.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Man City 'Likely' to Leave Outcast Off FIFA Club World Cup Squad List","https://www.si.com/soccer/man-city-leave-outcast-off-fifa-club-world-cup-squad-list","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:45:00 GMT","

Jack Grealish is expected to be omitted from the Manchester City squad for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup as he moves closer to a summer exit. 

The 29-year-old endured another frustrating campaign in 2024–25 and made just 20 Premier League appearances for the second successive season. He started only 16 of the 32 matches he featured in across all competitions, providing eight goal contributions for the struggling Cityzens. 

Such an underwhelming term has fueled speculation regarding his future and the fire was stoked further by Pep Guardiola's decision to leave him out of the squad for Man City's final Premier League game of the season against Fulham. 

That snubbing doesn't appear to be a one-off, with The Athletic reporting that Grealish is “likely” to be omitted from Man City's traveling squad for the upcoming Club World Cup which begins in mid-June. 

Grealish's exclusion could be the final nail in the coffin for the England international, who has managed just 17 goals in 157 appearances since his £100 million ($137.5 million) move from Aston Villa back in 2021. 

There is a growing expectation that his time at the Etihad Stadium has come to an end as Man City look to usher in a new era. There is unlikely to be a place for the ageing forward in Guardiola's squad moving into 2025–26. 

While the Cityzens are unlikely to recoup a significant chunk of the eye-watering fee splashed on Grealish, there will undoubtedly be an array of prospective buyers. In the Premier League alone, Newcastle United, former side Villa and, somewhat surprisingly, Arsenal have all been linked. 

There have been reports suggesting interest from Italian sides Inter Milan and Napoli, too, while there are likely to be suitors further afield—potentially in Saudi Arabia and the United States.

FIFA Club World Cup

FIFA has once again slashed ticket prices for the Club World Cup's opening night fixture, with concerns mounting that the launch game starring Inter Miami and Lionel Messi will be overshadowed by masses of empty seats at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens in Florida.

According to sources briefed on FIFA's attempts to sell tickets for the tournament, all of whom wished to remain anonymous when disclosing commercially sensitive information, tens of thousands of seats remain unsold for the fixture between MLS side Inter Miami and Egyptian team Al-Ahly at 8pm (ET) on Saturday, June 14. Hard Rock Stadium has a capacity of 65,326. The sources added that FIFA has been concerned in recent weeks that the opening game of the tournament has not been selling as well as they had expected. It was even suggested that tickets sold for the opening game are at less than 20,000 — but FIFA insists this is false, saying the figure is “much higher” but it did not specify numbers.

FIFA said in a statement: “We are introducing many new, successful clubs from all over the world to the world through this tournament being staged in the 11 cities across the United States. Overall, we anticipate great attendances throughout the competition for this first-ever edition – a tournament that we believe will grow edition-on-edition.”

FIFA had hoped for a big launch night turnout after involving MLS team Miami, whose star player Messi is marketed as the face of soccer in the United States, while they also expected this to be enhanced by playing the game in the team's home market.

However, FIFA has sold general sale tickets for the revamped 32-team Club World Cup under a dynamic pricing model, a system whereby prices fluctuate based on demand, and the tumbling prices for certain games are indicative of FIFA's struggles to penetrate the market.

As of Tuesday night, Inter Miami's game against Al-Ahly had dropped to only $55, according to prices on Ticketmaster, the portal FIFA are using to sell tickets for the tournament. This is half of what they were available for in May, while tickets were $230 for the cheapest seat in January and $349 after the draw in December. FIFA is now hoping that the reduced prices draw people in during a publicity blitz in the final week before the tournament.

Additionally, some sources have questioned whether it may have been wiser to take Inter Miami out of their home market where their star names would be more of a novelty, particularly if attempting to sell games at higher prices than Inter Miami home fans usually pay at a different venue to their normal home field at Chase Stadium. Others counter that FIFA were reasonable to hope that Inter Miami fans would rally behind their team in a home market.

FIFA is holding prices at a higher price point for later in the group stage in the hope that interest picks up in the tournament as it progresses. For example, Inter Miami's third and final game of the group phase against the Brazilian side Palmeiras has tickets starting at $113. However, their second game of the group against Portuguese team Porto in Atlanta has tickets available for $58, in a game that kicks off at 3pm ET on the afternoon of Thursday, June 19.

The highest selling group games in the tournament so far involve Real Madrid, with no tickets available for less than the $132 lowest entry for the Spanish club's game against Mexican side Pachuca (in Charlotte) while prices start at $310 against Saudi Arabian team Al Hilal (in Miami) and $253 against the Austrian team RB Salzburg (in Philadelphia). These prices appear to have increased since Madrid confirmed the involvement of new coach Xabi Alonso and summer signing Trent Alexander-Arnold in the tournament. The match involving Argentine team Boca Juniors against Bayern Munich is also trending particularly well, boosted by the substantial Argentine population in Miami, with the cheapest seat currently showing at $136.

FIFA said: “It is accurate that matches involving Boca and Real have high demand from fans. But they are not the only clubs to feature in such a list and, in fact, the highest selling match features other clubs for this first-ever edition. The strong international appeal has seen supporters from more than 130 countries book their ticket to the competition. The top 10 countries per ticket sales are the United States, followed by club fans from Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Canada, Germany, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan and Spain.”

Clubs competing in the tournament have a $1bn pot to fight for, with the winner in line to win as much as $125m.

Other ticket prices elsewhere have dropped dramatically. The lowest-priced ticket appears to be the match between Argentine side River Plate and Japanese team Urawa Red Diamonds, which is selling for as low as $24 for the match at Lumen Field in Seattle at 3pm ET on June 17.

Other games including new European champions Paris Saint-Germain against Brazilian side Botafogo are available for $33 at the 90,000-capacity Rose Bowl in Pasadena while there are also concerns for huge swathes of empty seats for games including Benfica vs. Auckland (in Orlando), Palmeiras vs. Al-Ahly (in New Jersey), Ulsan vs. Mamelodi Sundowns (in Orlando) and Mamelodi vs. Fluminense (in Miami), all of which are now selling for prices between $26 and $40.

Speaking in April, the FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who has been the biggest proponent of the tournament, insisted he was “not worried at all about ticket sales.”

He said: “When I see some of the stadiums in the United States filling itself when some teams are coming to play some friendly games, exhibition games, then I'm not worried at all to fill a stadium when teams are coming to play a World Cup, to play for, you know, something, something real.”

Inter Miami have been approached for comment.

In years without a World Cup, European Championship, or Copa América, soccer fans often find themselves twiddling their thumbs—refreshing transfer rumor pages day and night in search of a fix. But no matter how juicy the gossip, it never quite satisfies the craving for real competition.

2025 is one of those years. Fortunately, FIFA have a trick up their sleeve to keep fans engaged: the newly revamped Club World Cup.

Once dismissed as a glorified pre-season warm-up or post-season cooldown, the tournament has undergone a massive transformation. FIFA has poured significant investment into the event, expanding it from just seven teams to a full 32-team competition in a bid to make it one of the sport's premier spectacles. And so far, it's working.

This year's Club World Cup is packed with top teams from every corner of the globe—from Europe and South America to North America, the Middle East, and beyond. In an unusual twist, clubs like Real Madrid are even accelerating summer transfer plans—bringing in names like Trent Alexander-Arnold—to gear up for the tournament. It's a clear sign that this edition is being taken seriously.

Ahead of what promises to be a landmark moment in club soccer, here's everything you need to know about the 2025 Club World Cup: from the full schedule and participating teams to how and where you can watch it all unfold.

The 2025 Club World Cup will feature teams from all seven of FIFA's continental federations. That includes representatives from Europe (UEFA), South America (CONMEBOL), Asia (AFC), Africa (CAF), North and Central America (Concacaf), Oceania (OFC).

The allocation of slots is based on historical performance and global competitive balance. Europe leads with 12 participating clubs, reflecting its dominance in international club football. South America follows with six, while Asia, Africa, and North/Central America each contribute four. Oceania has one representative, and the final place is given to a team from the host country.

Qualification is primarily determined by results in each region's top club competitions. For example, winners of the UEFA Champions League and the Copa Libertadores from recent years automatically qualify. Other teams earned their spot based on consistent high-level performances in their respective continental tournaments across multiple seasons.

Here's the full list of qualified teams, along with how each one made it to the tournament.

DAZN will be the primary broadcaster of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, after securing global streaming rights in a landmark $1 billion deal finalized in December 2024. In a surprising move, DAZN announced that all matches will be available to stream for free, making the tournament more accessible than ever.

To complement its global coverage, DAZN has sublicensed rights to a number of regional broadcasters around the world. In the United Kingdom, Channel 5 will televise 23 matches, offering fans a chance to watch some of the action on free-to-air TV. Meanwhile, in the United States, TNT Sports will carry 24 games as part of its own Club World Cup programming.

In China, where DAZN currently doesn't operate, streaming rights were secured through a separate agreement with Migu. The deal includes coverage of both the 2025 edition and the next tournament, ensuring Chinese viewers won't miss out on the revamped competition.

Chelsea are accelerating their transfer plans to secure three MAJOR signings before the FIFA Club World Cup, with manager Enzo Maresca determined to strengthen his squad for the global showdown.

TEAMtalk understands the Blues are pushing to secure deals for all of AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan, Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, AND Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens, aiming to integrate them with new signing Liam Delap.

The club is also in the market for a new centre-back to bolster their defensive line. Maresca, who guided Chelsea to a strong campaign in last seasons Premier League, sees the Club World Cup as a chance to cement the club's status among the elite.

Maignan, the 29-year-old French international, is a top target to challenge Robert Sanchez in goal. Maignan's commanding presence, exceptional shot-stopping, and ability to play out from the back have made him one of Europe's premier goalkeepers, and his experience at Milan could prove invaluable for Chelsea's ambitions.

The French International goalkeeper has said yes to the move and Chelsea believe a deal could be done for as low as £15m pounds, due to his contract coming into its last year. Its seen as a great opportunity to get top class experience in the door for a good fee.

Milan are holding firm on their valuation and sources say negotiations are tense, the Italian giants are also working hard to convince their number one to sign a new deal and stay at the club.

Ekitike, the 22-year-old Frankfurt forward, is another key focus. Ekitike's pace, aerial ability, and clinical finishing make him a promising addition to Chelsea's attack. Maresca views him as a dynamic option to compete with Nicolas Jackson and Delap.

He is also seen as a player who can play across multiple positions in the front line and sources say he is very keen to play in the Premier League next season. Ekitike won't come cheap, however, with Frankfurt valuing him at £80m.

Gittens, the 20-year-old Dortmund winger, completes the trio. The former Manchester City youth product has dazzled in the Bundesliga with his directness and flair, earning comparisons to England star Bukayo Saka. His potential move to Stamford Bridge would add versatility and creativity to Chelsea's wide areas.

A broad agreement has been reached between clubs and Chelsea hope to pay £35m for the winger, who, like Maignan has said yes to the move and is keen on a return to England.

In addition to these attacking and goalkeeping targets, Chelsea are actively seeking a centre-back to pair with Levi Colwill. The club is prioritizing a defender comfortable in Maresca's possession-based system and one who is left footed, further movements have been made towards Jorrel Hato at Ajax.

As the Club World Cup approaches, Chelsea's ambitious transfer strategy underscores their determination to complete their biggest deals early in the window and they could have five news signings done by the time the tournament is in play.

                        Chelsea are in club-to-club talks with AC Milan for the signing of France starter, Mike Maignan, with the Blues seeking to conclude a four-signing spree worth close to £200m                    


                        The Blues are looking to add players in three specific areas as they look to build a squad capable of winning the Premier League, but one addition could spell bad news for Liam Delap                    


                        The Blues are plotting a blockbuster summer and two more forwards could arrive at Stamford Bridge after Liam Delap, according to an insider                    


                        The Reds will not stop at just the signing of Wirtz and will next focus on re-modelling their attack with two huge transfer targets now in their sights

...

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup kicks off in less than two weeks. The players and ownership of the Seattle Sounders are still fighting over their pieces of the pie.

Amid a stand-off over the upcoming FIFA prize pool, the Sounders players took the field Sunday wearing warm-up shirts reading ""Club World Ca$h Grab."" The shirts received considerable attention on social media, and even more attention from the owner's box.

According to Sounder at Heart and GiveMeSport, Sounders owner Adrian Hanauer angrily addressed the team in a profanity-laced postgame address. The exact comments aren't reported, but the players felt pushed enough that they discussed the issue with reporters in a joint address on Monday.

At the center of the fight is a tournament where players are only guaranteed to receive less than 1% of the prize money if they pull off a miracle run.

While the idea of the expanded Club World Cup, in which 32 teams from across the world will compete in the United States this summer, is exciting, it comes with on major issue. Those teams' players already play a full, taxing schedule, and the Club World Cup adds between three and seven games to that docket.

FIFA addressed this concern the way soccer governing bodies usually do: with enormous amounts of cash. The tournament has a prize pool of $1 billion, up from the $16 million offered in the previous tournament.

By simply showing up to their own Lumen Field in Seattle and playing three group play games, the Sounders organization is guaranteed to receive $9.55 million in participation money. For every game they draw, they get $1 million. For every win, $2 million. If they get out of group play? $7.5 million.

If they win the tournament, which no one expects them to do, the Sounders will walk away with more than $120 million.

And it is now at this point we will tell you the players' cut of all that money, no matter what happens, is capped at $1 million. Not each. To split.

As Sounder at Heart broke down, the reason for this is a provision in the MLS CBA — signed in 2021, back when the Club World Cup was a minor, seven-club competition — that says players can receive a total of no more than $1 million per tournament.

So basically, the Sounders organization is on track for the deal of a lifetime, and the Sounders players want payment that reflects three games of elite soccer. And now they are publicly fighting over it less than two weeks before their tournament opener.

Soon after the Sounders took the field in shirts that infuriated their team owner, the MLS Players Association released a statement saying the union and its players stand united with the team and demand ""a fair share"" of the Club World Cup prize money.

The union claimed it had ""respectfully"" invited the league to the table for months and had not received a reasonable proposal. It specifically called the $1 million clause out of date and ignorant of longstanding international standards for player payment in global competitions.

Per GiveMeSport, one MLS source claimed the league office had regular discussions with the MLSPA over the past few weeks, with no official proposal from the union, argued that the $1 million clause is not out of date.

It's also worth noting the MLSPA did agree to this CBA, but without the foresight that FIFA would be springing a multi-million cash cow on the league's better clubs.

The Sounders are one of three MLS squads that made the tournament, alongside LAFC and Inter Miami. Seattle was placed in Group B, alongside France's Paris Saint-Germain, Spain's Atlético Madrid and Brazil's Botafogo.

Neither of the other American teams have aired out their grievances like the Sounders have, but it's hard to imagine either of those groups of players being happy with what the league is currently arguing.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

PERTH, Australia -- With his eyes on steering Japan to a FIFA World Cup title, Hajime Moriyasu wants to see his nation's players featuring at the highest level in the year leading up to next year's tournament, be it in the top five European leagues or the UEFA Champions League.

The J1 League, however, also represents a rapidly rising league in the coach's eyes.

Defeating Bahrain to punch their tickets to North America 2026 with three games to spare, the Samurai Blue became the first nation outside of the hosts to secure qualification back in March -- and Moriyasu has taken advantage of his side's strong qualification campaign to rotate his side heavily for their final Asian qualifiers against Australia and Indonesia.

At the end of a long European season, the likes of Kaoru Mitoma, Takumi Minamino and Daizen Maeda have not made the trip to Western Australia, with it left to veterans such as Takefusa Kubo, Wataru Endō and Yūto Nagatomo -- the latter, in line to make his first appearance since the 2022 World Cup -- to bring a veteran presence to the squad.

On the other end of the spectrum, more players in the squad named by Moriyasu are in line to make their international debut, eight, than those who possess double-digit caps, seven -- 18-year-old Fagiano Okayama midfielder Ryūnosuke Satō the youngest.

""Our main goal is to win the World Cup next year,"" Moriyasu said via a JFA interpreter.

""If we think about the goal, and the ultimate goal is to win the World Cup, we need to take each match, each time we prepare for the matches, seriously, step by step. We need to build the strongest team possible towards the World Cup.

""We have changed some players [for this window]. We have brought in new players for this time. I want to expand and strengthen the squad. So when I choose the [World Cup] squad, I can pick from the strongest possible squad that is available.""

A post shared by ESPN Asia (@espnasia)

This inexperience, however, won't lead to a change in approach by the veteran coach, who is preparing to lead Japan into a second World Cup.

""Australia have a very good team under [Tony] Popovic,"" he said. ""The way we are going to play, I won't be changing anything in terms of mindset. We play each game one by one. We take each game seriously.

""We need to prove that Japan still has a lot more talent coming through. I would like to show the world that we still have lots of players who are coming through. I would like my players to shine on the very best stage tomorrow.""

Moriyasu's ability to grow his depth in person, however, will only come, in the limited time he gets with players during international windows.

And with so many players desperate to find a way to break into his plans for 2026, he acknowledged that the best way to do so would be to seek out the highest level possible in clubland.

This was tempered, however, with the important clarification that Japan's J1 League -- widely regarded as the most-competitive top-to-bottom league in Asia -- provided a strong, and still improving, level of competition.

""I ask my players to play at a higher level, no matter where that is,"" Moriyasu explained. ""I tell my players that the standard is to play maybe in the top five European leagues or play in the Champions League.

""That is one way to shine on the national team level, and it may raise their chances [of selection] in the national team as well.

""But, on the other hand, I think the level of the J1 League has risen drastically over the years now. Maybe because players like Endo ... I think he raised the level of the game in Japan.

""Players like him have contributed to raising the level of Japanese football in total. And it's not only the players. The youth coaches and [coaches at a] grassroots level have risen as well. They deserve respect for raising the status of the Japanese football we have now.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

 Contributor. 

Brazil's team coach Carlo Ancelotti looks on during a training at Joaquim Grava training center on ... More June 02, 2025 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Carlo Ancelotti begins his tenure as coach of Brazil on the way to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

New Brazil national team manager Carlo Ancelotti can see his side confirm its spot at the FIFA 2026 World Cup this week. Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay and Colombia can also confirm their places at the tournament if results go their way. Meanwhile Argentina has already booked its place.

Colombia who currently sits in the sixth and final automatic qualifying spot in South America will likely need just three points from an available six to qualify this week. Whilst the other teams above them could easily qualify with just one or two points from the upcoming matches.

Vinicius Junior of Brazil celebrates after scoring the team's first goal during the CONMEBOL Copa ... More America 2024 Group D match between Paraguay and Brazil at Allegiant Stadium on June 28, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Qualification is coming, but for Carlo Ancelotti and the Brazil squad this is the least of their worries. One year out from the big tournament, Brazil shouldn't even have to contemplate qualification. By the standards of this nation, they should be building a team that can win this tournament.

With that in mind, Carlo Ancelotti better get moving. The new boss opens up with games against Ecuador and Paraguay, but his time on the training ground with the team will also be vital if he is to start coaching the team into his own style of play.

This international window will be too soon to judge the new manager, but heavy expectations will be waiting around the corner for Ancelotti, and come the September and October internationals Brazil fans will expect big improvements for their side after a recent humbling by Argentina.

Willian Pacho of Paris Saint Germain celebrates with the trophy after the UEFA Champions League ... More Final 2025 between Paris Saint-Germain and FC Internazionale Milano at Munich Football Arena on May 31, 2025 in Munich, Germany.

Ecuador sits second in the table and are the only team in qualification to have lost as few as two games. At the Qatar 2022 World Cup the team was unlucky to face the Netherlands and an in-form Senegal in the group stages but this sterling young squad has grown since then and will be aiming for the knock-out rounds next summer.

Days ago, PSG centre-back Willian Pacho became the first ever player from Ecuador to win the European Cup, and his international teammate Moisés Caicedo scored for Chelsea as he lifted the UEFA Conference League title. The future and the FIFA 2026 World Cup is looking bright for Ecuador who takes on Brazil and Peru in the next week.

Uruguay's Argentine head coach Marcelo Bielsa gestures during the 2026 FIFA World Cup South American ... More qualifiers football match between Uruguay and Argentina at the Centenario stadium in Montevideo, on March 21, 2025.

Uruguay has been relatively quiet and inconsistent during this campaign. Marcelo Bielsa's men have won just five games from 14 but those included famous victories at home to Brazil and away to Argentina. Like any Bielsa or Uruguay side however they are a fiercely competitive group of players and very difficult to beat.

Uruguay has a year to try and convince the country it can do something special at the World Cup, starting with games away to Paraguay and at home to Venezuela this week. Qualification now seems a formality but the team hasn't yet shown the conviction of a side that can compete for the biggest prize of all next summer.

ASUNCION, PARAGUAY - NOVEMBER 14: Omar Alderete of Paraguay celebrates after scoring the team's ... More second goal during the South American FIFA World Cup 2026 Qualifier match between Paraguay and Argentina at Estadio Defensores del Chaco on November 14, 2024 in Asuncion, Paraguay.

Paraguay has undoubtedly been the surprise package of this FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign, and on an eight match unbeaten streak it is also the most in-form team on the continent. It is quite remarkable that Paraguay seems a near-qualifier with four games of the league still to be played; very few would have predicted such.

This amazing campaign has been formed on few goals at either end. Paraguay has conceded nine and scored just 11 in 14 games, but that means seven clean sheets providing the base to go and get results from. Paraguay has only lost three matches. Paraguay are six points above Venezuela in the play-off position and faces Uruguay and Brazil in the next week.

Luis Diaz of Colombia during the international friendly match between Spain and Colombia at London ... More Stadium on March 22, 2024 in London, England.

Colombia currently occupies the final automatic qualifying spot for the FIFA 2026 World Cup in the South American league table. Luis Díaz and his teammates are five points ahead of Venezuela and will hope to extend that margin, or at least maintain it, by defeating Peru at home this week.

A win against Peru would make Colombia very difficult for Venezuela to catch as they also have a home fixture to come against Bolivia in September. Six points from the remaining 12 will almost definitely be enough to qualify as Venezuela won't take maximum points. After the Peru game Colombia travels to Argentina for a rematch of the Copa America final; another fine test of their credentials ahead of the 2026 tournament.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","soccer"

DAZN has built a global brand on soccer and boxing coverage, and it isn't pulling punches about using both to score points with soccer fans at the FIFA Club World Cup.

Even as Europe and more than 100 million viewers around the world recover from Paris Saint-Germain's win over Inter Milan in the UEFA Champions League final, FIFA and DAZN prepare to welcome 32 clubs from around the world to the United States for 63 matches at 12 venues from Saturday, June 14, until Sunday, July 13. All matches will be streamed on DAZN for free.

To set the tone, DAZN borrowed Hall of Fame boxing announcer Michael Buffer and Eric B. & Rakim's “Don't Sweat the Technique” to give the event its equivalent of a boxer's walkout. In a spot debuting today—less than two weeks ahead of the tournament—Manchester City's Erling Haaland, Bayern Munich's Harry Kane, Inter Miami's Luis Suárez, and Boca Juniors' Edinson Cavani all don boxing robes with fighter nicknames and make their way to the match.

  

Suarez even gets a mouthguard with a tribute to his home city of Salto in Uruguay written across it—for the safety of opposing players and boxers alike.

After a brief cameo by DAZN Italian broadcast host Diletta Leotta, Buffer asks the gathered crowd who will be the undisputed Club World Cup champion. DAZN and FIFA are hoping the free broadcasts will have fans of all sorts looking forward to the answer.

 “We're excited to partner with FIFA for this historical event, where throughout June and July and across the globe, fans will tune in on DAZN for the first time in history to see one club crowned the undisputed champion of the world,” said Pete Oliver, CEO of growth markets at DAZN.

Inter Milan has decided to part ways with Simone Inzaghi, who is close to joining Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal. The Nerazzurri are reportedly lining up for a replacement already, with Como's boss, Cesc Fabregas, being the main candidate now.

Just as it was being reported earlier, the former Lazio boss has decided not to continue his adventure with the Nerazzurri after meeting with the club's board on Tuesday. Both parties agreed to part ways following Inter's disappointing 5-0 loss to PSG in the UCL final.

According to reports from Fabrizio Romano and Italian media, Inzaghi won't be out of a job for long. He is reportedly close to joining Al Hilal, as a verbal agreement has been reached with only the signing missing.

Financially, the former striker will be getting a massive improvement as he is set to earn up to $26m per season. Inzaghi's contract with Al Hilal is initially set up until 202,7 and he will immediately lead them for the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup tournament.

As for the Nerazzurri, they are now gearing up for a new chapter after Inzaghi and are ready to completely change course. Reports suggest that they are eyeing younger coaches, with Cesc Fabregas as their main target for now.

Inter have asked Como for the opportunity to discuss a potential deal with Fabregas, but there's still no response from I Lariani. The former Arsenal midfielder recently vowed to remain at the Lombardy-based club, but the Nerazzurri's proposal might be interesting for him.

Aside from Fabregas, another name being mentioned is Marseille's Roberto De Zerbi, but he has also rejected any link with Inter. De Zerbi is currently happy with his role at Marseille, but things can always change quickly in football.

Nevertheless, changing from Inzaghi, who was continuing what Antonio Conte was building, to Fabregas might be a huge gamble for Inter. The Nerazzurri might need to make more changes in the players' department if the Como boss agrees to join the Champions League finalist this season.

AC Milan are reportedly close to getting the signature of Luka Modric, who is leaving Real Madrid after the Club World Cup tournament. However, the Rossoneri will be parting ways with Tijjani Reijnders as he is set to join Manchester City.

The Rossoneri are looking to add a bit more experience to their squad and are choosing the Croatian international as their target. Although Modric is not young anymore, Milan believes that his leadership and quality can still be useful for them next season.

The 2018 Ballon d'Or winner will end his chapter at Real Madrid after the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup tournament later this month. Los Blancos decided not to extend Modric's contract, allowing him to join other clubs this summer.

Despite being close to 40 years old, the Croatian international is still attracting several suitors, and Milan is one of them. Reports from Italy suggest that the Rossoneri plan to offer a one-year deal plus a one-year option for Modric.

Milan's new director, Igli Tare, has reportedly got a verbal agreement with the player with only a formal signature missing. The Red and Black squad are keen to close the deal soon, so they can avoid competitions from other clubs.

It's not all positive news, though, for the Rossoneri fans, as although they are close to snatching Modric, Massimiliano Allegri's side will be losing another star player. After selling Sandro Tonali in 2023, Milan are about to part ways with another midfielder, Tijjani Reijnders.

The Dutch international has become one of Man City's targets for the new season, and he is keen on joining Pep Guardiola's team. Milan's failure to qualify for the Champions League next season seems to be an important factor for Reijnders, aside from the chances to work with Guardiola.

According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano and various media outlets, the Rossoneri and City have agreed on a deal worth 7o million euros for the Dutchman.  Although Milan fans might be expecting more, considering Reijnders' excellent season, the player's wish to join the Citizens seems to smooth things up for Guardiola's side.

Losing Reijnders might be disappointing for the Rossoneri, but they are ready to look for replacements in the transfer market. Not only Modric, Milan also have other names they are targeting, with Torino's Samuele Ricci being one of them.

Jannik Sinner equalled his best Roland Garros result on Wednesday, when he ended Alexander Bublik's run to become the first Italian man in history to reach six major semi-finals.

The Italian raced out of the blocks to storm ahead on Court Philippe-Chatrier, then used his clean timing to redirect Bublik's power, sealing a 6-1, 7-5, 6-0 victory in one hour and 48 minutes. The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings has won his past 19 matches at majors, having lifted trophies at the US Open and the Australian Open.

""We played a couple times already, so you know a little bit what to expect,"" Sinner said. ""But in another way, with him, you never know what is happening. He deserved to be in the quarter-finals, he beat very tough opponents. I tried to stay focused from my side of the court and play as solid as possible as he can have some ups and downs. I am trying to serve very well in important moments, which I have done.""

Sinner soars through 🚀 He hurries past Bublik 6-1 7-5 6-0 to secure his spot in the SFs 🔥#rolandgarros #sinner pic.twitter.com/yeHvUcb7so

Chasing a maiden Roland Garros crown, Sinner will meet Novak Djokovic or Alexander Zverev in the semi-finals. The 23-year-old is level at 4-4 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Djokovic but trails Zverev 3-4.

Sinner, currently 17-1 on the season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, joins countryman Lorenzo Musetti in the last four. It is the first time in the Open Era two Italian men have reached the semi-finals of the same Grand Slam even. In 1960, Nicola Pietrangeli and Orlando Sirola advanced to last four in Paris.

""Against this kind of player, you have to be consistent because if you make a lot of mistakes, it is a game where if we both serve very well, there is already not so many rallies. I tried to get rhythm with the rallies,"" Sinner said on his win against Bublik. ""I am very happy and happy with how I arrived in the semi-finals. Semi-finals in Grand Slams are very special, so I am looking forward to it.""



Sinner, who on Monday began his 52nd consecutive week at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, lost in the semi-finals to Carlos Alcaraz last year in the French capital but has gone from strength to strength since.

The top-seeded Italian won five titles in the second half of last season, including the US Open and the Nitto ATP Finals. He started 2025 by triumphing at the Australian Open and then reached the final at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome. He is yet to drop a set this fortnight in the French capital.

Bublik was competing in the quarter-finals at a major for the first time, having produced a stunning performance to upset fifth seed Jack Draper in the quarter-finals. In his fifth meeting with Sinner, the 27-year-old showed signs of nerves in the first set and played passively, hitting six winners and committing eight unforced errors, with the Italian taking early control.

However, the Kazakhstani improved in the second set to cause Sinner issues. Bublik used the drop shot effectively to pull the Italian out of position and opened his shoulders to hit through the court. Sinner refused to waver, though, soaking up pressure from deep behind the baseline before he gained the crucial break of the set in the 11th game to pull further clear.

Sinner was too consistent in the third set, hitting with aggression and precise depth to take control of the baseline exchanges and improve to 4-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Bublik, who also defeated Top 10 star Alex de Minaur in the second round, leaves Paris up 19 spots at No. 43 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

For the second time in as many Grand Slam tournaments, Alexander Zverev will meet Novak Djokovic deep into the fortnight — this time in the Roland Garros quarter-finals.

After a close first-set tie-break in the Australian Open semi-finals, Djokovic sent the German through to the final by retiring with a muscle tear in his left leg. There are no injury concerns to speak of at Roland Garros, where Djokovic has cruised to the quarters without losing a set and Zverev has dropped just one.



Djokovic leads the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series 8-5, a record that includes a 1-1 split on clay. But they have not met on the surface since the 2019 Roland Garros semi-finals, when the Serbian won in straight sets.

""He was much better than me back then, I would say, especially at the Grand Slam level,"" recalled Zverev, who is now three spots above Djokovic in the PIF ATP Rankings at World No. 3.

""We played a lot of matches since then. We played at Grand Slams since then. We have had a lot of tough battles. I have had a lot of great wins against him. I have had a lot of tough losses against him. We have great history in our rivalry, I would say, but I'm looking forward to the match, and it's always a privilege to be on court with him.""

 

Both players have excelled on all surfaces throughout their careers, with clay not a particular strength or weakness for either. 

Zverev, whose game is built on his booming serve and his rock-solid backhand, figures to have the advantage in the longer rallies thanks to his youth. ""He's 10 years younger. He calls himself a veteran of the game. What should I call myself, then?"" Djokovic joked. But the Serbian has been dialled in with his all-around game and could succeed in moving the German around the expansive Court Philippe-Chatrier.

This man's humour 😂😂😂 we love it#novakdjokovic #rolandgarros

Roland Garros has been Zverev's most consistent Slam, with the returning finalist reaching at least the semi-finals in each of the past four years. Djokovic has won the tournament three times, most recently in 2023. The Serbian also won Olympic gold at the Paris venue last year, and enters the quarter-finals on a 21-match winning streak at the site. He withdrew ahead of last year's quarter-finals with a right-knee injury.

Despite suffering four first-round defeats in five events earlier this year, Djokovic has also reached the Miami ATP Masters 1000 final and won his 100th tour-level title in Geneva. When Zverev was asked if he considered his opponent an outsider in the Paris title hunt, the German was quick to set the record straight.

""Novak Djokovic will never be a [dark] horse,"" he said of the 24-time major champ. ""For me, Carlos is the favourite. I have said that before. Then I would say the next three in line are Jannik [Sinner], myself, and Novak, right? I still believe that. I still believe on tennis and on experience Novak is up there with us, no question about that at all.""

Zverev's path to the title could go through all three of those elite opponents. While Alcaraz is on the other side of the draw, Sinner could await in the semi-finals if the Italian beats surprise package Alexander Bublik.

 Sinner has been scintillating in his progress this fortnight, earning four dominant wins as he seeks his third consecutive Grand Slam crown. But the mercurial Bublik will have nothing to lose in his first Grand Slam quarter-final. The Kazakhstani has already knocked off two Top 10 players in Paris: Alex de Minaur and Jack Draper. 

His power and unpredictability could make for an uncomfortable outing for Sinner, who is bidding for his first Roland Garros title and his first major trophy outside of his favoured hard courts.

Sinner leads the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series 3-1, but this will be their first clash on clay. They have played twice on grass and twice on hard.

The order in which these eight tennis players will be structured in the top ranks of the ATP ranking still needs to be determined, but what is already clear is that there is no one with the chance to break into that club. The biggest beneficiary is Tommy Paul, who will make his debut in the top 8, achieving his personal best ranking. Jack Draper could also achieve that, as long as Musetti loses in the semifinals and Djokovic doesn't reach the final. The Italian will be in the top 5 if Novak loses in the quarters.

PARIS (AP) — Top-ranked Jannik Sinner's overpowering run through the French Open moved into the semifinals with a 6-1, 7-5, 6-0 victory over No. 62 Alexander Bublik on Wednesday.

Sinner, who lost to champion Carlos Alcaraz in the final four at Roland-Garros a year ago, needed just 1 hour, 49 minutes to advance against Bublik, who upset No. 5 Jack Draper in the previous round.

Not only hasn't Sinner ceded a set yet, he only has dropped a total of 36 games through five matches over the past 1 1/2 weeks.

And he played clean-as-can-be tennis against Bublik — who was making his major quarterfinal debut — with 31 winners to just 13 unforced errors.

Next for Sinner is a semifinal Friday against either 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic or No. 3 Alexander Zverev, the 2024 runner-up in Paris.

The other men's semifinal will be No. 2 Alcaraz against No. 8 Lorenzo Musetti. They won their quarterfinals Tuesday.

Sinner, 23, is a three-time Grand Slam champion. That includes last year's U.S. Open and this year's Australian Open, so his winning streak at majors is now at 19 matches.

He is the first man from Italy to reach six Slam semifinals.

Tennis

June 04, 2025

A little over two years ago, Emma Raducanu underwent three surgeries in just 10 days to fix issues in both wrists and one of her ankles.

The former US Open champion revealed at the time that she had been dealing with those injuries for 10 months, and after trying to manage the pain and “playing through it”, she ultimately had no choice but to go under the knife. 

Raducanu later told The Sunday Times the pain in her wrists had escalated after Wimbledon 2022. 

“I started with a new coach and I was really motivated to get going. We were overtraining, a lot of repetition, and I carried on even through pain because I didn't want to be perceived as weak,” she admitted. 

Caroline Garcia, a former world No 4, recently shared a lengthy post on social media about how the idea of playing through pain is drilled into an athlete's mindset from a young age and that they're “conditioned” to believe that competing while injured is “somehow honourable or necessary”. 

Garcia said she had been living on anti-inflammatories to manage shoulder pain and received corticoid injections and plasma treatments so she could keep competing. Two weeks ago, Garcia, 31, announced she will be retiring from tennis this season.

Welfare is increasingly under the spotlight with many top players airing complaints to the press about what they believe has become a gruelling and dangerous tour schedule.

“Probably they are going to kill us in some way,” said Carlos Alcaraz last September, while Iga Swiatek has been openly criticising the WTA since the tour increased the number of mandatory tournaments last season.

Such is the physical toll and grind of the tour that players are seldom 100 per cent when on court.

Knowing when to power through is a common dilemma for any professional athlete, and for tennis players, the pressure to keep going comes in many different forms, with some feeling as though they are forced to continue playing.

Those pressures might stem from an outdated coaching culture of playing through the pain barrier as Garcia suggested, but they also come from a ranking system Casper Ruud describes as a “rat race”, with potentially dire consequences for those unable to engage in the ceaseless pursuit or defence of points. 

On the ATP Tour, pressure may come from a bonus system that shows little mercy to the injured, but is in place to ensure fans get to watch the best possible players at the biggest tournaments.

Pressure also comes from sponsors, whose expectations will undoubtedly influence scheduling and vital equipment choices.

The net result is that many players – even those at the pinnacle of the sport – feel they lack the autonomy to take total control of their careers.

Raducanu told The National in Abu Dhabi last year that the pressure to keep playing before she eventually had her multiple surgeries came “from various sources”.

“I chased tournaments, I chased a bit too much points, and I think this year I'm just taking my time in between, really just not chasing tournament to tournament, running around,” she said. 

Still 22 and gaining experience on the WTA Tour, Raducanu confessed that taking full ownership of the major decisions affecting her career remains a work in progress. 

“I don't think it's something that even now I have really fully figured out,” she said at April's Madrid Open. “I think it's something that I have been dealing with the last few years, and not necessarily knowing what I should do and taking a lot of advice from other people, even though I may have felt differently in certain situations. 

“But I think I have started literally this tournament and Miami, just kind of listening to my intuition a bit better and I think every time I've followed my head and my gut has gone against it, it's been the wrong decision for me and the few times that I have kind of followed what I feel, it has been right. So, I think I'm learning those lessons as I go along.”

Tunisia's Ons Jabeur has wrestled with similar quandaries and finally decided to follow her gut when she pulled out of last year's US Open to repair her injured shoulder. She pulled the plug on her season in August and returned to action the following January. 

“That decision came very late because I was suffering with my shoulder a lot. I couldn't play. It was affecting my game. It was affecting my confidence. Yeah, pushing through injury, I've been doing that my whole life,” Jabeur told reporters at Roland Garros last week. 

“We have a lot of guilt inside us, saying we're not doing enough or it's not enough. 

“The pressure from sponsors, the pressure from the ranking, the pressure of providing, I don't know, some players provide for their families as well. It is a very tough sport, unfortunately. I'm learning. I'm 30 years old, but I'm still learning in that.”

Three-time major finalist Ruud had been managing a knee problem throughout the entire clay season before he suffered his earliest French Open exit since 2018, losing to Nuno Borges in the second round last week. 

The Norwegian described the tennis tour as a “rat race” and said the system in place that penalises players for missing mandatory events is “questionable”. 

“You feel you're obligated to play with certain rules that the ATP have set up with the mandatory events. You feel like you lose a lot if you don't show up and play, both economically, point-wise, ranking-wise and opportunity-wise,” said Ruud.

“For me, I know these weeks and months are really important for the remainder of the year and for my career.

“Of course, if my leg is broken, I won't play. But it's tough anyway, especially when there's a time with mandatory events to skip them because the punishments are quite hard, in terms of everyone else will play, gain points, and you won't. Also, there's a certain bonus system set up that is reduced if you don't show up to the mandatory events.”

Ruud is referring to the ATP tour's bonus pool compensation programme, which awards payments to the 30 players who earn the most ranking points at Masters 1000 events and the ATP Finals within a season. It is subject to the player fulfilling certain mandatory tournament participations. This year, a $21 million bonus pool will be distributed.

Every missed commitment could see a player's bonus compensation reduced by 25 per cent, which in some cases can be avoided by fulfilling on-site promotional activities. 

American Taylor Fritz said he once missed out on the bonus pool because he had a fractured foot and didn't play Madrid and Rome. “That's kind of ridiculous,” he said. 

An explainer video released by the ATP Tour states “this system ensures that top players show up consistently and that fans see the best players in the world compete against each other at ATP's biggest events, while also rewarding performance and participation throughout the season, not just at the majors.”

Ruud says it is unfair. “It's a questionable system. You're kind of forcing players to show up injured or sick, or whatever, when that is not what I think is very fair,” he said. 

Stefanos Tsitsipas echoed Ruud's sentiments. He says he once played the Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells and Miami while badly injured because he felt pressured to do so. 

Skipping mandatory tournaments doesn't just affect those vying for bonus pool compensation. It can affect a player's ranking, which comprises the points accumulated from a certain number of events from specific categories. Missing one of those events could result in a fine (which can be appealed), as well as having a zero-pointer in your ranking. 

“As much as we have to adjust to the schedule of what we're doing and try to comply with all these tournaments and all these mandatory things that we need to attend and do, I feel like there are a few things that leave us not very flexible, such as contracts, such as tournament appearances,” said Tsitsipas. 

It is also common for contracts with sponsors to include tournament appearance clauses, which adds a layer to the decision-making process. 

Former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu lost the majority of her sponsors because injuries prevented her from competing regularly on tour. 

“With certain sponsors, you have to play a certain number of tournaments,” said Andreescu. “And yeah, that can be difficult for sure. 

“Because I'm sure we all want to play day in and day out. But for me, for instance, I haven't had that. So, it did come to the cost of losing sponsors. I lost almost every one of my sponsors because of that.”

Andreescu recalls an incident she faced with a sponsor when she had a knee injury in 2020. “There was one issue with one sponsor, that if I didn't do a commercial on this specific day, they would have wiped out my contract,” she said. “And so, I was like, ‘Hey, can you compromise a little bit here?' I didn't do it. They said, ‘OK, that's fine. We'll do it another time'. And then, bam! I didn't have that contract.”

Jabeur feels contracts for female athletes can be particularly tricky and can affect major decisions, like taking time away from the sport to have a baby. 

“I feel we should do better with women's contracts. Because if a woman is injured or wants to get pregnant, they don't get paid. I've seen that in so many contracts, we don't see that in male contracts,” the three-time major finalist said. 

“It's a bit weird. It's 2025, and we're still wrestling with that. Hopefully, that can be fixed. They should see a woman as she is, as an ambassador, as a great woman, representing herself, her country, them, but not when she wants to become a mum and they drop everything.”

Tennis players are considered independent contractors, which theoretically affords them freedoms that other athletes, who play for teams or clubs and are part of a league, don't necessarily have. 

But it's not always that simple. A player recently told The National they wanted to change their racquet but weren't sure how they would get out of their current contract with a specific manufacturer. 

They tried, and failed, to get their sponsor to tinker with their racquet and ended up testing another brand that suited them better. They have yet to figure out a way to make the switch without risking a heavy penalty. 

Tsitsipas faced a similar issue and suddenly began playing on tour with a blacked-out Babolat racquet while still under contract with Wilson. 

Many players have a psychological barrier when it comes to changing their racquet, even if a switch will help them unlock parts of their game they haven't been able to with their existing set-up. 

“It's not an easy decision,” Tsitsipas said last month in Madrid. 

“It requires ferocity and being a really big risk-taker because you are used to a certain thing for so long and you don't know what's out there. And it can be a tricky thing, especially during the middle of the season, the beginning of the season. These things need to happen before the season starts.”

Ahead of the start of this season, Madison Keys switched to Yonex when her contract with Wilson ended – a move that was heavily encouraged by her husband and coach Bjorn Fratangelo. It paid dividends immediately as she claimed a maiden grand slam title in Australia in January. 

Keys, 30, said that getting to make her own decisions was not easy at the start of her career, and it wasn't until she started working with former world No 1 Lindsay Davenport that she realised how important it was to take ownership. 

“She really pushed me to start making my own decisions, kind of setting my own schedule and not being afraid of getting a fine or taking a zero somewhere if I didn't want to go to a tournament,” explained Keys. 

“She really emphasised that if you want to be around for a long time and you want the longevity of your career, you need to be happy, you need to be doing what you want to do. So I think that was kind of slowly when I started making some of my own decisions.”

Former world No 1 Andy Murray, who retired last year, does not believe players are forced to do anything – a realisation that came to him later on in his career. 

“I never made decisions based on bonus pool, but it would be more about, ‘I would get a zero-pointer or it might affect my ranking,' [then it] might have been something I would have considered,” he said. 

“But then, as I got older and when I reflect on that and what I've said to some coaches that work with younger players and stuff, I said, you don't have to play those events. Everyone says the schedule is very long, which it is; it's definitely a long season, and now with the two-week events, it's quite demanding, but you also always have the choice not to play. 

“It's like yes, you might get a zero-pointer, you might lose a few ranking points, or not be part of a bonus pool. But that's a decision, you're saying I don't want to play because … or I'm making a decision to play because it's better for me financially.”

Murray says the same goes for entering contracts with racquet manufacturers.

“That's a decision you don't need to take,” said the Scot. “You cannot sign a contract and get paid and choose to play with whichever racquet manufacturer you want as well. So I don't necessarily think there's pressure on the player in that respect.”

ROLAND GARROS, PARIS — It is the sort of fairytale run that French tennis officials dream about.

All the host nation's players, men and women, are usually long gone by this stage of their Grand Slam tournament. But Loïs Boisson, arguably the unlikeliest last one standing of the 27 players representing France who locked into the French Open starting gate a week ago Sunday, took to the red clay of Roland Garros Wednesday alongside the best in the world, for the quarterfinals.

Advertisement

In beating the world No. 3, Jessica Pegula, Boisson became the first French man or woman to reach the last eight here since 2017. She did it on a packed-to-the-gunwales Court Philippe-Chatrier, in front of a crowd of 15,000 screaming at every Boisson winner and every Pegula error as only a hometown crowd losing its mind during a borderline-inconceivable upset can do.

Against Pegula, the crowd had been sparse early on, as it often is at the beginning of the day, when the women's matches tend to be scheduled. Those late-arriving Parisians who take their time over lunch normally settle into the stadium in time for the second contest of the day. But by the middle of the second set, when Pegula began to falter and Boisson started her charge, numbing the American with a seductive mix of spins and deep, looping balls before a shock of power across the net, the French had found their new hero — and their voice.

At the end, during those nervy last four games when Boisson scrambled Pegula's brain for the final time, there might not have been a soul across Roland Garros, either in the stadium itself or the plazas outside it, who wasn't all in on this woman who had played just one top-tier WTA Tour match ahead of this tournament.

“In the beginning, even though there weren't many, you can still hear them on center court,” Boisson said with a combination of shyness and emotional exhaustion during her post-match news conference.

“But for the third set, it was full. It was incredible. As soon as a point was tight, it would be really incredible.”

When the time came to play Mirra Andreeva, the 18-year-old Russian who is basically a Grand Slam veteran these days, the stadium was closer to full from almost the beginning. It was quiet to begin, as Andreeva's singeing backhand down the line and court coverage kept Boisson's weaponry at bay. But late in a first set that looked lost, Boisson started to find the patterns that had taken her past Pegula.

Camping in her backhand corner, Boisson can hit inside-out forehands that rise and dip all day. But what's more important is her ability to lace them down the line, keeping her opponent honest in those diagonal exchanges. She burned Andreeva again and again and again as the set wore on, dragging the Russian into a tiebreak and stealing it away to win the first set.

The world No. 361, Boisson was only playing in this tournament thanks to the generosity and desperation of France's tennis federation. The country had just two players in the WTA top 100 in early May, but as the owner and organizer of this event, the federation was able to award wild-card entries to seven other Frenchwomen.

Boisson, who hails from Dijon, 200 miles southeast of Paris in Burgundy, is just four months into a comeback from surgery to repair an ACL knee ligament tear. She was world No. 513 then, before winning 16 of 21 lower-tier matches in the run-up to Roland Garros. When her injury happened, she was supposed to be preparing for her French Open debut, having received a wild card on the back of winning four tournaments in the first four months of 2024 and 31 matches of 38 played.

She has paid back France's tennis federation, the FFT, in spades, becoming the story of the tournament. Even in a week that Paris Saint-Germain became kings of European soccer, Boisson has landed on the cover of the dailies and at the top end of news programs. She is the most famous French sportswoman, if only for a fortnight.

And the only place in the country that she hasn't been given true, top billing is the tournament at which she is the star.

Thanks to Boisson and Pegula's exploits, two women again delivered what the leaders of this tournament — Gilles Moretton, the president of the FFT, and Amelie Mauresmo, the former world No. 1 and French Open tournament director — said they most likely could not: roughly two-and-a-half hours of scintillating competition worthy of the biggest stage at the event.

In the round of 16, Iga Świątek, the four-time Roland Garros champion, and Elena Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon winner, went the distance in a match that saw Swiatek rise from a coffin of red clay to outlast one of her staunchest rivals. On Saturday, Boisson and her compatriot, Elsa Jacquemot, another French wild card, had wowed a packed stadium on Court Simonne-Mathieu.

The triptych of banner matches for women's tennis followed a week of Moretton and Mauresmo insisting that putting a women's match in the Philippe-Chatrier night session would be bad for spectators. It would risk, they said, not giving fans the sort of entertainment for which they had plunked down hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of euros.

On the second day of the tournament, Moretton had said that organizers base the night-session assignment on what is “better for sport”, adding that the people who make the schedule “have to think about what could be better for spectators.”

Five days later, Mauresmo insisted that the issue wasn't about women's matches not being “worthy to play at night” but about their length. She looks at the sold-out Chatrier after sunset and wonders what all the fuss is about. People love the product on offer. ‘What's the problem?'

Several of the most prominent women in the tournament have had serious issues with Mauresmo's and Moretton's interpretation of what would be “better for spectators.”

“I do think that women's matches are worthy of a night spot,” said Gauff, who often plays then at the U.S. Open in front of 24,000 people at Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Ons Jabeur, the three-time major finalist who has been sidelined by injuries for much of the past year, targeted organizers after her first-round loss. “I hope whoever is making the decision, I don't think they have daughters, because I don't think they want to treat their daughters like this,” she said in a news conference Tuesday.

Jabeur also wrote on social media: “A lot of amazing athletes have been told the same things over and over. That no one watches. That no one cares. That women's sport doesn't ‘move people.' Judgment comes quickly, often from those who've never even watched a full match. One empty stadium is held up as proof. The packed ones? Conveniently ignored.”

Madison Keys, the reigning Australian Open champion, lost to Gauff in the quarterfinal before Boisson and Andreeva took the court, was characteristically understated but no less pointed in her criticism.

“I think women typically have night matches everywhere else,” said Keys, whose final four matches in Melbourne, against Elina Svitolina, Rybakina, Świątek and Aryna Sabalenka, the world No. 1, were four of the most riveting duels in the sport this year. “I think women's matches are very entertaining and they have great value, and they deserve to be the feature match.”

Swiatek was matter-of-fact in saying that “they should be equal”.

The matches that have made the cut for primetime have only strengthened the words of Gauff, Jabeur, Keys, Świątek and Pegula, who compared talking about the issue every year to “hitting her head against the wall.”

In more than half of the night sessions in 2025, patrons have witnessed lopsided wins from the top men that didn't last as long as those missed opportunities to feature the women. Jannik Sinner (twice), Novak Djokovic and Holger Rune all dispatched their opponents in just over two hours, with the outcome of the match all but certain long before the conclusion. Carlos Alcaraz needed 94 minutes of thunderclap tennis to overwhelm an injured Tommy Paul.

Last year offered much of the same. Richard Gasquet, a French favorite-son now ranked No. 124, and countryman Pierre-Hugues Herbert, a wild card doubles specialist, were deemed worthy of the bright lights in their mismatches against Sinner and Djokovic. No women made the cut.

And so it was for Boisson as she took on Andreeva, the brightest of new lights in the women's top 10. Andreeva won two WTA 1,000s in a row earlier this year, the level just below the Grand Slams. No other player, man or woman, has accomplished that this season. Andreeva looked like that player in the second set, moving up 3-0 with a combination of quality and mental strength.

But the intriguing relationship between youth and experience at the heart of this match had not fully blossomed. Boisson is four years Andreeva's senior, but this is her first Grand Slam main draw. Andreeva is a French Open semifinalist, but she had never played a player with home advantage deep in a major. The crowd was doing everything it could to disrupt the flow of the match and turn it in Boisson's favor, and Andreeva, slowly and then all at once, looked like the player who had never been there before.

With Boisson serving down 3-2, Andreeva gestured up at her box as if telling someone to leave. At 3-3, Andreeva missed a volley on top of the net and rocketed a ball into the top tier of Court Philippe-Chatrier. The boos that erupted sucked in every last bit of air in the stadium. When Andreeva double-faulted to give Boisson the break, the match felt like it was over, and so it was. Boisson streaked her back with the red clay, celebrating the most unlikely 7-6(6), 6-3 win and semifinal berth in a match that lasted 128 minutes, 34 more than Alcaraz's beatdown of Paul.

The tournament can point to tangible reasons on this occasion. Andreeva's presence in the women's doubles event means she has to play earlier because she has another match later in the day. The women's semifinals are the day after their quarterfinal, so playing earlier gives them more time to rest. But that is a necessity because the women's semifinals are played as a one-day session, straight through from 3 p.m. The men's semis are split across two sessions: 3 p.m. and “not before” 7 p.m. A similar arrangement for the women's matches would have permitted a later slot for one of their quarterfinals.

The tournament put Boisson and Andreeva in the second Philippe-Chatrier slot for their quarterfinal, by which time the stadium was close to capacity for a tussle between two players who rely on guile, variety and the ability to conjure a bullet groundstroke among the magic at any given moment.

Boisson, a seemingly cool cat who walked onto Chatrier for her morning hit on Monday with a sense of awe and determination, was ready for the challenge.

“I told myself, ‘OK, I will play matches on this court, but it's OK. It's a court, like every court.'” She might have to get more used to it, too. Having started the event at No. 361 in the world, she will end it inside the top 60. That makes her the number one women's tennis player in France.

She will get another chance to tell herself things are OK Thursday, against Coco Gauff, the world No. 2. Just not at night.

Jannik Sinner eased into the last four, Lois Boisson's unlikely run continued and Coco Gauff overcame Madison Keys in an edgy contest

That's it from us for today, though, many thanks for your company. We'll be back for those semi-finals tomorrow – and we'll have a report on the site on Sinner's win and Zverev v Djokovic. A demain!

Still no order of play for tomorrow's women's semi-finals, with Lois Boisson, the story of the tournament, taking on Gauff, and Swiatek and Sabalenka facing off in part XIII. I guess organisers are debating whether they'd rather have a guaranteed full crowd for Boisson if they put her on first, which would be at 3pm Paris time/2pm UK, or whether they'd rather have her in a potentially more TV-friendly early evening slot.

If you want to catch up on today:

Breaking down Sinner's run: round one vs Rinderknech conceded 12 games, round two vs Gasquet seven games, round three vs Lehecka three games, round four vs Rublev eight games, quarter-final vs Bublik six games. It's staggering when you consider he didn't even play tennis for three months up until a few weeks ago.

With Sinner in this form – he's on a 19-match winning streak in grand slams, it's like early Roger Federer, before Rafa rocked the boat – I think he'll have too much for Zverev or Djokovic. But Alcaraz, most likely, in the final is too tough to call. Sinner blazed a path to the Italian Open final last month, his first event back from his ban, before running into Alcaraz, who beat him in straight sets.

“He can have some ups and downs,” says Sinner, making something of an understatement. “So I tried to stay very consistent, which I've done. It was a good performance from my side, as things were very windy and breezy. I'm very happy. Against these types of players you have to be very consistent. I'll maybe watch a bit [of the quarter-final later], but I'll try to switch off too. It's going to be a great match [the semi-final], hopefully I'll be ready. The fans want a high-quality match, we'll try to make it happen.”

Way too good 👊#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/VteL8EU4Mi

15-0, 30-0 and – you know the drill – 40-0 and game, set and match with another seemingly effortless winner. Bublik is grinning; he's had fun despite the defeat and third-set rout. For Sinner, it's a second consecutive French Open semi-final, where he'll face either Alexander Zverev or Novak Djokovic, who play this evening.

Sinner breaks: Sinner* 6-1, 7-5, 5-0 Bublik (*denotes next server)It's been entertaining, and he'll always have those wins over Jack Draper and Alex De Minaur, but Bublik's run in Paris is about to end, as Sinner, from 40-30 down on Bublik's serve, skips through the next three points with his usual efficiency. The world No 1 will serve for a place in the semi-finals. And Bublik almost congratulates Sinner at the changeover; he's already accepted his fate.

Third set: Sinner 6-1, 7-5, 4-0 Bublik* (*denotes next server)It's remarkable given how little tennis Sinner had under his belt coming into Roland Garros, after that three-month doping ban, how at ease he's been this fortnight. Close out this set and it'll be a fifth consecutive win in straight sets. From 40-15, Sinner does the business with an easy putaway at the net, and Bublik needs a miracle, or at least to summon several of his trademark jaw-dropping winners, to inconvenience the Italian winning machine for much longer.

Sinner breaks: Sinner* 6-1, 7-5, 3-0 Bublik (*denotes next server)0-15, 0-30, 0-40, as Bublik misdirects a backhand volley. Bublik is shaking his head; the crowd are almost silent. But Bublik does better at the net on the next point, putting away a winner. And from 0-40, he gets back to deuce! A lovely pick-up from Bublik at the net … Sinner lobs … but it's long! Bublik has a game point, which may do little more at this stage than prevent a third-set whitewash, but he doesn't capitalise. Deuce. Advantage Sinner. Deuce. Advantage Bublik. Deuce. Advantage Bublik. He allows himself a little smile, while also wincing at the pain Sinner is putting him through. Deuce. Advantage Sinner. Game set and match Sinner after yet more clean, consistent and clinical ball striking.

Third set: Sinner 6-1, 7-5, 2-0 Bublik* (*denotes next server)Bublik said he hated the sport “with all my heart” back in 2020. The enigmatic Kazakh is Kyrgios-like when it comes to his wavering focus, combustible temperament and his natural but unfulfilled talent. He's gesticulating at 40-15; he really can't catch a break at the moment. And Sinner swiftly holds.

Sinner breaks: Sinner* 6-1, 7-5, 1-0 Bublik (*denotes next server)Alas, as so often happens in tennis, Bublik, having pushed so hard in that second set, quickly surrenders at the start of the next. Sinner surges to 15-40, two break points. And that's the break, when Bublik can't dig a volley out from his feet.

Thanks Daniel. It's hard to see a way back for Bublik from here, as hard as seeing a French wildcard ranked 361 in the world on their grand slam debut making … er wait … OK, it's not impossible, but highly implausible. Bublik could probably do with a restorative mid-match Hangover-style trip to Vegas, which is what he did to reignite his career when he felt like jacking it all in during the spring, but instead he'll have to make do with a quick drink and rub of his towel.

*Sinner 6-1 7-5 Bublik As we said earlier, it's close until it isn't; offer someone like Sinner a finger, he'll take your whole hand. He serves out to love and it's a long way back for Bublik from here. As for me, I'm off to see Tina Knowles; here's Katy to croon you through the rest of this match,

Sinner 6-1 6-5 Bublik* A terrific backhand return, on the stretch, gives Sinner 0-15, then another sets up a forehand winner down the line for 15-30. I fear I can see where this is going and, shonuff, he gets low to carve a forehand winner that raises two break points. Bublik, though, has put so much into this set and he's not keen that it be for nothing, a fine point ended with two massive forehands to the corner. And I hate to say it, but you can probably guess what happens next: a double fault that hands over the break and that's the difference between good players and the best. Sinner will now serve for a two-set lead.

*Sinner 6-1 5-5 Bublik Serving to stay in the set, Sinner finds himself passed by a backhand winner, lazily annihilated cross-court; a netted return restores parity. And from there, the game disappears, Sinner making 5-5, but this is an even contest and if Bublik could nab the set, we'd really be talking.

Sinner 6-1 4-5 Bublik* Bublik has lovely hands, another cunning drop making 30-0 and an ace behind it raising three game points. And, though Sinner makes 15, a further ace secures the hold, and this is getting interesting.

*Sinner 6-1 4-4 Bublik OK, Bublik makes 15-30 … then goes long on the return before being wrong-footed by a forehand. The Kazakh, though, fancies the task, a disguised drop bringing us to deuce … so Sinner closes out in short order. He's not playing as well, though, and Bublik is serving better while making more of an impression on the return.

Sinner 6-1 3-4 Bublik* At 30-all, Bublik marches in only to put an inside-out forehand just wide … then lets go a decent drop, cleaning up at the net for deuce. From there, though, he coaxes a gorgeous forehand winner down the line for advantage before opening the court, hitting towards – but not to – the corner, allowing the putaway for a conclusive hold. It's hard to see him breaking, but in a breaker his serve and one-shot kill power would make him a live dog.

*Sinner 6-1 3-3 Bublik Er, no. His only hope really is to do what Wawrinka did in winning his three major finals against Djokovic and Nadal, just going for everything. He's not going to outlast Sinner from the back, but he does have big shots and a fine eye; the world no 1 holds easily once more.

Sinner 6-1 2-3 Bublik* Up 40-0, Bublik tosses in a well-timed double, then redeems it with an ace. This is much more enjoyable now, the Kazakh, in his first grand slam quarter, playing like he belongs. But can he get something going on the Sinner serve?

*Sinner 6-1 2-2 Bublik On Lenglen,Sander Arends and Luke Johnson have levelled at a set apiece in their men's doubles quarter against Huge Nys and Edouard Roger-Vasselin; I note this because Luke is, like Henry Patten – the Wimbledon and Aussie Open champ – coached by Calvin Betton, our resident expert. Sinner holds to 15, and he's so solid he should have his own MC pseudonym.

Sinner 6-1 1-2 Bublik* At 15-all Bublik strays long but having opened the channel for the pass down the line, Sinner nets and we move to 30s. From there, a service-winner down the T underlines the underdog's improvement … then a double reminds us of his nature. No matter, he holds again, and this is now a contest (until it isn't).

*Sinner 6-1 1-1 Bublik Bublik is, I guess, an example of just how much the very best sportsfolk are defined by their mentality. It's easy for the likes of us to say if we were blessed with talent, we'd give everything while staying calm under pressure, but actually doing that is almost impossible. Sinner holds easily and the match might just have settled into a pattern.

Sinner 6-1 1-0 Bublik* Bublik might just've settled. He holds to 15 and, in comms, Mac – told his coach is behind his decision to put effort in – chuckles at the apparently revelatory nature of this advice. At 27, he's still got time to explore its full extent.

*Sinner 6-1 Bublik Is Bublik growing into it? more so than his neck-beard, I guess and, as I type, Sinner overhits a forehand at 30-all; the comeback is on. And soon, the world no 1 is break point down, a big serve averting immediate danger, likewise one to the body. Then, when up advantage himself, he's passed by Bublik's backhand … but closes out thereafter. Sinner leads by a set and it's impossible to even conceive of a way in which he loses this.

Sinner 5-1 Bublik* Sinner makes 0-30 and Bublik, your streaky and occasional wonder-shot feel-merchant just cant cope ; understandably so. he's good enough to beat almost everyone when playing well, but the best are impervious to purple patches from his ilk. Still, a big serve digs him out of a set point at 30-40, then on advantage, Sinner overhits a putaway, and Bublik salutes the crowd upon winning his first game. The world no 1 will have to serve for the first set.

*Sinner 5-0 Bublik Better from Bublik, who stops in a long rally, playing four or five superb shots to win one point when he guess correctly and blocks back a pick-up into space; 015. From there, we wind up at deuce and this is better from the underdog – for all the good it does him. A service winner, an ace, and that's 5-0. The problem Bublik – and everyone else – has is that Sinner and Alcaraz ares streets ahead and going away. Only Jack Draper is improving in any kind of meaningful way and he's still a way off, especially on the red stuff.

Sinner 4-0 Bublik* At 15-30, Bublik telegraphs a drop, it sits up, and Sinner lanks in to stick it away. He's so comfy out there, and though i'm not sure his best level is the best around, his modal level is stratospheric and he quickly swats a backhand pass down the line for the double break. This could be over very quickly.

Greetings all. My internet decided to forsake me, but we're back now and Sinner is already a break to the good at 3-0.

The crowd really did blow the roof off. It's open as Jannik Sinner and Alexander Bublik take to the court. Daniel is back to take you through this – though I'll be back for some more later …

Stat attack. Boisson had won just one match on the WTA Tour before this tournament. Her ranking will jump from 361 to around 65 after this win. She's gone from a wildcard to a French No 1 in less than a fortnight. And she's into the semi-finals after beating three seeds, including two in the top 10.

Next up for Boisson: Coco Gauff. If Gauff is as error-strewn as she was today against Keys, Boisson really has a chance of taking one of the craziest stories in tennis history all the way to Saturday's final. Yes, Andreeva fell apart in the eye of a Parisian storm, but the way Boisson was able to hold her nerve, and do what so many French players have struggled to do in front of a demanding home crowd, suggests she will be very much up for the challenge of facing the world No 2. I don't think Gauff will let the crowd get to her in the way Andreeva did though.

Boisson, with a look a total disbelief, speaks:

It was amazing to feel supported like this. There are no words to describe that feeling. Whatever the situation for me last year, it's unbelievable to come from there. Thanks to all my team. I was so tense, I fought hard, the first set was very intense and at the beginning of the second set I was very tired. But I was able to recover.

She then talks about how she'll recover for tomorrow's semi-final, and talks of having six physios. Six?! Maybe a money-spinning Dove collab is happening.

Andreeva appears as if she wants to be put out of her misery. 0-15. 0-30. 0-40. Points that Andreeva lost more than Boisson won. 15,000 fans in Chatrier are once again losing their minds. And they're blowing the roof off when Boisson's strong strike draws the error! Boisson is on her back on the clay; she can't believe it. The French world No 361 wildcard is improbably into the semi-finals, having never even played a grand slam before!

Second set: Andreeva* 6-7, 3-5 Boisson (*denotes next server)Andreeva is usually able to problem solve so well on court, thinking on her feet, putting the pieces of the puzzle together, coming up with plan A, B, C, D and even E if needed. But having to fight against 15,000 French fans, she can't think straight. The magnitude of the moment, however, is starting to affect Boisson. She's shaking at 15-30, even more so at 30-40 … a long rally plays out, Boisson suddenly ups the ante with an injection of pace and Andreeva nets! A second break point for Andreeva at her advantage. Boisson holds her nerve once more. And Boisson backs up the break with her fifth straight game when Andreeva's meek drop shot is nowhere near to clearing the net!

Boisson breaks: Andreeva 6-7, 3-4 Boisson* (*denotes next server)Andreeva's mind is gone when she whacks a ball into row Z after falling 0-30 down. The teenager receives a code violation. She's then dicing with death with a couple of shots that just graze the line, but no, Boisson stops the point, the umpire checks the mark, and the ball was out! Andreeva's arguing, but it's in vain. 0-40. Which in Andreeva's current state of mind may as well be match points. Boisson breaks on the second! Her latest French revolution is almost complete! If she can hold her nerve …

Second set: Andreeva* 6-7, 3-3 Boisson (*denotes next server)With Boisson serving at 30-15, Martinez is absolutely screaming at Andreeva to “TAKE THE BALL EARLY”. Andreeva isn't too impressed, and appears to ask her to leave. Martinez doesn't listen and is still barking instructions to her charge when the game goes to deuce. It does the trick, though, because here's a break point! Boisson saves it with a sliding serve out wide. Boisson puffs out her cheeks; she perhaps looks a little tired. But still calm, unlike Andreeva, who can't believe it when Boisson takes the next two points to hold!

Boisson breaks: Andreeva 6-7, 3-2 Boisson* (*denotes next server)Andreeva is furious with herself, slapping her thighs, as Boisson holds to 30. She doesn't look as if she's shaken off that frustration, when she opens up her service game with an eighth double fault. The umpire pleads with the partisan Parisians to be quiet during Andreeva's service action. But Andreeva is still shaky, and her feet aren't quite moving quickly enough, as she drops 15-40 behind. The first break point is saved, but Boisson blasts a backhand winner down the line on the second! This jerking drama has another sudden twist!

Second set: Andreeva 6-7, 3-0 Boisson* (*denotes next server)Boisson taking that first set means the wildcard has remarkably won three consecutive sets against top-six players on her grand slam debut. Her ranking of 361 is slightly misleading, though, given she had an extended period out with an ACL injury, which she suffered just before Roland Garros last year; she couldn't even face watching the tournament from home, so upset she was at not being able to take the wildcard she'd been offered. Wonder what she'd have said back then if someone had told her she'd be where she is now. But she looks as if she believes she belongs out there, pushing Andreeva to deuce, but the Russian shakes her off on the next two points to hold. Andreeva is in the ascendancy.

Andreeva breaks: Andreeva* 6-7, 2-0 Boisson (*denotes next server)A wonderful game of cat and mouse at 30-all on Boisson's serve, and Andreeva pings a winning lob. 30-40, break point. Andreeva sorely needs this. And she gets it with a deep strike to Boisson's backhand, which isn't coming back into play. After all the tension and tumult of that first-set finale, the atmosphere has calmed and Andreeva is working her way back into this.

Second set: Andreeva 6-7, 1-0 Boisson* (*denotes next server)This is a wonderful, improbable story for Boisson – who knows it could be turning into a Raducanu at the 2021 US Open one – but I do feel for the 18-year-old Andreeva right now, fighting against the crowd. Her seventh double fault hands Boisson a break point in the opening game of the second set. And so many of her doubles have come at crucial moments. She does, at least, find the strength to resist the double fault before taking the next two points for a much-needed hold.

… and Andreeva can probably barely hear the encouragement of her coach Conchita Martinez to “keep going” over the screams of the crowd. Now it's Boisson with set point at 7-6 … and Andreeva hoiks wide! Sacre bleu! Boisson has the first set, having been 5-3 and set point down. The Parisian patrons are chanting “LOIS, LOIS, LOIS, LOIS, LOIS, LOIS”. I'm surprised they can breathe.

… make that 4-3, and a ripper of an inside-out forehand gets her to 5-3! She's hit 15 winners off that wing already. But Andreeva wrests back the mini-break and takes the two points on her serve, and suddenly it's the Russian with a set point at 6-5 … about 30 minutes after her first. Boisson is serving .. and Andreeva prods out! It's 6-6 as they again change ends …","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

⬆️ A look at Sinner's new return stance, how it begins and when he moves forward before the server makes contact. ⬆️PARIS—Tennis players are always on the hunt for ways to improve, from changing technique, bringing on new team members or trying out tactical adjustments. Experimenting with leaving their comfort zone, for all intents and purposes. Even if you are world No. 1.At this year's Roland Garros, Jannik Sinner has presented opponents with a different look across the net. Bringing an altered return position, which begins with a noticeably closed stance and then using his front foot as a driving force, has clearly paid off thus far, as the Italian is yet to drop a set through four matches.

Sinner has taken 47 percent of his return points and converted 58 percent of his break points, the latter leading the men's quarterfinalists heading into Wednesday.“Parallels wise, I think there's a bit of [Kei] Nishikori in there,” World Feed commentator Nick Lester assessed with TENNIS.com. “I think what they're trying to do, is get the momentum and the hips round to meet the ball earlier. As he returns, his weight is going into the court a bit more.“Proof of the pudding is in the eating, right? It's been pretty successful so far.”

Wherever the ball goes, they just turn the outside foot and then go.“If you take a step and do the split step, which most people do, and sometimes go, you can put a foot back and lose time.”

As it is written, Wednesday is mailbag day …

I don't know how much people paid for their night session tickets, but I certainly would have felt [cheated] to have paid for a less-than-fascinating match between [Jannik] Sinner & [Andrey] Rublev. Meanwhile, there were [four] competitive women's matches played during the day including the surprise upset of [Jessica] Pegula by a French woman, [Loïs] Boisson. That would have been a great night match.

Is there a reason not to schedule two women's matches for a night session? I get that there is a risk of a late night if the day session runs long and both women's matches are three sets. But, it seems [tournament director Amélie] Mauresmo et al are simply afraid to take a chance that the French crowd might be displeased. 

Barbara Lexington, MA

• I was going to write more about this at the end of the event, but we had so many questions this week about the absence of women … some quick thoughts:

1) For all the injustices and inequalities in tennis, I'm not sure the imbalance of women playing night matches—in a strange, sometimes charm-deprived, often rhythm-disrupting session—tops the list. But you can't have night sessions that feature only men, as was the case this year. And Ons Jabeur raised the best point: The lack of exposure is not just an insult; it is self-perpetuating. Tell fans that women's tennis is (literally) unworthy of prime time at a major, and is it a surprise that women's matches throughout the year are not as prioritized (or attended or televised) throughout the year? The message this scheduling sends is corrosive. The message this scheduling sends is untenable.

2) Yes, women's matches tend to be shorter than men's. Yes, you run the risk of a 57-minute blowout that might make ticket holders feel shortchanged. And there's a really easy solution. Hold two women's matches. Or hold a women's match followed by a doubles match.

3) What's that? Amazon, the television network for the night session, demands only men's night session matches? Tell them, you are a television partner and partners help each other out and operate as a good faith relationship. This has created a PR crisis that needs addressing, even if that means amending a contract.

4) As I write this, Alexander Zverev just won his fourth round match in 52 minutes, with his opponent, Tallon Griekspoor, retiring with an injury. It is midafternoon, but this could easily have been a night match. Are you not tempting fate by staging only one match, men's or women's?

5) Mauresmo—known as something of a progressive blazer of trails in her playing days—either believes the men's only night matches is acceptable policy, or she has been trotted out as the front-facing figure to take the slings and arrows. In either case, this is a profound pity.

6) For all the challenges that bedevil tennis, this one seems exceedingly solvable. Put on additional matches, including doubles. In a worst-case scenario, put on women's matches and hope you get Boisson-Pegula, not a match ending in less than an hour. But this is the only major that faces this annual controversy. It must change.

Novak Djokovic's path to the second week at RG:R1: McDonald (98) R2: Moutet  (73) R3: Misolic (153)R4: Norrie (81)Watch this space. Could be an exciting storyline.

Best, Christopher Carroll

• I agree it could be exciting. No doubt the draw fates smiled on him in Week 1. In Week 2? As I write this he conceivably could have to go through Zverev (his next opponent), Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz to win. Again, you can only beat the players placed before you.

We know that players rent homes at Wimbledon and stay near the court in the village. I'm curious where players stay during the French Open?

Peter T., NYC

• First, I'm curious to hear from you how the French Open vs. Roland Garros bit is going? To digress further … imagine pulling Roland Garros, World War I pilot, aside more than 100 years ago and saying, Check this out, in 100 years your name will figure prominently in a branding exercise for a tennis tournament. One that pays the winner 2.55 million euros. What's a euro? Never mind.

Anyway, I know of one player who has an Airbnb. But most of the players stay at hotels in the 8th arrondissement, which, depending on traffic, is 15 minutes or so from the site. (Even less on an e-bike!) 

Hi Jon,

How would you compare the level of camaraderie on the WTA tour with that on the men's side?

I ask because to me, it seems that the net meetings at the end of the matches look very different, the men's and the women's. The men frequently embrace warmly, exchange a few words, many times more than a few, smile, pat each other on the shoulder/belly/chest, and all that. On the women's side, however, whilst there is the occasional double cheek peck to be seen, more often than not it's just the briefest of handshakes, then they turn away from each other and walk off.

There is, of course, the occasional contentious match on the men's side which doesn't end so warmly, but by and large they seem a very convivial bunch, full of bonhomie in a way that seems to be missing from the ladies side. Am I wrong?

Gavin 

• There's a gender studies dissertation in here somewhere. All sorts of socialization and mores and culture. My take is that it's very case-by-case. Yes, there are some WTA handshakes that come with a layer of permafrost. But then you see Daria Kasatkina and Mirra Andreeva joking with each other or Madison Keys hugging most opponents. Or Keys and Taylor Townsend.

And, yes, you have these bromances in men's tennis. We talked recently about Sinner-Alcaraz following the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivals-need-not-be-enemies model. But you also have Arthur Fils–Jaume Munar or Ben Shelton–Andrea Vavassori or matches requiring the chair umpire to double as a bouncer and break up a fight.

Note I am trying to avoid a gendered conversation. But here's my take: For most players this is partially about likes and dislikes and friendships. But it is also a matter of optimizing performance. Friction and aggro is fun for fans. But for most players, the less distraction and tension and build-up, the better for their game.

Hi Jon,

I have been a fan of Iga [Świątek]'s for many years now. But, in the Round of 16, [third] set at 4–4, [Elena] Rybakina double faults on a second serve for Świątek to go up 5–4. But wait! The chair umpire comes down to check the ball mark and the ball actually caught the service line! Umpire says the ball was good. Iga says “I didn't ask you to check the mark.” Wow. Really bad sportsmanship right there! I think Lindsay Davenport even said that it's the chair's job to make sure the calls are accurate (and not only if a player asks for a check). Rybakina went on to hold to go up 5–4. It was a great match up to that point and I was enjoying seeing Iga fight and come back, but it was hard to root for Świątek from that point forward. I know there have been other complaints about Iga's sportsmanship.  What are your thoughts here?

Tim in Atlanta

• It was indeed a strange interval. Rybakina “double-faulted” and walked to the chair dejectedly, without issuing a protest. Świątek was, understandably, less than pleased that chair umpire Kader Nouni took it upon himself to examine the mark. When he ruled the serve “in,” Świątek didn't protest much.

A) My read: Perversely, the server thought the serve was out. The returner thought the serve was good.

B) Good for Nouni for having the courage—on such a critical point—to come down, unsolicited.

C) Good for him as well for getting it right. It would have been disastrous if replay had contradicted his judgment. It did not.

D) This will not happen next year when robots replace people at the final major.

E) Not only was Rybakina spared a double fault but she got a first serve.

F) Świątek won the match so any controversy was minimal.

G) I didn't think Świątek did anything unsporting. At a critical point of a critical match, she expressed frustration. Then she went about her business. Cut her some slack, I say.

Hi Jon,

Long time tennis fan—a big fan of your mailbag as well!

So … how about we start a movement to have Americans move away from pronouncing Roland Gow-ros to the correct Roland Gah-ros? Surely it can't be too difficult?

We don't have to worry anymore about SheraPOva to ShaRApova lolz

A librarian who cringes at our pronunciations, Ani

• Thanks. Both as a matter of professionalism and respect we should strive to make correct pronunciation. But at what point do we make concessions? If we do Gah-Ros, must we say Pair-ee as well? Jasmine Paolini won last month's event in Roma? Kraków becomes Krak-UFF. And of course there's the whole Bar-THEL-ona thing …

A reminder that for the players, there's the audio icon in their ATP and WTA bios. 

ENJOY THESE LAST FEW DAYS of the French Open, EVERYONE!

Kyrgios has not played at All England Club since losing 2022 final

Ongoing knee problem rules him out of this year's grand slam in London

Nick Kyrgios's Wimbledon absence will stretch into a third year after the Australian tennis maverick suffered a fresh injury setback.

Kyrgios has not played at Wimbledon since losing the 2022 final to Novak Djokovic, after a combination of knee, foot and wrist injuries.

He had hoped to play doubles at the French Open with Jordan Thompson but withdrew from what would have been his first appearance at Roland Garros since 2017 with a knee injury.

On Tuesday, Kyrgios confirmed that problem would also rule him out of Wimbledon.

“Just wanted to give everyone a quick update – l've hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately won't make it back for grass season this year,” Kyrgios wrote on Instagram.

“I know how much you've all been looking forward to seeing me out there, and I'm genuinely sorry to disappoint. This is just a bump in the road though, and I'm already working hard to get back stronger than ever.

“Thank you for all your continued support – it means everything to me. See you soon!”

Now 30, Kyrgios faces an uphill battle to resurrect his career, which has been hammered by injuries since late 2022.

The former world No 13 has played only four singles matches this year, claiming his first tour victory in two-and-a-half years at the Miami Open in March.

His Wimbledon withdrawal means his first-round exit at this year's Australian Open will remain his only grand slam appearance – of a possible 11 – since the start of 2023.

Last week, Thompson gave an insight into how much Kyrgios had struggled with his luckless injury run.

“He was pretty down. He told me he doesn't know how much more of these injuries he can take, and you've just got to feel for him,” Thompson said.

“Because as much as he says things in the media, I think he loves playing tennis and he loves being on court, so it's disappointing that he can't be here on the court.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

Though after June we'll only be left with baseball in terms of active big four sports, tennis fans are currently amid the heat of the calendar. As we trek through three Grand Slam tournaments in as many months, footwear brands are ramping up product centered around their signature athletes, so of course Coco Gauff's name remains one in heavy rotation.

Nearing the one-year anniversary of her latest CG2 and entering each of the three summertime majors among the favorites, Gauff pulls from Wimbledon's classic green to inform the design of her performance high top and its more accessible sibling, the Coco Delray. “Green Apple” hues can be felt on the tongue of either shoe and filling in the “N” branding on either side of the New Balance CG2, yet the storied air of Wimbledon aligns with the restrained tones elsewhere: both shoes utilize pure white mesh as their foundation.

While the Delray is suited for off-the-court purposes, this “Wimbledon” edition of the CG2 executes one of Coco Gauff's core tenets with her footwear choices, allowing fans to match with her choices during these high-stake matches. We'll have to wait until the end of June to see the US Open winner sport these on that stage, but you don't have to wait. Both the New Balance CG2 and Coco Delray are available now, clocking in at $160 and $110, respectively. Hit the “Where To Buy” links ahead to grab yours.

The highlight of a tennis fan's summer is almost here, with the 138th edition of Wimbledon ready to get started this month. 

Carlos Alcaraz successfully defended his title at SW19 last year after beating rival Novak Djokovic in straight sets on Centre Court.

That came after the Spaniard overcame Djokovic in 2023 in a thriller, and now the pair are going for glory yet again this time around in what could be the tennis legend's last appearance.

Jannik Sinner is sure to be involved in the battle for a Grand Slam along with in-form British No.1 Jack Draper, who will aim to emulate Andy Murray.

In the women's singles, No.31 seed Barbora Krejcíkova beat Jasmine Paolini to surprisingly win her first title at Wimbledon last year.

But World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka will be out to end her wait for a Grand Slam title at SW19, while Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff will surely challenge too. 

Wimbledon will begin on Monday, June 30.

The tournament will be played over 14 days, with it coming to a close on Sunday, July 13. 

The men's singles final is scheduled for the final day of play.

Meanwhile, the women's singles final will be held a day earlier on Saturday, July 12. 

Start times for each day will be confirmed closer to the tournament.

But last year, action got started at 11am on outer courts and 1pm on show courts, so things are expected to be similar this time around. 

The entirety of Wimbledon will be broadcast free-to-air on the BBC. 

Coverage will be split between BBC One and BBC Two, as well as online via BBC iPlayer, the BBC website and their mobile app. 

talkSPORT will have live updates from SW19 throughout the tournament too. 

To tune in to talkSPORT or talkSPORT 2 through the website, click HERE for the live stream. 

You can also listen via the talkSPORT app, on DAB digital radio, through your smart speaker and on 1089 or 1053 AM.

On top of that, talkSPORT.com will be across all of the latest news and build-up.

Due to the incredible demand for Wimbledon tickets, it's very hard for fans to secure themselves a spot to watch the action. 

A public ballot is run each year, which sees fans sign up to find out whether they have been successful or unsuccessful.

Unfortunately, the ballot is already closed for the 2025 tournament and the successful entrants will already have found out who they are.

However, there is still a way for members of the public to get into Wimbledon. 

And it is, of course, via The Queue, which is an iconic part of the event and sees fans line up in their thousands outside the venue. 

Each day, a queue will form and you can buy either show court tickets or ground tickets - but they are sold on a best available, first-come-first-served, one-per-person basis.

Once the capacity has reached its limit, entry will only be possible if someone exits, meaning you are not guaranteed to get in. 

More details can be found on the Wimbledon website here. 

The official seeds will be revealed in the lead-up to Wimbledon.

Coco Gauff and New Balance are keeping things fresh on the court this summer with new CG2 and Coco Delray colorways. Although Roland Garros is still in full swing, the brand has started to look ahead to the next Grand Slam: Wimbledon. 

Both of Gauff's shoes were launched today in a ""White and Green Apple"" colorway to match the vibrant greens of grass court season and the traditional white worn at Wimbledon. 

The simple yet refined design pays homage to the tournament's heritage while putting a modern twist on Gauff's signature shoe.

The Coco CG2 ($159.99) has bold splashes of Green Apple on each of the N's gracing the side of the shoes. Green detailing adorns the inner sole and outer flap with Gauff's signature and other design elements.  

Gauff's signature shoe is not only built for high performance but also to stand out for elite tennis athletes on the court.  

Designed for those with explosive movement and powerful shots, the shoe features a striking mid-cut silhouette, a FuelCell midsole for extra comfort, and a carbon fiber plate that keeps athlete's steps stable.

The Coco Delray ($109.99) has a new look that is more subtle, although the strong neon green accents are present throughout. Gauff's signature is written in green both on the sole and front flap, with New Balance's logo printed in the color just under the laces.

Inspired by the city where Gauff trained, the Coco Delray blends heritage and performance for a refined version of the CG2. 

Its durable construction and streamlined low-ankle collar offer both comfort and style, designed for all-day play and everyday wear off the court. It's unique in structure, with a FuelCell midsole and a lighter weight for improved movement. 

Earlier this morning, Gauff defeated Madison Keys to advance to the semifinals at Roland Garros. She has a record of 29-8 this season. The main draw for Wimbledon 2025 starts on July 1.

...

PARIS (AP) — That No. 2 seed Coco Gauff reached Thursday's French Open semifinals should surprise no one. Her 361st-ranked opponent for a berth in the title match? That's a whole other story.

Gauff made it to the final four at Roland-Garros for the third time, getting past No. 7 Madison Keys 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-1 on Wednesday in a quarterfinal between two Americans who both have won a major title.

Next up for 2023 U.S. Open champion Gauff? A matchup against French wild-card entry Loïs Boisson, who extended one of the most stunning runs in tennis history by beating No. 6 Mirra Andreeva 7-6 (6), 6-3.

“Unbelievable,” Boisson said. “Incredible.”

Those are a couple of good words for what's been happening.

A year ago, Boisson was supposed to make her Grand Slam debut in Paris, but she tore a knee ligament and couldn't compete. Now 22, Boisson is the first woman to get to the semifinals of her first major tournament since Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati did it at the 1989 French Open and is the lowest-ranked to get that far at Roland-Garros in at least 40 years.

She's doing it with a game made for clay, anchored by heavy groundstrokes and buoyed by a rowdy, partisan crowd that rattled the 18-year-old Andreeva — she was warned for ball abuse for smacking one toward the upper deck after one bad volley — and was just as loud when Boisson upset No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the fourth round.

“I love to play with the crowd. I love to hear my name when I won a point and everything,” Boisson said. “For me, it's just something plus. It's not pressure. But I think it's also really difficult for (a) player from (another) country.”

Over and over again, the chair umpire tried to tell the 15,000 or so spectators to be quiet as their thunderous applause and shouts of Boisson's first name reverberated off the inside of the closed roof at Court Philippe-Chatrier. They didn't heed those requests. They jeered and whistled when Andreeva complained about noise between her first and second serves or argued line calls.

“It's normal that they would support a French player, so I knew that it's going to be like this. I think that in the first set, I managed it pretty well (and) I didn't really pay attention to that,” Andreeva said. “But obviously with nerves and with pressure, it became a little harder.”

When the match ended, Boisson collapsed to her back, chest heaving and hands on her face. When she rose, there were flecks of rust-colored clay all over, including her forehead.

No matter what happens the rest of the way, Boisson certainly has left her mark on the 2025 French Open.

“I think every kid who plays tennis has the dream to win a Slam. More for a French player to win Roland Garros, for sure,” she said. “So, yeah, it's a dream. For sure, I will go for the dream — because my dream is to win it, not to be in the semifinal.”

What else happened at the French Open on Wednesday?

No. 1 Jannik Sinner got back to the semifinals in Paris for the second year in a row with his latest overpowering performance, defeating unseeded Alexander Bublik 6-1, 7-5, 6-0 in under two hours. Sinner has dropped just 36 games through five matches in the the tournament. His semifinal opponent will be 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic or No. 3 Alexander Zverev.

Who plays at Roland-Garros on Thursday?

The two women's semifinals are the only singles matches on the Day 12 schedule, with three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek facing No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in just their second matchup at a Grand Slam tournament, and Gauff meeting Boisson. The men's semifinals are Friday.

France's Lois Boisson celebrates as she won the quarterfinal match of the French Tennis Open against Russia's Mirra Andreeva at the Roland-Garros stadium in Paris, Wednesday, June 4, 2025.

PARIS (AP) — Coco Gauff kept double-faulting. She kept missing plenty of other strokes. She kept losing games in bunches. And all the while, she would let out a sigh or bow her head or look generally uncomfortable.

What the 21-year-old Gauff never did Wednesday during a tense and topsy-turvy French Open quarterfinal against another American woman with a Grand Slam title, Madison Keys, was give up hope or go away. And, in a contest filled with plenty of mistakes, it was Gauff who emerged to grab eight of the last nine games for a 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-1 victory over Keys and a third trip to the semifinals at Roland-Garros.

“I have had that in me from a young age,"" said the No. 2-seeded Gauff, who won the 2023 U.S. Open as a teenager and was the French Open runner-up the year before. “When times become more difficult, knowing that I can dig deep in those tough moments.”

Where did that come from?

“Just a love to win, the will to win. It's not something that's taught or anything. It's just I have always had that in me, and not just in tennis but in everything. I'm a very competitive person,” she said. “My philosophy is if I can just leave it all out there, then the loss will hurt a lot less than regrets of maybe not giving it your all.”

Gauff needed to overcame 10 double-faults — three in the opening tiebreaker alone — and the first set she's dropped in the tournament, as well as deal with the big-hitting Keys, the No. 7 seed, who entered with an 11-match Grand Slam winning streak after her title at the Australian Open in January.

They combined for 101 unforced errors and just 40 winners across more than two hours under a closed roof at Court Philippe-Chatrier on a drizzly, chilly day.

Nearly half of the games — 14 of 29 — featured breaks of serve. But from 4-all in the second set, Gauff held four times in a row while pulling away. She made two unforced errors in the last set, including just one double-fault.

After falling behind 4-1 at the start, and twice being a single point from trailing 5-1, Gauff switched to a racket with a different tension in the strings to see if that would help.

“Maybe it did, and maybe it didn't. I'd like to think that it helped a little bit,"" she said. ""Sometimes that stuff could just be mental. Maybe you're thinking, 'Oh, I changed my racket, I'm going to play better, and you start doing it. I don't know.”

She'll play Thursday for a berth in another major final, facing 361st-ranked French wild-card entry Loïs Boisson, who is on one of the most stunning runs in tennis history. Boisson beat No. 6 Mirra Andreeva 7-6 (6), 6-3 in the quarterfinals to follow up her upset of No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the fourth round.

Boisson, 22, is the first woman to reach the semifinals in her Grand Slam debut since 1989, when Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati both did it at the French Open. A crowd that offered support to Gauff against Keys via shouts of “Allez, Coco!” was raucous as can be behind Boisson, rattling the 18-year-old Andreeva.

The other women's semifinal is quite a matchup: three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek vs. No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka. They advanced with quarterfinal victories Tuesday.

It was Swiatek who stopped Gauff at Roland-Garros in the semifinals last year and in the final three years ago.

“I have a lot more work left to do,” said Gauff, who raised her arms overhead then spread them wide apart after the last point against Keys, “but I'm going to savor this one today.”

Repeatedly, Gauff scrambled this way or that to get her racket on a shot from Keys and send it back, often leading to a miss.

“The court being a little bit slower, coupled with the fact that she covers the court so well, just put a little bit of pressure on me to go a little bit more for my shots and maybe press a little bit too much, too soon,” said Keys, who occasionally admonished herself with a slap on her right leg.

“There were a lot of points where I felt like, playing someone else,"" Keys said, “I would have won the point.”

A match-up one point away from being realised at Australian Open 2025 is now finally set to take centre stage in Paris.

World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka will face three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek for a place in the Roland Garros final after both passed tough quarterfinal tests in straight sets on Tuesday.

It will be the first Grand Slam meeting between the rivals since the 2022 US Open semifinals almost three years ago – their one and only meeting at a major tournament, until now.

""It feels like the first since they have become the 'Big Two' of the WTA,” said Catherine Whitaker on The Tennis Podcast.

""I know it has, at times, been a Big Three, maybe even a Big Four… but let's face it, in terms of the last three years of WTA tennis, it's been those two. Those have been the mainstays at the top and they have been dancing around one another at the Grand Slams.

“We've been due this.”



Added podcast co-host David Law: ""It feels just about the ultimate, really, in the sport.

“Because not only is it the two of them, and them having been the dominant players, but it's Swiatek's territory and it's Sabalenka's world No.1 ranking and feeling of dominance.

""Those two colossal forces are colliding, and that is mouth-watering.""

Before the tournament we reported on the Jannik Sinner-Carlos Alcaraz duopoly at the majors. The Italian and the Spaniard have collected the past five Slam titles between them and remain on track, as world No.1 and No.2, to clash in their first major final.

Sabalenka and Swiatek are the women's equivalent.

Among active women's players they own the best winning percentages at Grand Slam tournaments, and no women this decade have reached more major semifinals than either of them.

Since Ash Barty's retirement just weeks after her Australian Open 2022 triumph, Swiatek and Sabalenka combined to win seven of the next 11 majors.

Yet they met just once at a Grand Slam event in that span; Swiatek recovered from 4-2 down in the third set of that epic 2022 US Open semifinal, and went on to win the trophy.

Beginning with Roland Garros in 2023, Swiatek and Sabalenka were seeded No.1 and No.2 at seven of the next eight majors, with Wimbledon last year the only outlier.

MUGURUZA ON SABALENKA: “She's just a perfect personality for world No.1”

Those seedings set the stage for Grand Slam final meetings, and twice they came within one point of making them happen.

Sabalenka led Karolina Muchova 5-2 in the third set of their 2023 Roland Garros semifinal, earning match point in the eighth game before the Czech served her way out of trouble and rebounded to win. At AO 2025, Swiatek held a match point against Keys deep in the third set of their semifinal, only for Keys to escape and subsequently stun Sabalenka in the final.



This meeting at the semifinal stage is due to Swiatek's seeding; she recently dropped from world No.2 to No.5 after failing to defend her Madrid and Rome titles, entering Roland Garros seeded fifth.

As Swiatek has fallen in the rankings, Sabalenka has become an increasingly dominant world No.1.

In the WTA live rankings she's more than 4500 points ahead of second-ranked Coco Gauff and this season has already won three titles from six finals, the most recent on clay in Madrid.

She's been equally imperious at Grand Slam level, not losing before the quarterfinal stage for three years. “That's crazy stats,” Sabalenka smiled when told she had contested her 10th consecutive major quarterfinal against Zheng Qinwen, which she won 7-6(3) 6-3.

“Honestly, I wasn't really thinking about that. I was really focused on the game. Yeah, that's crazy. That's crazy statistics.”

Thursday's clash with Swiatek in Paris will be Sabalenka's 11th Grand Slam semifinal – by far the most of any woman this decade.

And she can't wait to test herself against the game's best on clay.

“I love tough challenges,” she said.

“I think this is the matches where you actually improve as a player and where you get much stronger. And I'm always excited to face someone strong and then someone who can challenge me.

“I take it as a challenge, and I go out there and I fight, and I'm ready to leave everything I have to get the win.”

Sabalenka might be the game's dominant No.1 and premier force at the majors, but she is yet to break through at Roland Garros.

And that's because the tournament is Swiatek's domain.

The Pole has won four of the past five French titles and the past three in a row; she last lost at the event in the 2021 quarterfinals to Maria Sakkari.

Since then Swiatek has won 26 consecutive French Open matches, the most recent a 6-1 7-5 win over Elina Svitolina in Tuesday's quarterfinals.

This fortnight she surpassed streaks of 24 and 25 wins, set by Justine Henin and Monica Seles respectively, and approaches the all-time women's record of 29, held by Chris Evert – the widely-anointed Queen of Clay.

Swiatek has won 40 of her first 42 matches at the tournament, a mark bettered only by the legendary Rafael Nadal.

Having already equalled Margaret Court's Open-era women's record for the best winning percentage at Roland Garros, Swiatek closes in on more history.

A fourth consecutive singles title at Roland Garros would make her the first woman to do that since Suzanne Lenglen 102 years ago.

But first she'll have to go through Sabalenka, a player who has pushed her to the limit – and even beaten her – on her favourite surface, most notably in two incredible Madrid finals.

“These finals were probably one of the best, most exciting finals that I played,” Swiatek said of those 2023 and 2024 battles.

“Against Aryna it's always a challenge; she has a game for every surface. I need to just focus on myself, do the work, be brave with my shots and just go for it.

“She's been having a great season, so I'm not going to lie – for sure it's going to be a tough match. But I'm happy for a challenge.”

Young star Jannik Sinner and bona fide future legend Novak Djokovic were in the limelight on Wednesday as they took on their respective competitors in the French Open quarterfinals.

Sinner, who was yet to drop a set at Roland Garros this year, looked to continue steamrolling the competition against Alexander Bubik. Later in the day, decorated veteran Djokovic will take on 28-year-old Alexander Zverev of Germany.

It took an entertaining three sets for Sinner to overcome Bubik. Despite being unranked, Bubik shocked many by making it to the last eight competitors in the tournament.

Sinner showed why he is ranked No. 1 at Roland Garros with a display of dominance and heart against Bubik. The 23-year-old got off to good start and quickly established an early 4-0 lead. He would take the set with ease, 6-1.

The second set began with the two competitors in a 1-1 deadlock. After scoring a consolation point in the first, Bubik put up an early fight with a 2-1 lead. Bubik, 27, led the cat and mouse between them throughout the second — edging away whenever Sinner tied the score.

But momentum changed when Sinner broke the 5-5 tie as the set dragged on. While it took some work, the Italian took the set, 7-5. Bubik appeared to be tapped out from the fight he put up in the second set, as Sinner cruised away to a flawless 6-0 set.

Novak Djokovic faces Alexander Zverev in a blockbuster French Open quarter-final as the Serbian continues his bid for a record-extending 25th grand slam singles title. 

Djokovic is yet to drop a set at this year's tournament and defeated Cameron Norrie on Monday to claim his 100th career win at Roland Garros, as well as his 19th French Open quarter-final.

Zverev, the third seed, will be the toughest test Djokovic has faced by far, with the German having reached last year's final in Paris where he lost in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz. 

Zverev won his last meeting with Djokovic, but that came when the 38-year-old retired from their Australian Open semi-final after losing the opening set on a tiebreak. Here's everything you need to know. 

The match has been scheduled for the night session, which won't start before 7:15pm BST (UK time) on Wednesday 4 June. It could start later than that if the previous matches run over.

Alexander Zverev [3] vs Novak Djokovic [6]

Djokovic defeated Norrie in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2, to extend his winning streak on clay after winning the title in Geneva before the French Open began. 

“I can always expect myself to play better,” he said. “Considering the opponent's form, as well, and the last‑16 round and the occasion, I think was a very good match. From my side, a very solid performance.”

Zverev progressed to his fifth consecutive French Open quarter-final after his opponent Tallon Griekspoor retired while trailing 6-3 4-0, having struggled with an injury during the match. 

Zverev has won his last four French Open quarter-finals but trails the head-to-head against Djokovic 8-5. However, they have only played each other twice from the 2022 season onwards, with the record 1-1.

Coco Gauff, seeded No. 2, came from a set down to defeat fellow American and Australian Open champion Madison Keys 6-7(6), 6-4, 6-1 on Wednesday, advancing to her third French Open semi-final in four years at Roland-Garros

Coco Gauff, seeded No. 2, qualified for her third semi-final in four years at the French Open, defeating Australian Open champion Madison Keys in the opening match of the day on Court Philippe-Chatrier at Roland-Garros on Wednesday (6-7, 6-4, 6-1).

Gauff, runner-up in 2022, dropped her first set of the 2025 tournament against a player she had every reason to be wary of — she hadn't beaten Keys since Dubai in 2023.

The loss ends Madison Keys' 11-match Grand Slam winning streak and evens her head-to-head record with Gauff at 3-3. Gauff has now won both of their Grand Slam encounters, including their 2022 US Open clash. This was Keys' first Roland-Garros quarter-final appearance since 2019.

“It means a lot, especially getting through this tough match today,” Coco said. “It wasn't an easy match, and I'm very happy to get through it. I'm so excited to be in the semi-finals back here again. I have a lot more work to do. I'll just savour this one today and focus on the next one tomorrow.”

With 14 double faults and 101 unforced errors combined, the match was filled with tension — only broken by a dominant third set from Gauff, now 21 years old.

In the first set, nerves were evident as both players lost their serve three times. Gauff (21 unforced errors) failed to convert a set point while leading 5-4 and eventually lost the tiebreak 8-6.

But the 2023 US Open champion remained composed in the second set. After racing to a 4-1 lead with two breaks, she let the advantage slip (4-4) but fought back with aggressive play to seal the set 6-4.

The third set was one-sided. Serving brilliantly — not losing a single point on her first serve and hitting 71% of first serves in — Gauff didn't face a break point and broke Keys three times to close out the match in dominant fashion.

The match was played under the roof of Court Philippe-Chatrier due to a rainy day in Paris. “I think the court being a little bit slower coupled with the fact that she covers the court so well, it just put a little bit of pressure on me to go a little bit more for my shots and maybe press a little bit too much too soon”, said Keys.

“I think also there were a lot of points where I felt like playing someone else I would have won the point, but having to reset two and three times, it makes it harder, where even if you win six of those but if you're losing three or four, they could be important points.”

Gauff, ranked No 2, will face the winner of the match between Russian Mirra Andreeva, the No 6 seed, and French wildcard Lois Boisson next, to chase a spot in her third major final against Aryna Sabalenka (N.1) or triple defending champion Iga Swiatek (N.5).

Keys led their head-to-head 3-2 coming into Wednesday's match, winning their only previous clay-court encounter in three sets at the 2024 Mutua Madrid Open. Playing under the Chatrier roof, the 30-year-old Keys got off to a quick start against her younger but almost equally experienced opponent, breaking three times en route to a 4-1 lead.""I think a lot to be proud of,"" Keys reflected in press.

Throughout his career, Zverev has struggled when the stakes are highest. Can he change that against the greatest—and mentally toughest—player in tennis history?ByZachary CohenPublished Jun 04, 2025 copy_link

We were supposed to see Alexander Zverev and Novak Djokovic battle in the semifinals of the 2025 Australian Open, but the 24-time Grand Slam champion had to retire after dropping the first-set tiebreaker. Djokovic was dealing with a torn hamstring he suffered in his quarterfinal win over Carlos Alcaraz in Melbourne, and he simply wasn't able to continue. Well, we're now going to see these two dance again, on Wednesday, June 4, with a spot in the Roland Garros semifinals on the line.Both these players were struggling on clay heading into this tournament. Zverev did win a title in Munich, but between the three clay-court Masters events, Zverev's best result was a quarterfinal appearance in Italy, which is disappointing for somebody with his clay-court ability.Zverev has found a little something in Paris. Last year's runner-up has earned straightforward wins over Learner Tien, Jesper De Jong and Flavio Cobolli. He was also up 6-4, 3-0 against Tallon Griekspoor in the fourth round before the Dutchman had to retire. Still, that was a solid showing for Zverev, and it got him off the court to get his legs ready for Djokovic.

Still, that was a solid showing for Zverev, and it got him off the court to get his legs ready for Djokovic.

The problem with Zverev is that we haven't seen him win a big match in a long time. The biggest win he has to his name since arriving in Europe is a 7-6 (3), 6-1 victory over Arthur Fils. Djokovic is going to be a significant step up in competition.Djokovic's low points on clay were lower than Zverev's. He lost in straight sets to Alejandro Tabilo in Monte Carlo, then went to Madrid and lost in the same fashion against Matteo Arnaldi. Djokovic also skipped the 1000-level event in Rome, leading to some real uncertainty approaching the year's second major. But Djokovic went to Geneva to find a little something, and he left with a Stella-like groove. In my opinion, all Djokovic ever needed was some matches under his belt, and he got that in Switzerland.I was never worried about him being “washed.” Just look at the runs he made in Australia and Miami. And not only did Djokovic get to play four matches in Geneva, but TennisViz and Tennis Data Innovations had numbers that showed his ball striking there was exceptional. His movement also got better as the tournament progressed. So, I started to buy Djokovic as a contender in Paris, and the level has only gone up since the three-time Roland Garros champion got to France.

Djokovic comes into this match after straight-set wins over Mackenzie McDonald, Corentin Moutet, Filip Misolic and Cameron Norrie. That's not exactly the toughest road in the world, but Djokovic didn't play around with any of those opponents. He hit most of them off the court. Now, he's looking the part of a Top 5 player in the world again, and he's the exact type of player that can give Zverev nightmares.Nobody in the history of tennis has done more as a returner than Djokovic, so the Serbian should be able to give Zverev some trouble there. Of course, Zverev is one of the best servers on the planet, and there will be plenty of quick service holds. But for as powerful as Zverev is with the ball on his racquet, he's not as good as he needs to be at hitting his spots. At some point, that should catch up to him in this match.Zverev's lack of aggression should also be a big issue here. The German badly wants to extend rallies and wait out errors from opponents, but you can't do that when Djokovic is playing well. The 38-year-old doesn't miss nearly enough.

Djokovic is also tremendous at attacking his opponent's weaknesses, and Zverev has one: his forehand just isn't reliable. Zverev has been hitting it with more conviction in Paris, and he does have some week-long stretches in which he plays bigger from that side of the court. But in these types of matches—the ones with the biggest stakes—he tends to freeze up, take pace off that shot and leave his balls shorter in the court. If he does that here, Djokovic will calmly come up and pummel them.At some point, we're going to see guys like Zverev become too much for an aging Djokovic, but I just don't think we're there yet. So, I'd suggest taking the generous price you're being offered on the greatest player in the history of the sport.Pick: Djokovic ML (-110)NOTE: If you took my pre-tournament advice on Tennis Bets Live and played Djokovic to win Quarter 2 at +250 odds, I wouldn't add anything to that position.

Loïs Boisson's Roland Garros fairytale continued on Wednesday, the No. 361st ranked French wild card stunning Mirra Andreeva, 7-6 (6), 6-3 to reach the semifinals.Boisson caused the biggest upset of the women's event when she shocked No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula to reach the quarterfinals; she backed up that win by grounding the No. 6-se22-eded teenager in two hours and eight minutes beneath the Court Philippe-Chatrier stadium roof.Boisson had never faced anyone ranked inside the Top 50 prior to Roland Garros, her previously-highest ranked opponent being world No. 60 Moyuka Uchijima earlier this year at a WTA 250 in Rouen. The 22-year-old needed a wild card to get into the main draw, having missed her planned debut last year due to a torn ACL. She had gone viral at that tournament after opponent Harriet Dart made disparaging comments about her during their match, a moment Boisson later took in stride on social media.

She began the week with a three-set win over No. 24 seed Elise Mertens and later won another three-setter against fellow wild card Elsa Jacquemot to reach the second week. Once there, she rallied from a set down to defeat Pegula to book the biggest match of her career against Andreeva.Though she's four years younger than Boisson, Andreeva came into their quarterfinal with considerably more experience, having reached the semifinals of this tournament last June. She began 2025 with back-to-back WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells, vaulting into the Top 10 under esteemed coach Conchita Martinez. She didn't drop a set through her first four matches, and appeared on course for another seamless victory when she took a 5-3 lead on Boisson to kick off the final last-eight clash of the women's tournament.

At 22 years old, Boisson will next face world No. 2 Coco Gauff, the 2022 runner-up at Roland Garros and 2023 US Open champion, for the chance of making her first Grand Slam final.

Saving a set point on her serve, Boisson—who, alongside Andreeva, got to warm up alongside world No. 1 Jannik Sinner before their match—broke straight back and shook off losing a marathon 11th game to power through the subsequent tiebreaker, saving one more set point along the way.A frustrated Andreeva looked to have righted the ship early in the second, racing out to a 3-0 lead. But Boisson soon climbed back into the match, winning the next five games to find herself on the brink of victory.In anger, Andreeva knocked a ball into the crowd, startling a ball kid behind her, and couldn't reign in her emotions as she served to stay in the match, quickly falling behind 0-30. A forehand into the net handed Boisson three match points, and Boisson took full advantage, forcing a final error off a well-struck forehand to reach the final four in Paris.Up next for the tournament's Cinderella story will be No. 2 seed Coco Gauff, who roared back from a set down to snap Madison Keys' 11-match Grand Slam winning streak earlier in the afternoon.

THIS WEEK IN F1: 10 tricky quiz questions on the Spanish Grand Prix

Aston Martin's Chief Trackside Officer, Mike Krack, has shared some more insight into Lance Stroll's withdrawal from last weekend's Spanish Grand Prix, as well as when he might be able to return to action.

Aston Martin announced a few hours after Qualifying at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya that Stroll would sit out the race and undergo a medical procedure after experiencing pain in his hand and wrist.

READ MORE: Aston Martin announce Stroll to miss Spanish Grand Prix

This is believed to be linked to the fractures Stroll sustained in a cycling accident during the 2023 pre-season, after which he had surgery and managed to compete at the opening round of the campaign.

Speaking after Sunday's Grand Prix, Krack said: “As it has been known already, the whole thing started in 2023. If you guys remember, there were injuries, and over the last weeks there was the mention of pain.

Stroll sat out Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix due to pain in his hand and wrist

“You do not ask the driver every five minutes, ‘Do you have pain or not?' You have a chat here with the physio, or here a chat, and you understand that there are some small issues.

“We have seen it with Lance in 2023, when he fought his way back, they [the drivers] want to drive, they do not want to be out. Very often I think they drive with probably more pain than they would even admit, to be able to drive, because this is what they love to do.

“Over the last weeks, there was a mention here and there, but you are never aware how much it is, and over the weekend, I think it was just getting too much.

“I think at the end of the day, on Saturday after Qualifying, Lance and his team decided it was better to go and check, go and check again, and the recommendation was better not to race.”

Krack stated that Aston Martin's “Plan A” is for Stroll to race in Canada

Asked about Stroll's planned procedure and the anticipated recovery time, Krack continued: “You are not speaking to a doctor here, that is what makes it a little bit difficult to predict anything, or to say anything. I am not involved in that.

“We will have to see what the next days are bringing. I understand that there will be more tests, more checks going on over the next days, and we will know more in the coming days.

“At the moment, it's really difficult to tell you how it's going to go, and what is going to happen in the next days, but we will find out.”

Krack went on to state that Aston Martin's “Plan A” is for Stroll to be back in the car for his home race in Canada next weekend, but “Plan B” involves having the likes of reserve drivers Felipe Drugovich and Stoffel Vandoorne on standby.

Brazilian Drugovich is on Aston Martin's books as a reserve driver

This is despite former GP2 and F2 champions Drugovich and Vandoorne planning to take part in the upcoming 24 Hours of Le Mans, which clashes with the Montreal race weekend.

Meanwhile, Aston Martin Driver Development Programme member Jak Crawford, who currently competes in F2, would not be an option given that he has yet to hit the required number of points for a Super Licence.

“It is quite simple, the ‘Plan A' is to have Lance in the car – that is the ‘Plan A', and that is what we are working to,” said Krack. “If the ‘Plan A' does not work, then we need to pull ‘Plan B'.

“Obviously we always knew that Le Mans was going to happen, so we also had plans in place that if we need a driver that is doing Le Mans, we will bring him, but at the moment this is not the only question.”

He signed off: “We wait what the next days are bringing, and then we take a decision.”

THIS WEEK IN F1: 10 tricky quiz questions on the Spanish Grand Prix

Valtteri Bottas has made clear that he is “not done yet with Formula 1” and has “more to give” the sport in the future, with the 10-time Grand Prix winner still exploring his options of making a return to the grid.

Bottas was left without a race seat for the 2025 season after Kick Sauber signed an all-new driver line-up, forcing him to take a step back and ultimately pick up a test and reserve role with former employers Mercedes.

Speaking on the Beyond The Grid podcast, the 35-year-old emphasised his desire to get back into a full-time cockpit in 2026 – when new Technical Regulations will come into play – and add another chapter to his Grand Prix career.

“I'm sitting here now without a race seat, not because of my own choice,” said Bottas. “I definitely still feel – and that emotion was quite quick after I knew I wouldn't get a seat for this year – that I'm not done yet with F1.

“I still have more to give. It's still [the] number one thing in my life. That sensation, now that I've been watching aside, has got stronger and stronger and stronger, and now I really start to miss racing.

Bottas took up a reserve role with Mercedes for 2025 after losing his Sauber seat

“I just feel like the way especially the last two years went for me in my career, it's definitely not the way I want things to finish. End of last year – some Qualifying, some races – I felt like I was performing at my best ever.

“I haven't felt any degradation in myself yet. That's why I just want to keep going. We humans, we have deg, but I don't have it yet!”

One project Bottas has been linked to is the start-up Cadillac operation – an American team backed by automotive giant General Motors and TWG Motorsports who will enter F1 next year.

With Bottas an experienced, proven winner, and Cadillac building from the ground up, the Finn believes the two parties could be a strong match, while admitting the project is “very interesting” from the outside.

“I don't think they're in a massive rush,” Bottas said, referring to Cadillac's driver line-up choices. “They've been very, very busy on trying to get a car on the grid for next year.

Cadillac will join the F1 grid in 2026, with Bottas one of several drivers linked to the project

“I know my timeline, when I want to know about next year and what plans do I need to make, which I think, August, more or less, is a pretty good target for that. But hopefully we'll hear something more soon.”

He continued: “I think they have a few drivers on the list. I would imagine my experience will help because now I've raced in three different teams, with one of the teams [that] had mega success. With Williams as well, [we] had some great results, so I hope I'm in a good position.

“For me, I actually see a very interesting project, something new to F1, an American team with maybe a different view to the sport. If I would be there as a driver, it would be actually very interesting because you can start from scratch.

“The team starts from zero. You could actually make a big influence on certain things, which direction to go, and that would be very motivating and rewarding when the success comes.

“I think the rule change is always a good point to jump in because you just never know, if you suddenly get it right you might actually be doing really well from the get-go.”

Ferrell will write the book for the project alongside Harper Steele and Anthony King. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


Eurovision may be turned into a Broadway musical. 


	Producer Lia Vollack is creating a new musical based on the Netflix's 2020 film, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, which starred Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams. Ferrell will write the book for the musical, alongside his co-writer on the film, Harper Steele, with whom he also stars in the documentary Will & Harper, and with Anthony King, who wrote the book for the Beetlejuice musical. 




	The show will feature music by Savan Kotecha, who was the executive music producer on the film, and will be directed by Moulin Rouge! and Just In Time director Alex Timbers. The producers did not give a production timeline for the show.

	The movie follows aspiring Icelandic musicians Lars Erickssong and Sigrit Ericksdottir as they are given the chance to represent their country in the Eurovision song contest. The film's original song “Husavik (My Hometown),” written by Kotecha, Fat Max Gsus and Rickard Göransson, was nominated for an Academy Award for “Best Original Song” in 2020. 


	“We are more than excited to bring Eurovision to Broadway,” Ferrell said. “The stage musical is a perfect place to continue our celebration of all the things we love about this amazing and unifying song competition.”


	“Will Ferrell and Harper Steele are my comedy heroes,” stated Timbers. “And when I first saw their joyful movie “Eurovision” during the pandemic, it buoyed spirits during a very dark time. With this stage adaptation, I can't wait to bring that same mix of heart, spectacle, irreverence, and awe to audiences across the world.”


	Ferrell made his Broadway debut in 2009, when he played President George W. Bush in a brief run of a one-man show called You're Welcome America. A Final Night with George W. Bush. 

	











	The Eurovision Song Contest has also signed off on the project. 


	“This is a stellar team for what I am sure will be an equally stellar adaption of a film the world loved. Our aim always is to bring the joy of the Eurovision Song Contest to more people globally – especially as we approach our 70th edition in 2026,” said Martin Green CBE Director, Eurovision Song Contest.

A look behind the battle lines of the industry's real-life Game of Thrones, from the ever-shifting power struggles at Disney to the secret machinations at the top agencies.


							By 

	Peter Kiefer



	There are many qualities that will be required to become the next CEO of the Walt Disney Co. Boldness. Intelligence. Poise. But at a recent off-site corporate retreat, Disney's current leader, Bob Iger, offered another piece of advice for a top-level executive: “You need to be more selfish.”


	What Iger meant, according to the source who relayed the comment, was that the execs vying to succeed him must be willing to go to extraordinary lengths to beat out their competitors. It might seem like odd advice coming from a leader with a public image as a smooth strategist whose roughest edge is that he works so hard, he showers in his office (sometimes twice). But as Iger himself has noted, when he ran ABC in the early 1990s, he employed what he called “soft autocracy” to push through ideas that met resistance. More recently, after hand-selecting Bob Chapek as his successor back in 2020, he reportedly spent the next two years undermining and outmaneuvering his successor behind the scenes, setting the stage for his own triumphant comeback. When it comes to advice about taking power, the man clearly knows what he's talking about. (Disney firmly denies that characterization of Iger's return as well as the executive's account of the conversation. “That is not something Bob said, or would ever say, and the incident described simply never happened,” says Chief Communication Officer Kristina Schake.)

	For the execs battling to succeed Iger, like entertainment co-head Dana Walden and parks honcho Josh D'Amaro, not to mention the whole cadre of Hollywood strivers eager for top jobs throughout town, being overly aggressive comes at the risk of looking desperate. You must be auditioning constantly but never overtly. As any outlet that covers Hollywood machinations knows, angry PR people working for top lieutenants call in a fury not only when their boss slips a rung on an executive power list but also when they are mentioned as a potential heir apparent. Because no one wants to risk looking like they are gunning for the crown before the king is ready to give it up.

	











	Welcome to Hollywood's modern Game of Thrones. All across the entertainment industry, there are pitched power struggles quietly being waged for the top gigs at CAA, Sony, Lucasfilm and other power centers that will determine the leadership of Hollywood's top institutions for years to come. That these are happening at a moment of precariousness for the industry writ large makes the stakes that much higher. But to many, it's a struggle long overdue. As THR reported in an October cover story, “The Big Squeeze: Why Everyone in Hollywood Feels Stuck,” as top-level execs have seemed frozen in place, those in their 30s, 40s and even 50s have been lamenting the existence of a “gray ceiling” that they say has cheated them out of their big moment. But in recent months, some cracks in that gray ceiling have started to appear.


	Last year, across the U.S. economy, a record 2,221 CEOs stepped down, the highest level of turnover since 2002. In Hollywood, too, a generational turnover is happening — if too slowly for some — and it's prompting all sorts of questions: What will this new cadre of leaders look like? How will they emulate the leaders who came before? And what will the metrics of success be in a town that's reinventing itself?


	Thanks to recent transitions, a few answers have begun to emerge. Some ascensions have been smooth, as when in September the 70-year-old Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra announced that he would be stepping down to be replaced by 53-year-old Ravi Ahuja. Some more complicated: In March, UTA co-founder Jeremy Zimmer, 66, stepped aside as CEO, choosing David Kramer as his successor — but not on his timeline. And a week later, Endeavor's $25 billion go-private deal with Silver Lake officially concluded the era of Ari Emanuel, 64, and Patrick Whitesell, 60, running WME — their long partnership ended in acrimony but their influence still looms large.

	











	Meanwhile, some top jobs remain up for grabs — at Disney, of course, but also at subsidiary Lucasfilm, where accomplished-yet-controversial CEO Kathleen Kennedy is expected to end her reign shortly after Iger ends his. And then there's the ongoing Trump-imperiled merger between Paramount and Skydance, which when consummated will see 71-year-old Shari Redstone pass the torch to 42-year-old David Ellison. That leadership team is set … if they only had a company to run.


	When it comes to leadership transitions, success (or failure) is often measured by the chaos that follows. “Right now, with all the chaos in the industry, stability is like a drug,” says Terry Press, president of strategy and communications at Amblin Partners. “You want to be around it and you want to be in business with it.”


	To that end, Universal and Netflix have both executed succession with little public drama. In November, NBCUniversal elevated Donna Langley — first hired way back in 2001 — to chairman (no big surprise after TV was added to her longtime gig running Universal Pictures). Netflix, meanwhile, executed two major succession maneuvers during the past 15 years: 2020's announcement that Ted Sarandos would join founder Reed Hastings as co-CEO and then, when Hastings stepped aside in 2023, the ascension of COO Greg Peters as Sarandos' co-CEO. (While media gossips speculated that Peters' promotion irked Sarandos, insiders say the two men have such different fiefdoms — Sarandos lords over Hollywood, while product-focused Peters is in Silicon Valley — that actual evidence of tension is slim.)

	











	Few entities have been able to pass the torch as smoothly. CAA, for example, has struggled to articulate what the future will look like should the three principals — co-chairman and CEO Bryan Lourd, co-chairman Kevin Huvane and co-chairman Richard Lovett — choose to exit after 30 years of shaping the most powerful talent agency in the world.


	“It's the defining issue for the industry today, and we need to be thoughtful about it because there are repercussions,” says Jeff Berg, who from his perch running ICM from 1985 to 2012 had a front-row seat to the previous power shifts that shaped the industry for a generation. He notes that the film and television industry might be shrinking but the companies that dominate it have gotten bigger thanks to acquisitions, consolidation, globalization and private equity. “If you get succession wrong,” he says, “you can't unring that bell for a while.”


	***


	David Kramer, 56, had been waiting — patiently — in the wings. Three years earlier, UTA laid out the road map for what a post-Jeremy Zimmer era would look like when it announced that Kramer would be assuming the title of sole president, a role he previously had shared with Jay Sures. The announcement effectively anointed Kramer as the heir apparent and made it clear that his friend and co-president Sures, who had clashed with Zimmer, would not be getting the top job. The question then became, when would Zimmer actually leave?

	











	A year passed. Then two. Then three, and still there was no clear timeline for Zimmer's departure. Agents began to whisper about when, exactly, he would step down. Then came, quite literally, a conflagration. Like thousands of others, Kramer, who lives in Pacific Palisades, was forced to evacuate his home following the Palisades Fire in January. He and his family were taken in by Sures, and the two lived under the same roof for several weeks, according to a number of sources. Two months later, it was announced — seemingly out of nowhere — that Zimmer would be stepping down as CEO. “The [timeline] was executed from the bottom up,” says a UTA source who declined to speculate on whether Kramer and Sures had hastened Zimmer's exit when the latter two were living together. At the agency, “There was utter unanimity about [the plan], and David is being celebrated. Is that a coup? I don't know. But Jeremy didn't get to choose the moment it happened,” says this source.


	Adds a top agent who is in his late 50s: “Power is not given. It's seized. It's not something that's gently passed on, and that's from time immemorial.” This agent contends that the generation that has run Hollywood for decades was hungrier and more aggressive than the one that followed. “To any of the 47-year-olds out there who are wondering what the fuck happened to their careers? My response to them is: Why didn't you push harder? Maybe this group turned out to be ill-equipped to seize it.”


	Or maybe the Hollywood culture has just changed too much to make that kind of Machiavellian behavior viable. In recent years, Hollywood has lost some of its mojo. Decades of consolidation, a pandemic, two strikes and a pivot to streaming have resulted in a much smaller industry with fewer top jobs and less money sloshing around. The culture has changed, too. Algorithmic tech companies dominate. Data prevails over instinct and experience. Many of the much-caricatured qualities that used to be hallmarks of Hollywood power are now recognized as toxic. The personalities that now run this town are much different than the swashbuckling moguls who came before.

	











	Take Zimmer, for example. He came up at a time when the industry was full of swaggering personalities like the late Brad Grey, Barry Diller, Amy Pascal and Michael Ovitz. Like them, Zimmer is known as a tough and savvy operator who as a boss could be both condescending but also wildly charismatic. His successor, Kramer, meanwhile, is as close to a universally beloved figure as you can find in this town.


	A similar phenomenon has taken place at WME. Emanuel and Whitesell are larger-than-life. But agency co-chairmen Richard Weitz, 56, and Christian Muirhead, 45, who themselves report to the disciplined, operationally focused WME Group president Mark Shapiro, 55, are steady, calm, almost gentle (a term rarely associated with agents). They're not exactly the dictatorial desk-pounding types, and some wonder if a softer style can work in a cutthroat industry: “If you want to stay in power for decades, you have to run an oppressive system, even if it's subtle,” says a manager. “Power must be concentrated, and there has to be a level of fear. At WME, you did not cross Ari, and at CAA, you still do not cross Bryan, and there had to be repercussions for people who violated that.”


	(And here it's worth noting that Emanuel and Whitesell, no longer on speaking terms, aren't exactly relinquishing their industry clout. Emanuel, who still manages a few clients, is CEO of TKO Group Holdings, owner of WWE and the Ultimate Fighting Challenge. Whitesell launched WIN Sports Group, taking the NFL talent representation business of WME — and both men are walking away from the agency business several hundred million dollars richer.)

	











	“Richard and Christian are pursuing a different strategy,” says a WME source. “They're more about the collective and trying to set people up for success. Previous leadership was much more self-interested, reflecting the era they were raised in — what was going to get them to the top. “


	Producer Amy Baer, who started her career at CAA before becoming president of CBS Films, says: “The film and TV business has changed so drastically that I don't know the profile of the next generation of leaders. There are so many big open questions. It used to be easy to see who would get the top jobs because the way movies and television were made and distributed was predictable. Nothing is predictable anymore.”


	Maybe that unpredictability offers some small excuse as to how Disney botched things so badly on Iger's first exit. Needless to say, the do-over is now the most watched succession game in town (and maybe the world). Wanting to avoid another debacle, in January the Disney board added James Gorman, chairman emeritus of Morgan Stanley, to oversee the search, which remains opaque even to high-level Disney insiders.


	Still, sources say that D'Amaro — the parks and experiences chief — is now in pole position. The 54-year-old already was overseeing a $60 billion expansion of the parks business before Abu Dhabi — Disney's first new park since 2016 — was announced in May. He also is overseeing Disney's expansion into video games via a billion-dollar deal with Epic (the maker of Fortnite), which Iger views as a legacy project.

	











	One hurdle for D'Amaro is the continuing fallout from Chapek's disastrous run. Before his ascension, he also was the parks guy, and that showed in his inability to communicate with top Hollywood talent and their gatekeepers. D'Amaro has publicly tried to highlight the personal relationships he has with creatives to try to preempt that criticism. By contrast, Walden, the longtime television executive who has been rumored as a potential frontrunner since Iger returned, is a popular well-known figure within Hollywood's talent community. As Disney's first female CEO, her appointment also would carry major symbolic weight. One impediment for Walden, however, is her close friendship with Kamala Harris (which had been a boon just a few years ago). Given the vindictiveness of the Trump administration, it's hard not to see the relationship as a potential liability, unfair as that may be.


	Rounding out the shortlist of top internal candidates are Alan Bergman, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment, and ESPN honcho Jimmy Pitaro. The 58-year-old Bergman is a company man, having joined back in 1996, and is regarded as sharp and skilled at overseeing a portfolio that includes Marvel, Pixar, Walt Disney Animation and Lucasfilm. But replacing Iger — an unmatched brand ambassador who looks like talent — probably requires a magnetism that Bergman can't match (a liability he's said to be aware of).


	“This is the problem at Disney: How can you expect someone from theme parks to understand the process of making television and film? And how can you expect someone from television and film to understand how to work with the Chinese government?” says Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. “What's the old saying — nobody knows anything. In this case, it's nobody knows everything.”

	











	***


	As much as Hollywood likes to celebrate its buccaneer spirit, random events have played just as big of a role in determining who gets to rule. The 1994 helicopter crash that killed former Disney president Frank Wells would shape the industry for decades. Michael Eisner, Wells' No. 2 at the time, elevated himself to president, which led the then-43-year-old Jeffrey Katzenberg to leave Disney and later co-found DreamWorks. With Katzenberg gone, Eisner hired a 48-year-old Ovitz, who had co-founded CAA with Ron Meyer, to be his lieutenant. When Meyer left CAA to run Universal, it opened a leadership vacuum that was filled by a group of young agents that included Lourd, Huvane and Lovett.


	Rick Nicita was one of these so-called “Young Turks” who took over CAA. “It was an unwieldy succession plan, and I'm not quite sure how thought-out it was, but it was a plan,” he says. “And we were too young and naive at the time to think that we couldn't do it.” Over time, the original nine were whittled down to three, leaving Lourd, Huvane and Lovett in charge. They have given no indication that they plan to step aside anytime soon.


	“The idea that there's any succession plan at CAA is an illusion,” says a president of production at a major studio who is on the phone every day with at least one CAA agent. “You can sense it from everyone you talk to over there. Everything is in service of Bryan Lourd.” Another veteran questions why they should feel any pressure to leave: “The company is theirs so they can do what they want.”

	











	Some sources contend that the creation of internal boards within CAA spawned inflated titles for a handful of top agents, implying that a new batch of leaders was on the verge of taking the reins. That hasn't happened. Others accuse Lourd and Huvane of playing one generation of top agents against the next. “They have done that for 31 years and it absolutely works,” says a former top agent.


	Not long ago, the shortlist of potential successors included mostly agents on the talent side: Maha Dakhil (Tom Cruise, Natalie Portman), Joel Lubin (Taylor Sheridan, Glen Powell) and Franklin Latt (Pedro Pascal, Zendaya), along with Ida Ziniti (Steven Spielberg, Margot Robbie) and her husband, John Garvey (Chris Hemsworth, Rian Johnson). But with scripted content contracting and their sports business on the ascent, one source speculates the co-heads of sports, Howie Nuchow and Michael Levine, are in the mix.


	Dakhil, who has one of the best client lists in town, was long considered a prime leader in waiting. But in 2023, she was suspended from her leadership roles within the agency after she posted a captioned photo on Instagram that accused Israel of “genocide,” which she promptly took down and apologized for. She since has regained her footing, but some insiders believe the episode bought the principals more time to maintain the status quo.


	“It's a self-fulfilling prophecy,” says a source who recently left the agency. “If you don't empower and help the next generation grow, it reinforces the idea in Bryan and Kevin's head that they're the only ones who can do the job. And so of course then they can't leave.”

	











	***


	When discussing the difficulty of selecting new leadership in an embattled industry, one name comes up often: Jason Kilar.


	Kilar was appointed Warner-Media's CEO in May 2020, near the middle of AT&T's brief three-year ownership of the studio. With his degree from Harvard Business School and a tech-heavy CV, the 48-year-old came in with a mandate to shake things up. Sure, he had worked at Hulu, which gave him streaming experience, but he did not come up within the traditional confines of the film and television industry. These days, his two-year tenure running WarnerMedia is mostly remembered for Project Popcorn, the pandemic-era decision to release WarnerMedia's entire 2021 slate of films simultaneously in theaters and on streaming. The move was intended to boost subscriptions to then-fledgling HBO Max. And it did. But Project Popcorn came at a steep cost — and not just in the form of forfeited box office. It strained relations with the agencies and infuriated top talent like Christopher Nolan, who set up his next film (the massive hit Oppenheimer) at rival Universal. Warners is still dealing with Project Popcorn's fallout.


	Kilar's bold moves and harsh comeuppance beg the question: In an age of uncertainty, should Hollywood look to innovative but potentially disruptive outsiders or elevate from within?

	











	“Hollywood has always been much more tradition-bound than people think. It has its own rhythms,” says Nicita. “If the tenet now is to move fast and break things, that's not exactly in sync with the famous phrase ‘the past is prologue,' which still applies to the movie business.”


	Barry Diller concurs. “Hiring from the outside at the CEO level is an admission of failure,” says the IAC chairman and former Paramount boss. “Ideally, you bring someone in early in their career and they marinate in your enterprise, gain experience and succeed whoever is senior. That's by far the better process. Bringing in a CEO whom you don't know — and I don't care how many hours you interview someone, you don't know them — is a bad dice throw and rarely works.”


	Lucasfilm seems likely to follow that path in replacing Kennedy. Despite speculation about outside candidates, including former 20th Century head Emma Watts, insiders say the company seems most likely to promote from within. The current thinking is a scenario where chief creative officer Dave Filoni and production head Carrie Beck — both Lucasfilm vets — take co-head roles. Even as an arm of Disney, Lucasfilm remains, in many ways, a family business, and as a George Lucas protégé Filoni long has been considered a golden boy. But the knock against him is that he might be too steeped in Star Wars lore and risks steering a show into dense mythology that loses a broader audience. “He's not the Andor guy, he's the Ahsoka guy,” says one Disney insider. Beck, who joined the company in 2012, knows the ins and outs, but neither she nor Filoni has much film experience, which could be mitigated by Kennedy's continued presence as a producer on certain Star Wars projects, ensuring quality control in the short term.

	











	Sony went the other way — looking outside. When Vinciquerra stepped down in January, he quietly executed his own succession plan, having recruited Ahuja in 2021, a year after he abruptly left Disney in the aftermath of the Disney-Fox merger. Now Ahuja has a succession saga to sort out himself — at Sony's film studio.


	In May, he seemed to table the issue when he reupped 70-year-old movie boss Tom Rothman for several more years. According to insiders, Ahuja still believes in Rothman and wasn't keen on a big shake-up, not when the studio has momentum, is profitable and is about to undertake the ambitious and risky move of releasing all four of Sam Mendes' Beatles films in April 2028.


	The bigger question inside the studio is what Ahuja thinks of Rothman's two top lieutenants, Motion Picture Group co-presidents Josh Greenstein, who focuses on marketing and distribution, and Sanford Panitch, who focuses on production. In the past year, Greenstein has told numerous people that he'd likely leave Sony if Rothman were reupped. One scenario that's been floated is Greenstein reuniting with his friend and Skydance owner David Ellison after the Skydance-Paramount merger. Whether there's a place for Greenstein remains to be seen. Ellison has selected former NBCUniversal bigwig Jeff Shell as president, Dana Goldberg to run the film side and former Netflix content chief Cindy Holland to run Paramount+.

	











	Of course, all of them will answer to Ellison. Because, even in Hollywood, the one sure way to own the throne is to buy the kingdom.

""The Future of Entertainment"" was the topic in focus for the Swedish singer, songwriter, producer and co-founder of Pophouse Entertainment.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Björn Ulvaeus, the Swedish ABBA singer, as well as songwriter, music producer and co-founder of Pophouse Entertainment, may be 80 years old, but he continues to be excited to create and tell stories through music and beyond. That was one of the key messages of his appearance during a Wednesday “The Future of Entertainment” session at the first-ever SXSW London, which drew a huge crowd to the hip East London neighborhood of Shoreditch.


	In a wide-ranging discussion, he addressed writing a musical with the help of artificial intelligence, the London hit show featuring ABBA avatars and why his company is betting on Kiss to have success with a similar show.

	“Right now, I'm writing a musical assisted by AI,” the hitmaker shared on stage. While not sharing much detail on the project, he mentioned that it is a collaboration with a female creative partner and that he was about three-quarters through his work.


	So what is his experience creating music with AI? “It is such a great tool,” he told the SXSW London audience. “It's unimaginable that you can bounce back and forth with a machine, or a software, which can give you ideas to go in various different directions.” 


	But Ulvaeus also made one thing clear: “A misconception is that AI can write a whole song. It's lousy at that — very bad. And thank God! It's very bad at lyrics as well. But it can give you ideas.”


	He shared an example to illustrate a point. “You have written a lyric about something, and you're stuck maybe, and you want this song to be in a certain style. So you can prompt the lyric and the style you want, asking, ‘Where would you go from here?'” he explained. “And it usually comes up with garbage, but sometimes there is something in it that gives you another idea. That's how it works. It's like having another songwriter in the room with huge reference frames. It is really an extension of your mind.”

	











	Speaking of songwriting partners, Guardian music writer and on-stage interviewer Laura Barton asked Ulvaeus how AI compares to collaborating with ABBA partner Benny Andersson. “It's quicker and does exactly what you tell it,” he responded to laughter. “But it's not the same thing as having a songwriting partner.”


	More laughs ensued when Barton asked if Ulvaeus has ever asked AI programs to write ABBA lyrics. “It says, ‘No, we can't do that,'” he replied.


	But he shared that he and Andersson haven't only produced hits. “There was a period when Benny and I didn't quite know what garbage was,” he quipped. “There's proof of that. People don't listen to that.”


	The ABBA star currently serves as the president of CISAC – the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers. So he also had business insight to share on how the AI and music sectors should collaborate. “The AI music generators train on copyrighted material. They train on all the world's music. And for that, we feel that they should be paying something towards the songwriters and the artists and all those who actually created what they need to be able to create their AI models,” he emphasized. “I think it's slowly happening. There's a debate going on in the music and the tech industries about how that remuneration might happen. Also, the U.K. government is supposed to take decisions about how to regulate, how to look at AI and so is the European Union.”


	He then suggested that a likely model to follow with AI is that of streaming deals. “I think the model that is closest is the model that we have in streaming services where they have you subscribe, and part of the subscription goes back to the music industry, and that's what happens with Spotify, Amazon and all the others,” he said. “That one might be the one that applies to this as well, but AI is something completely different, so we don't know.”

	











	Ulvaeus co-founded Pophouse in 2014 together with EQT founder Conni Jonsson. The company acquires and develops entertainment brands within music, podcast and gaming. In 2022, it also began a push into music catalogue investments. On Wednesday, he highlighted that this has allowed him to work with music from such names as Avicii, Cyndi Lauper and Kiss.


	In 2021, ABBA unveiled their comeback with the release of the album Voyage and the virtual stage show ABBA Voyage in London, ticket sales for which topped the 2 million mark in its first 19 months. Ulvaeus discussed the success of the offering and how other musical acts will benefit from similar shows. “Kiss, we believe, could be a very interesting avatar experience in the kind of Marvel universe” in the digital age, he said.


	Indeed, Pophouse unveiled at the end of 2023 that “Kiss, the legendary rock band known for electrifying live performances over a 50-year career and sales of more than 100 million records worldwide, is marking the end of its physical existence by crossing into the digital world. The new Kiss avatar shows will be the second immersive, avatar-powered music concert project that Pophouse Entertainment is involved in — following the success of the ABBA Voyage show in London, where Pophouse is the lead investor.” 


	In Wednesday's conversation, Ulvaeus also discussed his continued appreciation of popular music, sharing that he currently enjoys Lola Young's “Messy,” from which he intoned a line of the chorus, and how artists can future-proof their legacies in a rapidly changing landscape, including AI, immersive experiences and touring.

	











	SXSW London runs through June 7. Penske Media, the parent company of The Hollywood Reporter, is the majority stakeholder of SXSW.

""Come and hear our music just as you did for decades,"" Young urged the U.S. President.

	Tyler Jenke



	As Neil Young prepares to tour the U.S. this summer, he's invited President Donald Trump to attend one of his shows as a way to remind him of “American values.”


	Young's comments appeared in a new post on his Archives website on Monday (June 2), which saw him ruminating on the current state of affairs in the U.S. ahead of the launch of his North American tour dates in August.

	“Our country and our way of life, that which our fathers and theirs fought for, is now threatened by our government,” Young wrote. “This is not what we voted for. This is our new reality. Our government is out of control, not standing for us. You can stand up for American values this summer, for our children and theirs.

	“When I tour the USA this summer, if there is not martial law by then which would make it impossible, let's all come together and stand for American values,” he added. “We will not be doing a political show. We will be playing the music we love for all of us to enjoy together. President Trump, you are invited. Come and hear our music just as you did for decades.”

	











	Young's invitation to Trump aligns with the President's previous comments about his fondness for the Canadian rocker's music. “He's got something very special,” Trump told Rolling Stone in 2008, reflecting on his numerous times seeing Young in concert and having him perform at his casinos. “I've met him on occasions and he's a terrific guy.”


	However, the pair have undeniably altered their opinions of each other since then, with Young having become increasingly more outspoken regarding Trump's policies since his first term as President. In April, Young had even noted that he feared constant criticism of Trump may result in a potential blacklisting from the country ahead of his upcoming tour dates.


	“If the fact that I think Donald Trump is the worst president in the history of our great country could stop me from coming back, what does that say for Freedom?” Young mused. “I love America and its people and its music and its culture.” 


	More recently, Young labelled Trump “out of control” in May after he made a Truth Social post which saw the POTUS describe Bruce Springsteen as “highly overrated” and “dumb as a rock,” while saying that Taylor Swift is “no longer ‘HOT.'”


	“Bruce and thousands of musicians think you are ruining America,” Young wrote in response to Trump's comments. “You worry about that instead of the dyin' kids in Gaza. That's your problem. I am not scared of you. Neither are the rest of us. You shut down FEMA when we needed it most. That's your problem Trump. STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT ROCKERS ARE SAYING. Think about saving America from the mess you made.”


	Young is currently scheduled to launch his forthcoming tour with the Chrome Hearts in Rättvik, Sweden on June 18, with North American dates set to begin in Charlotte, NC on Aug. 8

""It breaks my heart that so many people are going through so much – similar and worse,"" the singer stated on social media.

	Tyler Jenke



	British singer Jessie J has revealed that she had been recently diagnosed with “early breast cancer.”


	The musician (born Jessica Cornish) shared the health update on social media on Tuesday (June 3), telling her followers that the diagnosis came shortly before the release of recent single “No Secrets” in April. “I'm highlighting the word ‘early,'” she explained. “Cancer sucks in any form but I'm holding on to the word ‘early.'”


	As she continued, she revealed that she's been “in and out of tests” in the time since, but has decided to share her story with the world in an attempt to be more open about her journey, and also to give herself a chance to process the reality of her situation.

	“I also know how much sharing in the past has helped me with other people giving me their love and support, and also their own stories,” she explained. “I'm an open book. It breaks my heart that so many people are going through so much – similar and worse.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I'm getting to keep my nipples, that's good,” she continued. “It's a weird topic and a weird situation. And I know the press are going to say crazy stuff but you know what, to get diagnosed with this as I'm putting out a song called ‘No Secrets' right before a song called ‘Living My Best Life,' which was all pre-planned before I found out about this, I mean, you can't make it up.”


	Indeed, Jessie J's news comes shortly after the release of her single “Living My Best Life,” which arrived on May 16. In the caption to her Instagram post, the singer added levity to her situation, writing “No (more) Secrets and is it too soon to do a remix called ‘Living my breast life'?”

	











	In closing her video to fans, Jessie J explained that she will “disappear for a bit” to undergo surgery following her performance at the Summertime Ball in England on June 15.


	Jessie J's decision to be open and honest with her health journey aligns with her comments from July, in which she revealed a recent diagnosis of obsessive compulsive behavior (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD).


	“It's empowered me and honestly sometimes has overwhelmed me all at the same time,” she explained, noting that the information had made her think about her life in a whole new way. “If there is one thing social media has given me, it's the chance to relate, connect and heal with strangers that have kind hearts and are going through a similar thing. 


	“I have always been honest in the journey I'm going through in life.”

Today (June 4), Music Nation Copyrights Management, which handles music rights management in the United Arab Emirates, announced the company received formal approval to license, collect and distribute royalties from public performance and neighboring rights. The approval will deliver a vital new source of revenue for music rights holders, according to Music Nation.

	Through partnerships with performing rights organization BMI and digital global collective management organization SoundExchange, Music Nation will be the industry's first rights management organization capable of natively collecting performance, mechanical and neighboring rights. 


	“Today marks a pivotal moment for the UAE and Music Nation,” said Music Nation chairwoman Rasha Khalifa Al Mubarak in a release. “After years of careful planning, Music Nation is positioned to become a cornerstone of music licensing, empowering the Emirates' vibrant creative industry. As an Emarati, I am honored to establish a world-class music rights infrastructure that not only elevates local artists to greater heights, but also showcases our rich musical heritage and cultural traditions to the world.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Music Nation is part of a broad UAE initiative to support the creation of a thriving music ecosystem and to elevate the region's music industry by protecting the rights of music creators and compensating them for the commercial use of their work.  


	“The Ministry [of Economy] continues its efforts to develop an advanced system for the governance of copyright and related rights, based on global best practices. This is achieved by developing regulatory and legislative frameworks, stimulating investment in creativity, and supporting effective collective management systems that ensure the protection of rights and enhance the confidence of creators and musicians in the country's creative climate,” said undersecretary of the Ministry of Economy Abdullah Ahmed Al Saleh in a release. 


	He continues: “The collective management license for music plays an important role in promoting a creative culture in society, providing comprehensive protection for the intellectual property rights of musicians and artists, and providing mechanisms to ensure financial justice for artists and creators in the distribution of revenues and transparency in the collection and distribution of copyrights. This supports raising the competitiveness of the music industry in the country and making it an attractive destination for creative and cultural works worldwide.” 


	Music Nation will begin collecting royalties in the UAE for more than 2 million songwriters, composers, publishers, artists, sound recording owners and other music creators. That 2 million figure represents the combined copyrights held by clients of BMI and SoundExchange. Music Nation will collect and distribute royalties on their behalf in the UAE. 


	“We are thrilled to partner with Rasha, the Music Nation team and SoundExchange to ensure that music creators in the UAE have the opportunity to turn their passion into their careers by being paid for their creative work,” said BMI president and CEO Mike O'Neill in a release. “BMI has always been an unwavering advocate for the songwriters, composers and rights holders behind the songs the world loves, and we're excited to provide our music licensing infrastructure, expertise and deep experience fostering career development to benefit the region's incredible creators. There are endless possibilities ahead that Music Nation will deliver, and we look forward to a bright future together.” 


	The UAE and the broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region remain the fastest-growing music market in the world, with the IFPI reporting the territory expanded in 2024 for a tenth consecutive year. Music revenue in MENA last year climbed by 22.8%, outpacing the global average of 5.9% growth. 


	“This is a major milestone and a vote of confidence from the UAE Ministry of Economy in the combined abilities of Music Nation, SoundExchange and BMI,” said SoundExchange president and CEO Michael Huppe in a release. “We're excited to get to work establishing the region's premier collective management organization and serving creators with the same level of excellence we have for more than two decades in the U.S.”

The Chiefs champ celebrated his partner's triumph on Wednesday's (June 4) ""New Heights"" podcast.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	Swifties aren't the only ones celebrating the news that Taylor Swift purchased the masters to her Big Machine albums last week. Less than a week after the singer bought back the rights to her first six studio albums from Shamrock Capitol — the private equity firm that purchased them from Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings in late 2020 — for what sources told Billboard was around $360 million, her longtime boyfriend Travis Kelce weighed in on the news.


	In a trailer for Wednesday's (June 4) new episode of his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce, the siblings host former NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal, who just can't help himself when Swift's “I Knew You Were Trouble” comes on. Playing the Red hit on his phone and mouthing along to the lyrics “Once upon a time/ A few mistakes ago/ I was in your sights/ You got me alone,” Shaq was clearly feeling the news.   

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	As the hardcourt legend enthusiastically lip synchs to the tune, Travis and Jason bop along and smile, with Travis matching Shaq's hand gestures. “That's my favorite song in the world brotha,” Shaq tells the duo. “I love it.”

	











	Both Kelces clap and laugh at the news. “You know it,” Shaq adds. “Shout out to Tay Tay,” Travis says with a big smile on his face. “Just got that song back, too,” he adds as Jason fist-pumps and shouts “Hell yeah!” 


	“Just bought all her music back. So it's finally hers too man. I appreciate that dog,” Travis tells Shaq. It was the first public comment from Travis since the news broke last week via a letter from Swift about regaining control of Taylor Swift (2006), Fearless (2008), Speak Now (2010), Red (2012), 1989 (2014) and Reputation (2017). 


	In her note, Swift wrote, “I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away. But that's all in the past now. I've been bursting into tears of joy at random intervals ever since I found out that this is really happening. I really get to say these words: All of the music I've ever made… now belongs… to me.”


	While it took a few days for Kelce to weigh in, Swifties wasted no time in celebrating the news. Billboard reported that following the 11:30 a.m. ET announcement on Friday, early data showed U.S. activity around the singer's whole catalog — her six Big Machine albums, her subsequent albums and re-recordings on Republic — jumped to averaging nearly 35,000 consumption units for that day and Saturday (May 31), a 72.3% increase from the average daily activity in the previous 12 days from an average of 20,000 units.

	The Toronto International Film Festival is opening its 50th edition on Sept. 4 with a look back at one of the Great White North's own: legendary SCTV comedic actor-turned-comedy superstar, John Candy in the Colin Hanks directed, Ryan Reynolds produced new documentary, John Candy: I Like Me. 


	That second part of the title, of course, is a nod to Candy's famous line in John Hughes' Planes, Trains and Automobiles, when his goofy character Del Griffith stands up to the cynical Neal Page and exclaims, “I like me.” One of Candy's big breakout movies stateside was 1984's Splash in which he co-starred with Hanks' father, Tom Hanks.

	“Comedy fans all over the world grew up on John Candy's humor,” said Cameron Bailey, CEO of TIFF. “We love that John's global career started in Toronto, and we can't wait to share John Candy: I Like Me with everyone at this year's Opening Night Gala premiere. Colin Hanks has made a hugely entertaining film packed with some of Hollywood's biggest stars, but like John, this movie is all heart. For us, it's the perfect way to kick off TIFF's 50th edition.”“When you hear the name John Candy, your face lights up. He wasn't just a great actor; he was an even better person. People loved his everyman qualities, but they didn't know how relatable John really was. He went through the same struggles we all do, except now we talk about them. We are incredibly honored to have gotten to know the man better through this process and to bring the real John Candy to audiences starting with his hometown of Toronto,” said Hanks and Reynolds in a statement. John Candy: I Like Me, an Amazon MGM title, will debut on Prime Video this fall. Amazon MGM Studios also fired up SXSW with the Paul Feig directed movie, Another Simple Favor.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Disney's live-action Snow White  starring Rachel Zegler, which was mired in controversy from the moment before “go,” will debut on Disney+ on June 11.


	That's an 82-day window from the pic's theatrical release on March 21.


	This is where the truth will be told on the legacy of this Marc Webb-directed movie, which features songs from EGOT-winning team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and was produced by Wicked‘s Marc Platt. For it's on the streaming service that Disney recognizes a pic's popularity and worth, thus determining whether it will get sequels or future theatrical releases.

	











	It was on Disney+ that the studio first noticed the power of Moana and Lilo & Stitch, which led to a respective sequel and live-action feature adaptation. Moana 2 minted $1.059 billion at the global box office and has a live-action version set for next year, while Lilo & Stitch is about to cross $300M domestic, for a global cume well north of $634M and counting. The entire Lilo & Stitch catalog has mushroomed annually on Disney+ based on hours streamed, and the franchise has clocked more than a half-billion (546M) hours on Disney+ around the globe, with the original 2002 movie notching north of 280M hours viewed. Perhaps Snow White can whistle a happier tune at home on streaming.

Snow White, which was impacted by Zegler's comments about the princess, as well as her social media jabs at Donald Trump, went belly-up at the box office grossing $87.2M domestic (one of the lowest takes for a Disney live-action feature adaptation of a classic toon) and $205.5M worldwide. Gal Gadot co-starred in the movie as the Evil Queen.

	











	Set to a soundtrack that blends original songs with fresh takes on beloved classics, the film sees Snow White (Zegler) share her hopes in the heartfelt new ballad “Waiting on a Wish” — one of several soulful “contemporary kingdom” tracks that join timeless favorites like “Heigh-Ho” and “Whistle While You Work.”

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: A scammer has been reported to both the FBI and UK cybercrime agency after posing as well-known TV executives and asking writers to send them up to £2,500 ($3,300) to help get their scripts developed.


	Deadline has seen evidence of at least half a dozen British writers who have been contacted by a person pretending to be UK producer Charlotte Walls on the Stage 32 networking platform, asking them to submit ideas, sign an NDA and then pay a “refundable facilitation fee” of between £2,000 and £2,500. 


	The scammer also posed as another high-profile UK producer, who wished to remain nameless, and approached writers asking for money. In all, we are told by Stage 32 that around 100 messages were sent to UK creatives on the platform and about 25 people responded.

	Working with one writer, Anette Martinsen, we have tracked down what we believe to be the scammer's name, bank details and bank address. This information has been reported by Stage 32 to the FBI and by Martinsen to UK Action Fraud, a national reporting center for fraud and cybercrime that passes reports to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, which then decides whether to refer to local police forces for investigation. We are aware of at least one other report of the same scammer to Action Fraud. “Action Fraud can confirm that it received a report on 30 May 2025 and it is currently being assessed by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) at the City of London Police,” said a spokeswoman.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Stage 32 founder Richard Botto told us the scam is a “copy or extension of the same scam that has infiltrated Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, LinkedIn and X over the last three years.” He said Stage 32 “believes we have identified the perpetrator of this scam and are working with Action Fraud and the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center in an effort to bring them to justice.”


How it works


	Using a VPN to create a Stage 32 account from a foreign IP address, the scammer sets up fake profiles and impersonates producers like Catalyst Global Media's Walls. They then send writers a message like the one in the above image asking if they are interested in submitting material. If they respond saying they are interested, the scammer sends over a set of terms that say, “Should your project be identified as a strong candidate for development, we will proceed under a formal Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).”

	











	Following the signing of the NDA, the scammer says it requires a “refundable facilitation fee” of varying amounts between £2,000 and £2,500, which “serves as a demonstration of mutual commitment to advancing the project into early development and securing access to critical production infrastructure and strategic resources.” The scammer goes on to note that while this fee “may not be customary in every production arrangement,” “it is important to clarify that most professional producers and consultants charge substantial fees for their involvement.” “We fully understand that some creators may be seeking informal feedback or free evaluations,” it adds. “However, we wish to be transparent: our team invests significant time, resources, and professional leverage into every project we undertake.”


	We are not aware of anyone who has fallen victim to the scam and Stage 32's Botto told us “to the best of our knowledge, no one sent this ‘producer' any money.” Some writers told us they smelled a rat quickly due to the payment demand and the even stranger stipulation to sign an NDA simply to get a script into development. Others realized that the email address the scammer supplied was different to the company's email address on its website. The scammer pretending to be Walls, for example, was using a Gmail account. “Most people contacted recognized the scam, notified us, and the offending accounts were deleted and the IP's and emails blocked immediately,” Botto said. 


	Martinsen went along with the scam to see what she could uncover. Having agreed to the scammer's ‘terms' and signed a fake NDA, she was asked swiftly to send a £2,000 payment to a person called Agnieszka Falkowska, who banks with Barclays and whose bank address is listed in Peterborough, South England. When Martinsen didn't respond, she was quickly chased up and told that Agnieszka Falkowska works in the accounts department at Catalyst Global Media, although no such person in the Catalyst accounts team exists. At this point, Stage 32 was notified and contacted both the FBI and Action Fraud.


	We are aware of at least one other person who has also reported the name Agnieszka Falkowska and these same bank details to Action Fraud. Deadline has contacted the Gmail address the person calling themselves Agnieszka Falkowska was using and we have not received a response.


	Martinsen said “something didn't feel right” when she was contacted by the scammer via the fake Walls profile on Stage 32 about a comedy script she was developing titled In The Spotlight.


	“I talked to my friend Gina Lyons from Gobby Girl Productions who suspected it was a scam too,” Martinsen told Deadline. “I feel disappointed as you can imagine as it is tough being an older woman in the TV and film industry and I was of course hoping to get In the Spotlight made with a well respected company.”


	When Deadline contacted Walls last week to tell her she was being impersonated on Stage 32, Walls was mortified. “I'm devastated to have been caught up in a scam like this and genuinely shocked,” she said. “Writers are the lifeblood of our industry. It's more important than ever for people to be vigilant.”


	Another producer who has been impersonated and preferred to remain anonymous queried why these scammers are able to create fake profiles in the first place on platforms like Stage 32, and why they contacted so many writers before being caught. “There must be a way to check,” said the producer. “This is appalling. Our own reputations will end up being smeared and tarnished.”

	











	Botto said Walls' profile was “deleted within two minutes, much to her satisfaction.” “I speak frequently and repeatedly during my monthly Ask Me Anything broadcasts about how to protect yourself in this industry, including not to trust if a ‘named producer' is writing to you in broken English or through a suspicious email address,” added Botto. “As a writer, producer and actor myself who has been targeted by these scammers, I urge everyone to be vigilant and to do your due diligence.”


	Ellie Peers, General Secretary of the Writers Guild of Great Britain, said the guild's recent Is it a Steal? report, which found that 94% of writers who had paid to have their book published lost money, typically in the thousands, proves that “there is no shortage of people wanting to exploit writers online.” 


	“If writers are asked to pay someone for something that they should themselves be paid for, that is always a red flag,” added Peers. “This also shows the importance of always getting your writing contracts vetted by an expert before signing.”


	Another writer we spoke with pointed out that scams have become far more sophisticated and hard to spot in the age of AI, with platforms like ChatGPT able to easily replicate documents like contracts and NDAs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘My Eyes Are Up Here': Dakota Johnson Laughs Through Wardrobe Malfunction on Fallon","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/dakota-johnson-wardrobe-malfunction-jimmy-fallon/","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 02:41:35 GMT","

Dakota Johnson brought both charm and humor to her June 2 appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” The “Fifty Shades of Grey” star was mid-conversation with the host when she noticed that the plunging neckline of her Ferragamo dress was revealing more than intended.The visit marked part of Johnson's press tour for her upcoming film “Materialists.” As she took her seat next to Fallon, she gasped and said, “Oh, God,” while adjusting her dress.

A post shared by The Tonight Show (@fallontonight)

Despite the wardrobe challenge, Johnson kept her composure and sense of humor throughout the interview — a reminder of her unfiltered charm that fans have come to love.“This is the wrong outfit,” Johnson told Fallon while shifting uncomfortably.

Fallon quickly tried to reassure the Madame Web star by saying, “I think it's perfect.”

The interview continued with Johnson remaining poised and self-aware. At one point, she remained motionless in her chair, smiling while Fallon remarked, “Just don't move.”

As The Roots played a musical cue, Johnson joked again, “My eyes are up here,” drawing another round of laughter from the live audience.

Fallon looked upward dramatically and joked, “I can't even look there. I don't know what to do. Now, I'm confused.”

As the two laughed and tried to move past the mishap, Johnson, 35, became visibly distracted by the neckline. “Tell me if there's a problem,” she said.

Fallon responded with a chuckle, “There's almost a problem. But not quite.”

Unable to locate a blanket, Fallon handed her a tissue to use as a quick fix. Johnson tucked the napkin into her dress and quipped, “That's good. When I have a cold, that's what I do.”

Although the tissue only stayed in place briefly, it sparked plenty of laughs from the audience. Johnson eventually gave it back to Fallon, asking, “Do you want to keep this?”

Fallon joked in return, “I'm putting this on eBay this evening.”

The moment brought back memories of a similar incident from the previous year. While appearing on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” the strap of Johnson's Bottega Veneta dress came undone mid-interview.

“It just fell off,” she explained to host Jimmy Kimmel, who offered her Scotch tape to secure it. Johnson declined and continued the segment while holding the dress in place with her hands. “Well, I'll just hold it,” she said, then added with a laugh, “The movie is really good,” while promoting her film “Daddio.”

You finally land on what the name is and once we found out it was a girl, then Barbara became the name. If it was a boy, it would be Carl. The album is Barbara, and that's just who she is.

As the 42nd season of “Wheel of Fortune” comes to a close on June 6, 2025, it will mark the end of Ryan Seacrest's first season as host of the beloved game show. The longtime “American Idol” host took over for Pat Sajak in September, but the transition was far from easy. 

In an interview with Los Angeles station ABC7 on June 3, Seacrest admitted that he felt a “tremendous amount of pressure” taking over the iconic show and still doesn't feel fully comfortable after taping 195 episodes. 

A post shared by Wheel of Fortune (@wheeloffortune)

“Wheel of Fortune” legend Vanna White told ABC7 that the transition from co-starring with Sajak to Seacrest has been “seamless” and that he “makes it look easy.” 

But Seacrest said uneasily, “Most of the time. I still have to remember what I'm doing out there.”

“Let me be honest,” he told the outlet. “There was a tremendous amount of pressure that I felt coming into this. It's been built with Pat and Vanna for so many years, I just wanted people to feel comfortable and watch, and if we got a few more along the way, then bonus round, right? I'm thrilled that the loyal audience has accepted what we get to do together.” 

Seacrest's debut on the show was a slam dunk, according to Variety, which reported that it was “most-watched entertainment series in September across broadcast, cable and syndication.” By January, the Los Angeles Times had called Seacrest “ratings gold” on the game show. In March, “WOF” moved to second place behind “Jeopardy,” according to the U.S. Sun, but was still bringing in even more viewers than it did in September. 

A post shared by Wheel of Fortune (@wheeloffortune)

Among Seacrest's fans is White, who told ABC7, “This whole season, I have been smiling from day one. He's so easy to work with. He's fun. He's easygoing and he makes my job easy. You come to work and you make people happy. What could be better?” 

Seacrest also acknowledged that he's relieved he and White are comfortable enough with each other that they can ad-lib during the show, telling the outlet, “”We don't often know what we're going to say at the end of the show. It's 3-2-1 go! For me, that makes it fun and I think we get genuine laughter out of each other. We got to this stage, where at times we can read each other's minds.”

In April, White told TV Insider that she felt Seacrest came into the show with the best attitude, knowing he could never truly replace Sajak. 

“Ryan did his homework,” White she said. “He rehearsed and rehearsed and rehearsed. He also said to me, ‘I am not replacing Pat Sajak because no one could – ever. I am just stepping in.' That made me feel good because, as Ryan said, he's just stepping in – he's not trying to prove anything.” 

Seacrest and White will both return for season 43 of “Wheel of Fortune,” likely to start filming this summer. And although his return is not official, Seacrest is expected to host his 24th season of “American Idol” in early 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Adam Levine Unlikely to Return to ‘The Voice': Report","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/will-adam-levine-return-coach-2025/","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 13:48:11 GMT","

Fans were thrilled when Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine decided to return as a coach for season 27 of “The Voice” six years after abruptly leaving the show. But according to a report from the U.S. Sun on May 31, 2025, he's unlikely to be back anytime soon. 

An unnamed insider told the outlet that although Levine enjoyed the experience overall, he didn't realize how much he would miss the rapport he had with longtime coach Blake Shelton, who left the NBC series in 2023. 

A post shared by Adam Levine (@adamlevine)

Levine, 48, was one of the original coaches on “The Voice,” launching the show in 2011 with Shelton, Christina Aguilera, and CeLo Green. After 16 seasons, he shocked fans when he abruptly left the show in 2019, telling media outlets including “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” that he wanted to spend more time with his family. 

He announced his return to the series in June 2024, just before filming started on season 27 with Michael Bublé, John Legend, and first-time coach Kelsea Ballerini. 

In January, Levine told E! Online, “I just felt like it was time. I had some time to reflect and do my thing and be with my family. I was ready to do it, then the stars aligned and here I am.” 

But according to the insider who spoke with the U.S. Sun, Levine felt a “void” filming without the friendly, funny bickering and bantering he used to enjoy with Shelton, explaining, “Adam didn't realize how much his experience was made by having Blake on set with him until this season when he had to film without him.” 

The source continued, “He didn't enjoy this season as much as he anticipated, but he definitely feels Blake's void and misses him. That's not to say he doesn't like the other coaches this season, he does. But he didn't have as much fun as he did in the past with his buddy Blake.” 

The U.S. Sun's source told the outlet, “Adam's dream would be to return with Blake again, he desperately misses that guy. It'd probably kill it with the ratings.” 

But that's not likely to happen anytime soon, given that Shelton will launch his own singing competition in the fall of 2025 on CBS, called “The Road.” Shelton announced in November that he'd partnered with “Yellowstone” creator Taylor Sheridan to develop the competition series, which follows aspiring country stars out on the road. 

“No more shiny floors and studio audiences,” he said in a press release, clearly referring to his many years on “The Voice.”

No formal announcements about Levine's future on “The Voice” have been made, but he won't be part of season 28, which starts filming in July with Bublé, Snoop Dogg, Reba McEntire, and Niall Horan.

If you're a member of the film community at all, there's already a lot of charged emotion surrounding Mike Flanagan's “The Life of Chuck,” long before the heartbreaking, yet strangely joyous and often triumphant film even begins. 

It's not just that Flanagan and myself were speaking on the one-year anniversary of our mutual friend Scott Wampler's death. It's not just Flanagan's film is dedicated to Wampler. It's not just Flanagan's film is about someone dying before his time. It's also that Wampler is actually in this movie, in the background, smiling and full of life. I had no idea what my reaction would be to seeing Scott again, who I had not seen since we attended a Bruce Springsteen concert together (on a tour exploring the themes of loss). But, seated and waiting, I wasn't sad anymore. Or, to quote another famous Stephen King film, “I hope to see my friend.” And when I saw him, I felt joy.

 








Related Stories Natasha Lyonne: The Maverick Behind the Madness ‘John Candy: I Like Me' Documentary to Open 2025 Toronto International Film Festival 

“The Life of Chuck,” based on the early Stephen King novella of the same name, is a tough movie to explain without spoiling because it's told in three acts, out of order, with multiple actors playing the title role as we traverse Chuck's life. Its ambitious and abstract first act is the section best left experienced without fully revealing what's happening. After that, we meet Tom Hiddleston's version of Chuck — a segment that involves a showstopper of a dance routine. Then we meet young Chuck, played by Benjamin Pajak (who is fantastic), which brings the whole film together and explains the events we experience back in the first act. It's truly a remarkable film.

 










And Mike Flanagan wants you to know, this is certainly not a Stephen King horror film. Now, he doesn't want to compare his film to “Stand by Me” or “The Shawshank Redemption,” but the tone of “The Life of Chuck” is certainly more in line with those films than they would be, say, “Cujo.” 

Flanagan said he doesn't know if he pulled this one off or not (he did; and the good folks at the Toronto International Film Festival agree, as it won their top prize back in September), but he does know that no studio would ever agree to make something this structurally unusual. Instead, it was independently financed, allowing this already award-winning film to actually exist for all to enjoy.

The following interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.

IndieWire: I realize this is weird to say, but I've been dreading this interview a bit…

Mike Flangan: Yeah…

I've spoken to a lot of people who have seen this and there's been a wide range of reactions seeing Scott again. But when I saw him, it made me happy, and I wasn't expecting that.

It makes perfect sense. That spectrum of emotional reactions that we have to the people we've lost? I'm grateful that there are moments where we are really being confronted with the memory of someone that we've lost and inspires joy instead of sorrow. That's a great thing. That's a gift.

 










It's interesting. I was thinking back to Scott a lot in the last couple of days. A year ago today, on the day it happened, I was in Austin. And I was meant to have dinner with him and [Wampler's podcast partner and close friend] Eric Vespe. And we had texted that morning to confirm the plans. And then, that afternoon, he was gone. And Vespe and I still got together in a state of absolute paralyzed shock. This movie … I get happy to see him, too. And I've seen the movie enough, it makes me smile to see him there.

Again, I was shocked by my reaction. I'm glad it's not just me.

Yeah, I think that's perfectly human and great. Today, it's certainly kind of looming over the day, but not in a negative way for me. I'm finally back in LA after months in Vancouver and waiting for me was his issue of “Fangoria” with his set visit article in it, which I hadn't gotten to hold in my hand and read until this morning. Seeing his words and remembering him on set, o f him in the tent getting to watch the dancing sequence, he got to watch days of that. 

Yeah… I've been thinking about him a lot today. There will never be another. The last time I talked to him we recorded an episode of, he was doing a “Hellraiser” podcast…

Pinhead, the most reasonable villain. He was always adamant I watch “Hellraiser: Judgement” because Pinhead is at his most “middle manager paper pusher.” But I waited too long and never got to talk to him about it.
 










Yes! The most reasonable villain! And that podcast was the last extended conversation I had with him.

So, you made a movie.

[Laughs] I did.

About death.

Yeah, about dying young. About dying before your time. I think I get the most upset every time it occurs to me he'll never see it. That's the thing that kind of hits me.

The first act is so abstract compared to the other two that are more joyous. Was that the most difficult aspect? Getting that first act from page to screen?

It's the riskiest aspect of the movie. It runs the risk of really alienating people with despair and confusion. When I was reading the short story for the first time, I almost stopped reading it in the middle of that because it hit too close. And I was reading it in April of 2020, so right after lockdown started and it felt like the world was ending. And I was like, I don't know if I can keep reading this? 

But it is something I was conscious of going in, that we'd have this major tonal shift. That we'd have to pull people through a very despairing introduction and then hope they hold onto the ride long enough to shift gears into a full-blown dance sequence — then have to make it all work together. But it worked on the page, so it must be possible for it to work on the screen. And it was about just never dipping too far into the despair of it. We're telling an apocalyptic story but no one is running and screaming from the apocalypse.

 










But that's what felt real about it. In 2020, and even now, that's how it happens. Just, “this bad thing happened, so in a few weeks that means this other bad thing will happen.”

It hits me so different now. I think there are going to be cycles for me where every couple of years I'm going to be like, oh, that movie hits more uncomfortably than when we made it. Doing our final Dolby Vision and Atmos mixes back in February, seeing the fire footage in the movie on the news, two weeks after the LA fires … everyone here in the room working on it, it was like, oh shit, this just hit me in the stomach in a way it hasn't. And I've been living with it for three years now.

A surprising aspect of this film is when Tom Hiddleston's Chuck leaves the story and is replaced by the young Chuck, played by Benjamin Pajak, who is truly wonderful.

And he's not on screen for an hour! Then he shows up and owns it. It was never designed to be a piece that had a single protagonist. There's a title character, who is always present one way or another. And Tom's depiction of Chuck is certainly critical in the middle of the story and again at the end a little bit. But Benjamin really shoulders an enormous amount of the weight of the entire story. Because it's his story that defines Tom's. Then, retroactively, defines and explains Chiwetel Ejiofor's and Karen Gillian's and everybody at the beginning. It's a very weird thing that I've never had to do before: make a movie without a central protagonist. Chiwetel and I talked about it and he said, “I'm actually Chuck in the beginning.”

 










He is, yes.

Then his movie ends and it hands off to Tom's movie. And that movie ends and it hands off to Benjamin. And it's unique to the structure that King laid out. And we could only make this movie independently because I can't turn in a story that's structured that way to a major studio. It's like, “Who is the main character?” “Exactly!”

That always goes over well.

And I feel lucky we got to make exactly the movie I wanted to and lean into the strangeness and all the things you're not supposed to do in a contemporary movie. And I never knew if it was going to work or not. You never know. I will never know. But it seems to have worked well enough?

Wait, but I know. I'm saying, “It does work.”

But I exist in a very weird bubble where I will never know. I will believe that it does.

You won an award already.

Yes.

So there's that as some proof.

The biggest award of my career! By a lot!

Yeah, the Toronto International Film Festival's People's Choice is a huge deal.

I slept through it!

What?

I was so convinced we weren't a contender for it, I was asleep. My phone kept buzzing on the nightstand. It's like five in the morning and my agents are going crazy trying to get in touch with me. But I hadn't set an alarm to watch the announcement because I thought there was no way in hell.

 










Speaking of accolades, I've seen “The Life of Chuck” be described as, in comparison to other Stephen King adaptations, “more like ‘Stand by Me,' ‘The Shawshank Redemption,' and ‘The Green Mile.'” So, yeah, no pressure there.

Three of my all-time favorite films. I think “Stand by Me” is a perfect film. “The Shawshank Redemption” is a perfect film. To be held up at all in the same conversation as those movies is bizarre and amazing to me. It's important to point out, for the viewers who avoid horror who might avoid this movie because they see “Stephen King” — I love that's where we are pointing to remind people he's responsible for so much heart and so much heart in storytelling. If you're a Stephen King fan, I think you know it doesn't matter if it's horror or not. That heart and that empathy, that love of humanity is present in all of his stories.

“The Life of Chuck” does not have a rabid dog.

[Laughs] Exactly. There's no shapeshifting monster eating children. Or is there?

Neon will release “The Life of Chuck” in theaters on Friday, June 6.

If Hollywood is to be believed, life as a Catholic priest at the turn of the 20th century involved spending 75 percent of your time sitting in your office while people brought troubled women to you and asked you to determine if all of their problems could be explained away by demonic possession. So begins “The Ritual,” David Middel's excruciatingly generic horror effort that forces us to wonder whether the exorcism subgenre has any interesting juice left squeezing out of it — and then offers little in terms of reassurance on that front.

 










When Emma Schmidt (Abigail Cowen) begins experiencing night terrors, crippling fears of holy objects, and other signs of extreme distress, the clergymen in Earling, Iowa have differing opinions about how to treat her afflictions. Father Joseph Steiger (Dan Stevens), the young priest in charge of the local parish, is inclined to take a modern approach. Informed on the latest scientific developments, he sees a woman who needs psychiatric help, not evidence that Satan himself has infiltrated a human soul and needs to be exorcised. But the elderly (and eccentric) Father Theophilus Riesinger (Al Pacino) has other ideas. A lifelong believer in the ritual of exorcism, Theophilus won't be fooled by any of that newfangled science. He's determined to rely on old world methods to expunge the demonic presence from Emma, and the local bishop (Patrick Fabian), overrules Joseph and insists that they use his church to do it.

 








Related Stories ‘John Candy: I Like Me' Documentary to Open 2025 Toronto International Film Festival Jon M. Chu Warned His ‘Wicked: For Good' VFX Team That the Film Will Inevitably Be Memed 

What follows is so redundant that it barely merits a summary. Per usual, the old and new world methods clash over topics like whether to physically restrain Emma to a bed, and Theophilus is convinced that anything that looks like rational evidence against his ideas is just Satan manipulating everyone's brain. Despite all of that, Joseph gradually realizes that his nutty companion is correct about Satan being in the room with us. (Just once, I'd like to see one of these movies where the rational priest is vindicated after the crackpot's tactics completely fail and leave the church in a shambles.) While the film occasionally makes an attempt at a jump scare, it doesn't offer nearly enough spectacle to justify its strict adherence to plot beats we've seen so many times before.

A certain breed of cinephile might read this and think that the prospect of current Al Pacino playing a borderline senile exorcist with a thick German accent in a cheap B-movie is enough to guarantee a campy good time, narrative flaws be damned. But the final nail in the coffin of the film's watchability is how much effort the octogenarian star actually puts into the role. He plays the character perfectly straight, ensuring that there's no memeably bad outburst or low effort moment in a film that really could have used one. 

 










The film's greatest sin is how utterly boring it is, from its straightforward Catholic rituals that give way to predictable scares to the shaky handheld camerawork that doesn't fit with a movie that never makes any attempt to brand itself as found footage. And it appears that its filmmakers (or at least its marketing team) hope to rectify that by branding it as the one “real” exorcism movie. “The Ritual” leans into its status as a “true story” of one of the most documented exorcisms in American history, using title cards to note that Father Theophilus Riesinger was eventually profiled in Time Magazine and that the events influenced other movies like “The Exorcist.”

It's a flimsy platform to stake an entire movie's existence on, as the claim is impossible to prove, and those who want to believe it will say it's impossible to disprove. We know that Emma Schmidt was a real woman who had an exorcism performed on her by these two men, but we don't have any way of knowing that there was an actual demon inside of her. For a film that treats historical realism as a primary selling point, “The Ritual” has no real grounds on which to assert that it's less fantastical than any of the better exorcism movies out there. 

An XYZ release, “The Ritual” opens in theaters nationwide on Friday, June 6.

On June 5, the IndieWire Honors Spring 2025 ceremony will celebrate the creators and stars responsible for some of the most impressive and engaging work of this TV season. Curated and selected by IndieWire's editorial team, IndieWire Honors is a celebration of the creators, artisans, and performers behind television well worth toasting. We're showcasing their work with new interviews leading up to the Los Angeles event.

A conversation with Natasha Lyonne is to experience a gravel-voiced one-woman film school with a carousel of cultural references that range from “The Long Goodbye” to Lou Reed to quantum physics.

But what makes Lyonne singular (and why she's being recognized with the Maverick Award at this season's IndieWire Honors) is more than her encyclopedic mind or her distinct creative stamp. It's her ability to turn lived experience into genre-busting, soul-searching, radically original storytelling.

In a TV landscape dominated by serialization, Lyonne and co-creator Rian Johnson took a left turn with Peacock's “Poker Face,” a classic case-of-the-week mystery format with a twist. The heroine is Charlie Cale, a human lie detector with a beat-up car and an even more battered moral compass, and she's received plenty of “Colombo” comparisons.

 










“It's quite intentional that I walk around like a rumpled detective,” Lyonne told IndieWire, “but I'd say I've seen him in more Cassavetes films than ‘Columbo' episodes, if I'm being honest. Which I might as well be, given the theme of the show.”

As a result, “Poker Face” doesn't feel like a riff or homage. She and Johnson developed a character who feels both timeless and unmistakably hers. “It's not really about assessing the landscape,” Lyonne said. “It's about inner curiosity. That's more likely to resonate than paperwork.”

Lyonne's commitment to crafting characters with depth and agency began with co-creating Netflix's “Russian Doll.” The mind-bending, Emmy-nominated series riffed on time loops and existential dread while feeling deeply personal.

“At the risk of sounding pedantic, I do think it's important to mention that — as it so often seems with women — someone assumes a character was created for them,” she said. “Let's be really clear: That never occurred. This character exists because, like any good old-fashioned entrepreneur, I saw a void.”

Lyonne was never going to fit in the “beautiful, but she doesn't know it” roles. She's gorgeous but, with her wild red hair and irrepressible intellect, she doesn't look or sound like anyone who's unaware of exactly who she is. To find the work, Lyonne had to create it.

 










“In modern times, there were no women running around like Philip Marlowe on our screens. Surely, that was a hole I could fill,” she said with a laugh. “I knew nobody was casting me as a ‘Roller Girl' type, you know what I mean? That's Heather Graham's part, and Meryl Streep had her section. Well, I found mine in the basements of YMCAs and Murray Hill in Manhattan, where I would watch a lot of noir films alone in the middle of the day after I dropped out of Tisch.”

 “Mae West made her choices,” she added. “I made mine.”

Lyonne builds her shows from the inside out. She's a writer, director, and producer with her own company, Animal Pictures, which she co-founded to support boundary-pushing creators. She's now prepping her first feature, “Uncanny Valley,” which she's co-writing and directing with Brit Marling (“The OA”).

Lyonne and Marling became fast friends after they were invited to a series of what Lyonne describes as “backdoor Hollywood AI meetings.”

“I adore Brit Marling,” she said. “She's a fucking genius. Because of our sci-fi leanings, we'd each developed a deep interest in this space. And in these meetings, it became clear that a lot of what was already happening was AI. Brit and I looked at each other and realized: this is real. It's fascinating. We're both interested in this, and we're both kind of punks, raising our eyebrows at how it's all going down. So we got this idea: attack it sideways and head-on. I think it's going to be a very cool movie.”

 










In fact, she cracked, “It's not announced yet, but Joe Pesci is the star of ‘Uncanny Valley.' He plays my daughter. Thanks for this conversation, and thanks to IndieWire for this Maverick Award. As a maverick, it's really important that everyone knows Joe Pesci plays my daughter in ‘Uncanny Valley.' It's been said, so now it's fact. Throw it on Wikipedia.”

That kind of humor, bone-dry and self-aware, is part of what makes Lyonne's voice so necessary. But underneath it all is a deep understanding of what it means to survive, create, and evolve in an industry that rarely makes space for women like her.

Her advice to others, particularly women taking creative control, is simple and hard-earned: Hang tight. Stick to your guns. Don't worry about being palatable, or overthink the wins and losses. “It's all grist for the mill,” she said. “Self-respect is the answer. And blood on the page.”

That's why Natasha Lyonne is this year's Maverick. And why Joe Pesci better clear his schedule. “There is no reality,” she said. “It's what you make it. Where you're at dictates how you receive the world.”

“Poker Face” Season 2 is now streaming on Peacock.

There's a moment when Melanie Lynskey talks about Natasha Lyonne that kind of says it all.

“If she chooses you, you're going to be her friend,” she said. “That's just it.”

For more than 20 years, Lyonne and Lynskey have been ride-or-dies bonded by weird nights, great scripts, and deep mutual respect. They've starred in three movies together, including “But I'm a Cheerleader” and “The Intervention” (that one directed by their great pal and “Cheerleader” co-star Clea DuVall).

 










So as Lyonne gets her flowers at IndieWire Honors, Lynskey is here to remind us why there's nobody like Natasha.

“She's always been insanely talented,” Lynskey said. “But now, she knows exactly what she's capable of — and the world knows it too.”

That includes writing, directing, producing, and starring in not one but two groundbreaking shows (“Russian Doll” and “Poker Face”), all while championing the people she loves. “If she loves you, she wants you to be doing everything to the maximum of your abilities,” Lynskey said. “She's everyone's biggest cheerleader.”

Their friendship kicked off in Toronto during filming for the 1999 film “Detroit Rock City,” when a shy, New Zealand-based Lynskey arrived on set. “Natasha took me out for the night and that was it. We were bonded for life,” she said. That night included a Halloween KISS concert, an attempted casino trip (denied at the door: no passport), a persistent limo driver trying to crash the afterparty, and vodka. Lots of vodka. “If we tried that now, it would take me two weeks to recover.”

Lynskey still lights up when she talks about how Lyonne works. “I really kind of envy the looseness she has in her body, like the drapey-ness and the kind of physicality that can be a little bit masculine at times. It's really fun,” she said. “She's very loose, especially in ‘Poker Face.' She has a real sort of looseness to her limbs. And I feel like there's always a part of my brain that's like, ‘What do I do with hands?'— there's just this swagger. Meanwhile, I'm over here like, ‘What do I do with my hands?'”

 










Even before “Poker Face,” Lyonne's spirit helped shape Lynskey's path — sometimes literally. When Lynskey was auditioning for the role of a New Jersey girl in “Coyote Ugly” and couldn't afford a dialect coach, she leaned on her interpretation of Lyonne (never mind that she was very much born and raised on the Upper East Side). “It morphed into something else after I got cast, but I kind of based it on Natasha, yeah,” she said with a laugh. “I don't know how impressed she was about that: ‘I did that audition, too.“ I was like, ‘Well, sorry about that.”

Now, even as Lyonne's busy running the show, she's still hyping her friends. “She's everyone's biggest cheerleader. I remember one time I got a message from her, and she was looking for acting coach or a dialect coach and she said, ‘You're the best actor I have in my phone.' Such a specific compliment. I loved how it wasn't hyperbolic,” Lynskey said.

They don't see each other as much as they'd like, although Lynskey has an upcoming guest-star slot on episode 8 of “Poker Face” — but when they do, nothing's changed. “We had this great night recently, just hanging at Natasha's house and talking for hours. That's the good stuff.”

So what's left to say?

“She's such a treasure to all of us,” Lynskey said. “There's nobody like her, so it's really so special to see her being recognized.”

Jon M. Chu is bracing himself already for the “Wicked: For Good” memes. After the first part of his sprawling epic made history as the highest grossing movie musical of all time, Chu and his VFX team felt the pressure to be more than “good” once more. The driving force? The viral memes that “Wicked” spurred. 

“When we're in VFX reviews, I'm like, ‘Guys, this is going to be a meme. So if you're not proud of this and you don't want to see this repeated a thousand times in your feed, then just get it right,'” Chu told Vanity Fair about being in post-production on part two. “It allows us to all push ourselves again and not rest on our laurels.”

And there are more than a few laurels the “Wicked” team could be resting on: The film landed 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Actress for Cynthia Erivo, and Best Supporting Actress for Ariana Grande. It went on to win two Oscars for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. Meanwhile, Chu took home Best Director at the Critics' Choice Movie Awards, and the feature won a Golden Globe for box office achievement.

In “Wicked: For Good,” Erivo and Grande reprise their roles of Elphaba and Ariana Grande, with the political turmoil of Oz throwing their friendship into disarray. Chu previously wrote on X that the story of “Wicked” had to be split into two parts to accommodate the intensity of the plot. 

“As we prepared the production over the last year, it became impossible to wrestle the story of ‘Wicked' into a single film without doing some real damage to it,” Chu wrote in April 2022. “As we tried to cut songs or trim characters, those decisions began to feel like fatal compromises to the source material that has entertained us all for so many years. We decided to give ourselves a bigger canvas and make not just one ‘Wicked' movie but two! With more space, we can tell the story of ‘Wicked' as it was meant to be told while bringing even more depth and surprise to the journeys for these beloved characters.”

“Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” were shot at the same time, with Chu now telling VF that certain parts of “For Good” were actually filmed prior to the central storyline of “Wicked.” The out of order production no doubt was a shift for the ensemble cast, with Jonathan Bailey telling IndieWire that “Wicked: For Good” has a big “tonal shift.” 

 










“The world gets heavier and more complicated and there's just that pumping sense of hope and joy and resilience and all the things that we love about Elphaba's journey that I can't wait for,” Bailey said. 

His co-star Grande further told IndieWire that the entire production was meticulously curated for the best vibes.

“Every single person involved led with that same intentionality and thoughtfulness,” she said. “And nothing wasn't thought of. Every page on the books that are on the table that you don't even get to see opened, they're written about Ozian history. And the journals next to our beds are filled with scribbles. It's a real world when we all care as much as everyone else. And we all walk into the space with the awareness that everyone feels this same responsibility. I'm not alone in that.”

Have you been in a prominent but underappreciated indie rock band within the past 15 years? Does your musical expertise include Cristal Baschet, fiddle engineering, or “ambient sculpture?” Have you ever been favorably reviewed by this website? If you answered “yes” to one or more of these questions, you might be on Miley Cyrus' new album.

Something Beautiful, Cyrus' follow-up to her 2023 LP Endless Summer Vacation, features a credit roster that rivals the length of this review. It is a concept album without a concept: “My idea was making The Wall, but with a better wardrobe and more glamorous and filled with pop culture,” Cyrus told Harper's Bazaar last fall. Executing that vision, however thin, required an army of indie rock vets: Foxygen's Jonathan Rado, Alabama Shakes' Brittany Howard, the War on Drugs' Adam Granduciel, Nick Hakim, Alvvays' Molly Rankin and Alec O'Hanley, Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner, the Lemon Twigs' Brian D'Addario, and Haim's Danielle Haim, just to name a few. Cyrus executive-produced Something Beautiful with Shawn Everett, who also plays a number of instruments on the 13-track album—a tonally confused entry in Cyrus' catalog that lurches between hi-fidelity art rock and soggy, warmed-over pop. Directionless and thematically vague, it starts with a bang and ends in a whimper.

Cyrus released “Prelude” and “Something Beautiful” as the album's lead singles, a choice as misleading as making them the opening tracks. They are Something Beautiful's best songs, and the only pieces that audibly justify Cyrus' sprawling team of collaborators. Though their initial presentation was laughably “high concept” (in both music videos Cyrus preens about in archival couture), the songs themselves contain the most interesting arrangement and production Cyrus has ever recorded to. “Prelude,” co-written by Cole Haden of New York experimental group Model/Actriz, is part Tangerine Dream sci-fi score, part spaghetti Western overture, recorded with a dizzying amount of equipment: Moog, Fairlight CMI, saxophone, violin, Barr-Fox Wurlitzer Theater Organ, cello, viola, Minimoog. Cyrus does her best Laurie Anderson impression atop the layered arpeggios; spooling out stoic but evocative spoken word, her voice is slightly mottled, as if coated in fine ash. It almost works, except for the clumsy, inflated language (“Like when following an image from a train/Your eyes can't keep the passing landscapes from being swallowed into endless distance”).

With its heartsick soul melody, “Something Beautiful,” could have been another cloying Silk Sonic ballad for candlelit bubblebaths. But halfway through Cyrus chucks a live hairdryer in the water and the song erupts in a squall of saxophone, frothing hi-hat, and muscular guitar courtesy of Adam Granduciel. This kind of jazz-rock posturing might seem like a shallow plea to be taken seriously, but as someone who has always longed for Cyrus to make more interesting music (The voice! The charisma!), “Something Beautiful” feels more like the earnest experiment of a pop star famous for taking artistic risks, to varying degrees of success.

Even in its more maudlin verses, “Something Beautiful” is the strongest display of Cyrus' extraordinary voice on the album. Its texture and fidelity enriches her smoldering alto, heightening each crack at the back of her throat. Her voice sounds at once sculpted and intimate, cradled by Nick Hakim's light touch on Rhodes piano and Maxx Morando's restrained snare beat. The problem is: This is as good as it gets. The opening duo of “Prelude” and “Something Beautiful” present a real bait-and-switch dilemma on an album bloated with generic, dated, and lyrically incoherent pop-rock. After the opening fakeout, Something Beautiful coasts along to reheated disco, flaccid fist-pumpers, and schmaltz balladry of a bygone era.

“More to Lose” lands in the latter category, with its soft saxophone and treacly piano keys hinting at some deeper well of experience. It is bad but somewhat intriguing, if only because mainstream pop doesn't really sound like this anymore—the tearjerkers Bryan Adams mastered on “(Everything I Do) I Do It for You” from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, or “All for Love” from Disney's The Three Musketeers (as performed by Adams, Rod Stewart, and Sting). Sadly, “More to Lose” doesn't slap as hard. A plaintive tale of adult concessions, the song chronicles a dissolving relationship in the faintest outline. The title refers to a spare but very poignant line about how a breakup can rob you of things you never got to experience: “I just thought we had more to lose,” Cyrus sings. “More to Lose” is weighed down with the ghosts of memories never to be shared: A family. A fully booked vacation. The bedsheets on backorder. Unfortunately, Cyrus quickly abandons her efficient phrasing for throwaway lines like: “The TV's on but I don't know/My tears are streaming like our favorite show.”

Something Beautiful is crammed with nonsensical lyrics that operate on their own unworldly logic, always in service of a rhyme scheme or syllabic meter rather than actual meaning. In other words: They're patently dumb. A few favorites: “In my dreams I see your face/It hits me like a thousand trains.” “I'm losing my breath, yes/Boy you're marking up my neck-lace.” “A tower that's made of risqué, rude temptation.” A tower made out of what, exactly? What do you mean marking up a necklace?! Cyrus—she of “Butterflies fly away… Party in the U.S.A.” fame—should know that if the songs hit hard enough, we wouldn't be asking a damn thing.

The most egregious missteps on Something Beautiful are its pop songs. There is nothing remotely close to the tepid but inviting hooks of “Flowers” within its 52-minute runtime, despite many attempts at funk and disco-tinged hits. “Easy Lover” feels like another Bruno Mars castoff, with its walking bassline, stomping beat, and chirping “oohooh-ooh-oohs.” “You've got the love I always needed,” Cyrus rasps over Brittany Howard's electric guitar. “Tie me to horses and I still wouldn't leave ya.” This one stilted line sums up the entire song: It's referential, uninspired, and really just a rearrangement of pieces that don't quite fit in their new configuration.

“Walk of Fame” and “Every Girl You've Ever Loved” are atrocious for similar reasons; the sanitized disco beats, the weak self-mythologizing, the drag-diva vocab that's already been co-opted by major corporations. “Walk of Fame”—as in, “Every time I walk, it's a walk of fame”—can't be saved by Danielle Haim's guitar or Howard's celestial vocal loop. In fact, Howard helps tank the song by saluting Cyrus with the lamest pop eulogy of all time:

You'll live foreverIn our hearts and mindsAn ageless pictureA timeless smileWe'll wear it on our T-shirtsA star buried in the pavementEveryone will walk around it

Naomi Campbell has an even more pointless task on “Every Girl You've Ever Loved,” only her lines are so absurd they might be comedic gold. In between Cyrus' arena-rock belting, Campbell half-whispers reverent non-sequitors like, “She has the perfect scent,” “She speaks the perfect French,” and “She never wears a watch, still she's never late” in a saggy attempt at ballroom panache. Cyrus has called Something Beautiful her “gayest” album yet, but its “gayest” song sounds like it was engineered by a marketing team trying to spike Fiji Water sales during Pride.

That's the reigning issue with Something Beautiful: It is more interested in signaling than embodying. Cyrus can access the best musicians and producers, and she can register a genuine interest in more subversive art, but few songs on her new album feel like they emerge from experience, or a burning desire to explore new sounds. It's possible Cyrus is completely aware of her own limitations here. “I'm in the record business,” she recently told The New York Times. “When I sign a contract, they're buying records that they wish to sell, so I understand that I am setting myself up to become merchandise.” But then Cyrus said something so vulnerable it was alarming: “At one point in my life, I look forward to just being an artist, untied, untethered. At some point I'll get to do that.” I wonder what that will sound like.

It's been 30 years since Portishead's Dummy took home the Mercury Prize and cemented Bristol's trip-hop underground, but its woozy turntablism echoes across the pop spectrum today: the pitch-shifted melancholy of Sky Ferreira, the bass-heavy brooding of a.s.o., the dreamy reverb of crushed. The juxtapositions and subversions that made the genre groundbreaking at its inception still have an obvious appeal. Trip-hop's contrast of wistful vocals against steely, computerized rhythms is an easy aesthetic shorthand for nihilism, existentialism, and accelerationism. It's theoretically perfect, in other words, for sighing deeply while reminiscing about “morphine kissing” and “acid tripping,” as yeule does on their fourth album, Evangelic Girl is a Gun.

yeule has wielded nostalgia as a weapon before: 2023's softscars used the serrated edges of nu-metal and grunge to amplify their rage, and a year prior, Glitch Princess incorporated shades of mid-2000s indie folk into its complex digital circuitry. Much of yeule's artistic output is preoccupied with dissociation and disconnection—rotting, maiming, and otherwise escaping the flesh. Their strongest songs use nostalgia to ground that disembodiment in the undeniably human: the strikingly simple strum of an acoustic guitar on “dazies,” a bloodcurdling scream on “x w x.” But on Evangelic Girl is a Gun, yeule deflates much of what created that productive tension; these songs offer disappointingly little to differentiate themselves from their already heavily referenced source material.

It's not that Evangelic Girl is a Gun is a challenging listen—the slow, shuffling rhythms and bluesy basslines on “Tequila Coma” and “What3vr” will go down easy for fans of Moby and Massive Attack, while “VV” recalls the 2000s soft rock of Ingrid Michaelson and Natasha Bedingfield. With production from an illustrious group including A.G. Cook, Clams Casino, and Mura Masa, the album sounds technically sharp, filled with small flourishes—the click of a gun reloading on “Saiko,” the sound of a camera flash on “1967.” But it is, despite the suggestion of sex and violence in its marketing, ultimately tedious.

At 31 minutes, Evangelic Girl is a Gun is the shortest record yeule has released, but repetitive choices make it feel far longer. A stifling, slow-moving beat seems to carry the first two songs forward at a morphiated drip. Moments on “Eko” and “1967” that should feel climactic—repeating the song's title as breakbeats ricochet, screaming about a lover going off to war—are lost in the background, competing against a small army of vocal filters. “Skullcrusher” is perhaps the worst offender, so numbingly loud and slow it almost sounds as if it were accidentally exported at half speed. There is no emotional anchor here like the onslaught of “dazies” on softscars, nor a moment of differentiation like the shocking vulnerability of “Don't Be So Hard on Your Own Beauty” on Glitch Princess. Despite its apparent intricacies, Evangelic Girl is a Gun feels oddly flat.

Maybe the album's sameness would feel less glaring if the lyrics had more to offer than fatalistic bromides. On “The Girl Who Sold Her Face,” they stretch the opening lines—“Don't go on your phone/Just pretend to be dead”—just a bit further than the melody naturally allows. It hangs awkwardly in the air before hitting the not-quite rhyme of “They said ‘Everyone loves you'/Yeah, them but not the feds.” Other songs, like “Saiko” and “Tequila Coma,” feel like B-sides from softscars, revisiting that album's themes of self-destruction. This superficiality bottoms out at “Dudu,” which pairs lyrics that read like LiveJournal statuses—“Cut a line/Have a cry/Unstable butterfly”—with a maddeningly endless repetition of the titular phrase. It's both too saccharine and too cynical, a nursery rhyme for the ketamine crowd.

For its flaws, Evangelic Girl is a Gun glimpses the potential for a new, more embodied sound from yeule: There is a levity in their voice here as they finally shake some of the heavy digital processing that earlier albums wielded like a cyborgian shield. But on their fourth album, yeule can't help but be overwhelmed by the dense production that surrounds them, buckling under the immense weight of their inspirations.

Shortly after the release of his first solo album, 2020's Serpentine Prison, Matt Berninger fell into a depression so deep that he could neither write nor sing. Having spent two decades detailing smoke-thick melancholy as the lead singer of The National, the sudden inability to articulate this all-consuming darkness was debilitating. On The National's twin 2023 albums, Laugh Track and First Two Pages of Frankenstein, he confronted that year in paralysis head-on. Now, on his second solo album, Get Sunk, he seems determined to leave that bleak period behind him for good. But his more positive outlook comes at the expense of the rich detail and self-analysis that brings Berninger's work with The National to life.

From the outset, Berninger gestures at epiphanies without exploring them. Opener “Inland Ocean” builds around a tremolo guitar with little flourishes of wind and strings as Berninger sings about something imprecise: “Lost cause, I have no emotions.” A pared-down choir returns to that line as though it's a mantra, but the lyric is so vague that it comes off less as profundity and more as a stray thought. The same is true on the following track, “No Love,” where Berninger sketches the feeling of a location but never returns to shade in the empty spaces. “This place has a sinking feeling/The energy's so strange,” he sings, “It doesn't have anything to do with anything/The vibes aren't right.” Major chords and uncluttered mixes undercut any uneasiness those lines might have conjured.

These songs lack Berninger's gift for rendering the mundane dramatic. Take “Once Upon a Poolside” from First Two Pages of Frankenstein, the first song he wrote after that debilitating bout of writer's block. There, too, he's disoriented—“What was the worried thing you said to me?” he asks in the stark chorus—but he fights through to find some poetry in his senses: the smell of sweet perfume, planes sinking into sidewalks, a panic attack in super slow-motion. All that Berninger evokes at the top of Get Sunk is the slow-motion.

There are moments of intrigue on Get Sunk, not least the two duets. “Breaking Into Acting” features Meg Duffy of Hand Habits, while Julia Laws, a.k.a. Ronboy, adds minimal melodies on “Silver Jeep.” Their voices are a welcome reminder of a world outside Berninger's mind, and his lyrics open up as a result. In the intriguing little scraps of detail on the latter song—“I gotta get a message to you without signals/AC motor puts me right to sleep/I dream of dreaming and grind my teeth”—Berninger finally attempts to express the inexpressible, rather than simply acknowledging it and letting it go. His sonorous, croaking baritone feels weightier when tied to Laws' airy harmonies.

Berninger wrote a handful of these songs before his depression took hold, but when he started work on the album in earnest he went back, rewrote lyrics, and re-recorded vocals, reasoning that he had to say something new with his rediscovered voice. But still, Get Sunk often feels as though it stalled out after the first draft. The rhythms on “Frozen Oranges” and “Nowhere Special,” for example, don't quite fit, as though they've been read directly from a stream-of-consciousness journal entry.

The closer, “Times of Difficulty,” reverses this pattern. Like “Inland Ocean,” it's rooted in major chords and adheres to an ultra-simple structure, but it feels folkier and more organic. It even has a mantra worth repeating: “In times of heartache, get drunk/In times of tears, get sunk” may not be sound advice on its face, but there's an endearing old-world charm to it. As a standalone song, “Times of Difficulty” is the best from either of Berninger's two solo albums so far. Although it would be a fitting closer to an album of vivid self-reflection, at the back end of Get Sunk, its wisdom feels unearned.

Berninger's reputation as the sad dad of indie rock is well earned, but it was never the melancholy itself that made his work compelling—it was his eye for detail, instinct for fragmented poetry, and dry sense of humor. It would have been fascinating to see him apply those gifts more fully to writing about life as he searches for peace in middle age and refinds his voice after falling silent. Instead, Get Sunk feels like a missed opportunity.

Mere days before they release Never Enough, their long-awaited fourth album, Turnstile visited The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to debut two new songs from the record: “I Care” and “Dull.” Surrounded by striped wallpaper, a pale pink carpet, and a framed photo of a rotary telephone, the Baltimore experimental hardcore band played the former 1980s-sounding pop-rock song while wearing retro over-the-ear headphones. To match the glitchy hardcore of the latter track, Turnstile were doused in red lighting while they jumped around onstage. Watch a replay below.

Never Enough, the follow-up album to 2021's smash success Glow On, comes out this Friday, June 6, via Roadrunner. It's Turnstile's first LP with new guitarist Meg Mills, following Brady Ebert's departure, and first since they received Grammy nominations.

The music videos for Turnstile's previously released singles “Never Enough,” “Birds,” “Seein' Stars,” and “Look Out for Me” are all part of the upcoming companion film Turnstile: Never Enough. That 50-minute movie, which was directed by singer Brendan Yates and guitarist Pat McCrory, includes all 14 songs from the record and will be screened at movie theaters around the country.

Later tonight, at New York's AG Studios, Turnstile will be in conversation with writer Lawrence Burney about their new cover story on Pitchfork, which was printed as a limited-edition zine. They will discuss the interviews that went into the cover story, the making of the zine, their new album Never Enough, and more. RSVP to the event here.

Beleaguered record club Vinyl Me, Please will relaunch under the ownership of VNYL Inc. after taking steps to enter liquidation earlier this year. The company has instated a new leadership team that promises to honor past obligations—notably the rash of unfulfilled orders that has exasperated customers—and, as new chief executive Nick Alt said in a press release, restore the company to “its true form as the ‘Best Damn Record Club.'” Going forward, the owners intend to integrate Vinyl Me, Please with its VinylBox and VNYL brands as a sister operation specializing in premium audio.

VNYL acquired Vinyl Me, Please after a post-bankruptcy bidding war, the new owners told Variety. The company's new president, the direct-to-consumer operator Emily Muhoberac, said in the press release, “Vinyl customers deserve a white glove experience and that's far from what they've gotten recently. We intend to do that by getting back to the fundamentals of VMP with a great customer experience.”

They plan to keep the company afloat with the help of its proprietary technology, which they say uses streaming and other record sales data to parse trends that inform which records get pressed, thus improving efficiency. Alt added in the press release, “Our philosophy is simple: not every collector is the same. Some customers want a Blue Note Anthology box set. Others are counting the days until the new Reneé Rapp LP drops. We're building different clubs to serve different types of listeners—with pricing and curation that actually match their needs.”

In the Variety interview, Alt assured unhappy customers that a campaign is under way to fulfill orders as quickly as possible. “I think a lot of these customers haven't heard anything for many weeks or maybe even months, and even if they did hear something, it might have been an AI chat bot.” He continued, “If I was in that situation, I'd be pissed off too. I'd be so furious. And so I think what you'll notice is us taking a very different approach to the customer service element and just the humanity of dealing with these customers and not feeding them into kind of a weird customer service funnel.”

							By 

	Daniel Kreps



Heart's summer tour has been hit by an unforeseen misfortune as, on the eve of the trek's first show, two “irreplaceable instruments” were stolen from the venue.


	The band's Royal Flush Tour kicked off May 31 in Atlantic City, but prior to that gig, the two instruments — a “custom-built, one-of-a-kind purple sparkle baritone Telecaster with a hand-painted headstock, crafted specifically for Nancy Wilson” and vintage 1966 Gibson EM-50 mandolin that band member Paul Moak has played for over 25 years — were both stolen after Heart's gear was loaded into Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.

A post shared by Nancy Wilson (@nancywilson)


	“These instruments are more than just tools of our trade — they're extensions of our musical souls,” a “devastated” Nancy Wilson said in a statement on social media. “The baritone Tele was made uniquely for me, and Paul's mandolin has been with him for decades. We're heartbroken, and we're asking for their safe return—no questions asked. Their value to us is immeasurable.”

	











	Heart is offering an unspecified reward and “no questions asked” for any information leading to the retrieval leading to their return. “Anyone with knowledge of the theft or whereabouts of the instruments is urged to come forward,” the band continued.

	Despite the loss, Heart's tour with Todd Rundgren will soldier on Wednesday with a concert in Vienna, Virginia. The Royal Flush tour will currently run through August 30, concluding in Bethel, New York.

	In May 2024, Heart's Ann and Nancy Wilson spoke with Rolling Stone about performing together on tour for the first time in five years. “We just got really tired of not playing together, and we both wanted to do a Heart tour,” Wilson said. “So then there is this question hanging in the air: Can Heart be Heart without Ann or can Heart be Heart without Nancy? It never could.”


	However, the reunion tour was delayed after Ann Wilson revealed she underwent surgery and “preventative chemotherapy”; she has since successfully completed the chemotherapy.

	A woman who claims Sean “Diddy” Combs dangled her over the 17th floor balcony of Casandra “Cassie” Ventura's high-rise apartment in a fit of random rage took the witness stand Wednesday and said Combs also threatened her life, proclaiming, “I'm the devil, and I could kill you.”


	In chilling testimony that wasted no time, Bryana “Bana” Bongolan said Combs “held” her over the balcony one night in September 2016 and then “threw” her into patio furniture. She said the alleged assault left her with bruising, back and neck pain, and lasting emotional distress.


	“I have night terrors and paranoia and scream in my sleep,” she told jurors Wednesday at the mogul's sex trafficking and racketeering trial in New York.


	Appearing nervous, if not terrified, Bongolan spoke softly and haltingly as she recalled meeting Ventura while working at the streetwear company Diamond Supply Co. in 2014. The fashion designer and creative consultant said she “wasn't really fond of” what she was seeing in terms of her new friend's relationship with Combs. She recalled watching her friend in a state of distress while speaking to Combs by phone and the time Ventura called her on FaceTime while she was getting ready for the premiere of her movie The Perfect Match in March 2016.

	











	It was a couple days after Combs allegedly punched Ventura in the face at the InterContinental Hotel and then kicked and dragged her in the hotel's hallway in an assault caught on surveillance video. Bongolan said Ventura panned the camera from side to side, clearly displaying a visible black eye.

	











	“I remember saying, ‘I'm sorry,'” Bongolan recalled. Ventura, she said, was quiet. 


	Bongolan also recalled another night when she was staying at Ventura's apartment and Combs allegedly started banging on the door. She recalled seeing Combs throw a knife at Ventura, with Ventura chucking it back. Bongolan said that she didn't call police. “I was scared of Puff,” she said.


	Bongolan also recalled the sinister threat Combs allegedly delivered just inches from her face on a beach in Malibu in April 2016. She had no idea what prompted Combs to call himself “the devil” and threaten her life, she testified.

	Before her testimony started, Bongolan invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, leading U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian to sign an immunity order. It wasn't immediately clear why she might need the protection, but Bongolan testified that she frequently did drugs with Ventura, supplying her with prescription pills, cocaine and ketamine.


	Bongolan was one of Ventura's close friends while the R&B singer was dating Combs in the latter half of the couple's turbulent relationship. In a $10 million lawsuit filed last November, Bongolan said the “outrageous” balcony incident left her deeply traumatized.


	“The only purpose of dangling someone over a balcony is to actually kill them or to intentionally terrorize them and rob them of any concept of dominion over their own bodily autonomy and safety,” the complaint filed in Los Angeles said.


	In the 17-page filing obtained by Rolling Stone, Bongolan said she and her girlfriend were asleep in a guest bedroom at Ventura's apartment on September 26, 2016, when Combs showed up unannounced and started banging on the door. Bongolan said she asked her girlfriend to hide in the guest bathroom and lock the door.


	As soon as Combs gained entry into the apartment, he allegedly grabbed Bongolan on the balcony, turned her back to his chest and groped her breasts as she yelled at him to leave her alone, the lawsuit said. Bongolan claimed Combs then lifted her onto the balcony banister while yelling incoherently, “Do you know what the fuck you did?”

	Bongolan said she had no idea what Combs was saying and desperately tried in resist. But standing only 4 feet and 11 inches tall, Bongolan said she was no match for the music mogul.


	“He immediately lifted her up higher and over the 17th floor balcony of Ms. Ventura's apartment with only Combs' grip keeping her from falling to her death,” the lawsuit said. Bongolan said Ventura eventually emerged from her bedroom and screamed at Combs to stop, informing him that Bongolan's girlfriend was in the apartment as well.

	











	“Ostensibly recognizing the threat of so many witnesses to his assault, [Combs] pulled Ms. Bongolan back from over the balcony,” the complaint said. At that point, Combs allegedly “slammed” Bongolan onto the patio furniture, including a table.


	“Mr. Combs firmly denies these serious allegations and remains confident they will ultimately be proven baseless,” a legal representative for Combs said in a statement sent to Rolling Stone when the lawsuit was first filed last year.


	The alleged balcony incident was initially revealed in Ventura's blockbuster sex trafficking lawsuit filed against Combs in November 2023. Bongolan was not identified by name in the complaint, and Ventura reached a private settlement with Combs a day later.


	Bongolan was mentioned, though not by name, in Combs' superseding indictment as well as prosecutors' opening statement. Prosecutors allege Combs used violence and threats of violence as a means of promoting and protecting the alleged criminal enterprise at the center of the government's racketeering charge against him.


	“When employees, witnesses to his abuse, or others threatened Combs' authority or reputation, Combs and members and associates of the Enterprise engaged in acts of violence, threats of violence, threats of financial and reputational harm, and verbal abuse,” Combs' superseding indictment from April charged. “These acts of violence included arson and multiple acts of kidnapping … In addition, on multiple occasions, Combs threw both objects and people, as well as hit, dragged, choked, and shoved others. On one occasion, combs dangled a female victim over an apartment balcony.” 


	Combs, 55, was arrested in September and has pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy, the sex trafficking of multiple women, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Authorities allege he paid dozens of male escorts to have coerced sex with his alleged victims. If convicted as charged, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.


	On Wednesday morning, a forensic video expert told jurors that the infamous hotel surveillance video showing Combs slamming Ventura to the ground and kicking and dragging her in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in 2016 was not manually doctored. Expert Frank Piazza said the video material he received from prosecutors faithfully represented what happened that day. He said an automated conversion process sped up some of the action slightly, but he was able to correct it. He said the motion-activated surveillance system at the hotel also created some pixilation and time stamp issues. 

	











	The video compilation also showed the end of the encounter for the first time. In the new footage, a still towel-clad Combs was seen leaving his hotel suite, apparently checking if Ventura was still near the elevator banks. He then turned back around and immediately placed a phone call.

	Prosecutors also unveiled a series of text messages extracted from Combs' phone showing communication with his security member D-Roc in September 2015. The chain of messages appeared to show Combs dispatching D-Roc to monitor Ventura. “It's time for the ice,” Combs texted in one. “Stay on top of Cassie Does the eye look any better? … Why does she not have herself in hiding?”


	In related testimony Tuesday, hotel security guard Eddy Garcia told jurors that Combs and his chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, pushed him hard to erase the video from the hotel's computer system and hand over the only copy on a thumb drive. Garcia said Combs paid $100,000 in cash and had him sign a confidentiality agreement with a $1 million penalty if he violated it.

	With the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team on dubious legal footing, congressional Republicans are quietly inching forward legislation to grant President Donald Trump new, lawful powers for razing the federal government: the unprecedented ability to propose to Congress, under reorganization authority, the abolition of executive departments, independent regulatory agencies, and all statutory programs in either.


	If enacted, the legislation would let Trump recommend that simple majorities in Congress bless any fatal finishing move of his on the already–gutted Education Department, any other Cabinet-level department, or any executive agency, including independent regulatory agencies — such as the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Federal Communications Commission, and Federal Reserve — designed to serve congressional interests and whose heads have codified protections, albeit flagging, against at-whim firing.


	Legal experts tell Rolling Stone the Reorganizing Government Act would empower the president to ask Congress to approve, on a fast track, reorganization plans altering or eliminating how the executive carries out laws passed by Congress, effectively neutralizing, say, any or all civil rights laws, environmental laws, or fill in the blank.

	











	The Trump administration has already moved to impair or abolish several agencies, starting with the U.S. Agency for International Development, whose scraps have been folded into the State Department. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to “to close the federal Department of Education,” and as president, he's attempted to dismantle it via executive order. His administration has fired heads of independent regulatory agencies, now under litigation. Project 2025 architect Russell Vought, head of the key White House agency for executive-led reorganizations, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has long targeted entire statutory programs — housing vouchers, student loans — for elimination.

	The very–little–noticed Reorganizing Government Act, introduced by Republicans in both the House and Senate, would allow Trump to do the work of DOGE on steroids — and with the statutory backing from Congress that federal judges have stated he needs.


	It would give Trump far more authority than any previous president has ever enjoyed — with the partial exception of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression — to recommend Congress approve wide-ranging restructurings of the executive branch and, possibly, of even more entities inside the wider executive establishment.


	The slowly-moving legislation would resurrect and amend the congressionally granted presidential reorganization authority that expired in 1984, allowing Trump to propose ending or altering any executive agency or some/all of its statutory programs — such as the Environmental Protection Agency, any of the 18 spy agencies, or the IRS — as well as any “corporation wholly owned by the United States.” Such corporations federally chartered include the Millenium Challenge Corporation; international aid foundations structured as corporations like the African Development Foundation; and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supplies small yet important funds for PBS, NPR, and local member stations.


	Expansive language in the legislation makes the list of potential targets sprawl — encompassing potential reorganization plans for firing independent regulators, eliminating their positions or agencies, and likely challenging the administrative apparatus in novel ways. Reorganizing means transferring, consolidating, coordinating, authorizing, or abolishing governmental org-chart entities or their functions, most plainly warranted when government efforts are needlessly duplicated.


	By letting the president formally pitch lawmakers on such restructurings, the legislation would grant Trump and his narrow Republican majorities in Congress exceptional power to take down the administrative state. Trump could, through 2026, present up to three concurrent plans to lawmakers, who'd then have 90 days per plan to consider each. Instead of the usual 60 Senate votes needed to pass legislation, based on filibuster rules, the reanimated law from 1984 would allow these plans to pass by simple majority votes.

	At any time during a 90-day period, Trump could withdraw a plan, and for the first 60 days, the ex-TV game show host could start-stop changes to it — an invitation to use what he calls “great television” to stress everyone out with repeated shocks of will he or won't he, habituating fear into acquiescence.

	











	Stanford Law professor Anne Joseph O'Connell, who specializes in agency structure and personnel, tells Rolling Stone that “While the Congressional Review Act of 1996 already allows for fast-track repeal of recent major agency regulations, this legislation, if enacted, could demolish statutory mandates that have been on the books for decades. The Reorganizing Government Act would, in practice, end the legislative filibuster for a wide swath of issues carried out by federal agencies. It is a wolf hiding in the details of government organization charts.”


	Assuredly, passing the legislation would regularize, if not Musk's DOGE per se, then similar, stronger austerity powers for the White House. The world's richest man on May 28 announced his supposed departure from DOGE, and while his murky “special government employee” categorization apparently concluded around the end of May, authority for the austerity team itself persists through July 4, 2026, the country's semiquincentennial. Yet to keep dismantling the administrative apparatus long-term, federal judges have indicated the White House must put its dismantling efforts on a firm legal foundation.


	Trump's need for statutory backing is especially pressing since Musk or his operatives have been accused of various law breakings, in their attempts to hoard ever more power for the executive. Congressional Democrats led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have called DOGE conflicts of interest “a disturbing pattern,” a way to “enrich Mr. Musk and other elites.” His hacker-like team of twentysomethings' apparent stockpiling of sensitive information includes demanding states and their contractors give up food stamp recipients' personal details. In its data-hoovering efforts, DOGE has been accused of breaching protected records such as tax return data for millions of people and nearly every federal employee, as well as the Treasury systems behind almost all payments made by the U.S. government, though judges have since enjoined their access partially.


	Two federal judges' May 22 preliminary injunctions paused the White House's brazen staffing and budget cuts for the duration of their respective lawsuits. One, brought by 21 attorneys general from Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia, seeks to stop the gutting of the Education Department, calling it equivalent to abolishment, with New Jersey's top prosecutor, Matthew J. Platkin, saying “Trump is not a king, and he cannot unilaterally decide to close a Cabinet agency.” The other, filed by nonprofits, local governments, and labor organizations — prominently, the largest federal employee union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) — aims to “stop the unconstitutional dismantling of the federal government by the President […] unprecedented […] in clear excess of his authority.” 

	











	In court in April, the Justice Department conceded the obvious: Trump doesn't have statutory reorganization authority. The AFGE, in a March letter to the House, explained their dread that giving him it would result in an executive branch made up of fewer civil servants and more contractors.


	For all the White House bluster about increasing efficiency by cutting a bloated federal workforce, its portion made up of actual employees has, percentage-wise, long been shrinking consistently, while hovering — in absolute terms — around three million people since the late sixties. The often lucrative, secretive public gigs for the private sector — combined with revolving-door practices and capture of government decision-making by ‘self-contracting contractors‘ — not infrequently give the growing number of hirelings weaker incentives than those offered the attenuated core of salaried civil servants to remain loyal to the United States Government and the public it's supposed to serve.


	Legalizing DOGE-style austerity would require getting the Reorganizing Government Act through the Senate, where the GOP is seven senators shy of bypassing filibusters sans sufficient defections from Democrats and independents. 


	The legislation was born into a climate of drastic political regression. Trump's allies are pushing to legalize the twice–impeached president's hoped-for, but unconstitutional, third term; he's already selling Trump 2028 merchandise. Influential ideologues are glorifying extreme dominance hierarchies as the best human social structure, even claiming that installing a monarchy wouldn't be that big of a deal. Passing the Reorganizing Government Act would be a huge step toward crowning — even as protests swell against the idea — the first United States king.


	Republicans introduced both Reorganizing Government Act bills on Feb. 13 into a seismic landscape: Two days earlier, Trump had ordered federal agency heads to “undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs),” the type of DOGE- (or OMB-)led restructuring involving axing budgets and personnel rosters — and the type receiving the most media attention.


	But Trump's order also told agency heads to submit reports “discuss[ing] whether the agency or any of its subcomponents should be eliminated or consolidated,” for the purpose of “Developing Agency Reorganization Plans.” OMB and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) followed up 13 days later with guidance deriding the government as “bloated, corrupt” and instructing that the reports be developed with agencies' DOGE “team leads,” then handed in by Mar. 13.

	











	The reports, Agency RIF and Reorganization Plans (ARRPs), couple reduction in force aspects — budget slashings, firings — with restructuring aspects such as abolishments; largely unrevealed, their contents would help illuminate the administration's doings.


	In the AFGE lawsuit, Judge Susan Illston at a May 9 hearing showed intense interest, per the transcript this journalist obtained, in the ARRPs, stating that “Defendants have not publicly released these plans despite requests from the public, employees, and members of Congress.”


	Illston asked the Justice Department if the Senate's request for the ARRPs had been answered. When attorney Eric J. Hamilton replied that “interbranch discussions between Congress and the executive branch” weren't “relevant,” she retorted, “So you don't want to tell me, is what you're saying?”


	He didn't. The Justice Department claims the ARRPs contain sensitive details, aren't final, and don't bind agencies to specific actions. On May 13, the plaintiffs provided at least part of one. The judge wrote that it didn't “neatly align with the government's characterization of ARRPs in general.”


	With a discovery order, the judge obtained a sampling of ARRPs herself and reviewed them behind closed doors. The government's motion to prohibit the plans from coming to light remains pending.


	Illston explained why inspecting the ARRPs, the characterization of which the parties dispute, is pivotal: Did “Trump, OPM, OMB, and DOGE simply instruct agencies to begin planning for RIFs in the future and provide guidance on how to make those plans?” That's what the Justice Department claims; if true, the deliberative process privilege would shield the plans from oversight.


	Or, as multitudinous news reports suggest, were the full ARRPs “directing agencies to make ‘large-scale' RIFs and to make them now?” The same question applies to structural reorganizations.


	Illston decided the evidence shows the ARRPs were indeed directive and on May 22 issued a preliminary injunction to “pause large-scale reductions in force and reorganizations” for the lawsuit's duration. On June 2, the administration appealed to the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs told Illston the next day that their opponents aren't obeying her injunction.


	When issuing the pause, the judge gave Trump another option: procure “the cooperation of the legislative branch.”


	If Congress passes it, that statutory partnership — presidential authority to propose reorganization plans — is exactly what the Reorganizing Government Act would supply the White House.

	











	At the moment, the Reorganizing Government Act appears to be moving slowly and looks unlikely to pass. With only 53 GOP senators, it faces an uphill battle for the 60 Senate votes required by default. 


	But that could change if Republican Senate Budget Chairman Lindsey Graham's (R-S.C.) new nuclear option effort, which is currently pending, portends further sleights-of-hand by his party. Such longshot tricks, if successful, might permit Republicans to get a budget bill to Trump with non-fiscal provisions — such as reorganization authority — shoehorned in.


	Rep. James Comer's (R-Ky.) half of the Reorganizing Government Act cleared the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform by a party-line vote of 23-20 on Mar. 25, and now has 19 cosponsors. Sen. Mike Lee's (R-Utah) version in the upper chamber, however, is still sitting in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee with its two cosponsors, apparently collecting mothballs.


	If GOP leaders want to force the reorganization bill through, Senate Republicans could try to add the legislation to budget reconciliation legislation — in an attempt to protect the bill from a filibuster, so it could sail through the senior body with just 51 votes. 


	Congress is currently using the byzantine reconciliation process to try to extend and expand Trump's 2017 tax cuts for the richest, which will be financed, in part, with unprecedented cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs for the poor.


	Members from both major parties have sometimes used the reconciliation process to try to stuff in agenda items probably not primarily fiscal, except the maneuver Graham has indicated he'll use represents a severe escalation.


	In April, GOP senators eschewed Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough's expertise and claimed Graham could decide the cost of a bill all by himself. The budget chairman said the extension Republicans set forward for Trump's 2017 tax cuts would be cost free. Rather than measuring against the “current law baseline,” assessed for half a century following a statutory definition, he announced his intention to measure expenses against a “current policy baseline.” He hasn't yet shown his math-work.


	Number-crunching watchdogs from both the center-right Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the liberal Center for American Progress teamed up to tell the Senate in April that the Graham-goes-it-alone trick is “abuse” tantamount to “fabricat[ing] their own scores on the spot.”

	











	Even faking numbers, the GOP couldn't coherently claim the Reorganizing Government Act is principally budgetary in nature. The CBO scored the House version as having zero “direct spending” and zero “revenues” because it's the subsequent legislative dominoes — the putative joint resolutions approving any reorganization plans — that would impact the star-spangled spreadsheets.


	Bobby Kogan, a signer of the April letter and the Center for American Progress's senior director for federal budget policy, tells Rolling Stone that the Graham solo trick, arguably an attempt at a newfangled nuclear option, couldn't logically apply to sneaking the Reorganizing Government Act through reconciliation.


	“CBO says the Reorganizing Government Act doesn't have a scorable impact, so it's not allowed in reconciliation,” Kogan says. “This is exactly the sort of thing Senator Byrd didn't want in reconciliation and that his rule [controlling the process] was intended to keep out.”


	So far, Graham's maneuver is untested in floor debate. His office didn't respond to multiple emails and calls for this article.


	Republican senators might not give up easily, given the threat of Trump supporting primary challengers. An unusually high number of their seats, 20, are up in the midterms. Further, Americans for Prosperity, the dark-money flagship of fossil fuel billionaire Charles Koch, told Congress on Apr. 28 to prioritize, along with four other bills, the Reorganizing Government Act. For months, the Koch network has sought statutory footing to “establish lasting reforms” without Musk.


	“Nuclear options” are almost always avoided since one's Senate opponents might deploy them too — mutually assured destruction — yet the times are trigger happy. Under White House pressure, the Senate's presiding officer — possibly J.D. Vance, a onetime harsh critic of Trump who's now his vice president and bowing bulldog — could assent to shutting down MacDonough or other Strangelove-style games.


	AFGE acting legislation director Daniel Horowitz tells us, “The question hanging over reconciliation is to what extent is the Republican majority going to play by any rules at all. They are clearly going to stretch the boundaries of the budget laws as far as possible to insert their anti-government policy priorities into any package.”


	If defeated or left for dead, the Reorganizing Government Act would stand as a marker of just how far some congressional Republicans wanted to go to keep empowering an already off-the-chain Trump. And if presidential reorganization authority isn't in the cards this congressional session, there's always next year(s) — especially as long as Trump commands the loyalty or fear of many on Capitol Hill.

	











	Muddying the tea leaves, the White House and almost all queried congressional Republicans have said little or nothing about the Reorganizing Government Act.


	In fact, according to this journalist's historical review, with only one debatable, situational exception, every president extended reorganization authority by Congress since the power was first granted in 1932 has — as chief executive or president-elect — openly explained his desire for it to lawmakers or the public ahead of the earliest bill's introduction, usually weeks or months in advance. Trump, on the other hand, hasn't said a thing about it this term.


	The doubtful analogue occurred in an era when statutory reorganization authority was lower stakes, somewhat routine: President Jimmy Carter, in his 1980 State of the Union, could assume his touting of a then-forthcoming reorganization plan more or less implied, without his spelling it out, that Congress might need to renew his authority before it expired early that April. Lawmakers did, fairly fast. The House even passed their portion of the renewal under suspension of rules, a simplifying process for uncontroversial legislation.


	If Trump were granted such authority without publicly justifying it, he could try painting himself as somehow akin to Carter, but whereas Carter's campaign promise of “a complete reorganization of the executive branch” was headline-grabbing enough to inspire multiple polls on the subject during his initial year in the White House, the first-term Trump encouraged the press to opt out of filming a “little report” on the reorganization authority his officials were, in and around 2018, pursuing without much fanfare. Trump even told the journalists that report was “extraordinarily boring and therefore not fit for camera.”


	Second-term Trumpers aren't talking at all. During the Mar. 25 Oversight session, Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), opposing the “blank check” of the Reorganizing Government Act, said: “I don't believe that Mr. Musk or any member of the administration has actually been in front of this committee […] yet here we are in a process to pass it without any clarification about why this authority is needed.” Several emails and calls from this journalist to the White House Press Office and OMB went unanswered.


	Congressional Republicans are almost all mum, too, despite the prerogative's capacity to profoundly affect the separation of powers among the three federal branches: Congress, executive, and the judiciary. Each checks the others and answers to the Constitution.

	











	Besides statutory reorganization powers, presidents can change up the executive branch via, varying with the type of agency, the usual slow method of working with Congress to enact statutes, or they can — because the Constitution lets presidents arrange for assistants while enforcing laws — issue executive orders or facilitate internal reorganizations led moreso by individual agencies themselves. However, those latter options may rely heavily on judicial assent, often requiring presidents to plunge into protracted power struggles, as in the AFGE lawsuit.


	If Congress enables presidents to propose reorganizations, the chief executives are largely freed from lawmakers' snail-speed deliberations and entrenched dependencies on specific districts and states, and can make recommendations quickly to Capitol Hill as a whole, from a birds-eye view.


	Yet whenever lawmakers delegate such a prerogative, Capitol Hill sidelines itself: Congress retains its constitutional power to create, edit, or end executive entities that implement statutory goals, but it passes to the White House the political capital baton — and lower procedural hurdles for congressional assent, nowadays including the filibuster-proof simple majorities mechanism.


	John A. Dearborn, a Vanderbilt University political science professor who authored the book Power Shifts: Congress and Presidential Representation, tells Rolling Stone, “In the early to mid-20th century, Congress's decisions to grant presidential reorganization authority depended on legislators' sense that they could trust the president, as an officeholder elected by the whole people, to uniquely act in the national interest and achieve a rational reorganization of the executive branch.”


	“But in recent decades, the level of trust Congress and the wider public has had in presidents to do that has declined, and correspondingly, since 1984 lawmakers have avoided granting presidents such broad reorganization authority,” he says. “The Reorganizing Government Act of 2025 comes during a political context very different from earlier periods when that kind of authority was regularly granted: a time of extreme polarization and disagreement over whether the president can be counted on to act in the interests of the whole country.”


	Given the contentious climate and the marginalization of Congress the legislation would entail, one might hope lawmakers would discuss it eagerly. But my multiple emails and calls to GOP leadership in both chambers, the bills' sponsors and cosponsors, and Republicans on the relevant committees went unanswered — save for the rare staffers who advised me to ask someone else and for two Representatives whose communications teams provided startling comments.

	











	Press Secretary Will Garrett told me on Apr. 25 that his boss, Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), “fully supports any effort that allows President Trump to make government more efficient.”


	However, in economics, public policy, physics, and the dictionary, efficiency means something like useful output divided by total costs. DOGE's boasts notwithstanding, federal government first-quarter expenditures — arguably a plausible denominator for an efficiency ratio — have increased, while revenues, the corresponding numerator, have slightly declined, the whole fraction compared with President Joe Biden's final first quarter. If receipts versus outlays spells efficiency, then that's not being efficient. That's not even just being cheap. Trump and Musk have been inefficient.


	Reorganization authority isn't any automatic efficiency cure-all. The Congressional Research Service report from 2012 that Comer entered into the record during the Oversight session states that there have been “few instances in which reorganization plans resulted in documented cost savings.” Of course, obtaining reorganization authority and abolishing Cabinet-level departments could save fortunes — in the same way weight loss may be achieved by chopping off limbs.


	Discussing his state-level reorganization efforts as Georgia's governor in his 1975 presidential campaign autobiography Why Not the Best?, Carter criticized thought-terminating bizspeak clichés such as efficiency: “Nowhere in the Constitution of the United States, or the Declaration of Independence, or the Bill of Rights, or the Emancipation Proclamation, or the Old Testament or the New Testament do you find the words ‘economy' or ‘efficiency.' Not that these two words are unimportant. But you discover other words like honesty, integrity, fairness, liberty, justice, courage, patriotism, compassion, love — and many others which describe what a human being ought to be. These are also the same words which describe what a government of human beings ought to be.”


	For all the questions, three Republicans skipped the Oversight vote, and while the offices of Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Rep. Michael Turner (R-Ohio) ignored my repeated calls and emails asking why, Press Secretary Annie Butler emailed me on Apr. 18 that the absent Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-N.Y.) — who cosponsors the bill — had a “scheduling conflict” for “an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing scheduled at the same time.”


	“That's all!” she added.

	











	In multiple emails — reinforced by calls — I asked her, “The Energy and Commerce Committee hearing ended at about 1:41 p.m. Eastern. But the House Oversight vote for H.R. 1295 was more than five hours later. It takes something like 15-20 minutes to get from room to room, yes? So why didn't Rep. Langworthy vote on whether or not to favorably report this legislation he co-sponsors?”


	No answer.


	The White House and most of the relevant congressional Republicans' unwillingness to talk underscores the sense that Congress would not be granting reorganization authority to a principled steward of the national interest, but to a president who answers only to himself, his, or foreign foes.


	In April, the late Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), then the House Oversight ranking member, told Rolling Stone that “congressional Republicans are finally admitting that President Trump and Elon Musk do not have the legal authority to kill entire federal agencies, take a chainsaw to beloved programs like Social Security and Medicaid, or purge the federal workers that care for veterans, keep our food supply safe, and fight cancer.”


	He added, “They're plotting to use the shell of a long-dormant statute as a Trojan Horse to gift Trump and Musk the unprecedented, filibuster-proof authority they crave to use and abuse taxpayer dollars however they want in their bid to remake our government in their own corrupt image.”


	Congressional Republicans must now navigate, on one side, the risk Trump will tar them in MAGA extremists' eyes, and on the other, his softer voters among their constituencies angering at his doubling-down that their kids should just make do with fewer dolls and pencils, realizing it may not herald the new economic “golden age” the six-time bankruptcy filer promised. Meanwhile, rising voter suppression legislation and voting computer insecurities threaten to list the ship of state farther and turn such political constraints into ancient history.


	Vanderbilt University political science professor David E. Lewis, an expert on presidents and the bureaucracy, tells us: “In the past, presidents would exercise restraint in the use of reorganization authority. If they overstepped, there would be consequences. Upset members of Congress could refuse to support their legislative agenda, and so forth. For Trump, emphasizing an executive agenda, he is not worried about members refusing to support him down the road. He needs them for very little and does not fear losing their support.”

	











	Instead of Congress predominating as a representation of a diverse public, the MAGA-backing ideologues seek to reverse today's unique evolutions toward increasing heterodoxy — insta-global communications sharing bottom-up knowledge, feminist uprisings worldwide — to make macho-monarchy great again, though the Declaration of Independence says it wasn't.


	Maybe it seemed hard to believe — that some aim to make Trump a monarch — before mid-February, when he posted AI-generated imagery of himself as a king, which official White House socials circulated. 


	In a January New York Times interview, the most prominent monarchist ideologue, blogger Curtis Yarvin, was asked if his “point” was that the U.S. has supposedly “had something like a dictator in the past, and therefore it's not something to be afraid of now.”


	He answered: “Yeah.”


	Years earlier, “Mencius Moldbug,” Yarvin's pseudonym, typed missives out of his grab-bag of cacophonous quotes to the fascist-friendly among consequential, on-the-down-low hacktivist chat-circles.


	Now the Times calls him the “MAGA court philosopher,” reporting on Yarvin's May 5 debate at Harvard. The report says he calls for “a techno-monarchy,” but an attendee said the debate “never got to the heart of the matter: Yarvin's affirmative case for monarchy.”


	Likely Trump has heard, through his vice president and others, bits and pieces of that rambling, if you can't dazzle 'em with brilliance, baffle 'em with bullshit case for monarchy — “humans fit into dominance-submission structures” very easily, Yarvin wrote in 2008, with a tunnel vision cropping out counterexamples. He elaborated three years later that Trump has “obvious kinginess”: “Supreme personal authority, generally male,” for which The Donald is “clearly biologically suited.”


	On a podcast last year, Vance, then a U.S. Senate candidate, referenced Yarvin fleetingly, but approvingly. The vice president is a protégé of Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel, who invested in his Senate campaign and also in Yarvin's computer networking project the regressive blogger described in 2010 as “digital feudalism.” The night before Trump's second inauguration, at the D.C. “Coronation Ball,” Yarvin was a fêted guest. On his trip, Moldbug and the VP spoke with one another — briefly, the blogger says.


	DOGE, especially if upgraded into statutory, escalated reorganization authority, is verging on a king-flavored administrative coup: a non-military seizing of enough power — illegally — to steer the ship of state very much elsewhere.

	











	Aided by Yarvin's circuitous justifications, Trumpers are smashing hollows into the government, and they're not remaining vacuums. Evidently, the White House is filling them, not infrequently, with themselves, their cronies, and perhaps tentacles of foreign enemies.


	So far, the public is responding with some strength. A grassroots effort to grant Trump his third impeachment — Operation Anti-King, now called Citizens' Impeachment — has gained several Representatives' support; protests are growing countrywide; the stakes keep skyrocketing.


	Yet in a world increasingly run — de jure or de facto — by software architects, it can feel like something new is needed, beyond the atavistic urge to discover pseudo-selfhood in stanning a bully-king or dusting off laudable, creaky impeachment protocols antithetical to the same.


	Another software architect, working on a global commons for online collaboration based on public-only data — a framework far from Yarvin's “digital feudalism” — debated political theory at a leading university during Trump years, too, except philosopher and human rights activist Heather Marsh at the Oxford Union in 2018 argued for her project and the peaceful, prosocial-yet-diverse evolution of democracy, not its regression, and got censored.


	Regarding the Reorganizing Government Act and the United States generally, Marsh, author of the recent books Stigmergy: How to Create a Mass Movement and How to Dismantle a Dictatorship, tells Rolling Stone, “A spectacle of horror creates suspense, terror and dread. Dictators take advantage of audience shock to spin a web around a mesmerized public until it is too late for escape. The paralysis of fear, guilt, anger, docility and nihilism still trapping part of the population in inertia is allowing a dictatorship to form where a democracy stood such a short time ago. The regime goal appears to be to isolate the U.S., tank the economy, and cause mass death through autogenocide, in order to create the perfect moment to implement totalitarianism.”

	How can the public ‘reorganize' in response? Marsh says, “The blitzkrieg strategy of regime actions must be turned on them until they are the ones dizzy and overwhelmed with the speed, variety and unpredictability of opposition tactics. There should be thousands of different things for them to respond to every day. Protests, boycotts, town halls and legal challenges are happening, but actions need to overwhelm the regime.

	











	“At the same time, we have to build alternative community and governance structures to replace the rapidly collapsing ones,” she says. “The neo-fascist-monarchist ideologues think they have a replacement ready, but they are just lazily recycling ideas we already fought against and won. If we beat them to implementation, we can create a new system that works for everyone. We must accelerate and diversify opposition actions quickly — while ensuring it is them who are paralyzed with shock and dread.”

	It's taken a few months, since he lives in the Netherlands, but Eric Andersen finally found time to watch A Complete Unknown. And the troubadour legend, who haunted those same Village clubs during that same time, was…a bit underwhelmed. 


	“It seemed a little sugarcoated,” he says. ”It was a little two-dimensional. But I found it quite amusing and quite entertaining. I was looking at it more like a cinematic situation than something I knew. I was watching a movie. So, I enjoyed it from that standpoint.”


	Then again, Andersen has a right to critique. At this point, many of the songwriters and musicians from that hallowed Greenwich Village scene have either died (mostly recently Peter Yarrow) or retired from touring (like Tom Paxton last year). Only a handful of those who helped make the Village a musical hotbed are still out performing and even making new albums — Bob Dylan, of course, along with Judy Collins, Carolyn Hester, Noel Paul Stookey, and very few others.

	











	Andersen, who turned 82 this year, is also still on that list. Although he's never had a Top 40 hit, the American-born songwriter has written a handful of songs that are part of that new American folk songbook — “Violets of Dawn,” “Thirsty Boots” — and albums like 1972's Blue River are considered high-water marks of the genre. His impact was especially felt on the recent tribute album Songpoet: Songs of Eric Andersen, which includes renditions of his songs by Dylan, Linda Ronstadt, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Amy Helm, Lenny Kaye, Dom Flemons, Willie Nile, the duo of Larry Campbell and Teresa Williams, and the late Rick Danko (who formed a band with Andersen shortly before his death).

	In the last few decades, Andersen, who moved to Norway for a period and then relocated to Amsterdam 20 years ago, has occasionally returned to the U.S. for shows. In those years, he's made albums based on the words of Lord Byron, Albert Camus and German writer Heinrich Böll; released a collection of his own spoken-word pieces; saluted his peers with recordings of Village covers (The Street Was Always There); and cut a full-album, live-recreation of Blue River. But last month, he finally rolled out his first new set of songs, Dance of Love and Death, in over 20 years.

	With its ruminative ballads and rhythms, the album is very much of a piece with the territory Andersen began carving out for himself when he arrived in New York in the Sixties. Like Dylan, he was championed by New York Times music critic Robert Shelton, which also helped Andersen land a record deal. With songs like “Close the Door Lightly When You Go” and “Come to My Bedside,” Andersen injected an air of mystery and sensuality into the scene. He befriended the likes of Paxton, Collins, and the late Phil Ochs and witnessed an increasingly isolated Dylan spar with his peers at the Kettle of Fish bar. He was so ingrained in that world that, he says, he missed Dylan's historic Newport 1965 show because he was booked into the Gaslight Café, one of the essential Village venues.


	Talking about the way that community has been recreated in films, Andersen feels that another recent movie rings a bit more true than A Complete Unknown. “[Inside] Llewyn Davis was much more of the scene that I remember,” he says. “Even to the point where I went up to Vanguard Records to get some money, and the guy actually handed me a $20 bill. I was living on the Lower East Side cooking for junkies and I needed the money to go to the vegetable market to buy stuff for them. I was walking back home, and I just stopped at the Vanguard offices. There's a scene identical to that in Llewyn Davis. It couldn't have come from me, but the vibe, the scene, and the lighting was more realistic than the other film.”


	Along with many of his peers at the time, Andersen isn't a character in A Complete Unknown, although he took heart in Ochs' “There But for Fortune” heard in one of Monica Barbaro's Joan Baez performance scenes. “That was really beautiful,” he says. “That came out being the best song in the film, which is hard to believe, because there are so many great songs. What was a little bit tragic was that Bob was such a word guy. He can talk. Not chatty, but he said things, you know. Usually talking about writing and stuff like that. None of that seemed to come through. But you can't do much in a movie. You got to gloss things over.”

	Whether it's the result of those movies or a degree of rediscovery, Andersen has felt more openness to his style and that era than he has in a while. ”I remember playing a couple of shows in Boston, when parents took their kids,” he says. “And they were the ones who came up to talk to me. Maybe it blew their minds that somebody could stand up there and sing songs about things they think about. Maybe there's some kind of deprivation going on in terms of their musical world. I don't know. But even though their parents dragged them to this show, they were the ones who got it, which was funny.”


	Starting during that period and continuing over the decades, Andersen very much lived the life of the wandering, nomadic poet-writer. He was featured in an early Andy Warhol film, appeared on Johnny Cash's TV variety show, wrote songs about his close relationships with Janis Joplin (“Pearl's Goodtime Blues”) and Patti Smith (“Wild Crow Blues”), and asked Joni Mitchell to be the godmother to his daughter. He's also had his share of disappointments: signing with Beatles manager Brian Epstein right before Epstein's death and having the tapes for his all-important follow-up to Blue River lost. (They were finally discovered and released, but 20 years later.)


	Over its 17 songs, Dance of Love and Death reflects on some of those past times, most movingly in “Every Once in a While,” about his wife Debbie Green, who died in 2017. “Were you jealous of my future? Was I jealous of your past?” he sings. “Yeah, that was about her,” Andersen says. “I think everybody has a situation where you think about somebody every once in a while and that person comes back, and I just sat down and that song poured out.” The album also has moments of harrowing storytelling (“River Spree [Berlin],” about a junkie), relative lightheartedness (“After This Life”), and his signature deep-voiced intimate romanticism (the title song).

	Although Andersen isn't known as a topical songwriter, he also ventured into that topic with the climate change-inspired “Season in Crime (Crime Scene),” spurred on by a California tour with violinist and Dylan alumnus Scarlet Rivera. “She was living in Topanga Canyon and her house was going to burn down,” he says. “We were talking about sparks and embers in the air. It started to write itself. It doesn't take much to start a song.” Thanks to producer Steve Addabbo and contributing musicians like Kaye and Dylan bassist Tony Garnier, the music is a mix of chamber-folk beauty and galloping rock & roll.

	











	In early September, Andersen will return to the States for a month of shows on the East Coast. He's read or heard about international musicians who've supposedly had their visas revoked or have had to deal with profit-depleting tariffs when they arrive. “So far, it's full steam ahead,” says Andersen, who has American and Dutch passports. “But things are evolving very rapidly. Everybody's on edge. I want to come over with my guitar and maybe they'll say, ‘Well, you know ….,' because I'm a resident overseas. It'll be interesting.” About any unlikely detainment, he jokes, “If I have one call to make, it'll be to you.”

Travis Kelce is celebrating Taylor Swift‘s big win. During the latest episode of the New Heights podcast, the Kansas City Chiefs player jammed out to the original recording of “I Knew You Were Trouble,” the Red single that the musician now owns after purchasing her catalog from Shamrock Capital. “Just bought all her music back,” Kelce said. “It's finally hers.”


	The impromptu dance party started when Kelce and his brother Jason welcomed Shaquille O'Neal to the podcast. “Hold on, I gotta show you guys something,” the NBA legend told the brothers before playing the OG “I Knew You Were Trouble” recording from his phone and dramatically lip-syncing the lyrics. “That's my favorite song in the world.” Kelce took the moment to highlight Swift, boasting: “Shout out to Tay Tay. Just got that song back, too.” 

We knew @SHAQ could jam, but not like that 😅TOMORROW. THE SHAQ EPISODE. pic.twitter.com/0Rtq4OfZ3D


	Last week, Swift penned a letter sharing the news herself. “All of the music I've ever made… now belongs… to me,” she wrote. “And all my music videos. All the concert films. The album art and photography. The unreleased songs. The memories. The magic. The madness. Every single era. My entire life's work.”

	The singer-songwriter's first six studio albums were sold to her by Shamrock Capital, which purchased them from Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. The sale brought to an end the years-long battle Swift fought after her label, Big Machine, sold off her catalog to Braun without her permission. The dispute pushed the musician to begin re-recording those albums — from her self-titled debut through Reputation — as Taylor's Version recordings in order to devalue the originals.

	











	“All I've ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy,” Swift said. “This was a business deal to them, but I really felt like they saw it for what it was to me: My memories and my sweat and my handwriting and my decades of dreams. I am endlessly thankful.”

	Kelce and Swift have been cheering each other on since first going public with their relationship in 2023. Swift has attended plenty of Kansas City Chiefs games, while Kelce made a number of appearances at the Eras Tour — including on stage as a dancer during one of her London concerts. 


	“When you say a relationship is public, that means I'm going to see him do what he loves, we're showing up for each other, other people are there, and we don't care,” Swift told Time in 2023. “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you're seeing someone. And we're just proud of each other.”

Vin Diesel had four claims dismissed on Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by his former assistant, but still faces sexual battery and wrongful termination allegations.


	Asta Jonasson sued Diesel in 2023 and accused the actor of groping her, forcibly kissed her, and masturbating in front of her in his hotel room in Atlanta in 2010. The former assistant claimed the alleged assault took place just over a week after Diesel and his production company, One Race Productions, hired her while filming Fast Five. Jonasson also claimed the production company fired her the next day in retaliation for resisting Diesel's advances.


	Diesel's lawyers previously stated that the actor denied “generally and specifically, each and every allegation” leveled by Jonasson.


	Per the suit, Jonasson cited California's AB 2777, which, like New York's Adult Survivors Act, allows some sexual misconduct claims to be filed in civil court regardless of whether the statute of limitations had passed. In addition to claims of sexual battery, wrongful termination, claims of retaliation, negligent supervision and retention, and infliction of emotional distress, Jonasson also sued Diesel for four claims under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	However, plaintiffs must first file an administrative complaint with the state Civil Rights Department (CRD) before they can file a lawsuit under the state FEHA. This gives the CRD time to evaluate the allegations and decide whether to accept the case for investigation.

	











	Diesel's attorneys argued that Jonasson's administrative complaint, required under FEHA, was submitted after the one-year deadline, and claimed California's extension of the statute of limitations for sexual assault lawsuits does not apply to administrative filings.


	Judge Daniel M. Crowley agreed with Diesel's lawyers and dismissed the four FEHA claims. “Plaintiff's FEHA claims are time-barred because she failed to timely exhaust her administrative remedies by filing a CRD complaint within one year of the alleged adverse action, a jurisdictional requirement for a FEHA lawsuit,” Crowley wrote in Tuesday's ruling.


	Following the dismissal, Diesel's attorney Bryan Freedman told People, “It is unfortunate that a person who worked for the company for less than two weeks 15 years ago in another state is allowed to use the California court system to assert such baseless claims.” He added, “Next, we will present irrefutable evidence that the remaining fictitious allegations alleged herein did not occur and finally end what remains of this maliciously filed lawsuit.”

	In a statement to Rolling Stone, Matthew T. Hale, an attorney for Jonasson, said, “While we respectfully disagree with the court's decision on this limited legal issue, the Court made no factual findings that impact the remaining causes of action in this case.  We will continue to advocate vigorously on behalf of our client, who remains committed to seeking justice.”

FAIRFIELD — The truth is out there.

And, according to Enigma, an unidentified aerial phenomena repotting app, California is almost always at the top of revealing the truth.

Enigma has received more than 100 reports recently, and San Diego International Airport is particularly active.

Across 52 major U.S. airports, San Diego has recorded 565 UAP sightings reported within a 5-mile radius.

These reports span a wide range of craft shapes, with “light,” “sphere,” and “circle” being the most commonly described. Nearly half of all sightings reference some form of light, and more than 13% mention orbs or spheres specifically – suggesting recurring visual themes across multiple locations.

California, Florida and Arizona top the list in total sightings, while airports like Cleveland-Hopkins, Phoenix Sky Harbor and San Diego International see the highest localized activity.

A notable number of witnesses also report multiple objects or formations, particularly near urban air hubs. This dataset offers a growing picture of how UAP sightings are distributed in proximity to high-traffic airports – hinting at both behavioral patterns and potential points of verification through aviation infrastructure.

Enigma started receiving public sighting submissions via web in late 2022 and launched its iOS app in May 2023. So far 25,949 sightings from the U.S. have been published. Videos are included.

Most polls suggest about 20% of Americans have seen a UFO, or 66 million Americans, according to Enigma.

Another article came out from Stacker that says we've had a lot of UFO sightings in New Jersey. So many in fact we can rank them by the Top 10 towns where it's most common.

Now, for the purists, yes, I know the modern-day terminology has changed from Unidentified Flying Object to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, or UAP.

In part, UAP goes beyond just strange objects in the skies and covers all strange activity, object or otherwise. But many experts and insiders are using UAP in place of UFO to get away from the automatic alien life form assumption. But because the vernacular still uses UFO, it's what I'm using here and it's what Stacker used in their rankings.

Why would there be so many more sightings of UFOs in certain towns over others? Is there a commonality we need to think about?

Thoughts on this follow but first scroll through this list of the Top 10 New Jersey towns where the most UFOs have been seen.

Gallery Credit: Stacker

So is there something we're missing? Is it completely random or are there certain things towns have in common that could be a reason for heightened activity?

For the longest time, we heard sightings in the United States were common near nuclear facilities. OK. Then why isn't Lower Alloways Creek Township in Salem County on this list? The Salem Power Plant and the Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station are there.

But yet we have Clifton, Norwood, Atlantic City, Howell, Jackson, Jersey City, Edison, Brick, Newark, and Toms River.

Clifton has a population of around 90,000, whereas Norwood is only 5,000. Newark is over 300,000 but Howell about 53,000. So it's not population.

These days Democrats feel Republicans will believe anything and Republicans think Democrats are the gullible ones. Well, Atlantic City, Jersey City, and Newark overwhelmingly voted for Harris last year and Toms River, Jackson, and Howell all went Trump. So are we ALL gullible?

Or is income playing a part?

Some used to believe it was lower income people living in perhaps a trailer park that saw more UFOs, but later research showed the opposite was true. The wealthier you were the greater chance you had of seeing something unexplained. That could be because more free time among affluent people has them enjoying outdoor activities more often.

Well, Norwood's median household income is $164,766 and Atlantic City's is $36,220.

Does race have anything to do with it? One town's white majority is 89% and another is 11%.

Again, not a lot in common. Some of these towns are as urban as it gets, others as suburban as they come. I'm starting to give up on looking for commonality. So maybe have some fun? Do towns that say sprinkles over jimmies see more UFOs?

Clifton, Norwood, Edison, Jersey City and Newark all say sprinkles. Atlantic City says jimmies. The other four say a mix.

In conclusion, we have no way of knowing what these towns have in common that could be making them the most prone to UFO sightings. We might need little grey men to land and explain their choices.

Pentagon official vows ‘aggressive' data collection, swift resolution of cases

After generations of stigma and secrecy around sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), or what the public calls UFOs, investigators probing hundreds of unsolved cases say the second Trump administration could be a turning point for transparency.

""We're trying to get as much of the raw evidence out as we can without putting our partners' equities at risk,"" said Jon Kosloski, director of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, the government-wide task force leading research into mysterious sightings.

""The office has hired additional personnel and we're investing in automated security review software that can redact the sensitive information from videos,"" he said of an effort to release more currently classified material related to the probes.

WATCH: Investigating UFOs in the Trump-era - Tonight 7p/9p ET on ABC News Live Prime with Linsey Davis, streaming on Hulu, Disney+ and wherever you find ABC News.

Congress established the Resolution Office in 2022 to ""detect, identify and attribute"" mysterious objects of interest in the air, outer space, and underwater, with special focus on mitigating potential threats to military operations and national security.

More than 1800 cases have been reviewed by the Pentagon so far, with the vast majority ultimately resolved as likely balloons, drones, debris or animals based on a comprehensive review of available data.

Kosloski says ""several dozen"" cases remain anomalous even after rigorous analysis of evidence. They continue to receive new reports of anomalies by military service members and the general public every month.

""It's a potential problem, a national security problem, safety of flight issue,"" Kosloski told ABC News. ""We seem to have the full support of the administration"" in pursuing answers.

President Donald Trump has famously been a UFO skeptic. ""It's never been my thing. I have to be honest,"" he told podcaster Joe Rogan in an October 2024 interview. ""I have never been a believer.""

But the president, who has full access to all government secrets as commander in chief, has also hinted on several occasions that there may be more information than has previously been revealed about alleged extraterrestrial life and unusual technological capabilities.

""I won't talk to you about what I know about it but it's very interesting,"" Trump told his son, Donald Trump Jr., in an online video during the 2020 campaign. ""But Roswell's a very interesting place with a lot of people that would like to know what's going on.""

Since taking office a second time, Trump has vowed ""radical transparency"" across government. Last month, he ordered the release of all remaining classified files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy Jr.

Some UFO enthusiasts across the political spectrum are pushing for a similar release of government files related to extraterrestrial mysteries.

""When you have only certain information that's shared with the American people, that's when conspiracy theories happen. And it's, in my opinion, that conspiracy theories can be detrimental,"" said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., in April as she opened the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.

Lawmakers from both parties have proposed legislation to force government agencies to disclose more information on UAPs, but Congress has yet to pass it.

""The issue is when we mix secrecy with a stigma, and that we create such a stigma around a phenomenon that it becomes difficult, if not impossible, for agencies, for people to look at the issue seriously,"" said former Associate NASA Administrator Mike Gold, who served on the agency's UAP Independent Study Team.

Gold, who is now part of the UAP Disclosure Fund, an independent group of scientific and national security experts, says Congress must fund more aggressive analysis of troves of existing government data.

""If we study UAP, not only can we help with national security,"" Gold said, ""but even if we don't discover something exotic, what's the worst case scenario? We discover an incredible new physical phenomenon?""

Critics of the Pentagon effort led by Kosloski say it has been hobbled by ""staffing shortfalls,"" bogged down by ""bureaucratic confusion,"" and mired in ""excessive secrecy.""

In recent testimony before Congress, whistleblowers insist the government is still hiding evidence of non-human intelligence, which top officials have long denied.

Kosloski has accelerated the release of intensive investigations, publishing unclassified resolution reports for some of the most high-profile cases, detailing the technical and intelligence analysis behind the conclusion.

""Our hope is to be able to triage them, identify those that have the best scientific data, the nexus with national security interests and the true anomalies behind them, and focus our attention on those really anomalous cases,"" Kosloski said.

Last year, the Pentagon completed a historic review of 80 years of records related to unidentified anomalous phenomena, concluding there is ""no evidence that any U.S. government investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.""

""That stands true,"" said Kosloski.

Government and private UAP investigators say it will take substantially more data to resolve the most persistent mysteries on file.

As for whether he can categorically rule out the existence of an intact spacecraft or part of a spacecraft in government possession, Kosloski said he has not been able to corroborate any claims but promised to push for public release of any likely findings of non-human intelligence.

""There's no precedent for that, obviously, but I think that we would take that up through the Secretary of Defense and allow him to make that decision.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Water From Your Eyes are a UFO on “Life Signs”, announce new album","https://beatsperminute.com/water-from-your-eyes-are-a-ufo-on-life-signs-announce-new-album/","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:34:20 GMT","

Water From Your Eyes – the duo of Rachel Brown and Nate Amos – will release a new album called It's A Beautiful Place on 22 August via Matador.

They've shared the lead single from the album, “Life Signs”, which finds them once again stitching together different art-rock approaches with inimitable style and slickness. While Amos' guitar moves between low-flying UFO hum, sweet jangle-pop and full-on attack mode, Brown insouciantly sings of strolling around the world like some kind of extra terrestrial walking around the city, taking it all in, – the “strife in the city”, the “unwavering guilt” mounting around their numbness. Brown's falsetto gives everything a sweet innocence, putting an innocent glaze over their pain – “I am coming apart / I'm becoming together / True to form,” she muses. The shapeshifting duo are back with an absolute howitzer, but it barely feels like they're breaking a sweat, they're just that good.

The video for  “Life Signs” was directed by Brown themselves and features the duo as a cast of TV characters. They explain:

“Television has always been my biggest passion and this video was mostly conceived from my desire to experiment with the tropes of genre. But I also think the medium lends itself to the idea of fitting an infinite amount of universes into a little box you can keep in your living room. I wanted the video to encapsulate as many worlds as the song does and to express an entire lifetime within a short few minutes.”

Watch the video for “Life Signs” below or find the track on streamers.

Water From Your Eyes' new album A Beautiful Place arrives on 22 August via Matador (pre-order/save). Follow Water From Your Eyes on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

(WASHINGTON) — After generations of stigma and secrecy around sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), or what the public calls UFOs, investigators probing hundreds of unsolved cases say the second Trump administration could be a turning point for transparency.

“We're trying to get as much of the raw evidence out as we can without putting our partners' equities at risk,” said Jon Kosloski, director of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, the government-wide task force leading research into mysterious sightings.

“The office has hired additional personnel and we're investing in automated security review software that can redact the sensitive information from videos,” he said of an effort to release more currently classified material related to the probes.

Congress established the Resolution Office in 2022 to “detect, identify and attribute” mysterious objects of interest in the air, outer space, and underwater, with special focus on mitigating potential threats to military operations and national security.

More than 1800 cases have been reviewed by the Pentagon so far, with the vast majority ultimately resolved as likely balloons, drones, debris or animals based on a comprehensive review of available data.

Kosloski says “several dozen” cases remain anomalous even after rigorous analysis of evidence. They continue to receive new reports of anomalies by military service members and the general public every month.

“It's a potential problem, a national security problem, safety of flight issue,” Kosloski told ABC News. “We seem to have the full support of the administration” in pursuing answers.

Trump vows greater transparency

President Donald Trump has famously been a UFO skeptic. “It's never been my thing. I have to be honest,” he told podcaster Joe Rogan in an October 2024 interview. “I have never been a believer.”

But the president, who has full access to all government secrets as commander in chief, has also hinted on several occasions that there may be more information than has previously been revealed about alleged extraterrestrial life and unusual technological capabilities.

“I won't talk to you about what I know about it but it's very interesting,” Trump told his son, Donald Trump Jr., in an online video during the 2020 campaign. “But Roswell's a very interesting place with a lot of people that would like to know what's going on.”

Since taking office a second time, Trump has vowed “radical transparency” across government. Last month, he ordered the release of all remaining classified files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy Jr.

Some UFO enthusiasts across the political spectrum are pushing for a similar release of government files related to extraterrestrial mysteries.

“When you have only certain information that's shared with the American people, that's when conspiracy theories happen. And it's, in my opinion, that conspiracy theories can be detrimental,” said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., in April as she opened the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.

Lawmakers from both parties have proposed legislation to force government agencies to disclose more information on UAPs, but Congress has yet to pass it.

“The issue is when we mix secrecy with a stigma, and that we create such a stigma around a phenomenon that it becomes difficult, if not impossible, for agencies, for people to look at the issue seriously,” said former Associate NASA Administrator Mike Gold, who served on the agency's UAP Independent Study Team.

Gold, who is now part of the UAP Disclosure Fund, an independent group of scientific and national security experts, says Congress must fund more aggressive analysis of troves of existing government data.

“If we study UAP, not only can we help with national security,” Gold said, “but even if we don't discover something exotic, what's the worst case scenario? We discover an incredible new physical phenomenon?”

Whistleblowers, advocates allege secret evidence long denied

Critics of the Pentagon effort led by Kosloski say it has been hobbled by “staffing shortfalls,” bogged down by “bureaucratic confusion,” and mired in “excessive secrecy.”

In recent testimony before Congress, whistleblowers insist the government is still hiding evidence of non-human intelligence, which top officials have long denied.

Kosloski has accelerated the release of intensive investigations, publishing unclassified resolution reports for some of the most high-profile cases, detailing the technical and intelligence analysis behind the conclusion.

“Our hope is to be able to triage them, identify those that have the best scientific data, the nexus with national security interests and the true anomalies behind them, and focus our attention on those really anomalous cases,” Kosloski said.

Last year, the Pentagon completed a historic review of 80 years of records related to unidentified anomalous phenomena, concluding there is “no evidence that any U.S. government investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.”

“That stands true,” said Kosloski.

Government and private UAP investigators say it will take substantially more data to resolve the most persistent mysteries on file.

As for whether he can categorically rule out the existence of an intact spacecraft or part of a spacecraft in government possession, Kosloski said he has not been able to corroborate any claims but promised to push for public release of any likely findings of non-human intelligence.

“There's no precedent for that, obviously, but I think that we would take that up through the Secretary of Defense and allow him to make that decision.”

FAIRFIELD — The truth is out there.

And, according to Enigma, an unidentified aerial phenomena repotting app, California is almost always at the top of revealing the truth.

Enigma has received more than 100 reports recently, and San Diego International Airport is particularly active.

Across 52 major U.S. airports, San Diego has recorded 565 UAP sightings reported within a 5-mile radius.

These reports span a wide range of craft shapes, with “light,” “sphere,” and “circle” being the most commonly described. Nearly half of all sightings reference some form of light, and more than 13% mention orbs or spheres specifically – suggesting recurring visual themes across multiple locations.

California, Florida and Arizona top the list in total sightings, while airports like Cleveland-Hopkins, Phoenix Sky Harbor and San Diego International see the highest localized activity.

A notable number of witnesses also report multiple objects or formations, particularly near urban air hubs. This dataset offers a growing picture of how UAP sightings are distributed in proximity to high-traffic airports – hinting at both behavioral patterns and potential points of verification through aviation infrastructure.

Enigma started receiving public sighting submissions via web in late 2022 and launched its iOS app in May 2023. So far 25,949 sightings from the U.S. have been published. Videos are included.

Most polls suggest about 20% of Americans have seen a UFO, or 66 million Americans, according to Enigma.

The multiplayer game has sold more than 22 million copies worldwide

Blumhouse is developing a feature film adaptation of the hit paranormal video game “Phasmophobia,” the studio announced Tuesday.

From British indie game developer Kinetic Games Limited, “Phasmophobia” launched in 2020 on Steam and since then has sold more than 22 million copies worldwide. It is also available on consoles including Playstation 5 and Xbox Series.

The film adaptation will be produced by Blumhouse and Atomic Monster in association with Kinetic Games Limited.

“Phasmophobia” is a first person multiplayer horror survival in which players must identify a type of ghost haunting a given location.

An international group of biologists and astrobiologists has published the results of their research in npj Microgravity, which changes our understanding of the limits of life on Earth. The authors examined how the extremophile black fungus Rhinocladiella similis behaves when exposed to two key factors on Mars: high doses of UV-C radiation and magnesium perchlorates, salts that are found in large quantities in Martian soil.

In a 0.9% Mg(ClO₄)₂ solution, the fungal culture was irradiated with UV-C up to 0.4 kJ/m². Despite the powerful oxidative stress, R. similis retained approximately 80% of its viability, while the model “Martian” organism Exophiala 15Lv1 lost half of its colonies. Further tests showed steady growth of R. similis even at 250 mmol/L perchlorate — a concentration that mimics possible salt brines on Mars.

Explanation: Scientists exposed the fungus to a “cocktail” of Martian salt and strong ultraviolet light — conditions in which most microbes die. However, Rhinocladiella similis survived at a rate of nearly 80%, while the Martian fungus lost half of its cells. Even in a very salty solution, similar to possible Martian conditions, the black fungus grew calmly.

Using proteomics and metabolomics, scientists have discovered that the fungus transforms into a yeast form, increasing the production of antioxidant enzymes and protective melanin pigments. This “molecular shield” neutralizes active forms of oxygen and stabilizes cell membranes in a saline environment. This shield neutralizes harmful oxygen “garbage” and strengthens cell walls, making it resistant to salt and radiation.

Why is this important?

The study once again demonstrates that life on Earth already possesses the tools necessary to conquer the harshest niches of the Red Planet. It seems that humanity's struggle for survival on Mars may gain an unexpected fungal ally.

The answer to the question, “Why should humanity even consider colonizing Mars and other planets?” can be found in our special analytical article, “Why do people need to inhabit space?”, which examines the scientific and economic arguments in detail.

Thom Donovan

On “To Bring You My Love”, PJ Harvey uses American blues to explore the supernatural in search of a human connection. Broken relationships are not new to songwriting, but Harvey reaches for an even older tradition in traversing the boundary between earth and its ghosts.

Her love song is haunting and heavy and builds slowly using a lurching guitar riff. Using the language of gospel and blues, with the noise and spirit of punk, “To Bring You My Love” describes how the unbearable becomes bearable. Having felt the pain of lost love, Harvey commits to a baptism of fire to carry love over endless obstacles.

Harvey said she created “To Bring You My Love” based on “atmosphere” and “feeling.” The title track of her third studio album exposes conflict and survival within her invented world. The things one bears just to reach the next moment in their life.

And I've traveled overDry earth and floodsHell and high waterTo bring you my love.

She uses biblical language to explain the difficult path she's traveled. Her experience suggests she's willing to endure hard times to keep the relationship intact. Additionally, the supernatural metaphors lend Harvey's punk blues a mystical quality, following a tradition that has inspired artists like Elvis Presley and Nick Cave.

Climbed over mountainsTraveled the seaCast out of HeavenCast down on my knees.

To Bring You My Love marks Harvey's first proper solo album. She had recorded Dry and Rid Of Me with her trio, featuring drummer Rob Ellis and bassist Steve Vaughan. But this new chapter finds Harvey beginning her lauded work with producers Flood and John Parish.

Following the raw grunge of Rid Of Me, recorded by Steve Albini, Harvey moved to rural England and wrote in isolation. She imagined an emotional reality and explored the shadowy corners of the human condition, like someone transformed (or possessed) by desire. But instead of the boundaries of the physical state, Harvey searched the metaphysical.

This isn't Robert Johnson selling his soul at the crossroads. Harvey sounds so darkly possessed, it's like she's wrestled back control of her soul from the devil. Its recaptured and murky condition creates a kind of superpower—someone with nothing to lose.

“To Bring You My Love” isn't Harvey's plea for love. This is just how it's going to be.

The spirit might be an essence or a principle. But one hardened by the harsh winds of experience and rejection. What Harvey is singing about is the messy, complex nature of things. It's everything that it means to be truly human.

New Delhi: With the conclusion of the Indian Premier League, general entertainment channel Colors is set to introduce a new supernatural series titled Noyontara. The show follows the life of a 23-year-old ghost-whisperer, Noyontara, who has long lived on the margins of society due to her rare abilities. Her story takes a turn when she marries Dr Surjo, a rationalist haunted by personal loss.

Upon arriving at her new home, the mysterious Pari Mahal, Noyontara becomes entangled in a web of family secrets and supernatural occurrences. Central to the narrative are two women, Lata and Lalita, each claiming to be her mother-in-law. As the line between guidance and manipulation becomes increasingly blurred, Noyontara must navigate complex relationships, hidden motives, and spectral allies, including a mischievous ghost named Hasiram.

Shruti Bhist, who plays the lead role, reflected on the character's strength and uniqueness. “It's an exciting challenge to spearhead Noyontara, a supernatural thriller set in a world where the living are shrouded in secrets and the dead aren't always what they seem. The most compelling twist that viewers will get to see in the story is its unexpected take on ghosts: the good ones, the guardians, the misunderstood. My character is no damsel in distress, she's a fighter, a saviour, someone who's embraced her gift of ghost-whispering while navigating the fragile line between life and death. What drew me to the character was her strength and her unwavering drive to help those carrying pain, loss, and the echoes that linger after death.”

Actor Narayani Shastri, in her first collaboration with Colors, spoke about portraying dual roles in the series. “Noyontara marks my very first association with Colors, and I couldn't have asked for a more challenging role to begin this journey. The stark contrast between the two characters I portray gripped me from the very first narration, one is a calculating, power-hungry manipulator, while the other is fierce, protective, and guided by love and instinct. Both women exist under the same roof, but carry entirely different energies. It was creatively exhilarating to slip into two such emotionally distinct spaces and bring them to life through unique mannerisms and motivations. What I love most is that amidst all the mysticism, the story taps into a very real human conflict — the struggle to discern truth from illusion. I'm looking forward to audiences experiencing this constant dance of doubt, where you're never sure who's the saviour… and who's the villain.”

Arjun Chakrabarty, known for his work in Bengali cinema, will be making his debut in Hindi television with this show. “Noyontara is exactly the kind of Hindi television debut I had hoped for, emotionally rich, and unlike anything I've done before. I play Surjo, a man of science and structure, someone who clings to logic while quietly carrying the weight of past grief. His world is turned upside down when he marries Noyontara, a woman who moves seamlessly between the living and the dead, his complete opposite in every way. The two central women in Surjo's life, his wife and his mother, operate from a space of faith and emotion, which he has spent years distancing himself from. But through them, he's forced to confront the very emotions he's tried to suppress, and in that confrontation lies the chance for healing. What drew me to this role is its emotional complexity, the reminder that sometimes our deepest battles aren't with the supernatural, but with the fears and truths we carry within ourselves.”

Noyontara is scheduled to premiere on June 9 and will air daily at 8:30 PM on Colors.

If you see some strange lights descending over Strathcona County on Saturday night, don't freak out. The alien guests have been invited.

Among the true-believer set, it's called a Close Encounter of the Fifth Kind, or CE-5 for short. We've all heard stories about people who have seen UFOs, and late-night TV is filled with stories about people being abducted by little grey beings. But a CE-5 is where, and take this with all the grains of salt you need, contact between aliens and humans are initiated by us.

Derryn Donaghey, who has a fantastical UFO encounter story of his own, is organizing the conference, to be held near Cooking Lake, about 42 km southeast of Edmonton. He was part of a similar gathering a couple of years ago. The attendees all form a circle, looking up. This gives the group a 360-degree view of the sky. There is mental focus on attracting alien attention, and sounds are played that are supposedly signals to extra-terrestrials that “hey, we've set up a sort of interstellar bus stop, here.” In Douglas Adams' famed The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, travellers can  stick out a beacon called an “electronic thumb” that attracts alien ships. So, it's sort of like that, and nothing like that at the same time.

Donaghey claims that at the previous gathering, the group saw 52 “ships” in just a 10-minute period.

“And no one was scared,” he said. “They were just euphoric. Really, the truth is out there, we should see if we can find it in our lifetime. If there is truly life out there, I think they are more active now because they have seen what a gong show is happening here.”

Donaghey said that recent moves by the American government to declassify military files and video of UFO encounters has helped push his research into the mainstream.

“I've never seen little green men, but I have seen things that I can't explain, ” said Donaghey.

Donaghey was in the military police back in 1987. He was part of group of military personnel who were out training near Redwater, roughly 60 km north of Edmonton. This is what he recalls: In the middle of nowhere, their compasses stopped working. Their flashlights went dead. And soon, in a clearing, they saw a large ship, like nothing they'd ever seen.

“It was so close, you could have hit it with a slingshot,” he said.

But, when they returned to base, only three of the dozen military personnel remembered the ship at all.  The memories of most of the soldiers had gone full Manchurian Candidate. Then, it was just Donaghey and his superior officer.  Dongahey said he tried to report it, and was told by superior officers to keep his mouth shut, instead.

He stayed quiet for years.

“You don't want to talk about it, because you sound crazy.”

Nathan Zieber is a dual American/Canadian citizen who spent years working as an investigator for MUFON, the civilian-led, non-profit group that investigates UFO sightings around the world. He is known as the “Paranormal Pastor.” He will be speaking at Saturday's event.

He said that 98 per cent of his investigations can be explained: Aircraft, drones, balloons, comets and other natural phenomena. He said that his goal as a UFO researcher is not to prove the existence of extraterrestrials, but to simply eliminate the easy-to-come-by explanations.

“My job isn't to prove what it is, but to prove what it can't be, that it can't be these other things,” he said. “The truth is left out there.”

He became interested in UFO investigations because of his American grandfather, who served in the Vietnam War. He said that his grandfather saw many of what the military called “foo fighters” during his time in Asia.

The most compelling investigation Zieber has been on? In the UFO community, Alberta is well-known for cattle mutilations. As in, cows found dead in the pasture, drained of all blood.

He was called to one near the hamlet of Madden, about 240 km south of Edmonton, where some cows were drained, the eyeballs removed. He said there was no rational explanation on how cows could be slain like that. He said there were traces of radioactivity in the area and that nearby trees showed signs of charring. It's one that is still in the unsolved file.

Even amongst those we might call UFO enthusiasts, there are no easy explanations. Donaghey said that's why Saturday's symposium is all about sharing ideas, and nothing is off limits. He's heard it all, from alien visitation to government false-flag operations to that all of this reported heightened activity in the sky is a sign of the Rapture.

“Anyone who claims to have all the answers is someone to avoid,” said Donaghey.

Donaghey understands that a lot of people see him as a nut, or someone who has seen things that can be scientifically explained. But he said that attendees to these events often include the likes of police officers, nurses and doctors.

“We're not a bunch of wackos.”

She's Baba “Manga.”

A Japanese graphic novel artist and psychic has foretold of a major disaster that'll befall Japan in 2025 — and people are so spooked they're canceling their summer vacations.

Manga artist Ryo Tatsuki has drawn comparisons to the blind Bulgarian mystic “Baba Vanga” for her eerily accurate predictions of global events, which have included everything from the deaths of Freddie Mercury and Princess Diana to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, the Daily Mail reported.

For her latest apocalyptic prophecy, outlined in a 2021 edition of her best-selling comic “The Future I Saw,” she predicted a calamity occurring on July 5, 2025, the Guardian reported.

The exact nature of the fiasco is unclear. 

But it mirrored a prediction she made in the original 1999 manga in which she warned of a major “great disaster” striking Japan in March 2011 — the same date as the Japanese earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people and caused a triple-meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

As such, superstitious parties took such stock in Tatsuki's latest premonition that they uploaded social media PSAs warning people to steer clear of the Land Of The Rising Sun. 

With the so-called doomsday date just around the corner, many travelers who had summer Japan trips booked are getting cold feet and either postponing or scrapping their vacays altogether.

Flight reservations for Japan from key markets such as South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong plunged dramatically following the prophecy.

According to a survey by Bloomberg Intelligence bookings from Hong Kong were down 50% year-on-year while trips between late June and early July had plummeted by as much as 83%.

And summer trips weren't the only ones impacted by the prescient comic. An HK travel agency claimed that Japan travel reservations during the April-May spring break were down by half from last year.

Japanese officials have since implored people to ignore the warnings, which they claim are completely unfounded.

“It would be a major problem if the spread of unscientific rumors on social media had an effect on tourism,” said Yoshihiro Murai, governor of Miyagi prefecture — one of the hardest hit during the 2011 earthquake — said at a press conference, per the Daily Mail. “There is no reason to worry because Japanese are not fleeing abroad … I hope people will ignore the rumors and visit.” 

Nonetheless, even state officials have been concerned over quakes of late — and not just because of Tatsuki's manga, whose latest edition has sold more than 1 million copies.

In April, a government taskforce warned that a quake originating off Japan's Pacific coast would kill as many 298,000 people.

Fortunately, while Japan is one of the world's most quake-prone countries due to its location on the Pacific “Ring Of Fire” experts pointed out that it's impossible to accurately forecast the time and location of an earthquake.

Unfortunately, the so-called Japan disaster isn't the only calamity that's on the horizon, according to “The Future I Saw.” Tatsuki also foretold that COVID-19 — which killed over 7 million people and overflowed hospitals in 2020 — would return in 2030 and wreak even “greater devastation,” the Daily Mail reported.

“An unknown virus will come in 2020, will disappear after peaking in April, and appear again 10 years later,” she wrote.

This comes after a highly infectious COVID-19 strain that caused hospitalizations to spike in China has reared its head in the US with cases in New York City.

In a recent interview with Japanese media, Tatsuki warned people to take her predictions with a grain of salt.

“It's important not to be unnecessarily influenced … and to listen to the opinions of experts,” she said.

A psychic dubbed Japan's 'Baba Vanga' issued a terrifying prediction for 2030 which will bring back harrowing memories for many.

Ryo Tatsuki, a manga artist from Japan who's drawn frequent comparisons to the famous fortune teller Baba Vanga, has earned a reputation for eerily accurate predictions of some of the world's most devastating catastrophes.

Indeed, the psychic has correctly predicted the deaths of Freddie Mercury, Princess Diana, along with a myriad of major world events - including the Kobe earthquake in 2011 and even the Covid-19 pandemic.

Now, the prophetess is predicting the return of a deadly virus, much like the one which resulted in mass lockdowns, overflowing hospitals and more than 7 million deaths when it swept the globe in 2020.

Writing in her book, titled The Future as I See It, published in 1999, the Japanese mystic foresaw the arrival of an 'unknown virus' in 2020, with many believing her to have accurately predicted the onset of Covid-19.

And according to Tatsuki, the world is yet to see the last of the devastating virus.

The Japanese artist predicted that the health disaster would make a 'return in 2030' and reap even 'greater devastation'.

'An unknown virus will come in 2020, will disappear after peaking in April, and appear again 10 years later,' she wrote.

A theory that may not be so far from the truth in light of the news that Covid cases are creeping back up in India. 

Major states including Kerala, Maharashtra, and Gujarat, among others have reported a 'sharp increase' in diagnoses of the virus, reported the Economic Times.

Responding to the new influx, health authorities across the country have issued guidelines to hospitals and warned people to remain vigilant. 

Officials have told the public not to panic but have emphasised the need for people to be cautious and act in line with government issued health guidelines. 

Last month, tourists were seen cancelling their trips in swathes after a prediction from Tatsuki foresaw disaster striking Japan.

Tatsuki, who also has a career as a manga artist, first gained notoriety after a number of predictions from her 1999 book titled, The Future I Saw, appeared to come to fruition.

In 2021, Tatsuki released an updated version of 'The Future I Saw' which included a prediction of a major disaster in mid-2025.

Now, as the date draws closer, many travellers who had holidays booked to Japan for July are getting cold feet and postponing their trips or cancelling altogether.

According to CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, a travel agency based in Hong Kong, bookings to Japan dropped by half during the Easter holiday.

This is expected to dip even further in the coming two months in the leadup to the premonition date.

Tourists from China and Hong Kong, which are the country's second- and fourth-largest sources of tourists, respectively, have been the most likely to cancel or postpone their Japan travel plans.

This was further exacerbated after China's embassy in Tokyo stoked concerns by releasing an official warning to Chinese citizens in late April to take caution when travelling, studying or buying real estate in Japan.

But the panic has since spread to other markets including Thailand and Vietnam, where social media platforms have been flooded with Tatsuki's prediction, warning travellers to reconsider their holidays to Japan.

Japanese officials have since attempted to quell the panic with a series of official statements to reassure travellers that these were simply 'unscientific rumours'.

'It would be a major problem if the spread of unscientific rumours on social media had an effect on tourism,' Yoshihiro Murai, governor of Miyagi prefecture, said at a press conference.

'There is no reason to worry because Japanese are not fleeing abroad … I hope people will ignore the rumours and visit.'

In 1999, after consistently having what she described as visions of the future, Tatsuki released her book which was titled, 'The Future I Saw' (cover pictured)

While she was largely unknown at the time her first book was published, Tatsuki has since became a recognised force among psychics.

She claimed she began having premonitions in the early 1980s after a number of her vivid dreams came true.

Her book has recently gained renewed interest after a number of her premonitions made in hindsight appeared to mirror real life events.

Amongst her chilling predictions for the future, Tatsuki is said to have accurately foretold the sudden death of Freddie Mercury. 

She claims to have seen images of the Queen frontman dying suddenly in a dream on November 24, 1976.

Exactly 15 years to the day later, the singer died aged 45 from complications of having AIDS.

She is also thought to have predicted the death of Princess Diana.

A year later, Tatsuki claimed she had a dream in which she saw a woman standing at the end of a corridor in a palace. Stood at the end, she saw a portrait of a blonde woman holding a baby, with the picture named 'Diana'. 

Five years to the day later, she claimed she had another dream about the Princess in which she saw her die in the car crash.

The prophet has previously said that her predictive dreams arrive in a period of time that can be divided by five. 

Then in 1995, Tatsuki said that dreamed an old man led her to 'cracked earth', leading her to predict that the Japanese city of Kobe would be 'cracked' in either 15 days or 15 years.

And thus her prophecy came true as 15 days later, Kobe was struck by an insidious earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people. It is now considered the second deadliest earthquake of the 20th century.

She has often been compared to the Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, who despite passing away nearly three decades ago in 1996, has issued countless predictions for the fate of the world, foretelling events all the way up till 5079. 

She too became a cult figure after supposedly predicting major world events such as 9/11, the Covid-19 pandemic and even Princess Diana's death.

Speculation is swirling about Trump's lack of public events. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)AP

Political pundits and social media users are questioning why President Donald Trump has gone “missing” from public appearances despite major world events taking place. 

The president has not had any public events scheduled since at least Friday, according to Trump's schedule, sparking speculation as to what the president has been doing in recent days. Many social media users wondered if the president is feeling the “pressure” after being nicknamed “TACO Trump,” after Ukraine launched a massive offensive against Russia and after tech billionaire Elon Musk criticized his “big beautiful bill.” 

Some users suggested, without evidence, that Trump's disappearance must be because he had “a medical event” despite there being no proof of that. Trump is slated to likely make a public appearance on Wednesday evening for a “summer soiree” on the White House lawn, according to his public schedule.

MeidasTouch's Ben Meiselas reported on Trump's lack of public appearances in a video published on Wednesday.

“Where did he go? Like, where did Donald Trump go? We really haven't heard from him since the weekend. Yeah, he's made deranged posts. Of course, he does that. He made that weird post that former President Biden got executed in 2020 and then became some sort of robotic manifestation,” Meiselas said. 

“But Donald Trump hasn't had any public appearances. I mean, I know he was playing golf in Virginia and then playing golf in Virginia again. But really, what, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? Nothing on his public schedule,” he added.

In one of his few Truth Social posts over the weekend, Trump also shared an unfounded conspiracy theory on Saturday night that claimed former President Joe Biden was “executed” in 2020 and replaced with robots or clones. This comes as Trump continues to promote MAGA's latest conspiracy theory that aides around Biden misused the “autopen” while Biden was in office.

“With the exception of the RIGGED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020, THE AUTOPEN IS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY!!!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post at 2:28 a.m. on Wednesday.

Meiselas jabbed Trump over the autopen in his video on Wednesday, questioning who is “running” Trump's autopen when he is in “hiding”.

“Trump is still a threat while he's in hiding. You know, I'm not sure, you know, who's running Donald Trump's autopen or who's pulling the strings. Is it Steven Miller? Who, you know, who is it?” he said.

Trump critic Ron Filipkowski also blasted the president for his 2 a.m. Truth Social post and mocked him for being “MIA.”

“TACO's been MIA for days, got up and posted a Biden conspiracy at 2:00 AM, then went back to bed. Maybe he will surface today - he's going to do something crazy to distract media from the Elon story,” he said.

“The David Pakman Show” posted a video raising questions as to where Trump is on Tuesday. Host David Pakman emphasized that he does not think Trump is “dead” or “ill,” but wondered who is in charge while Trump is away. He noted that Republicans made the same accusations of Biden while he was in office. 

“He's still got a team of extremists around him who are making moves every single day, whether or not Trump's there. You've got Stephen Miller and J.D. Vance and whoever else. So again, where is Donald Trump? And maybe just as importantly, if he's not at the wheel, who is at the wheel?” Pakman said.

“We have some guesses, but we really don't know. And it's another example of how all of the criticisms and claims about the Biden administration seem to be doubly true about Donald Trump,” he added.

Sean 'Diddy' Combs' sex trafficking trial has spawned a slew of absurd conspiracy theories linking the rapper to several high-profile figures.

Internet trolls have tried to connect some of America's biggest names - from Barack Obama and Kamala Harris to Beyoncé and Jay-Z - to Diddy's alleged misconduct.

Prince and Kim Porter were brought into the discourse posthumously with theorists alleging both detailed Diddy's alleged exploits before their deaths.

Others even went as far as baselessly claiming Los Angeles' deadly Palisades Fire was set in an attempt to burn evidence that would be essential to Diddy's trial. 

Diddy, 55, has pleaded not guilty to five counts including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. The trial is currently in its fourth week.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan say that over two decades Combs coerced women, including his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, to take part in drug-fueled sexual acts.

Combs' lawyers have acknowledged he was at times abusive in domestic relationships, but argue that women who took part in 'Freak Offs' did so consensually.

After Diddy was accused of a string of depraved crimes, there was widespread fears among Justin Bieber fans that the singer may have been sexually abused by the rap mogul during his early years in the music industry.

Concern first erupted last year after a video resurfaced of Combs and Bieber - who was a minor at the time - hanging out for '48 hours.' The pair also worked together on an album.

The viral video showed the pair standing next to each other while Diddy stated: 'He's having 48 hours with Diddy, where we hanging out and what we're doing we can't really disclose. But it's definitely a 15-year-old's dream.' 

He added: 'I have been given custody of him. He's signed to Usher and I had legal guardianship of Usher when he did his first album. 

'I don't have legal guardianship of him [Bieber] but for the next 48 hours he's with me and we're gonna go full crazy.' 

During the clip, Bieber offered simple responses to Combs - such as saying 'yeah' and also 'full crazy.' 

But Bieber, 31, has insisted he wasn't targeted by the rapper.

The singer's spokesperson told TMZ last month: 'Although Justin is not among Sean Combs' victims, there are individuals who were genuinely harmed by him. Shifting focus away from this reality detracts from the justice these victims rightfully deserve.'

In regards to the videos of the pair together, insiders told the news outlet that the interactions were simply 'performative' - and explained Bieber was closer to the rapper's sons than to Sean.   

When a series of deadly wildfires tore through southern California in January, conspiracy theorists made baseless claims the infernos were started to 'cover up' Diddy's alleged sex crimes - and protect any allies he may have left.

 Diddy's lavish house in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles, a few miles east of Beverly Hills, was untouched by the devastating fires.

But many celebrities who live in or near the Pacific Palisades area - anywhere from five to 50 miles away from Holmby Hills - did lose their homes.

Former government official Catherine Austin Fitts ramped up the theory by asking how many people connected to Diddy have avoided their homes being destroyed.

'In situations like [the L.A. fires], I look at patterns,' Fitts said on her podcast. 

'I look at some of the communities involved. How many of the homeowners were on the P. Diddy list?'

The Diddy list is said to name all celebrities accused of attending parties hosted by the rapper where he is alleged to abused. The list has not been verified.

There are also wild claims about the fires being started to destroy evidence and even a network of tunnels from Diddy's home to other properties including the Playboy mansion and even Michael Jackson's home.

There are claims that this was a joke online.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris was linked to Diddy in the weeks leading up to the 2024 presidential election thanks to a resurfaced tweet.

Harris, during her run for the White House in 2019, praised Diddy for hosting a town hall on racial inequality for her campaign. 

'There's a lot at stake for our communities right now and it's critical we bring to the forefront how coronavirus is perpetuating racial inequality and health disparities,' the tweet read. 

But conservatives jumped at the opportunity to bring up the old tweet, with some pointing out 'this didn't age well...' 

President Donald Trump even shared a meme featuring a doctored image of Harris and Diddy to his Truth Social platform, saying: 'Madam vice president, have you ever been involved with or engaged in one of Puff Daddies freak offs?'

Beyoncé and Jay-Z were baselessly accused of being involved in a criminal enterprise with Diddy last year.

The allegations surfaced on Piers Morgan's Uncensored show when singer Jaguar Wright, who appeared as a guest on the program, suggested the pair had committed crimes similar to those of which Diddy has been accused.

Wright told the media personality she had been 'screaming' that 'Diddy and Jay-Z are 'monsters' for four years.

But Morgan was forced to issue an apology to the famous couple after their lawyers contacted him, saying the allegations were 'totally false and have no basis in fact'.

Wright's claims, which Morgan said would 'have an audience with or without shows like mine', were edited out of the program, BBC reported.

Morgan also apologized, saying: 'Editing interviews is not something we do lightly at a show called Uncensored. But like the proverbial cries of 'fire' in a crowded theatre, there are legal limits on us, too. And we apologize to Jay-Z and Beyoncé.'

Jay-Z also came under fire after he was accused in a lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old alongside Combs after the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. 

The complaint was dismissed by the alleged victim's attorney in February this year.

The 99 problems hitmaker released a statement after the suit was dropped, saying: 'Today is a victory. The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed. This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere. 

'The fictional tale they created was laughable, if not for the seriousness of the claims. I would not wish this experience on anyone.' 

A fake news story, based on no evidence whatsoever, went viral in October last year, alleging that Will Smith sold his daughter Willow Smith to Diddy.

The article featured a doctored image of Willow, 23, and the rap mogul in bed together, prompting widespread speculation that she had been harmed by Diddy.

Internet sleuths posted lengthy videos claiming that there was 'deeply unsettling' 'leaked footage' showing both Willow and her older brother Jaden, 26, in 'compromising situations' with Diddy.

One conspiracy theorist even peddled an allegation that the children's mother Jada Pinkett Smith sold Jaden to the rapper.

There is no evidence to support any of the allegations about the Smith family.

DIDDY HAS FOOTAGE OF BARACK OBAMA 

Conspiracy theorists quickly looped Former President Barack Obama into the Diddy dialogue after the disgraced rapper was arrested last year and an image of them together resurfaced.

Conservative influencer Charlie Kirk discussed the pair's connection on his web show, even baselessly questioning: 'Maybe P. Diddy has footage of Barack Obama doing something he shouldn't have been doing?'

Obama first crossed paths with Diddy in 2004 when the music mogul rallied support for Democrats ahead of that year's DNC. This included Diddy interviewing Obama for MTV, where Obama praised the rapper for encouraging people to get out the vote.

As Diddy's wealth soared to over $700 million through the noughties, he became a top celebrity backer for the Democrats and used his platform to back the party in several election cycles.

In 2004, this saw Diddy interview both Obama - then a candidate for the senate in Illinois - and Hillary Clinton.

Footage of Diddy's brief interview with Obama, which was widely circulated in wake of the rapper's arrest, saw the politician praised the Diddy's efforts 'because he doesn't have to do this.'

'This is part of what is important about giving back,' the young Obama said.

Their exchange appeared jovial, as Diddy made fun of Obama sweating at the convention as he said he 'wanted to apologize for not sweating' while Obama jokingly padded his head with a napkin.

Diddy would go on to support Obama's successful run for the White House in 2008, including hosting a 'Last Chance for Change' rally for the then-candidate in Florida days before the election.

Obama was bizarrely named in Diddy's ongoing federal trial in shocking testimony about drug-taking at the rapper's infamous 'freak off' parties.

Diddy's former personal assistant David James testified that A-listers would pop pills including Percocet and ecstasy at the parties.

He did not say Obama was ever in attendance at the parties - but said celebrities would celebrate with 'various pills in the shape of the former president's face', the court heard.

Just last month a rumor circulated online that federal prosecutors presented a secret recording of Prince exposing Diddy as evidence in the rapper's trial.

The rumor alleged that Prince, before his death, divulged details of the alleged illicit activities from Diddy's parties.

He also warned 'if something happens to me, this recording needs to go to the press or the police, either one', according to the theory.

But the alleged video or audio recording never surfaced. 

AI-generated content claiming to be a 'Prince & 'Diddy' video' has been shared online, but factcheckers on sites like YouTube have added disclaimers that the footage is 'altered or synthetic content'.

Prince was mentioned in the Diddy trial by Cassie Ventura who, in her testimony, said she fled a party at the musician's house just before Diddy assaulted her at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

Prince died on April 21, 2016. The coroner ruled that the seven-time Grammy-winner died from an accidental fentanyl overdose.

Diddy's ex-girlfriend Kimberly Porter was tied to the trial from beyond the grave after the publication of a fabricated salacious memoir that purported to tell the story of an abusive relationship between the pair.

Porter and Combs' children denounced the 59-page book - titled Kim's Lost Words: A journey for justice, from the other side... - as a complete fabrication after it became a bestseller on Amazon in September last year.

'We were made aware of a dispute regarding this title and have notified the publisher,' an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. 'The book is not currently available for sale in our store.'

The independent publisher is Todd Christopher Guzze, who goes by the name Chris Todd and defines his occupation as an 'investigative producer, author and journalist.'

Todd told The Associated Press in a phone interview in September that sources 'very close to Kim and Sean Combs' provided him with a 'flash drive, documents and tapes' from Porter that he eventually pieced together to create the memoir.

Todd used the pseudonym Jamal T. Millwood when publishing the title. The name is an apparent reference to a conspiracy theory involving rapper Tupac Shakur, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in 1996.

The theory baselessly claims that Tupac faked his death and was using the alias Jamal T. Millwood.

OpenAI on Wednesday announced that it now has 3 million paying business users, up from the 2 million it reported in February. 

The San Francisco-based startup rocketed into the mainstream in late 2022 with its consumer-facing artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, and began launching workplace-specific versions of the product the following year.

The 3 million users include ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Team and ChatGPT Edu customers, OpenAI said. 

""There's this really tight interconnect between the growth of ChatGPT as a consumer tool and its adoption in the enterprise and in businesses,"" OpenAI's chief operating officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC in an interview. The company supported 400 million weekly active users as of February.

OpenAI expects revenue of $12.7 billion this year, a source confirmed to CNBC. In September of last year, the company expected to see an annual loss of $5 billion on $3.7 billion in revenue, according to a person close to the company who asked not to be named because the financials are confidential.

Lightcap said OpenAI is seeing its business tools adopted across industries, including highly regulated sectors like financial services and health care. Companies including Lowe's, Morgan Stanley and Uber are users, OpenAI said. 

The company also announced new updates to its business offerings on Wednesday. 

ChatGPT Team and ChatGPT Enterprise users can now access ""connectors,"" which will allow workers to pull data from third-party tools like Google Drive, Dropbox, SharePoint, Box and OneDrive without leaving ChatGPT. Additional deep research connectors are available in beta. 

OpenAI launched another capability called ""record mode"" in ChatGPT, which allows users to record and transcribe their meetings. It's initially available with audio only. 

Record mode can assist with follow up after a meeting and integrates with internal information like documents and files, the company said. Users can also turn their recordings into documents through the company's Canvas tool.

Lightcap said enterprise customers have been asking for updates like these, and that they will help make OpenAI's workplace offerings more useful. 

""It's got to be able to do tasks for you, and to do that, it's got to really have knowledge of everything going on around you and your work,"" Lightcap said. ""It can't be the intern locked in a closet. It's got to be able to see what you see.""

OpenAI said it has been signing up nine enterprises a week, and Lightcap said the company will try to sustain that pace over time. 

""People are starting to really figure out that this is a part of the modern tool stack in the knowledge economy that we live in,"" he said.

WATCH: Consumer need isn't there for OpenAI hardware product, says Michael Nathanson

WASHINGTON, June 4. /TASS/. Republican President Donald Trump has asked his fellow party members in the US Senate not to bring to a vote, for the time being, a bill that would tighten sanctions against Russia, including by imposing restrictions on third countries, according to Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Roger Wicker (Republican, Mississippi).

""I know he has requested that [Republican Senate Majority Leader John] Thune not bring the bill up [for consideration] this week,"" the lawmaker said during an online meeting with the Defense Writers Group in Washington, of which TASS is a member.

The bill in question was introduced in early April by a bipartisan group of senators. The main sponsors were Senator Lindsey Graham (Republican, South Carolina, designated by Russia as a terrorist and extremist) and Senator Richard Blumenthal (Democrat, Connecticut). The initiative envisions, among other measures, secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners. The proposal includes imposing a 500% import tariff on goods entering the US from countries that purchase oil, gas, uranium, and other commodities from Russia. Senator Rand Paul (Republican, Kentucky) recently warned in an op-ed for the Responsible Statecraft website that the country most harmed by the potential passage of this legislation would be the United States itself, both economically and strategically.

According to the information presented by Wicker, the bill enjoys overwhelming support from the 100-member Senate, making its passage through the upper chamber of Congress virtually assured. In his assessment, should the bill become law, it would have a very negative impact also on China. However, Wicker did not clarify whether, in his view, Trump would support the bill.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Hugo Aguilar, who has links to governing party, topped unprecedented and controversial popular vote

An Indigenous lawyer from the state of Oaxaca is set to become the president of Mexico's supreme court following the country's unprecedented elections to appoint its entire judicial system by popular vote.

Activists hailed the election of Hugo Aguilar, a member of the Mixtec Indigenous group, as a symbolic victory – while noting that Aguilar, who topped the poll of candidates for the supreme court, had long since shifted from his own roots as an activist to a figure much more closely aligned with the state, and involved in controversial mega-projects such as the Maya Train.

“[Aguilar] is a brilliant lawyer,” wrote Joaquín Galván, a defender of Indigenous rights in Oaxaca, on X. “But while they say we the Indigenous are represented in him, in reality he has spent almost 20 years operating for the government, not for [Indigenous] peoples.”

Sunday's vote was the result of a radical reform by the governing Morena party, which said it would reduce corruption and impunity in the judicial system by making it more responsive to popular opinion.

But the concept was challenged by critics who said it would destroy the separation of powers and could flood the judicial system with unqualified candidates backed by opaque interests. Many career judges chose not to run.

Roughly 2,600 posts, from local magistrates to supreme court justices, were up for grabs. Given the sheer number of positions and candidates involved, critics had warned that a low turnout was likely. Parts of the opposition also called for a boycott.

In the event, just 13% of Mexicans voted, a record low in a federal election.

“The turnout was frankly meagre,” said Javier Martín Reyes, a constitutional law professor at Mexico's Unam university. “The government has tried to argue that voters were demanding this reform. But this has been proven false.”

Sheinbaum described the process as “a complete success”, adding: “Mexico is the most democratic country in the world.”

There was evidence of illegal party interference in the elections through the distribution of cheat sheets telling people how to vote, largely with the names of the government's favoured candidates.

All nine of the new justices on the supreme court were included on such cheat sheets. Most have ties to the governing party, meaning it may no longer act as a check on Morena's executive power, as it has in the past.

Aguilar is among them, having served as a senior official at the National Institute for Indigenous Peoples during the government of Sheinbaum's predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

One of Aguilar's campaign promises was to promote justice for Indigenous communities and the environment – yet under López Obrador he coordinated consultations for mega-projects such as the Maya Train and the Interoceanic Corridor, a train-and-port system to connect trade between the Pacific and the Atlantic, that were riddled with irregularities.

Two other candidates with previous ties to Morena are María Ríos, who served as legal counsel to López Obrador when he was president, and Irving Espinosa, who was an adviser to Morena lawmakers.

Three sitting justices who decided to run were all re-elected: Lenia Batres, Yasmín Esquivel and Loretta Ortiz. All three were initially nominated by López Obrador and have largely voted in favour of Morena governments.

It is not certain how justices with past ties to Morena will vote, but if they band together they could give Sheinbaum a decisive majority on Mexico's highest court.

Even those with more independent profiles might fear to go against the executive, said Martín Reyes.

“Morena and its allies have a supermajority – they can change the constitution at any moment, start political trials, remove [the justices'] immunity,” said Martín Reyes. “These people will live under the threat of sanction.”

The National Electoral Institute will continue to release results over the next week, including for the powerful new disciplinary tribune, tasked with supervising judges, and the top electoral court.

Preliminary results suggest Morena may have significant influence in the first of those, too.

“These elections were a failure and a success,” said Martín Reyes. “A failure in terms of democratic participation – but a success in terms of political capture.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Germany: Cologne evacuation lifted after WWII bombs defused","https://www.dw.com/en/germany-cologne-evacuation-lifted-after-wwii-bombs-defused/a-72782573","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 17:48:45 GMT","

Buildings across the center of the western city of Cologne were evacuated after the discovery of three World War II bombs. Some 20,000 people had been under evacuation orders. 

Large areas of the city center of Cologne were closed off on Wednesday as experts defused three bombs left over from World War II, which ended 80 years ago.

The evacuation operation in Cologne, which has seen plenty of them over the years, was one of the largest to ever be carried out in the city since World War II, with some 20,000 people ordered to leave the affected area.

The process of defusing the bombs had to be delayed at one point because of a resident refusing to evacuate, according to a city spokesperson.

An individual living in the old town resisted orders to leave their apartment, with public order officials, police, and the fire department enforcing removal measures.

Kai Kulschewski, head of explosive ordnance disposal in the nearby city of Düsseldorf, who is coordinating the disposal, had earlier said everything was going to plan. He had added that the defusing operation had yet to begin as of the afternoon because not everyone had been evacuated yet. 

""We can only start when the last person is out,"" he said. 

The evacuated area included the entire old part of the city, 58 hotels, three Rhine bridges, the town hall, the railway station in the district of Deutz, which lies across the Rhine from the city center, museums, a hospital and two care homes.

The city's major landmark, Cologne Cathedral, was, however, situated just outside the danger area.

Germany's national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, had warned that many trains will be diverted or even canceled, and road traffic has was severely disrupted. 

The weapons — two 2000-pound (900-kilogram) bombs and one 1000-pound bomb, all manufactured in the US — were discovered in Deutz on Monday.

In a statement on its website, the City of Cologne said, ""The evacuation is the largest such measure since the end of World War II. Everyone involved hopes that the defusal can be completed in the course of Wednesday.""

Bomb defusals are nothing new in Cologne, as it was one of the major bombing targets for Allied forces during the Second World War.

Among other attacks, the British Royal Air Force targeted Cologne with its first ""thousand-bomber raid"" on a German city overnight to May 31, 1942, dropping 1,455 tons of bombs and destroying or damaging thousands of buildings.

Corporate America has fallen out of love with Pride month – and it's because of Donald Trump.

Businesses that used to smother their merchandise in rainbow flags for the month of June have dramatically scaled back this year, many wary of provoking an investigation by the Trump administration.

Meanwhile, Pride events across the US are facing budget shortfalls as corporate sponsors duck out.

Robby Starbuck, the anti-woke activist known for his pressure campaigns, believes a “massive” shift has taken place at some of the world's biggest companies in the past year.

Polling of 200 corporate executives by Gravity Research, seen by The Telegraph, showed almost two in five plan to pare back their Pride month celebrations this year.

Of those, the overwhelming majority – 60 per cent – said this was a result of pressure by Mr Trump.

“It's clear that the administration and their supporters are driving the change,” Luke Hartig, president of Gravity Research, said. “Companies are under increasing pressure not to engage and speak out on issues.”

On his first days in office, Mr Trump issued a flurry of executive orders taking aim at diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in both the government and private sector.

Jeremy Tedesco, a senior counsel with the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), believes that most companies regard Pride as a “performative act” and are now unwilling to risk incurring the wrath of the administration by showing their support.

“In those orders are promises to use the department of justice and some of the other relevant federal agencies to investigate recalcitrant companies that are continuing illegal practices,” he said.

“Companies are viewing this as a legitimate risk at this point.”

Right-wing activists believe much of corporate America's commitment to Pride month and LGBT causes is underpinned by the Human Rights Campaign, an influential pressure group.

Eric Bloem, its vice-president of corporate citizenship, claimed Mr Trump was “weaponising” the justice department and the equal employment opportunity commission to “intimidate companies”.

“Companies that show up only when it's convenient, or backtrack the moment there's political pressure, risk losing trust and credibility,” he told CNN.

Gravity's polling shows Americans are broadly cynical about companies that have embraced Pride, believing they are more concerned with profit than principle.

“It's primarily that Left-wing activists figured out the levers of pressure to apply to companies, to get them to do what they wanted to do, while the Right of centre didn't really show up,” Mr Tedesco said.

Now it is the Left which appears to have been caught flat-footed by the sudden shift in the political landscape.

In San Francisco, the US' longstanding liberal bastion, its annual Pride event reportedly faces a $200,000 budget gap after corporate donors failed to materialise this year.

Heritage of Pride, the group behind celebrations in New York and other American cities, is attempting to claw its way out of a budget shortfall of some $750,000 for the same reason.

Anheuser-Busch, a company scarred by its corporate partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, has left Pridefest in St Louis, Missouri $150,000 in the black after ending its three-decade sponsorship.

Washington DC is hosting World Pride this year, meaning drag queens and demonstrators waving rainbow flags will soon be descending on Mr Trump's doorstep.

But there too, Booz Allen Hamilton, the technology company, withdrew its sponsorship citing its need to comply with “recently issued executive orders”, according to the Washington Business Journal.

The Kennedy Centre, the performing arts venue where Mr Trump installed himself as chairman soon after taking office this year, has also cancelled its “Tapestry of Pride” events which were scheduled to last from June 5 to 8.

Washington Pride Alliance subsequently distanced itself from the centre, labelling the move “disappointing”.

Gravity's polling shows 39 per cent of companies said they were toning down their celebrations because of a threat of a backlash from the Right.

Just seven per cent said they had been swayed by resistance from progressives, in a sign of the shifting power dynamics in American politics.

Mr Starbuck, one of America's most vocal anti-DEI campaigners, said companies had belatedly realised they were going to “divide their customer base” by leaning too heavily into Pride events.

The political clash over Pride and DEI causes has created an untenable situation for companies, he told The Telegraph.

“You're going to elicit this yearly outrage where you're a ping pong ball in the culture war,” Mr Starbuck said.

“I think that when they talk to one side and they talk to the other side, what they find is we're the rational ones. I'm not demanding that they take on my politics – I'm asking for corporate neutrality. The other side is demanding total adherence to their ideology.

“The left is losing ground because they're behaving absurdly and they expect companies to be a proxy for their beliefs, whereas I expect companies just to stay out of divisive subjects.”

NATO leaders convening for a key summit this month will deliberately avoid discussing membership for Ukraine, AFP reported on Wednesday, citing sources. The bloc's members are reportedly wary of raising the issue due to fears it could exacerbate tensions between the EU and US.

Members of the US-led military bloc are highly likely to “steer clear of its previous strong statements that Ukraine is on course to join the alliance” when the summit takes place in The Hague in late June, the agency said.

One diplomatic source told AFP that the final declaration is expected to omit any mention of Ukrainian membership to maintain unity among member states. “There will be nothing on that,” a NATO diplomat said. “My expectation is we will be absolutely silent.”

US President Donald Trump has expressed firm opposition to Ukraine's bid to join NATO. In February, he suggested that Ukraine “can forget about NATO,” adding that Kiev's bid was “probably the reason the whole thing started,” referring to the conflict with Russia.

Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky is still expected to be present at the summit, but any formal talks between the bloc and Kiev are unlikely, AFP said. “It will be a PR disaster if he's not there,” another diplomat told the agency.

While NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has insisted that Ukraine remains a priority issue at the summit, AFP sources have painted a different picture. They suggested that the overwhelming emphasis will be on trying to satisfy Trump's demands that member states drastically ramp up their defense spending. It “is the most important part and no one wants to jeopardize that,” the agency's source said.

Russia has stated that NATO membership for Ukraine is a red line and one of the key reasons for the conflict, insisting that Ukraine adopt a neutral status as a key condition for a lasting peace.

While Trump administration officials have described NATO membership as “a bridge too far,” Kiev has refused to commit to neutrality or to refraining from hosting foreign troops on its soil, which Moscow also considers to be a red line.

Musk, who just left the Trump administration formally last week, calls for a new tax bill to be drafted and claims ‘America is in the fast line to debt slavery'

Trump's tax bill would add $2.4tn to US debt, says non-partisan analysis

Elon Musk, who only days ago left his role in Donald Trump's administration, continues his onslaught of attacks on the president's spending bill working its way through Congress, saying on social media that a new one should be drafted.

He wrote on his X platform:

A new spending bill should be drafted that doesn't massively grow the deficit and increase the debt ceiling by 5 TRILLION DOLLARS.

In a phrase he repeats in several posts from today, the billionaire said:

America is in the fast lane to debt slavery.

It comes only a day after Musk blasted the bill as a “disgusting abomination”. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,” he wrote on X yesterday.

He had previously said he was “disappointed” by the bill, which in adding $2.4tn to the budget deficit would “undermine” the work of his Doge federal cost-cutting team.

I'm at a Democratic conference in Washington where party divisions were exposed when pro-Palestinian protesters stormed the stage.

Congressman Ritchie Torres, a staunch supporter of Israel who has publicly rejected claims of genocide in Gaza, was being interviewed by journalist Josh Barro at WelcomeFest, billed as the biggest public gathering of centrist Democrats.

About a dozen demonstrators marched forward and gathered around Torres with signs that included “Fire Ritchie” and “Gays against Genocide”. The New York congressman indicated that he welcomed the protesters' right to free speech, responding: “Freedom is a beautiful thing. Thank God for freedom!”

Organisers of the event including Liam Kerr - wearing a football jersey customised with former senator Joe Manchin's name on the back - joined security staff in removing the protesters, who offered token resistance.

As they did so, Carly Simon's 1972 hit “You're So Vain“ boomed from loudspeakers with an accompanying video. Once the demonstrators were gone, some audience members rose to give a standing ovation.

Karine Jean-Pierre, who served as White House press secretary for Joe Biden, has left the Democratic party to become an independent, according to the publisher of her forthcoming book.

Jean-Pierre, who served two Democratic White Houses, is expected to detail the weeks that preceded Biden's monumental decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, per a preview of the book, which is set to be published this fall.

The book, titled Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines, promises a detailed recounting of “the three weeks that led to Biden's abandoning his bid for a second term and the betrayal by the Democratic party that led to his decision”.

Jean-Pierre did not arrive “lightly” at her decision to leave the Democratic party, according to the publisher. The book, billed as a “hard-hitting yet hopeful critique”, will make the case for “why Americans must step beyond party lines to embrace life as Independents”.

Jean-Pierre's announcement comes as the party has been forced to reckon with its decision to staunchly support Biden's decision to seek a second term as the oldest serving president in American history and despite voter concerns about his age and mental acuity. Tensions between Jean-Pierre and the White House press corps grew tense last year, as reporters pressed for more access and transparency around the president's health.

Conservatives on a state college board reversed a decision to hire the experienced academic Santa Ono to lead the University of Florida, despite his efforts to distance himself from previous support for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and past criticism of Donald Trump.

The 10-6 vote followed a contentious meeting of the Florida board of governors on Tuesday when members argued over Ono's record, including accusations he failed to protect Jewish students during pro-Palestinian protests last year while he was president of the University of Michigan.

The rejection came a week after UF trustees voted unanimously to appoint him as the 14th president of the state's third-largest university at a salary of $1.5m. It also followed what some critics saw as an attempt by Ono to “clean up” his record.

His name was quietly removed last month from a letter signed by more than 600 university presidents accusing the Trump administration of unprecedented interference in academic institutions. Ono wrote an opinion piece for Inside Higher Ed in May explaining why he no longer believed DEI on campus represented equal opportunities for students.

“Over time, I saw how DEI became something else – more about ideology, division and bureaucracy, not student success,” Ono wrote, taking credit for eliminating university DEI offices in Michigan.

“Combating antisemitism has [also] been a priority throughout my career. I've worked closely with Jewish students, faculty and community leaders to ensure that campuses are places of respect, safety and inclusion for all.”

At least one governor in Tuesday's board meeting in Tallahassee was skeptical of Ono's shifting views. And a number of conservative figures in Florida, where the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has led an assault on what he sees as “woke ideology” on campuses, were previously critical of Ono's nomination.

They pointed to, among other issues, Ono's previous support for DEI efforts, and a claim he was slow to respond to pro-Palestinian protests at the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus in April and May last year. The university has since taken a particularly harsh approach to cracking down on the protests.

Fox News has some more detail about the notice the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights sent to the accrediting body that audits Columbia University, notifying it that the Ivy League school is currently failing to meet its standards for accreditation. Accreditors determine which institutions are eligible for federal student loans and Pell grants.

Per Fox News's story:

The Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), which is a recognized accrediting body for degree-granting higher education institutions across the mid-Atlantic, ensures that its member schools – such as Columbia – meet established standards of academic quality, integrity, institutional effectiveness and more. MSCHE is one of several accrediting institutions across the country that the Department of Education deems reliable.

Only institutions accredited by Department of Education-recognized accreditors are eligible to participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs, such as Pell Grants and federal work-study or student loan programs.

Education secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement:

Accreditors have an enormous public responsibility as gatekeepers of federal student aid. They determine which institutions are eligible for federal student loans and Pell Grants. Just as the Department of Education has an obligation to uphold federal antidiscrimination law, university accreditors have an obligation to ensure member institutions abide by their standards.

We look forward to the Commission keeping the Department fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia's compliance with accreditation standards, including compliance with federal civil rights laws.

The notice marks the latest escalation in the Trump administration's bid to beat Columbia into line because of what it alleges is the college's failure to protect students from antisemitic harassment.

It follows the cancellation of $400m in federal grants and contracts, after which the university yielded to a series of changes demanded by the administration, including setting up a new disciplinary committee, initiating investigations into students critical of Israel's war in Gaza, and reassigning control of its Middle East Studies department.

Columbia has been the epicenter of a pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel student protest movement that roiled US campuses over the last year and a half.

The Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services said last month that an investigation found that the university had acted with “deliberate indifference” towards the harassment of Jewish students during campus protests.

The Department of Education said it has notified Columbia University's accreditor of a violation of federal anti-discrimination laws by the Ivy League school.

This violation, the department said, means that Columbia has failed to meet the standards of accreditation set by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

The university did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

I'll bring you more on this as we get it.

The Trump administration is considering a $1,000 fee for tourists and other non-immigrant visa applicants seeking an expedited interview appointment though government lawyers have raised legal red flags over the plan, according to an official and an internal state department memo.

Individuals entering the US on tourist and other non-immigrant visas already pay a $185 processing fee. The new $1,000 option the US is considering would be a premium service that allows some people to jump to the front of the line for visa interviews.

The program could arrive in pilot form as soon as December, the memo reviewed by Reuters said.

The proposed fee for visa appointments, which has not been previously reported, comes alongside Donald Trump's vision of a “gold card” that would sell US citizenship for $5m, granting faster access to those willing to pay.

But the state department's legal team said there was a “high risk” it would be rejected by the White House budget office or struck down in US courts, the memo said. Setting a fee above the cost to provide the service “is contrary to settled supreme court precedent”, the memo said.

A state department spokesperson said the department does not comment on internal documents and communications.

“The department's scheduling of non-immigrant visa interview appointments is dynamic and we are continually working to improve our operations worldwide,” the spokesperson said.

The state department has moved $250m to the Department of Homeland Security for voluntary deportations by migrants without legal status, a spokesperson said, in an unprecedented repurposing of funds that have been used to aid refugees uprooted by war and natural disasters.

The money has been transferred “to provide a free flight home and an exit bonus to encourage and assist illegal aliens to voluntarily depart the United States”, the state department spokesperson told Reuters.

Historically, those funds have been used “to provide protection to vulnerable people” overseas and to resettle refugees in the US, said Elizabeth Campbell, a former deputy assistant secretary of state.

The state department's planned reorganization explicitly states that the agency's refugee bureau now largely will focus on efforts to “return illegal aliens to their country of origin or legal status”.

The funds came from Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) overseen by the Bureau of Population, Refugee and Migration. Its website says its mission is to “reduce illegal immigration”, aid people “fleeing persecution, crisis or violence and seek durable solutions for forcibly displaced people”.

Deputy secretary of state Christopher Landau, citing the law authorizing the funding, said in a 7 May Federal Register notice that underwriting the repatriation of people without legal status will bolster the “foreign policy interests” of the US.

He did not mention the $250m transfer to DHS.

The DHS did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Trump's administration has encouraged migrants to leave “voluntarily” by threatening steep fines and deporting migrants to notorious prisons in Guantánamo Bay and El Salvador. On 9 May, Trump announced ‘Project Homecoming', an initiative overseen by DHS that offers $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to migrants who “self-deport”.

DHS said in a 19 May news release that 64 people had “opted to self deport” to Honduras and Colombia on a charter flight under the program.
 Some experts said that while legal, sending the money to DHS for deportation operations was an unprecedented use of MRA funds.

The main purpose of the funds historically has been “to provide refugee and displacement assistance, refugee processing and resettlement to the US, and respond to urgent and emerging humanitarian crises - not to return those very people to the harm or persecution they fled,” said Meredith Owen Edwards, senior director of Policy and Advocacy at the Refugee Council USA.

Donald Trump has said the nation's debt ceiling should be eliminated, saying he agreed with Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren's view on the subject.

“The Debt Limit should be entirely scrapped to prevent an Economic catastrophe. It is too devastating to be put in the hands of political people that may want to use it despite the horrendous effect it could have on our Country,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

The GOP is looking to raise the debt ceiling as part of the party's broader tax and spending cuts package to enact Trump's domestic agenda.

Warren on Friday backed Trump's call to abolish the nation's debt ceiling, pressing for bipartisan action to “get rid of it forever”. She posted on X that she and Trump agree that the debt limit, which caps how much money the Treasury can owe to pay the country's bills, should “be scrapped to prevent an economic catastrophe”.

However, she also added in a jab to the GOP's “big, beautiful bill” that “jacking up the debt limit by $4tn to fund more tax breaks for billionaires is an outrage”.

Here's Trump's full post, which was posted alongside a screenshot of that X post from Warren:

I am very pleased to announce that, after all of these years, I agree with Senator Elizabeth Warren on SOMETHING. The Debt Limit should be entirely scrapped to prevent an Economic catastrophe. It is too devastating to be put in the hands of political people that may want to use it despite the horrendous effect it could have on our Country and, indirectly, even the World. As to Senator Warren's second statement on the $4 Trillion Dollars, I like that also, but it would have to be done over a period of time, as short as possible. Let's get together, Republican and Democrat, and DO THIS!

Ukraine has released dramatic edited footage of its drone attack on four Russian military airbases in Operation Spiderweb, which was 18 months in the making, and involved the use of remotely operated drones from Ukrainian territory.

Russian planes and jets were targeted on runways across Russia and destroyed by the Ukrainian drones. Scenes of carnage were visible from the first-person view footage, with Russian planes engulfed in balls of fire.

The drone attacks carried out by Ukraine in Operation Spiderweb destroyed billions of dollars worth of Russian aircraft stationed at bases across the country, including at locations as far away as Siberia, in what Kyiv claims is its longest-range assault of the war.

The spectacular operation was prepared in secret over 18 months. Ukraine's agents moved short-range drones and explosives inside Russia before they were launched remotely for a coordinated strike on Sunday that was intended to strike at Moscow's air superiority.

Drones were smuggled into Russia and placed inside containers, which were later loaded on to trucks. With the trucks positioned near Russian bases, the roof panels of the containers were lifted off by a remotely activated mechanism, allowing the drones to fly out and begin their attack. The drones had first-person view, or FPV, technology that allowed them to be operated remotely, probably from Ukrainian territory.

Attempting to launch drones from Ukraine would have been much harder, as they would have had to cover huge distances and avoid Russia's air defences.

The White House confirmed yesterday that Donald Trump had no advance knowledge of the attack. He also hadn't commented on it publicly until this afternoon's call with Vladimir Putin.

Here's a visual guide to the operation from my colleagues:

Donald Trump has said that he has just discussed the recent drone attacks by Ukraine on Russia and developments concerning Iran in a phone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin that lasted over an hour.

During the conversation, Putin told Trump that Russia will have to respond to the Ukrainian drone attacks, the US president said. “It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace,” he said in a Truth Social Post.

Putin had said “very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields” - referring to ‘Operation Spiderweb', which saw Ukrainian agents move drones and explosives deep inside Russia to strike four airbases - Trump said.

He also said that Putin had suggested he may participate in talks with Iran to try to get a nuclear deal done. Trump said: “I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement.”

Here's the full post:

I just finished speaking, by telephone, with President Vladimir Putin, of Russia. The call lasted approximately one hour and 15 minutes. We discussed the attack on Russia's docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides. It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields. We also discussed Iran, and the fact that time is running out on Iran's decision pertaining to nuclear weapons, which must be made quickly! I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement. President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion. It is my opinion that Iran has been slowwalking their decision on this very important matter, and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!

Germany's new conservative leader, Friedrich Merz, is due in Washington tomorrow for his first official meeting with Donald Trump, putting political Berlin on tenterhooks like no other transatlantic encounter in living memory.

Discussions between the German chancellor and the US president will focus on Ukraine, the Middle East and trade policies. How well or badly the talks go – during a small group meeting, followed by a lunch and then, perhaps most nail-bitingly, a press conference in the Oval Office – may shape relations for decades to come, analysts say.

Having reportedly spoken by phone four times since Merz's election win in February, swapped numbers and exchanged an undisclosed number of text messages, the two leaders are now on first-name terms.

But Merz knows the road to a normal friendship is thorny. The transatlantic relationship has been altered almost beyond recognition since Trump's return to office, and the shock “sits very deep”, said Mariam Lau, a journalist and the author of a new in-depth portrayal of Merz. She went on:

It's the equivalent of a medical emergency in political terms: the speed and degree to which the Merz government has had to react to the disintegration of the transatlantic alliance, one of its main foreign policy pillars, is like being forced to undergo dialysis or an organ transplantation.

Berlin has viewed as menacing and dangerous the unprecedented interference in German politics by leading members of the Trump administration – by his former adviser Elon Musk; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and the vice-president, JD Vance, in particular. There is the lack of unity over how and even whether to punish Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine, there are tensions over defence spending levels, and there are diverging viewpoints over the Middle East, and over Trump's looming tariffs.

Indeed nobody in Berlin is resting on their laurels. As to just how quickly leaders' inaugural visits to the Oval Office can curdle, one only needs to recall Volodymyr Zelenskyy's lions' den encounter three months ago, or more recently the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa's. It has not gone unnoticed that Merz called the latter last Friday, reportedly to pick up a few Trump-whisperer tips.

Lau said Merz would have to “walk a tightrope between keeping an open dialogue with Trump and standing up to him, not giving into his whims”. And Merz is said to have been coached on an array of eventualities and is armed, rhetorically at least. Merz knows that keeping things brief, not interrupting, heaping praise and stressing the commonalities is the accepted playbook when dealing with Trump.

Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has told a Senate hearing that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is “fully staffed” with weather forecasters and scientists after concerns were raised about some offices losing 24-hour staffing ahead of hurricane season.

“We are fully staffed with forecasters and scientists. Under no circumstances am I going to let public safety or public forecasting be touched,” Lutnick told a Senate appropriations subcommittee overseeing NOAA, saying he got the National Weather Service (NWS) exempted from a federal hiring freeze.

NOAA, which includes the NWS, lost around 1,000 people or 10% of its workforce amid federal job layoffs in the first months of the second Trump administration, including 600 at the weather service. At least six NWS offices had stopped the routine twice-a-day weather balloon launches that collect data for weather models.

The US hurricane season officially began on Sunday and lasts through November. NOAA forecast last week that this year's season is expected to bring as many as 10 hurricanes.

The agency had been scrambling to reassign staffers internally to fill gaps in understaffed offices over the last few months, sources told Reuters.

Lutnick told the committee that they are going to fill these positions and focus on cutting programs that he said were not part of NOAA's mission, including “children's books about climate anxiety”.

An internal memo seen by Reuters said that NOAA plans to hire 126 mission-critical positions at the National Weather Service including forecasters, radar technicians, hydrologists and physical scientists that will be advertised externally.

US economic output will fall as a result of Donald Trump's new tariffs on foreign goods that were in place as of 13 May, while also reducing federal budget deficits by $2.8tn over a decade, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has said.

Reuters reports that in a letter to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and two other high-ranking Democrats, the CBO said the tariffs, which have been challenged in court cases, will raise the costs of consumer and capital goods.

“CBO estimates that, on net, real (inflation-adjusted) economic output in the United States will fall as a result,” the agency said.

“Inflation will increase by an annual average of 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026, in CBO's estimation, reducing the purchasing power of households and businesses,” the letter to Schumer and senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley stated.

Wyden is the senior Democrat on the Senate finance committee and Merkley is the ranking Democrat on the Senate budget committee. The three senators requested the CBO analysis on the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs implemented between 6 January and 13 May through executive actions.

The CBO's inflation estimates were compared to an economic outlook published by the CBO on 17 January.

The analysis was completed before two courts ruled that the tariffs exceeded the president's authority to impose them. The administration has asked an appeals court to pause one of the rulings.

Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, said he tried to call Elon Musk on Tuesday night after the tech billionaire's online outburst denouncing Donald Trump's tax and spending bill as a “disgusting abomination”.

Johnson told reporters on Wednesday:

I called Elon last night and he didn't answer. I hope to talk to him today.

He said he and Musk are “very friendly”, adding:

We've laughed about our differences on policy before. I'm not upset about this.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

In April, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a company that makes humanoid robots. There he floated an idea to fix the country's woeful men's soccer team. 

“Can we have robots join the team?” Xi was quoted as saying on the Web site of Zhiyuan Robotics. 

It might be too late. China will be out of FIFA World Cup qualifying if it fails to beat Indonesia today. Even a victory might only delay the departure.

What is the problem? China has 1.4 billion people, the globe's second-largest economy and won 40 Olympic gold medals last year in Paris to tie the US. Why can it not find 11 elite men's soccer players? 

The government touches every aspect of life in China. That top-down control has helped China become the largest manufacturer of everything from electronics to shoes to steel. 

It has tried to run soccer, but that rigid governance has not worked. 

“What soccer reflects is the social and political problems of China,” said Zhang Feng, a Chinese journalist and commentator. “It's not a free society. It doesn't have the team-level trust that allows players to pass the ball to each other without worrying.” 

Zhang said that politics has stalled soccer's growth. There is added pressure since Xi is a big fan and has promised to resuscitate the game at home. Soccer is a world language with its “own grammar,” and China does not speak it, Zhang said. 

“In China, the more emphasis the leader places on soccer, the more nervous the society gets, the more power the bureaucrats get, and the more corrupt they become,” Zhang added. 

After China defeated Thailand 2-1 in 2023, Xi joked with then-Thai prime minister Srettha Thavisin, saying: “I feel luck was a big part of it.” 

The consensus is clear. China has too few quality players, too much political interference from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and there is too much corruption in the local game. 

Wang Xiaolei, another prominent Chinese commentator, said that soccer clashes with China's top-down governance and the emphasis on rote learning. 

“What are we best at? Dogma,” Wang wrote in a blog last year. “But football cannot be dogmatic. What are we worst at? Inspiring ingenuity and cultivating passion.” 

The latest chapter in China's abysmal men's soccer history was a 7-0 loss last year to geopolitical rival Japan. 

“The fact that this defeat can happen and people aren't that surprised — despite the historical animosity — just illustrates the problems facing football in China,” said Cameron Wilson, a Scot who has worked in China for 20 years and written extensively about the game there. 

China has qualified for only one men's World Cup. That was 2002 when it went scoreless and lost all three matches. Soccer's governing body FIFA places China at No. 94 in its rankings — behind war-torn Syria and ahead of No. 95 Benin. 

For perspective: Iceland is the smallest country to reach the World Cup. Its latest population estimate is almost 400,000. 

The Web site Soccerway tracks global soccer and does not show a single Chinese player in a top European league. The national team's best player is forward Wu Lei, who played for three seasons in Spanish La Liga for RCD Espanyol. The club's majority owner is Chinese. 

The 2026 FIFA World Cup would have a field of 48 teams, a big increase on the 32 in 2022, yet China still might not make it. 

China will be eliminated from qualification if it loses to Indonesia. Even if it wins, China must also beat Bahrain on Tuesday next week to have any hope of advancing to Asia's next qualifying stage. 

Englishman Rowan Simons has spent almost 40 years in China and gained fame doing television commentary in Chinese on English Premier League matches. He also wrote the 2008 book Bamboo Goalposts. 

China is benefiting from reforms over the past decade that placed soccer in schools, but Simons said that soccer culture grows from volunteers, civil society and club organizations, none of which can flourish in China, as they are possible challengers to the rule of the CCP. 

“In China at the age of 12 or 13, when kids go to middle school, it's known as the cliff,” he said. “Parents may allow their kids to play sports when they're younger, but as soon as it comes to middle school the academic pressure is on — things like sport go by the wayside.” 

To be fair, the Chinese women's team have done better than the men. China finished runner-up in the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, but has faded as European teams have surged with built-in expertise from the men's game. Spain won the 2023 Women's World Cup. China was knocked out early, battered 6-1 by England in group play. 

China has been successful targeting Olympic sports, some of which are relatively obscure and rely on repetitive training more than creativity. Olympic team sports such as soccer offer only one medal. So, like many countries, China focuses on sports with multiple medals. In China's case they are diving, table tennis and weightlifting. 

“For young people, there's a single value — testing well,” Zhang said. “China would be okay if playing soccer were only about bouncing the ball 1,000 times.” 

Li Tie, the national team coach for about two years beginning in January 2020, was last year sentenced to 20 years in prison for bribery and match-fixing. Other top administrators have also been accused of corruption. 

The graft also extended to the Chinese Super League. Clubs spent millions — maybe billions — on foreign talents backed by many state-owned businesses and, before the collapse of the housing boom, real-estate developers. 

The poster child was Guangzhou Evergrande. The eight-time Super League champions, once coached by Italian Marcello Lippi, was expelled from the league and disbanded earlier this year, unable to pay off its debts. 

Zhang said businessmen invested in professional soccer teams as a “political tribute” and cited Hui Ka-yan. The embattled real-estate developer financed the Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club and used soccer to win favor from politicians. 

Property giant Evergrande has amassed debts reported at US$300 billion, reflective of China's battered property segment and the general health of the economy. 

“China's failure at the international level and corruption throughout the game, these are all factors that lead parents away from letting their kids get involved,” said Simons, who founded a youth soccer club called China Club Football FC. 

“Parents look at what's going on and question if they want their kids to be involved. It's sad and frustrating,” Simons said.

More than 1 million pilgrims yesterday joined Islam's most important rite under a beating sun, as the hajj started with the Saudi Arabian hosts scrambling to avoid last year's more than 1,000 deaths in sweltering heat.

With temperatures expected to top 40°C, robed pilgrims slowly circled the Kaaba — the black cube at the heart of Mecca's Grand Mosque which is Islam's holiest site.

State media reported that others had begun arriving in the sprawling tent city of Mina on Mecca's outskirts where they were to stay overnight before the hajj's high-point today — prayers on Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Mohammed is believed to have delivered his final sermon.

About 1.4 million pilgrims arrived in Saudi Arabia ahead of the hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam that must be performed at least once by all Muslims with the means.

Authorities have ratcheted up heat protection measures such as extra shade to avoid a repeat of last year, when 1,301 people died as temperatures hit 51.8°C.

Pilgrims yesterday were to perform the tawaf — walking seven times around the Kaaba, which Muslims pray toward each day.

Before entering Mecca, pilgrims must first enter a state of purity, called ihram, which requires special dress and behavior.

Men don a seamless shroud-like white garment that emphasizes unity among believers, regardless of their social status or nationality.

Women wear loose dresses, also white, exposing just their faces and hands.

Pilgrims arriving on buses had begun already trickling into Mina on Tuesday afternoon, greeted by staff offering them coffee and dates.

“I am so happy; it's such an amazing feeling,” said Reem al-Shogre, a 35-year-old Saudi Arabian performing the pilgrimage for the first time.

Following last year's lethal heat wave, authorities have mobilized more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials to improve protection.

Shaded areas have been enlarged by 50,000m2, thousands of additional medics would be on standby and more than 400 cooling units would be deployed, Saudi Arabian Minister of Hajj and Umrah Tawfiq al-Rabiah said last week.

Artificial intelligence technology would help process the deluge of data, including video from a new fleet of drones, to better manage the massive crowds.

Prime Minister Mark Carney says Canada will not immediately retaliate after U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50 per cent, citing ongoing negotiations over a new trade and security deal with Washington.

Speaking to reporters before a caucus meeting Wednesday, he described Mr. Trump's tariffs as “unjustified” and “illegal” but said Ottawa would hold off on responding.

“We will take some time, not much, some time, because we are in intensive discussions right now with the Americans on the trading relationship,” the Prime Minister said. “Those discussions are progressing.”

Mr. Trump initially imposed tariffs of 25 per cent on the metals in March, which he doubled as of Wednesday. The tariffs apply globally but they disproportionately hit Canada, which is the largest supplier of both metals to the U.S.

Roughly half of U.S. aluminum imports and nearly one-quarter of steel imports come from Canada.

From investing to real estate, here's how you can Trump-proof your wallet

The Canadian government imposed retaliatory tariffs in March but Mr. Carney lifted many of those in April out of fear of driving up prices for Canadian consumers. An estimate by Oxford Economics this week found that more than half of U.S. steel imported into Canada is currently exempt from tariffs.

The Prime Minister's hesitation on retaliation is a contrast with the approach of former prime minister Justin Trudeau, who immediately imposed tariffs on the U.S. both earlier this year and in 2018, during Mr. Trump's previous trade war with Canada.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Wednesday urged immediate retaliation by the federal government. He said he spoke with Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc, the point-man on the U.S.-Canada file, to make the case.

“He didn't give me a guarantee, but I'll be all over him. We can't sit back and let President Trump steamroll us,” Mr. Ford told reporters at Queen's Park. “We need to react immediately.”

The Premier said “everything is on the table” for Ontario's own retaliation but did not specify what he was considering. 

In March, Mr. Ford instituted a 25-per-cent surcharge on electricity the province sends to 1.5 million homes in three U.S. states. He cancelled the measure within a day after Mr. Trump threatened to double steel and aluminum tariffs in response.

Mr. Ford said it is his understanding that “we're close to making a deal” with the U.S., which is why he is not for now reinstating the electricity surcharge.

He also said the U.S. had broken an agreement he had with Mr. Lutnick after meeting with him in March that the Trump administration would not hike steel and aluminum tariffs if Ontario did not impose the electricity surcharge.

“We had an agreement before that he was going to take off the other 25 per cent and keep it at 25 per cent, and unfortunately, they broke a verbal agreement,” Mr. Ford said.

Mr. Ford, once an admirer of Mr. Trump who has become a vocal critic of the President's through regular appearances on U.S. cable news, said he plans to meet with Canadian steel companies to try to onshore $30-billion of steel that is currently imported from the U.S.

“It's unfortunate that President Trump and his team in the U.S. have thought this is a great idea. I think they can't see the forest beyond the trees. This is going to hurt the American people,” he said.

Mr. Carney is pushing for a deal between Canada and the U.S. covering both trade and national security, including the border and defence. 

The Prime Minister said on Wednesday that the tariffs are “bad for American workers, bad for American industry and, of course, for Canadian industry as well.”

Prime Minister Mark Carney says the U.S. decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum is not justified and will harm Americans as well as Canadians. He says Canada is in intensive discussions with the U.S. and will take some time, but not a long time, to decide how to respond to the latest tariff escalation.

The Canadian Press

At a White House meeting last month, Mr. Trump said there was nothing Mr. Carney could say that would make him change his mind on tariffs but the Prime Minister has remained insistent that such a deal would include the U.S. lifting its levies on Canada.

Mr. LeBlanc was in Washington on Tuesday to meet with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a bid to push the talks forward.

Mr. Lutnick said Wednesday that the administration's goal is not to get other countries to simply lower trade barriers but to ensure that those countries stop exporting certain products to the U.S., a position that would appear to complicate Mr. Carney's efforts to land a deal that includes removing U.S. tariffs.

At a committee hearing, Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, asked Mr. Lutnick if he would accept a deal from Vietnam in which that country would remove all tariffs and trade barriers in exchange for the U.S. doing the same.

“Absolutely not. That would be the silliest thing we could do,” Mr. Lutnick replied. “No, it's a terrible deal. We're the ones with money.”

“What's the purpose of reciprocity, then?” Mr. Kennedy fired back.

“There are certain products we want to reshore. We don't want other people making them,” Mr. Lutnick said.

Under further questioning from Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lutnick admitted that he did not know the name of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the legislation under which the U.S. has imposed steel, aluminum and auto tariffs. 

He also said he was not familiar with a principle called the “major questions doctrine,” which was central to a legal decision overturning a different series of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Mr. Lutnick is the member of the President's cabinet with top authority on trade policy.

Mr. Kennedy's grilling of Mr. Lutnick could indicate a fracture in Republican support for Mr. Trump's agenda. While the party traditionally supported free trade, it has largely fallen in line behind the President's protectionism since he returned to office.

Steel prices in the U.S. have already risen by 16 per cent since Mr. Trump took office in January, and his higher tariffs risk causing inflation for American consumers by making products built with steel more expensive.

In an interview with The Globe and Mail earlier this week, Catherine Cobden, president of the Canadian Steel Producers Association, also called on Mr. Carney to reinstate retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel imports and hike them to 50 per cent.

She said Mr. Carney's decision to roll back some of the tariffs was “ill-advised” and stopped manufacturers from moving toward using Canadian steel.

The German chancellor will be meeting President Trump in Washington with Ukraine and tariffs on the agenda. Meanwhile, a massive evacuation effort took place in Cologne as three WWII bombs are defused. DW has more.

Read about developments and news from Germany on Wednesday, June 4, 2025:

The World War II bombs found on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne have been safely defused, city officials have confirmed.

Streets and bridges in the area were gradually reopened, and evacuated residents were allowed to return to their homes in the evening.

The process of defusing World War II bombs in central Cologne has been delayed because of a resident refusing to evacuate, according to a city spokesperson.

An individual living in the old town resisted orders to leave their apartment, with public order officials, police, and the fire department enforcing removal measures.

The bomb squad cannot begin defusal until the area is fully cleared.

Large areas of the city center of Cologne were closed off on Wednesday as experts prepared to defuse three bombs left over from World War II, with some 20,000 people ordered to leave the affected area.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul says Chancellor Friedrich Merz will use his upcoming visit to Washington to tell US President Donald Trump that Europe stands firmly with Ukraine in opposing Russia's invasion  — and that no opportunity for peace should be missed.

""Europe expects us — the United States and Europe — to bring Russia to the negotiating table,"" Wadephul said during a news conference alongside his Polish counterpart.

""This opportunity for peace must not be missed. And this war must finally be brought to a just end.""

In response to Germany's decision to deny a Russian state media journalist a residency permit renewal, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova announced that Russia will take retaliatory measures against German journalists currently in the country.

Zakharova added that Moscow has repeatedly warned Berlin of retaliatory measures.

""In this case, we will quickly develop and implement retaliatory measures. Therefore, there is no need for Berlin to pretend that they were unaware of this,"" she concluded.

In November, Russia expelled two German reporters in a tit-for-tat move after Berlin informed two employees at Russian state broadcaster Channel One that they would have to leave Germany.

The German government is looking at a simpler process when it comes to declaring countries of origin as safe, under a push by the new conservative-led coalition to reduce the number of asylum seekers.

Chancellor Merz's Cabinet approved a draft policy in which a country can be declared safe with a simple statutory order and where the consent of the Bundesrat (Germany's upper house of parliament) is no longer needed.

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the move was part of a whole package of ""national measures (...) to implement the asylum turnaround.""

Under German asylum law, ""safe countries of origin"" are seen as those where people are not subject to political persecution or inhuman punishment. 

Migrants seeking asylum from these countries are likely to have asylum applications rejected, apart from exceptional cases. 

Deportations back to safe countries will also face fewer legal obstacles. Opposition lawmakers from the Green party have criticized the draft as contrary to German law, as have asylum and immigration NGOs.

The reform still needs to be approved by the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.

The announcement comes just days after a court declared the government's tightened border security, including the turning back of asylum seekers, to be illegal under German law.

German mechanical engineering firms reported a drop in orders in April. This decrease came amid concerns over US tariff policies.

According to trade group Association of German Mechanical and Plant Engineering (VDMA), orders declined by 6% year-on-year in April, though they were 1% higher in the first four months of 2025 than in the same period the previous year.

Domestic orders in April were 4% below last year's level, while foreign orders dropped 7%, exacerbated by a 13% decline in non-euro countries, the trade group said in a statement.

""In view of the many tariff threats and announcements by US President Donald Trump and the great uncertainty this has caused, this was an expected setback,"" said VDMA chief economist Johannes Gernandt.

""Global uncertainty remains high. This makes it all the more important that we set the right course ourselves in Germany and Europe,"" he added.

The Federal Association of Research and Information Centres on Anti-Semitism (RIAS) said there had been a 77% increase in antisemitic incidents across Germany last year.

In its latest report, RIAS said 8,627 such cases had been documented when compared to the 4886 incidents recorded in 2023.

The consequences of the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led terror attacks and the subsequent war were found to have had ""a decisive influence on the number of antisemitic incidents,"" RIAS said.

""With 5857 cases, Israel-related antisemitism was the most common manifestation of antisemitism in 2024,"" RIAS said in a summary of its findings.

The organization said it documented 8 incidents of extreme violence, 186 assaults, 443 cases of targeted property damage, 300 threats, 176 mass mailings and 7514 instances of abusive behaviour.

Among the eight cases of extreme violence highlighted was the attack in Solingen in which three people were killed and eight others injured. The so-called Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility and RIAS said in a video the group released, the attacker referred to the war between Israel and Hamas.

""Among other things, the attack was stated to be an act of revenge for the Palestinian people who had suffered massacres with the support of “Zionists,”"" RIAS said.

With 544 incidents, Rias 2024 also recorded the highest number of antisemitic incidents with a right-wing extremist background since the nationwide comparison began in 2020.

The German Police Union (GdP) in Berlin is pushing for a countrywide ban on private fireworks around New Year's, news agency DPA reported, citing the branch chairman.

""The public is ready to rethink how we celebrate New Year's,"" said Stephan Weh, who pointed to results from an online survey in April which showed high levels of support for more stringent restrictions on fireworks.

The poll conducted by Berlin GdP showed that 97% of around 178,000 respondents backed banning of firewords for private use, while 93% supported a ban on sales.

The issue was brought into sharp focus at the beginning of this year when 5 people were killed in firework-related incidents and many more were injured.

A video also went viral showing a man shoot a firework into an apartment in Berlin's Neukölln district, sparking anger and debate about the conduct of revelers during this time.

Emergency services are frequently attacked and injured in incidents where fireworks are fired deliberately towards them.

Instead of private fireworks, 91% of respondent supported organized public firework displays, with nearly half saying they would attend such events. 
 

The US has doubled steel and aluminium tariff as President Donald Trump ramps up his sweeping import measures since returning to office.

The tariffs — which came into force at 0401 GMT — doubled from 25% to 50% of the goods' value as Trump seeks to rectify alleged trade imbalances while strengthening US industry.

""We need to come up with negotiated solutions as quickly as possible, because time is running out,"" German economy minister Katherina Reiche said Tuesday on the sidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) talks. 

The EU has said it ""strongly regrets"" Trump's measures, cautioning that it ""undermines ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated solution"" with the US.

The German Steel Industry Association says the US is the most important sales market for the European steel industry.

Germany's aluminium industry warned on Wednesday that the tariffs would harm all parties and called for urgent and constructive dialogue with the Trump administration.

The tariffs come amid a climate of increased pressure and uncertainty in the sector.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will leave for Washington on Wednesday night for his first visit to the US as leader of Europe's largest economy.

Merz will be holding talks with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday.

Talks are expected to center around ending the war in Ukraine and the Trump administration's tariffs, among other issues.

The one-on-one discussion will be followed by an Oval Office press conference, which is highly anticipated considering the manner in which both Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa were dealt with during their respective visits.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul called for the preservation of well-established US-German relations on Wednesday. He visited Washington last week where he held talks with US State Secretary Marco Rubio.

""They have made me confident that we can reach agreements in mutual interest even on issues where we have differences of opinion,"" German news agency DPA quoted Wadephul as saying at a meeting of former Arthur F. Burns Fellowship scholars in Berlin.

The discovery of World War II-era bombs in Cologne on Monday has led authorities to evacuate an estimated 20,000 people from their homes.

City authorities say its one of the largest evacuations in postwar history and affected areas including the entire old part of the city, 58 hotels, three Rhine bridges, the town hall, the railway station in the district of Deutz, which lies across the Rhine from the city center, museums, a hospital and two care homes.

Bomb disposal is a common occurrence in Cologne, which was one of the most heavily bombed German cities during World War II.

US airstrikes on the Ras Isa oil port in Yemen last April killed 84 people and wounded more than 150 others.

The April bombing of a Yemeni oil port by U.S. forces that killed and wounded hundreds of civilians and disrupted the delivery of lifesaving aid to one of the world's most war-torn nations was “an apparent war crime” that should be investigated, a leading international human rights group said Wednesday.

On April 17, a series of U.S. airstrikes destroyed the Ras Isa oil Port on the Red Sea north of Hodeidah, killing 84 people and wounding more than 150 others, according to first responders, local officials, and a probe by the U.K.-based independent monitor Airwars.

The bombings were part of the Trump administration's response to resistance by Houthi rebels to Israel's annihilation of Gaza, which has included ballistic missile strikes targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping related to the key U.S. ally.

“U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years,” U.S. Central Command said at the time, adding that “this strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen.”

However, the first four U.S. strikes on the port happened while workers were still on the job. Officials said first responders including paramedics and rescue workers who rushed to the scene were killed in subsequent strikes, known as “double taps” in military parlance.

Human Rights Watch said Wednesday that of the strikes' victims, “49 were people who worked at the port, several were truck drivers, and two were civil defense personnel. Others may have been workers' family members. Three were identified as children.”

“The list contained one person identified as a ‘colonel,' but who was not necessarily a military member,” HRW continued. “The Hodeidah branch of the government-owned Yemen Oil Company posted photographs of 49 employees they said were killed.”

In new investigation, @hrw finds that the US attack on Ras Issa Port in #Yemen in April is an apparent war crime. The port is critical as an entry point for aid + commercial imports. According to @airwars, at least 84 civilians were killed, 150 injured.https://t.co/97CksDJPp3

HRW Yemen and Bahrain researcher Niku Jafarnia said Wednesday that “the U.S. government's decision to strike Ras Isa Port, a critical entry point for aid in Yemen, while hundreds of workers were present demonstrates a callous disregard for civilians' lives.”

“At a time when the majority of Yemenis don't have adequate access to food and water, the attack's impact on humanitarian aid could be enormous, particularly after Trump administration aid cutbacks,” Jafarnia added.

U.S. airstrikes on Yemen, which averaged around a dozen per month during the final year of the Biden administration, soared to more than 60 in March under President Donald Trump, according to the Yemen Data Project.

Other recent U.S. massacres in Yemen include a series of March 15 strikes on residential areas in the capital Sanaa that killed at least 53 people including numerous women and children, an April 20 strike on the Farwah market in the Shuub neighborhood of the capital Sanaa that killed at least 12 people and wounded 30 others, and the April 28 bombing of a detention center for African migrants in the city of Sa'ada that left at least 68 people dead and dozens more wounded.

These strikes came after President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth loosened the U.S. military's rules of engagement to allow the bombing of a wider range of targets and people. In March, Hegseth announced that the Pentagon's Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Office and Civilian Protection Center of Excellence, which was established during the Biden administration, would be closed.

Hegseth — who has supported pardons for convicted U.S. war criminals — lamented during his Senate confirmation hearing that “restrictive rules of engagement” have “made it more difficult to defeat our enemies,” who “should get bullets, not attorneys,” according to his 2024 book The War on Warriors.

The U.S has been bombing and conducting ground raids in Yemen since the beginning of the so-called War on Terror launched by the George W. Bush administration in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Airwars says hundreds of Yemeni civilians have been killed in 181 declared U.S. actions since 2002.

In 2015, then-President Barack Obama announced that U.S. forces would provide “logistical and intelligence support” to the Saudi-led coalition intervening in the ongoing Yemeni civil war on behalf of the national government as it battled Iran-backed Houthi rebels. That assistance included refueling Saudi and Emirati warplanes that were bombing Yemeni targets and killing thousands of civilians while a blockade fueled famine and illness that claimed hundred of thousands of lives.

“The U.S. has been implicated in laws-of-war violations in Yemen since it began ‘targeted killing operations' in 2002 against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,” HRW said Wednesday. “Those strikes continued until at least 2019 and killed many civilians, including 12 people attending a wedding in 2013. To Human Rights Watch's knowledge, the U.S. has never acknowledged or provided compensation for civilians harmed in this or other unlawful attacks.”

The Pentagon has only acknowledged 13 civilian deaths caused by U.S. military action in Yemen since 2002. The Trump administration has been especially tight-lipped about civilian casualties resulting from its operations, a stance some critics have called ironic given that top administration officials including Hegseth discussed highly sensitive plans for attacking Yemen on a Signal group chat in which a journalist was inadvertently included.

“The recent U.S. airstrikes in Yemen are just the latest causing civilian harm in the country over the past two decades,” Jafarnia said. “The Trump administration should reverse past U.S. practice and provide prompt compensation to those unlawfully harmed.”

“I don't know what a white flag is, shoot to kill,” the officer reportedly said at the time.

An Israeli officer who reportedly ordered soldiers to “shoot to kill” people in Gaza holding a white flag has been promoted to the rank of battalion commanding officer, meaning that he may be directing hundreds or thousands of soldiers.

Haaretz reports that, in 2024, the unnamed officer ordered soldiers to shoot two people spotted by a drone walking toward a corridor in Gaza who were carrying a white flag and raising their hands. A commander protested, pointing out the flag and that the people may be Israeli prisoners who escaped Hamas captivity. 

But soldiers said the officer, a deputy battalion commander at the time, insisted multiple times that they be killed. “I don't know what a white flag is, shoot to kill,” he reportedly said. The two people ultimately turned around and were spared, but the commander was “berated as a coward” by his commanding officers, Haaretz reported.

This account was uncovered by Haaretz in an investigation last December, and reccounted by a soldier who witnessed the incident in an op-ed around the same time. That soldier, Chaim Har-Zahav, was apparently summoned by Israeli police to give a statement about the incident after the op-ed was published. 

Officials are actively considering opening an investigation into the commanding officer over the incident — but, officials haven't made a decision on the investigation for months, and he was promoted.

Har-Zahav said that soldiers didn't carry out the order because it was illegal and against the military's ethical code. 

But the commanding officer's promotion suggests, instead, that these sorts of orders are not transgressions so much as actions embraced and actively rewarded by the Israeli military's high-ranking decisionmakers.

Indeed, Haaretz reports that the Israeli military said that the incident is “under an in-depth investigation,” but still offered unmitigated praise of the commander: “[T]he deputy battalion commander is an esteemed officer who has served lengthy tours of reserve duty during the war, for the sake of the country's security.”

Meanwhile, despite the insistence of some of Israel's defenders, a deluge of other reports have revealed that the Israeli military's abuses are systemic. 

Soldiers testify that illegal and immoral actions — like the abuse of prisoners, attacks on humanitarian aid, and targeting of civilians — come from the top down. The systemic nature of the military's atrocities are also clear from the actions of soldiers across Gaza, which has been nearly completely razed to the ground in the military's quest for the forced expulsion of all Palestinians from the besieged region.

Annual cuts to Medicaid would average $70 billion — roughly the same amount the wealthy will save in tax cuts.

In a letter sent to Senate leaders on June 3, a team of health experts at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania warn that funding cuts included in the budget reconciliation package narrowly passed by House Republicans last month would lead to 51,000 more people dying across the United States each year.

The package, labeled the “big beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump, includes deep cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance for lower-income and disabled people. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a total of 10.9 million people will lose health insurance by 2034 if the current bill becomes law and Congress allows cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act Marketplace to go through. An additional 5.1 million people would lose coverage because the bill fails to extend tax credits for ACA Marketplace plans, and Health and Human Services has proposed new rules limiting the program's enrollment periods and making other changes, bringing the total to 16 million.

The estimate of 51,000 preventable deaths is based on details from a previous analysis from CBO, which initially found that 13.7 million people would lose their health care coverage by 2034. Since CBO has now revised that estimate to be higher in response to queries from Democrats, the estimate of 51,000 deaths could, in fact, be an undercount.

The legislation would also repeal federal safe staffing standards that require nursing homes and long-term care facilities to maintain a minimum ratio of nurses to patients in order to provide proper care, which the researchers estimate would result in 13,000 additional deaths annually.

The Senate is taking up the “big, beautiful bill” after House Republicans passed the budget package on a razor thin, one-vote margin, despite protests from Democrats and a handful of moderate Republicans from swing districts. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) requested the analysis on mortality as ranking members on the Senate Budget Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, respectively.

“In other words, when you throw 13.7 million Americans off the health care they have … when you increase the cost of prescription drugs for low-income seniors, and when you make nursing homes throughout America less safe, not only will some of the most vulnerable people throughout our country suffer, but tens of thousands will die,” Sanders said in a statement on Tuesday.

The latest calculations from public health experts adds to a growing pile of research on the devastating potential impacts of budget cuts, which Trump and his fellow Republicans are pushing for to cover tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. If the current bill becomes law, annual cuts to Medicaid would average over $70 billion over the coming years — the same amount millionaires and billionaires would gain in tax cuts each year, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).

Even with those cuts to critical health care programs, the budget package is projected to increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. In an open letter to the Senate on Monday, EPI and six Nobel laureate economists said the nation's structural deficits are already too high, and the bill would put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates while reducing incomes for the bottom 40 percent of earners. Taken together, the economists wrote, “the House budget constitutes an extremely large upward redistribution of income” while adding to the national debt.

“These steep cuts to the social safety net are being undertaken to defray the staggering cost of the tax cuts included in the House bill, including the hidden cost of preserving the large corporate income tax cut passed in the 2017 tax law,” the economists wrote. “But even these sharp spending cuts will pay for far less than half of the tax cuts (not even including the cost of maintaining the corporate income tax cuts of the 2017 law).”

The budget reconciliation package makes cuts to health care funding in multiple ways, although the proposal to impose work requirements on adult Medicaid enrollees has received the most media attention. The researchers at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania focused on three policies impacting three distinct groups: individuals who will lose all Medicaid coverage, lower-income seniors who will lose subsidies that help pay for prescription drugs, and people who are expected to die in nursing homes if the safe staffing requirements are removed.

According to their data, the researchers estimated an additional 51,000 preventable deaths annually, including:

In addition, the bill does not extend 2021's enhanced premium tax credits for ACA Marketplace insurance plans. If lawmakers allow these tax credits to expire and the rule changes at the Department of Health and Human Services become effective, an estimated 5.1 million people will lose affordable health insurance, leading to an additional estimated 8,811 preventable deaths, bringing the total to at least 51,000.

“We know that when people are enrolled in Medicaid it saves lives compared to people not having health coverage, and we know the bill will increase churn and disenrollment in Medicaid,” said Rachel Werner, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics and co-author of the analysis, in an interview. “It's estimated that millions will lose coverage, and that will translate to loss of life.”

Polling consistently shows that cuts to Medicaid and the health care safety net are deeply unpopular, and many rural and lower-income districts in red states depend on Medicaid to keep hospitals and clinics running. Perhaps this explains why Trump has made a show of publicly urging House Republicans not to “touch” Medicaid. Now that Medicaid is indeed on the chopping block, Trump and his allies in Congress are turning to lies and misinformation.

In a statement on Monday, the White House said the idea that “people will literally die” due to Medicaid cuts is a “hoax” and a “disgusting lie” told by Democrats. The bill would penalize states that used their own funds to expand Medicaid to cover some immigrants who would not qualify for federal funding; the White House claimed Medicaid would be “strengthened” by removing 1.4 million undocumented immigrants from the rolls. That coverage loss would also extend to documented children and pregnant women under the proposed policy, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a top health policy think tank.

Trump and his allies in Congress are also defending controversial Medicaid work requirements included in the House bill, which would require adult recipients to prove that they are working at least 80 hours per month to maintain their health coverage. People with disabilities would also likely be required to prove they qualify for exceptions, and all enrollees would face more paperwork and barriers to coverage. The policy would reduce federal spending by $280 billion over 10 years by kicking people off Medicaid rolls.

The White House said on Monday that “4.8 million able-bodied adults on Medicaid are choosing not to work,” a claim also made by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who recently told NBC's Meet the Press that the 4.8 million people are “refusing” to work and will not lose coverage “if they choose too.”

However, as the Washington Post points out, 4.8 million is the number of people estimated to become uninsured due to work requirements, not the number of young men “sitting around and playing video games” instead of getting a job, as Johnson has previously suggested. KFF analysis shows 92 percent of adults on Medicaid are either working or likely qualify for exceptions to work requirements, as most Medicaid enrollees who do not work are caregivers, parents, students, or have a disability.

Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018, which led to 18,000 adults losing health coverage over the four months before a court stepped in to halt further implementation. A study by Harvard University researchers found the work requirements were effective at cutting Medicaid rolls during that time period but had no effect on employment. Research on other states has found that few programs linked to Medicaid work requirements actually help enrollees find jobs.

Some Republicans have outright lied about the reconciliation bill, suggesting they are not pursuing Medicaid cuts when they are. Others are resorting to callous mockery. When constituents confronted Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa at a recent town hall with questions about people dying without health coverage, she shrugged and told them: “Well, we all are going to die.” 

After a video of the exchange went viral, Ernst doubled down with a bizarre video in what appears to be a graveyard, suggesting that those who are afraid of preventable deaths under the Medicaid cuts are like children who believe in the tooth fairy and should embrace “my lord and savior, Jesus Christ.”

“Sen. Ernst's flippant comments over the weekend reveal a grim reality: Republicans in Congress know that their tax bill will rip away lifesaving health care from their constituents, jeopardizing lives just to pad billionaires' pockets … and they just don't care,” said Kobie Christian, a spokesperson for the economic justice campaign Unrig Our Economy, in a statement.

The “big, beautiful bill” will likely undergo changes in the Senate, where conservative fiscal hawks are anxious about increasing the federal deficit, and defenders of public health refuse to blow holes in a safety net that provides coverage for millions of people in order to pay for tax cuts.

“In the wealthiest country in the world, we should be guaranteeing health care to all as a human right, not taking health care away from millions of seniors and working families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires,” Sanders said.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

            • Happening now: Bryana Bongolan, a longtime friend of Cassie Ventura, has given more details this afternoon about an incident with Sean “Diddy” Combs in 2016 when she said that she was “held over a 17-story balcony” by the music mogul.
    


            • Previous testimony: The jury this morning also heard from forensic video expert Frank Piazza, who said the March 2016 video from the InterContinental Hotel that captured Combs assaulting Ventura was not manually altered. Yesterday, Eddy Garcia, a former security officer at the hotel, testified about how Combs allegedly tried to cover up the video, saying he accepted $100,000 from Combs in exchange for the footage.
    


            • Federal charges: Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


            • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.



            Defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland suggested that during Bryana Bongolan's first meeting with prosecutors, she did not mention that Sean “Diddy” Combs told her, “I could kill you.” Bongolan said she didn't remember when she told the government about that incident.
    


            Westmoreland also suggested that Bongolan later told prosecutors the incident happened at a party, not at a photoshoot. Bongolan said she did not remember if she said that.
    


            The defense attorney said the first demand letter from Bongolan's attorney alleged that Combs said he could kill her while she was hanging over the balcony. Bongolan testified that those were not her words and that the two incidents did not happen at the same time. She said she fired her attorney after that.
    


            Westmoreland suggested that Bongolan did not mention certain details about the balcony incident during her first meeting with prosecutors, such as Combs banging on the door and her telling her ex-girlfriend to hide in the bathroom. Bongolan said she did not remember.
    


            Westmoreland suggested that Bongolan told the government Combs groped her on the balcony. Bongolan said she told prosecutors where his hands grabbed her when he picked her up.
    


            The defense attorney also suggested that Bongolan's second demand letter claimed Combs grabbed her breasts so hard she had bruises. Bongolan said she does not remember what the letter said.
    


            Bryana Bongolan's testimony has been “shocking and damning” and shows Sean “Diddy” Combs' alleged abuse also extended to those he was not romantically involved with, Alyse Adamson, a former federal prosecutor, said.
    


            “Bryana Bongolan was not in a relationship with Sean ‘Diddy' Combs, and if you recall the defense has really tried to frame their alternative narrative of what was happening with Cassie –– between Cassie and Combs –– as toxic domestic violence,” Adamson explained. “But here we have another witness who was not romantically linked to Combs being violently abused,” she said, referring to Bongolan's testimony that Combs held her over “17-story balcony” in 2016.
    


            Adamson said Bongolan's testimony goes directly to the racketeering and conspiracy charge prosecutors are trying to prove “because it demonstrates that Combs was operating in a way that, through threats, violence and abuse, that goes to the corrupt enterprise aspect of the RICO.”
    


            Defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland questioned Bryana Bongolan's allegation that she saw Sean “Diddy” Combs throw a knife at Cassie Ventura, suggesting she doesn't actually remember that incident.
    


            Bongolan told prosecutors in an interview that Ventura and Combs would get in knife fights sometimes, according to interview notes referenced by Westmoreland.
    


            Bongolan said she doesn't remember saying that and stands by the memory she testified to today. She said she doesn't know how or where Combs got a knife to throw at Ventura.
    


Remember: This morning, Bongolan said that on one occasion when she was staying at Ventura's apartment, they were awoken by Combs and that once inside, “He threw the knife in Cassie's direction.” Bongolan testified that she didn't call the police following the incident because she “was just scared of Puff.”
    


            Bryana Bongolan confirmed that she spoke to Cassie Ventura before and after Ventura filed her lawsuit in November 2023.
    


            Ventura asked Bongolan to name her in connection with the balcony incident in her lawsuit, but Bongolan said she refused.
    


            Bongolan also testified that she did not tell any of her friends about her own lawsuit.
    


            Bongolan confirmed she had conversations with Ventura about the balcony incident both before and after Ventura filed her lawsuit, including discussions about the location and who was present.
    


            She said Ventura described the incident as happening at a hotel with a different person present.
    


            Bryana Bongolan confirmed that she first met Sean “Diddy” Combs sometime around 2016 at a dinner at his house.
    


            She testified that she went to the dinner as Cassie Ventura's friend. She confirmed that Combs was very standoffish with her that day.
    


            Bongolan testified that she's still friends with Ventura and celebrity stylist Deonte Nash, who testified last week. 



            She said she's spoken with both of them since the trial began, but confirmed that they have not discussed their testimony.
    


            Bongolan also testified that she hired a lawyer to sue Combs. She also acknowledged that lawyers she's hired have acted on her behalf.
    


            Defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland asked Bryana Bongolan how she felt when she used drugs like marijuana, cocaine, ketamine, G, and acid.
    


            Bongolan said they “partied” a lot together and she regularly sold drugs to Cassie Ventura.
    


                    “You would agree with me that you and Cassie had a serious drug problem,” Westmoreland asked.“Yeah, we had a problem,” Bongolan said.
                





            On one occasion Bongolan said she got Ventura so many pills it scared her.
    


            Bongolan acknowledged that she and Ventura were doing drugs together before Bongolan met Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            Bryana Bongolan said she and Cassie Ventura partied together and used a lot of drugs together.
    


            Bongolan recounted the first time she spent the night at Ventura's home, confirming that Ventura asked if she liked to get high. Bongolan said she replied yes, and they got high together.
    


            She confirmed that, after that, she and Ventura spent most of their time together getting high.
    


            Bryana Bongolan said she's seeking $10 million in her lawsuit against Sean “Diddy” Combs but said she's not expecting any money to come from her testimony at this trial.
    


            Bongolan said she filed the lawsuit against Combs “because I wanted to seek justice for what happened to me.”
    


            Bongolan's direct testimony is over.
    


            Defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland is now cross-examining Bongolan.
    


            Bryana Bongolan testified that a music producer named Rob Holladay reached out to her in early 2024. She said Holladay had been one of her best friends for a long time, and he was also friends with Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            She said Holladay called her on FaceTime, and he appeared to be in Combs' backyard in Beverly Hills. Bongolan testified that Holladay told her he was calling on behalf of Combs and he was authorized to talk about “settling with me.”
    


            Bongolan confirmed that about a month or two after she spoke with Holladay, her current attorney helped her file a lawsuit against Combs.
    


            She said she is no longer friends with Holladay.
    


            Bryana Bongolan testified that she spoke to Cassie Ventura after Ventura filed her lawsuit against Sean “Diddy” Combs in 2023.
    


            She told Ventura that there were a few details wrong about the balcony incident described in Ventura's lawsuit, such as it not happening in a hotel and Ventura having the date wrong.
    


            When asked if she experiences lasting effects from the incident with Combs, Bongolan whispered, “Yes.”
    


            Bongolan testified she experiences “nightmares, a lot of paranoia, and I used to scream a lot in my sleep, but it's dissipated a little bit.”
    


            She said she didn't experience those things before the incident.
    


            Bongolan hired a lawyer, Tyrone Blackburn, in January 2024. Blackburn made a monetary demand to Combs regarding the balcony incident.
    


            Bongolan testified that she fired Blackburn when she realized he had included incorrect information in the monetary demand paperwork.
    


            Bryana Bongolan said the last time she hung out with Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura was around New Year's in 2018.
    


            Bongolan testified that she went to the penthouse suite at the One Hotel in Miami with Combs and Ventura for New Year's, where they did ketamine for eight hours. After that, she left and decided she could no longer use drugs.
    


            She tattooed the date on her neck as a “commitment to get sober and not go back.”
    


            Bongolan said she wasn't able to get sober right away, but she's sober now. After leaving the hotel in Miami that day, Bongolan said her relationship with Ventura became “sporadic.”
    


            Bryana Bongolan testified she told her managers about the incident, and one advised her to at least see a chiropractor if she was too scared to do anything else.
    


            Bongolan said she saw a chiropractor that day but did not disclose who caused her injuries when asked.
    


            The jury was also shown a photo of Bongolan's neck and back that appeared reddened and covered with bandages.
    


            The image shown was actually a photo of an iPhone displaying the original picture. Bongolan said her ex-girlfriend took the photo and she couldn't AirDrop it.
    


            Bongolan testified that she didn't seek further medical treatment at the time because the drugs in her system numbed the pain.
    


            Bryana Bongolan said Sean “Diddy” Combs or one of his security guards Facetimed her a day or two after the incident on the balcony.
    


                    “I remember saying a couple times, I don't want any problems with you,” she testified. She said Combs didn't say much, but he kept putting his hands over his head and breathing, and alternating looking away from the camera and then looking back.
                





            Bongolan said she didn't report the incident on the balcony to police because she was scared.
    


            She said she and Combs saw each other after the incident and “tried to be cool.”
    


            Assistant US Attorney Madison Smyser directed Bryana Bongolan back to the incident on the balcony of Cassie Ventura's Los Angeles apartment.
    


            Bongolan testified she was asleep with her ex-girlfriend on a couch in Ventura's apartment when she heard Sean Combs banging on the door in September 2016. Ventura was in her bedroom at the time, Bongolan said.
    


            Bongolan took her ex-girlfriend to hide in the guest bathroom and then went to the balcony herself to appear “casual.”
    


            Bongolan said she hid the other woman at the time testifying, “I didn't want to expose her to things that I see.”
    


            She had a marijuana cigarette on the balcony facing away from the door when Combs came out to the balcony.
    


                    “I either lit the blunt or was about to light it,” Bongolan said. “He basically came up behind me.“He lifted me up and then had me on top of the rail.”
                





            Bongolan testified Combs grabbed her chest and then held her by her armpits over the railing.Her feet were dangling above the railing, she said. Bongolan is about 5 feet tall.
    


            Combs repeatedly yelled, “Do you know what the f**k you did?” according to Bongolan.
    


            Bongolan said she still doesn't know what Combs was talking about at the time. She recalled responding something like, “I don't know what the f**k I did.”
    


            After about 15 seconds dangling over the balcony railing, Combs threw her on the balcony furniture.
    


            She said she had a lot of adrenaline and didn't realize she was hurt right away.
    


            Bongolan said as she was falling, she heard Ventura's voice. Bongolan said Ventura asked something like “Did you just hang her over the balcony?” and it sounded like she was in disbelief.
    


            Ventura and Combs then began talking, and Bongolan heard something about her girlfriend being in the house. Combs left shortly after, she said.
    


            After Combs left, Bongolan went back to her apartment. “I was shaking a lot,” she said.
    


            She said she had a big bruise with a piercing in the middle of it on her leg, and she suffered neck and back pain. The jury saw a picture of the bruise.
    


            Assistant US Attorney Madison Smyser has resumed her questioning of Bryana Bongolan, a longtime friend of Cassie Ventura.
    


            Prosecutor Maurene Comey said she thinks it's unlikely that “Jane” will testify today.
    


            She said they intend to call Enrique Santos after Bongolan's testimony ends, but said his testimony should be brief.
    


            Jane is one of Sean “Diddy” Combs' accusers who is using a pseudonym during his trial.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian is back on the bench after the lunch break.
    


            Bryana Bongolan, a longtime friend of Cassie Ventura, is expected to resume her testimony soon.
    


            Subramanian just sent the jurors, who had entered the courtroom, back to the jury room so they can resolve a technical issue.
    


This post was updated with details on the jurors returning to jury room.



            We're on week four of the trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, and so far the jury has heard from 26 witnesses — including Cassie Ventura, the prosecution's star witness who testified for multiple days about the abuse she said she endured during her relationship with Combs.
    


Here's a look at who else has taken the stand so far:



            Frank Piazza, a forensic audio and video editor, was the first witness to take the stand this morning in Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal criminal trial. Piazza is an expert witness who testified that he is being paid $295 per hour for his work on this case and that he has no knowledge of the case but reviewed cell phone video, surveillance footage and “sex videos.”
    


            Bryana Bongolan was called to the stand next and testified about a physical altercation she alleged happened at the hands of Combs. Her testimony is expected to continue after the lunch break.
    


Here's what happened this morning:



            The trial is in recess for lunch. Defense attorneys and prosecutors will return at 1 p.m. ET.

Spanish may be the most spoken language at home behind English, except in three U.S. states, but the second most-popular, non-English languages used in each state show off the diversity of the United States in unexpected places, whether it's Korean in Alabama or Vietnamese in Kansas.

Almost 22% of U.S. residents age 5 and older spoke a language other than English at home, double the share from four decades ago, according to figures released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau, and it varied by state. In California, 44% of residents spoke a language other than English at home, while it was 2.5% in West Virginia.

The United States is a multilingual nation due to immigration, despite recent crackdowns by the Trump administration, said William Frey, a demographer at The Brookings Institution.

“This is a big part of who we've been over a long period of time,” Frey said.

President Donald Trump earlier this year issued an executive order designating English as the official language in the U.S.

Spanish was spoken at home by 13.2% of speakers, and it was the top non-English language spoken at home in every state but Hawaii, Maine and Vermont. In Maine and Vermont, home to French Canadian communities, French was the most popular non-English language, and in Hawaii, it was Iloko, a language spoken by the Ilocano people of the Philippines.

Here's a look at where languages are spoken in the United States.




Outside of English and Spanish, Arabic was the most spoken language at home in Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia. The Detroit, Michigan, area has more Arabic speakers than any other metro area.

About 1 out of 7 Alaskans who speak a language other than English at home did so in Central Yup'ik, making the native language the second most common non-English language behind Spanish in Alaska.

Chinese was the second-most common non-English language spoken at home in Delaware, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington. If all Chinese dialects are combined, it would be the third most spoken language in California behind English and Spanish.

Although it was the dominant non-English language in Maine and Vermont, French was the second most-common non-English language in Louisiana, Maryland, New Hampshire and North Carolina.

German was the most spoken language behind English and Spanish in eight states — Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, North Dakota, South Carolina and Wyoming. In total, more than 871,000 people over age 5 spoke German at home in 2021, compared to 1.6 million in 1980.

Florida had almost a half million Haitian speakers, making it the most common language behind English and Spanish. The Sunshine State has the nation's largest Haitian population.

In Minnesota and Wisconsin, Hmong was the second-most spoken non-English language at home. Many Hmong people settled in the Upper Midwest states after fleeing Southeast Asia in the mid-1970s following the Vietnam War.

Korean was the most spoken language in Alabama and Virginia behind English and Spanish.

In South Dakota, the Lakota dialect of the Sioux people was the most common language spoken behind English and Spanish.

The language of the Marshall Islands was the second-most spoken non-English language in Arkansas, where the community is concentrated in the northwest part of the state.

Arizona and New Mexico had the most Navajo speakers in the United States. The Navajo Nation extends into Arizona and New Mexico, where the indigenous language was the second-most popular non-English speech in those two states.

Despite a nationwide decline in speakers, Polish was Illinois' second-most common non-English language behind Spanish, primarily due to the Chicago area having one of the nation's largest Polish communities.

Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island have some of the largest concentrations of Portuguese speakers in the U.S., making it the most spoken language in these states behind English and Spanish. It also is the second-most common non-English language in Utah, which is home to missionaries who served in Brazil and explains its popularity, according to the University of Utah.

The Filipino language was prevalent in California, Hawaii and Nevada, where it was the second-most popular non-English tongue.

In Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon and Texas, Vietnamese was the most popular language behind English and Spanish, reflecting that people who speak different languages are no longer concentrated in big cities that serve as entry points for immigrants.

“People of different backgrounds are dispersed to different parts of the country,” Frey said.

Former federal prosecutor Jonathan Fahey discusses the upcoming trial for Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, President Donald Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants and more on ‘Fox News Live.'

A federal judge granted a request Wednesday from more than a dozen major news outlets and publishers to unseal certain records in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Salvadorian migrant and alleged MS-13 member who was deported from Maryland to El Salvador in March in what administration officials have acknowledged was an administrative error.

Separately on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted a request from Abrego Garcia's legal team to file a motion for sanctions against the Trump administration. That filing is due June 11, she said in an order. 

The one-two punch from Xinis could give plaintiffs new ammo to pursue more formal punishments against the Trump administration if officials are found to have been acting in bad faith or knowingly defying court orders. 

It will also give new access to media outlets covering the case. Xinis agreed to grant in part a request from a group of 14 major media outlets and publishers – including Fox News, NBC News, CBS News, New York Times, the Washington Post and NPR – who filed a motion to unseal records in the Abrego Garcia case, citing concerns over the lack of public access, as well as over government efforts, or lack thereof, to facilitate his return to the U.S.

In her order, Xinis agreed with the contention of the news outlets – referred to jointly as the ""Press Movants"" – that the public ""enjoys a presumptive right to access court records, overcome only when outweighed by competing interests.""

As such, Xinis ordered the Trump administration to unseal a handful of documents that have so far been filed under seal, as part of a protracted legal battle over the status of Abrego Garcia.

Xinis also ordered them to unseal a transcript from an April 30 hearing in his case. 

""The right to public access of court records remains critical to promoting ‘trustworthiness of the judicial process, to curb judicial abuses, and to provide the public with a more complete understanding of the judicial system, including a better perception of fairness,'"" she said Wednesday.

The order comes amid a months-long court fight over the status of Abrego Garcia, who remains in El Salvador. 

Xinis in April ordered the Trump administration to comply with an expedited discovery schedule to determine whether they were complying with the directive to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., which was upheld by the Supreme Court earlier this year.

Since then, she has struggled to ascertain the status of Abrego Garcia, or efforts made to return him to the U.S.

Trump officials, for their part, have repeatedly alleged that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, though any formal ties remain unproven. 

Lawyers for the government and Abrego Garcia's attorneys have sparred with Xinis in court over what exactly it means to ""facilitate"" his return – a months-long fight that Xinis most recently described as beating a ""frustrated and dead horse.""

Xinis previously took aim at what she deemed to be the lack of information submitted to the court as part of an expedited discovery process she ordered last month, describing the government submissions as ""vague, evasive and incomplete"" responses, and which she said demonstrated ""willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.""

The order is the latest development in the ongoing feud between Trump officials and the courts over the use of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime immigration law used earlier this year to quickly deport migrants from the U.S.

To date, the Trump administration has not knowingly complied with any court orders to return migrants who were removed and sent to El Salvador in the early wave of deportation flights, despite earlier court orders from Xinis, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and others.

It is unclear whether Xinis plans to begin contempt proceedings against the administration, though the federal judge in D.C. said earlier this year that he had found probable cause to do so.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram highlights divisions in the Republican Party over President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' on 'Special Report.' 

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said Elon Musk should fund primary challenges against almost every Republican who voted for President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" last week.

""I don't primary my colleagues, but I feel pretty good about him doing it,"" Massie told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

""There's a few others that should be spared,"" when asked to clarify if he meant all 215 House Republicans who supported the legislation. ""But people want term limits, right? Elon can bring term limits.""

Musk came out against the massive Trump agenda bill that House Republicans passed last week.

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,"" Musk first posted.

It was followed by several posts on the national debt, and one that read, ""In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.""

Massie said on Wednesday, ""I just think he made one mistake when misstatement – he said take them out in November. I would take them out in primaries if I were Elon Musk.""

Both House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the White House have closed ranks around the legislation.

Johnson issued a rare forceful response to Musk from the podium of his weekly press conference on Wednesday, calling the billionaire ""flat wrong.""

""Elon and I left on a great note. We were texting one another, you know, happy texts, you know, Monday and then, and then yesterday, you know, 24 hours later, he does a 180, and he comes out and opposed the bill,"" Johnson told reporters.

""And it surprised me, frankly. And, I don't take it personal…I think he's way off on this, and I've told him as much, and, I've said it publicly and privately.""

The massive budget reconciliation bill is aimed at advancing Trump's priorities on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the debt limit. 

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected it would add $2.4 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years, but House GOP leaders have dismissed that modeling as inaccurate representations of economic growth.

Massie was one of three House Republicans to vote against the bill. Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, also voted ""no,"" while House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., voted ""present.""

Massie is also no stranger to clashing with both Trump and Johnson. He has faced primary threats from the former and led an unsuccessful bid to remove the latter from House leadership.

Massie has been consistent, however, in his opposition to legislation that would have any chance of adding to the federal debt – now currently nearly $37 trillion.

Republican supporters of the bill, however, have contended that it is the best possible vehicle to radically reform government programs plagued with waste, fraud and abuse, and restore much-needed funding to the border, while extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts.

However, the legislation is now in the Senate, where Republicans have already signaled they would want to see changes to the final bill.

Fox News Digital reached out to the National Republican Congressional Committee for comment on Massie's remarks.

Fox News' David Spunt reports the latest on the case. Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley also weighs in during 'The Faulkner Focus,' and discusses the latest on backlash over a Wisconsin judge's arrest.

A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) claiming President Donald Trump's executive orders had threatened the independence of the Federal Election Committee (FEC), a significant — albeit rare — court victory for the president.

In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, a Biden appointee, said the DNC failed to demonstrate ""concrete and imminent injury"" — or the burden needed to justify their request for a preliminary injunction. He said that the concerns raised by the party about the FEC's independence as a result of Trump's executive order were far too speculative to satisfy the court's higher bar for emergency relief. 

At issue in the case was the executive order Trump signed on Feb. 18, titled, ""Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies.""

Democrats filed the lawsuit just 10 days after the order was signed, arguing that the order threatened to encroach on the independence of the FEC and risked subjecting it to the whims of the executive branch.

The lawsuit focused largely on the claim that the FEC is an independent regulatory agency and argued that the credibility of the entire regulatory enterprise would be ""fatally undermined if the party controlling the White House can unilaterally structure campaign rules and adjudicate disputes to disadvantage its electoral competitors.""

Notably, Ali said Tuesday that he had not found any evidence to date that the White House or the Trump administration had taken steps to change or undermine how the FEC interprets federal election law, or target its independent role.

The ""possibility that the president and attorney general would take the extraordinary step of issuing a directive to the FEC or its Commissioners purporting to bind their interpretation of FECA is not sufficiently concrete and imminent to create Article III injury,"" Ali said Tuesday.

Should that change, however, Ali said the DNC was welcome to submit an amended filing to the court to reconsider the case.

""This Court's doors are open to the parties if changed circumstances show concrete action or impact on the FEC's or its Commissioners' independence,"" Ali said.

Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., breaks down the national security threat posed by China on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

Chinese President Xi Jinping is ""very tough"" and ""extremely hard to make a deal with,"" President Donald Trump admitted Wednesday.

Trump made the statement on his Truth Social platform, clarifying that he still ""likes"" the Chinese leader. The statement comes as Trump is expected to hold a phone call with Xi sometime this week to discuss tariff negotiations.

""I like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!"" Trump wrote.

White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett revealed plans for Trump to speak with Xi on Sunday.

""President Trump, we expect, is going to have a wonderful conversation about the trade negotiations this week with President Xi. That's our expectation,"" Hassett said Sunday during an interview on ABC News' ""This Week.""

Trump's plans for a call come after he leveled tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods following the president's reciprocal tariff plans in April, when China retaliated against the U.S. with tariffs of their own.

""I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!"" Trump wrote.

""The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!"" he added.

A Democratic senator lobbied the Biden administration to remove her husband from a Transportation Security Administration surveillance program after flying with a suspected terrorist, according to the Trump administration.

The Department of Homeland Security revealed Wednesday morning that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) contacted TSA about her husband, William “Billy” Shaheen, being subjected to enhanced screening and lobbied former TSA Administrator David Pekoske to give him a blank exemption from its Silent Partner and Quiet Skies program.

Jeanna Shaheen first contacted the TSA in July 2023 after her husband was flagged for the enhanced screening during two flights, where he was flagged for the first time for traveling with a suspected or known terrorist. The exemption, which Shaheen's husband was given in October 2023, was given two days after the Democratic senator contacted the TSA for a second time after Billy Shaheen was flagged for traveling with a known or suspected terrorist. 

“It is clear that this program was used as a political rolodex of the Biden Administration — weaponized against its political foes and to benefit their well-heeled friends,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. “This program should have been about the equal application of security, instead it was corrupted to be about political targeting. The Trump Administration will restore the integrity, privacy, and equal application of the law for all Americans, including aviation screening.”

Other individuals who were followed by U.S. Marshals and monitored by the federal government while flying included foreign royal families, political elites, professional athletes, journalists, and the Trump administration's Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard — all without knowing they were on a surveillance list rolled out by the Biden administration.

Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Rand Paul (R-KY) exposed in May that the TSA had tracked Gabbard during the 2024 election for unspecified reasons that Republicans have said boiled down to politics.

In the Shaheens' case, Mr. Shaheen was flagged by TSA on July 20, 2023, for traveling with a known or suspected terrorist, whose name was not included in the DHS announcement.

Not long after that flight, the senator's office contacted the TSA about her husband receiving enhanced screening on two flights.

Mr. Shaheen was flagged a second time as a co-traveler of a suspected terrorist on Oct. 18, 2023. The DHS stated that the senator contacted TSA again and met with Pekoske.

Later that month, Mr. Shaheen was placed on the TSA's Secure Flight Exclusion List, which ensures certain passengers are not surveilled. He remained on the list for 18 months, until April of this year.

The DHS did not disclose the nature of Mr. Shaheen's travel or why he was traveling with someone listed on the FBI's terrorist watch list.

An upcoming book by former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reveals that she is no longer a member of the Democratic Party and is urging others to “think outside of our boxes.”

Jean-Pierre's book, Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines, details how the former spokeswoman for the Biden administration “didn't come to her decision to be an Independent lightly.” In an Instagram video, Jean-Pierre said people have asked her since leaving the White House, “What do we do next?” and she claimed that this new book is her answer.

“And what I mean by that is in an era of misinformation, disinformation, the regressiveness of social policy, what we're seeing currently right now, what I have decided to do, and I really have thought long and hard about this, is to follow my own compass,” Jean-Pierre said. “And that's what I've done, and that's what this book does. And here's the truth, and here's how I will lay it out to you: I think we need to stop thinking in boxes, and think outside of our boxes, and not be so partisan.”

The former press secretary then stressed the need for unity, saying, “I will be there with you” under the condition that others respect the community “that I belong to” and other “vulnerable” communities she cares about, without elaborating exactly who that encompasses. As such, she argued her book is about looking beyond “partisan” stances in politics and how people can “move forward together.”

The online listing for Jean-Pierre's book lists the release date as Oct. 21. The book's description does not mention anything about former President Joe Biden's health but does detail “the three weeks that led to Biden's abandoning” his reelection bid and “the betrayal by the Democratic Party” that he faced.

JAKE TAPPER AND ALEX THOMPSON'S ‘ORIGINAL SIN' CLAIMS TO TELL THE STORY OF THE COVER-UP OF BIDEN'S DECLINE. IS IT JUST ANOTHER CHAPTER?

Prior to Biden dropping his 2024 reelection bid, Jean-Pierre pushed back against unflattering videos of the president, which featured former President Barack Obama and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni appearing to help Biden during public events. The former White House press secretary deemed the videos “cheapfakes,” a play on the word “deepfake,” and claimed “the right-wing critics of the president have a credibility problem.”

Independent is the latest book regarding the troubled Biden administration. It follows the New York Times bestseller, Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again. Tapper's involvement in the book has been strongly criticized, as late-night host Jon Stewart called it “f***ing weird” how the CNN anchor was selling a book containing news that could have been told to the public “a year ago, for free.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Edmund White, who died yesterday at 85, infused his life with as much pleasure as he did his writing.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

Edmund White had the most beautiful blush. I recall watching him at a celebration of his work while one of his most sexually explicit essays (which is saying a lot) was read aloud—my mind had to perform its own gymnastics just to picture all the right organs in the right receptacles. Ed's blush somehow managed to overlap his cheeks and spread across his chin, his forehead, his ears, and into his greatest receptacle of all: his kindly, contemplative soul.

No one blushed like Ed. And when you saw him blush, you saw a midwestern child still agog at the wide world and the fact that it would accept him. The path between his homeland of Cincinnati and the salons of New York and Europe seemed smoother than it had been, just like the ease and unaffected nature of Ed's prose hid the great artistry behind it. You could find Ed dining with Italian baronessas or at some unspectacular joint in Key West or within the wonderfully messy and book-strewn confines of his own apartment, and there would always be the same blush across his face.

He giggled a lot. This may seem like an unimportant fact when talking about one of America's greatest writers, but Ed's giggle came from the same place as his blush. He giggled as if you were tickling him, like a naughty child perpetually discovering his naughtiness. Maybe that was the secret to Ed. The co-author of The Joy of Gay Sex was never jaded; he never let go of pleasure, even as age and illness conspired to take it away. He recently published one of his best books, The Loves of My Life, which, yes, is another Ed White memoir but is also a brilliant argument for the importance of sex and love, in all their conjoined variations, to the human animal and, by extension, to the artistic work we animals produce. In the age when the messy mechanics of sex have been asked to depart the page for the world of fetishized porn, Ed demanded that literature retain the ecstasy and desperation and glorious ridiculousness of two (or sometimes many more) bodies thumping against each other. He loved sex the way some of his younger contemporaries love recognition or a well-cooked egg at brunch.

Read: The writer who understood the true nature of obsession

And the joy of love and sex and the joys of talking and writing were all intertwined in Ed's mind and work. I appreciate gossip myself, but Ed turned gossip into an art form. To hear him gossip was music. He was breathless, engaged, in love with the tale he was telling. And because of the mastery with which he was able to process the endless social parade in front of him, his gossip was a form of prepublishing. People, myself included, told Ed everything, both because we loved him and ached to see him giggle and because we wanted him to be a naughty interpreter of our lives.

It is customary in an appreciation of this sort to mention when one met the recently departed, but I honestly can't remember. I would guess it was 23 years ago, because as soon as you published your first book, there was Ed in all his blushing, giggling glory. And often next to Ed, holding a single malt, there would be an unsmiling writer of great pretension looking down at you from a great height. I knew immediately which kind of writer I wanted to be.

I remember one drunken night walking through the inner rooms of his apartment as an outrageous party unfolded in the main quarters, taking photos (with an early phone that was barely up to the task) of his bedroom and bathroom, all of it unremarkable and slathered in normalcy, and thinking, This is what a great writer's home should look like. The lessons of his life and work are there on every page of his books, a portable M.F.A. for the taking. Keep your eyes open; record everything; fall in love constantly; radiate kindness whenever you can, even when you have to dig deep through the morass of history, biography, and bigotry to find it. Many of my best writer friends have died in their 50s; Ed lived a full life by every measure, and still his passing is a unique form of loss. No one out there has even a tenth of his blush.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Even if most Americans haven't abandoned their private sense of empathy, many don't seem terribly bothered by the rancidness of their leaders.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

Every month or so I get a desperate message from a 25-year-old Afghan refugee in Pakistan. Another came just last week. I've written about Saman in the past. Because my intent today is to write about her place in the moral universe of Elon Musk and Vice President J. D. Vance, I'll compress her story to its basic details: During the Afghan War, Saman and her husband, Farhad (they requested pseudonyms for their own safety), served in the Afghan special forces alongside American troops. When Kabul fell in 2021, they were left behind and had to go into hiding from the Taliban before fleeing to Pakistan. There the couple and their two small children have languished for three years, burning through their limited cash, avoiding the Pakistani police and Taliban agents, seldom leaving their rented rooms—doomed if they're forced to return to Afghanistan—and all the while waiting for their applications to be processed by the United States' refugee program.

No other country will provide a harbor to these loyal allies of America, who risked everything for the war effort. Our country has a unique obligation to do so. They had reached the last stage of a very long road and were on the verge of receiving U.S. visas when Donald Trump came back into office and made ending the refugee program one of his first orders of business. Now Saman and her family have no prospect of escaping the trap they're in.

“The stress and anxiety have become overwhelming,” Saman wrote to me last week. “Every day I worry about the future of my children—what will become of them? Recently, I've developed a new health issue as well. At times, my fingers suddenly become tight and stiff—almost paralyzed—and I can't move them at all. My husband massages them with great effort until they gradually return to normal. This is a frightening and painful experience … Please, in this difficult time, I humbly ask for your help and guidance. What can I do to find a way out of these hardships?”

I've brought the plight of Saman and her family to members of Congress, American activist groups, foreign diplomats, and readers of this magazine. No one can offer any hope. The family's fate is in the hands of Trump and his administration.

George Packer: ‘What about six years of friendship and fighting together?' 

And, after all, their story is just one small part of the suffering caused by this regime. A full accounting would be impossible to compile, but it already includes an estimated several hundred thousand people dead or dying of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria because of the elimination of the U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as the starvation of refugee children in Sudan, migrants deported to a Salvadoran Gulag, and victims of domestic violence who have lost their shelter in Maine. In the wide world of the regime's staggering and gratuitous cruelty, the pain in Saman's fingers might seem too trivial to mention.

But hers is the suffering that keeps arriving in my phone, the ongoing story that seems to be my unavoidable job to hear and tell. And sometimes one small drama can illuminate a large evil. Since reading Saman's latest text, I can't stop thinking about the people who are doing this to her and her family—especially about Musk and Vance. As for Trump, I find it difficult to hold him morally responsible for anything. He's a creature of appetite and instinct who hunts and feeds in a dark sub-ethical realm. You don't hold a shark morally responsible for mauling a swimmer. You just try to keep the shark at bay—which the American people failed to do. Musk and Vance function at a higher evolutionary level than Trump. They have ideas to justify the human suffering they cause. They even have moral ideas.

Musk's moral idea goes by the name longtermism, which he has called “a close match to my philosophy.” This reductio ad absurdum of utilitarianism seeks to do the greatest good for the greatest number of human beings who will ever live. By this reasoning, the fate of the hundreds of billions of as-yet-unborn people who will inhabit the planet before the sun burns it up several billion years from now is more urgent than whether a few million people die of preventable diseases this year. If killing the American aid programs that helped keep those people alive allows the U.S. government to become lean and efficient enough to fund Musk's grand project of interplanetary travel, thereby enabling human beings to live on Mars when Earth becomes uninhabitable in some distant era, then the good of humanity requires feeding those aid programs, including ones that support refugee resettlement, into the woodchipper.

Refugees—except for white South Africans—aren't important enough to matter to longtermism. Its view of humanity is far too large to notice Saman, Farhad, and their children, or to understand why America might have a moral obligation to give this family a safe home. Longtermism is a philosophy with a special appeal for smart and extremely rich sociopaths. It can justify almost any amount of hubris, spending, and suffering. Sam Bankman-Fried, the cryptocurrency mogul who is serving a 25-year sentence for fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering, was a longtermist.

It isn't clear that Musk, during his manic and possibly drug-addled months of power in the Trump administration, applied moral reasoning when hacking at the federal government. His erratic behavior and that of his troops in the Department of Government Efficiency seemed driven more by destructive euphoria than by philosophy. But in February, on Joe Rogan's show, Musk used the loftiest terms to explain why the cries of pain caused by his cuts should be ignored: “We've got civilizational suicidal empathy going on. And it's like, I believe in empathy. Like, I think you should care about other people, but you need to have empathy for civilization as a whole and not commit to a civilizational suicide. The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy.”

Here is another category of the long view, with an entire civilization in place of the planet's future inhabitants. Musk's sphere of empathy is galactic. In its cold immensity, the ordinary human impulse to want to relieve the pain of a living person with a name and a face disappears.

Vance once called himself “a proud member of both tribes” of the MAGA coalition—techno-futurists like Musk and right-wing populists like Steve Bannon. But when Vance invokes a moral code, it's the opposite of Musk's. The scope of its commitment is as narrow and specific as an Appalachian graveyard—the cemetery in eastern Kentucky where five generations of Vances are buried and where, he told the Republican National Convention last summer, he hopes that he, his wife, and their children will eventually lie. Such a place is “the source of America's greatness,” Vance said, because “people will not fight for abstractions, but they will fight for their home.” Politically, this is called blood-and-soil nationalism. Religiously, Vance traces his moral code to the Catholic doctrine of ordo amoris, the proper order of love: first your family, he told Sean Hannity of Fox News, then your neighbor, your community, your nation, and finally—a distant last—the rest of humanity.

But Vance's theology is as bad as his political theory. Generations of Americans fought and died for the idea of freedom in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II, and other conflicts. And Christian doctrine does not say to keep out refugees because they're not your kin. Jesus said the opposite: To refuse the stranger was to refuse him. Vance likes to cite Augustine and Aquinas, but the latter was clear about what ordo amoris does not mean: “In certain cases, one ought, for instance, to succor a stranger, in extreme necessity, rather than one's own father, if he is not in such urgent need.”

From the March 2022 issue: The betrayal

It's a monstrous perversion of both patriotism and faith to justify hurting a young family who, after all they've suffered, still show courage and loyalty to Vance's country.

Starting from opposite moral positions, Musk and Vance are equally indifferent to the ordeal of Saman and her family. When empathy is stretched to the cosmic vanishing point or else compressed to the width of a grave, it ceases to be empathy. Perhaps these two elites even take pleasure in the squeals of bleeding-heart humanitarians on behalf of refugees, starving children, international students, poor Americans in ill health, and other unfortunates. And that may be a core value of these philosophies: They require so much inventing of perverse principles to reach a cruel end that the pain of others begins to seem like the first priority rather than the inadvertent result.

Think of the range of people who have been drawn to MAGA. It's hard to see what political ideology Elon Musk, J. D. Vance, Glenn Greenwald, Glenn Loury, Nick Fuentes, Bari Weiss, Lil Wayne, Joe Rogan, Bill Ackman, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and Kanye West have in common. The magnetic pull is essentially negative. They all fear and loathe something more than Trump—whether it's wokeness, Palestinians, Jews, Harvard, trans people, The New York Times, or the Democratic Party—and manage to overlook everything else, including the fate of American democracy, and Saman and her family. But overlooking everything else is nihilism.

Even if most Americans haven't abandoned their private sense of empathy, many don't seem terribly bothered by the rancidness of their leaders. I confess that this indifference astonishes me. It might be the ugliest effect of Trump's return—the rapid normalization of spectacular corruption, the desensitization to lawless power, the acceptance of moral collapse. Eventually it will coarsen us all.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

What do you actually owe your partner's family?

by  Allie Volpe

Anna can't exactly pinpoint when her relationship with her sister-in-law started to sour. Rather, it was a slow unraveling. 

When the two met over 20 years ago through their now-husbands, who are brothers, Anna actually preferred spending time with her future sister-in-law. “We would hang out all the time,” says Anna, who is being referred to by her middle name so she can speak freely about her family. “I would get through being with him just to hang out with her.”

Anna and her sister-in-law also had a common enemy: their husbands' parents. At family gatherings, they'd steal away with a glass of wine and whisper, “Can you believe they said that?” The women could compare notes about their mother-in-law's latest insult or how their father-in-law constantly belittled his wife.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Unlike Anna, 47, who largely kept her concerns to herself, her sister-in-law was vocal about her dislike for their in-laws. This rubbed Anna's husband the wrong way and ultimately drove a wedge between the two families. 

Now, they live an hour away and only see each other a handful of times a year. And when they do, it's awkward, Anna says. Her kids are no longer close with their cousins. Whenever Anna's sister-in-law invites her family on trips to amusement parks, they decline but end up going anyway — without them — and then lying about why they couldn't coordinate plans. 

“I just hate the dishonesty,” Anna says. “The worst part for me is pretending everything is fine when clearly everybody in the room knows it's not fine.”

The relationship one has with their in-laws can be fraught and perplexing, friendly and intimate, polite and distant.

The relationship one has with their in-laws can be fraught and perplexing, friendly and intimate, polite and distant. They're not the people you've chosen to bind yourself to, but you're still inextricably linked as long as you're with your partner. In-laws enjoy all the trappings and status of family, but aren't quite. Spending time with them can feel obligatory and not totally enjoyable. At the same time, there are no clearly defined expectations for what in-law relationships should look like, beyond the stereotypes. 

So what do you owe your partner's families of origin? They may not be your family, but they're probably going to be in your life in some form or fashion. They might never be a proxy for your own mother or sibling, but that doesn't mean they can't come close. 

As long as people have married, they have inherited their spouse's family. For centuries, parents aimed to pair their children based on the reputation, power, and wealth of a neighboring family, to create alliances through marriage. In many cultures worldwide, newlyweds typically moved in or near the husband's family. “The aim of marriage was to acquire useful in-laws or gain political or economic advantage,” writes Stephanie Coontz in the 2005 book Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage. By the 1920s, Coontz writes, “marital privacy was more important than adults' ties with their parents” and, as a result, the number of couples who lived with their parents dropped precipitously over the first half of the 20th century. 

As couples established themselves as independent entities, in-laws — especially mothers-in-law — came to be seen as prying interlopers, as evidenced in the 1954 book In Laws, Pro & Con. “Many a mother-in-law sounds baffled, bewildered, and bitter in her role,” wrote the book's author Evelyn Millis Duvall. “She reports that anything she does is misconstrued by her sons- and daughters-in-law. If she leaves them alone, she is being neglectful; if she is nice to them, she is being twofaced; if she appears interested in what they are doing, she is meddling; if she keeps out of their affairs, she is not interested in them — she just can't win!” 

Since then, the cultural view of in-laws in America has stayed remarkably consistent, says Sylvia Mikucki-Enyart, an associate professor of communication studies at the University of Iowa. The caricature of the overbearing mother-in-law still has strong cultural sway — TV and movie representations abound. In real life, there are entire Reddit communities dedicated to meddlesome “MILs.” Now, try to think of a single well-known father-in-law joke.

“In-law relationships are this weird between place of being family but not being the same intensity of family as family origin.”

Beyond these broad stereotypes, cultural and familial expectations and traditions influence the in-law relationship. For instance, daughters-in-law in Asian American families reported feeling anxious, angry, and confused as a result of their in-laws' traditional cultural expectations to be subservient and deferential, according to one study. Other research found that among Black families, sons-in-law sharing interests with their fathers-in-law and making an effort to engage in family activities helped strengthen their bond.

The way you interact with your in-laws is largely shaped by your partner's example. After all, if it weren't for them, you probably wouldn't have any connection to these people at all. Marrying someone who has a history of regularly spending time with their family of origin is a strong indication that you'll likely see more of these people in the future. “I would take my guide from my wife,” says Geoffrey Greif, a distinguished university professor at the University of Maryland School of Social Work and co-author of In-Law Relationships: Mothers, Daughters, Fathers, and Sons. “How close does she want me to be with her father and mother?”

These expectations shouldn't come as a surprise — they're almost certain to come up while a couple is dating. As the relationship progresses and you gain insight into your partner's familial ties, you may learn how much they value weekly hangouts with their siblings or big gatherings for holidays. A close-knit family dynamic can, for some, be a green flag.

Early on in his relationship with his now-wife Melli, Steven Schenberg, a 37-year-old in transportation logistics in Chicago, realized they'd not only be marrying each other but also each other's families. 

Within the first few months of dating, Schenberg grabbed dinner with one of Melli's sisters, attended the family's annual New Year's Day brunch, and slept on the floor of the hotel room Melli shared with her sisters at a wedding. Melli's brother is now one of Schenberg's best friends — a friendship that likely wouldn't have happened had they not met through Melli. Schenberg credits the closeness he maintains with his wife's family as part luck, part shared values. “I was raised in a tight family nucleus,” he says. “Melli was the same way.”

Just because in-laws occupy a place of prominence in your partner's life doesn't necessarily guarantee them a similarly intimate space in yours. After all, you lack a deep shared history. There's always a degree to which you'll always play catch-up. “In-law relationships are this weird between place of being family but not being the same intensity of family as family origin,” says Gretchen Perry, an associate professor of social work at the University of Northern British Columbia. “When you have conflict, often, there's less tolerance for the intensity of that conflict [than] with your own family of origin.”

And these relationships can be primed for conflict: too involved in-laws, absent in-laws, pushy in-laws, cheap in-laws, too-invested-in-their-traditions in-laws. Because there are fewer cultural norms offering a clear example of normative in-law relationships in Western societies, Mikucki-Enyart says, uncertainty abounds. “Versus other cultures where when you get married, you go live with your husband's family and you're deferential to your mother-in-law,” she says. “There are other cultures where it's very clearly outlined how these in-law relationships go, and in the US, we really don't have that.”

In her research, Mikucki-Enyart has observed two types of uncertainty arise within in-law relationships: relational uncertainty (What kind of relationship do I want with this person? How often do we interact?) and family level uncertainty (How do we balance time with each family? How will grandparents interact with children?) The latter is usually more impactful, Mikucki-Enyart says, especially when grandchildren enter the picture. If a parent-in-law is uncertain about how best to help their adult child and their spouse care for their own kids, they may sacrifice closeness with their grandkids. 

“There are other cultures where it's very clearly outlined how these in-law relationships go, and in the US, we really don't have that.”

Mother-in-law relationships are typically the ones that are more fraught, at least in heterosexual relationships. This is because mothers have more points of contact within families. Women are still socialized and are expected to carry the bulk of child rearing and kin keeping, Mikucki-Enyart says, and a scarcity mindset pits mothers against their child's partner. “There's not enough for all of us,” she says. “We have to fight for a position and a spot, which leads to…it's either her or me. Not ‘no, we can both love him and have individual relationships with this linchpin person.'” The recent “boy mom” phenomenon only further ties a mother's identity to her male children — the trope suggests that relinquishing her son to a romantic partner means a woman losing a part of herself, too. 

Fathers-in-law, meanwhile, are seen as protectors. “Men aren't involved in these relational roles, or their protectiveness is fulfilling their role,” Mikucki-Enyart says. 

The more you buy into the cliches, the more they become self-fulfilling prophecies. “Parents, especially mothers-in-law, are really in this damned if they do, damned if they don't position,” Mikucki-Enyart says. “They're very aware of the negative stereotype surrounding them. So sometimes then they'll go to the extreme and really, give the couple space. ... Then children are like, ‘Well, my mother-in-law doesn't even reach out, she doesn't even care,' and when she does, it's too much.”

Whether an in-law falls under the umbrella of kin depends on how you define family. Those with a more narrow view of family — spouse and children — may be less inclined to bend over backwards to appease their mother-in-law. Still, in most cases, it's worth maintaining at least a cordial relationship with your in-laws for the benefit of your spouse or children. 

That's assuming you're treated with the same respect.

Rina, a 31-year-old who works in hotel customer service in Toronto, used to consider her husband's sister someone reliable, someone worth confiding in. But over time, Rina's sister-in-law cut off contact with her, despite maintaining daily calls with her brother. At family gatherings, Rina's sister-in-law would ignore her and never told her kids to call her Aunt Rina. Recently, Rina's sister-in-law introduced her new baby to everyone in the family — except Rina. She was heartbroken. 

Rina, whose last name is being withheld so she can speak freely about her family, told her husband that his sister's actions made her feel like an outcast. “He sees the problem,” Rina says in an email, “and really wanted to help out.” He offered to talk to his sister, but Rina stopped him. It would only cause more drama.

Knowing your in-laws, flaws and all, helps blunt the pain of any slights. In her research examining relationships between mothers- and daughters-in-law of East Asian descent, psychologist Angela Gwak found that though they were stressed by their mothers-in-law, daughters-in-law learned to cope with them over time. “They've learned to accept them, but not like [their] family of origin,” Gwak says, “but just learn to coexist together. The stress is less jarring because they know and can predict how they would respond to certain circumstances or situations.”

Proof (and perhaps solace) that you may not be able to completely live without your in-laws, but you can learn to live with them.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was disappointed to hear Elon Musk's critique of President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill.""

""Let me say this. It's very disappointing. I have come to consider Elon a good friend. He's obviously a very intelligent person, and he's done a lot of great work,"" Johnson told reporters on Tuesday.

""But with all due respect, my friend Elon is terribly wrong about the one big beautiful bill,"" Johnson added.

Johnson said he had a ""friendly conversation"" with Musk on Monday, where he pitched the bill's merits to the Tesla and SpaceX CEO.

""He and I spoke for, I think, more than 20 minutes on the telephone, and I extolled all the virtues of the bill and he seemed to understand that,"" Johnson said on Tuesday.

Johnson was speaking at a doorstop interview when he was asked about Musk's X post on Tuesday afternoon. In his post, Musk called Trump's signature tax bill a ""massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill"" and a ""disgusting abomination.""

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore,"" Musk wrote.

""Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,"" he added.

On May 22, House Republicans passed Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" and sent it to the Senate. GOP lawmakers hope the bill will be sent to Trump's desk on July 4.

Trump's bill, in its current form, will raise the US deficit by $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years, per the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

This isn't the first time Musk has criticized Trump's signature tax bill. Musk told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" in an interview that aired on June 1 that he was disappointed with the bill.

""I was like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,"" Musk said.

""I think a bill can be big, or it could be beautiful. I don't know if it could be both,"" he added.

Musk's pointed criticism of the GOP comes just days after he announced his departure from the Trump administration. Musk said on May 28 that he was wrapping up his 130-day tenure as a special government employee leading the White House DOGE office.

In his interview with CBS, Musk said he did have ""differences of opinion"" with the Trump administration but did not specify what they were.

""But it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention,"" Musk told CBS.

""So then, I'm a little stuck in a bind, where I'm like, well, I don't wanna, you know, speak up against the administration. But I also don't wanna take responsibility for everything the administration's doing,"" he added.

Musk did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

President Donald Trump's tariffs have overall been bad news for Wall Street dealmaking, but one corner of the market is benefiting from the uncertainty: secondary investing.

The buying and selling of secondhand shares of private funds, known broadly as secondary investing, soared to a record $160 billion last year — a growth trajectory that's expected to continue as large institutions like Harvard and Yale turn to this corner of the market to raise cash.

Verdun Perry, the head of Blackstone's $87 billion secondary investing business, predicts that the market will grow to $220 billion this year, a nearly 40% jump from last year. The first quarter, usually the slowest for the secondaries market, saw roughly $45 billion in secondaries transactions, Perry said.After more than three years of ""relatively slow"" distributions from private equity funds, many investors are ""motivated to sell,"" Perry said.

Perry said he expected the industry to continue growing regardless of the macro environment given the ballooning size of the private markets in recent decades. Indeed, one-off secondary deals of $1 billion to $2 billion are now relatively commonplace compared to twenty-five years ago, when the market was lucky to clear that much in an entire year.

In light of the sector's expansion, Business Insider has compiled a list of the top industry professionals in the private secondaries market. BI used recommendations of industry insiders and an accounting of total assets under management at the pros' respective firms.

The investors who made the cut work for a range of firms, from megafunds like Blackstone and Ares to secondaries specialists like Ardian. They invest across a wide array of strategies, including private equity, real estate, and infrastructure. Their portfolios often include both LP-led deals — where institutional investors sell stakes in private equity funds — and GP-led transactions, in which financial sponsors offer liquidity to existing investors without offloading the underlying assets. These structures have become more common as overall deal flow remains subdued across the industry.

They have spent decades watching the industry transform from a niche to a must-have strategy. Many of them didn't even know what secondary investing was when they were first recruited but are now leading this growing business at some of the largest and most powerful investment firms.

Check out Business Insider's first list of secondaries power players, highlighting 15 top professionals in this budding industry, presented in alphabetical order by firm name.

Akers got his start as an investment banker at a regional bank, researching the private markets long before every private equity buyer was just a Google search away. His early experience evaluating private equity managers helped lead Akers to join Adams Street nearly 20 years ago as a secondaries investor.

He has now led the firm's secondary investing team for nearly nine years, helping grow its assets under management to $8.5 billion.

Akers said he was drawn to Adams Street because of its impressive fund of funds offering, which boasts over a thousand active investments in private equity funds.

Access to data and relationships is critical, and the firm fosters close collaboration between its primary and secondary teams through dedicated ""GP pods.""

""For each of our key general partners, we have a group of professionals internally from each of our underlying strategies to share company insights, sourcing ideas, and portfolio updates,"" Akers said. ""These little insights can be critical to differentiating our underwriting in a situation, and that collaboration has been enormously valuable.""

In addition to fostering teamwork, Akers also chairs the secondary investment committee and continues to source deals. He sees volatility being a big boon for the industry.

""We're maybe the one investment group in our offices around the world that gets excited when we see some market volatility because it usually does create a great buying opportunity,"" Akers said.

Benedetti first joined Ardian in 2006, when the French firm launched its first US office in New York City. He and Colas were two of the firm's three US-based employees.

The secondaries industry was ""hyper-niche,"" Benedetti said, but he and Colas were about to land several large deals that helped put them on the map.

The pair closed a $1.9 billion deal with Bank of America in 2010, leading to similarly large deals with GE and Citibank and eventually relationships with pension and sovereign wealth funds, according to reporting at the time.

This year, Ardian announced it had raised the largest secondaries fund in the world at $30 billion, making it the industry's largest secondaries investor with $97 billion in assets under management.

The fund is already half-invested, said Colas, with an average deal size of $2 billion. He sees the market continuing to grow at a fast pace, with many transactions from the past two years coming from first-time sellers. He predicts this will most likely lead to even more deals.

""Once they see it's actually fairly efficient, you can move a portfolio of $2 billion, $3 billion pretty quickly,"" Colas said. Benedetti added that more than half of the fund's secondaries deals were from repeat sellers.

Fundraising, not seller demand, will be the biggest roadblock, Colas said.

Benedetti and Colas — the firm's executive president and executive VP, respectively — now juggle more than just dealmaking. They also sit on Ardian's investment and general management committees, lead a 110-person secondaries team, and engage with prospective sellers exploring the market. Still, they aren't afraid to get their hands dirty.

""Just yesterday,"" Benedetti said, ""we called an emergency meeting with the two of us and a team of six people hunkered down in a conference room for four hours to make a go-no-go decision for our final pricing on two multibillion-dollar deals.""

Seven years into his secondaries career, Keith helped launch a new line of business at Ares: investing in infrastructure assets. At the time, Landmark — now Ares' secondaries platform following its 2021 acquisition — was already a powerhouse in private equity and real estate secondaries.

""In 2014, I brought a couple of new investors to the firm who wanted to invest in real assets,"" Keith said. ""Having brought them in, I was now responsible for managing that program. I was thrust into a position of responsibility very early in my career.""

Landmark was one of the first firms to launch a secondaries business focused on infrastructure, just as infrastructure was emerging as a sought-after asset class among buyout professionals. The pitch was simple: By investing later in the life cycle of an asset, investors could avoid the up-front capital expenditures that often came with these sorts of investments, benefiting instead from the stable income often associated with these investments.

Still, it was a challenging time.

""I'd say North American investors were very comfortable in secondaries, but very few of them actually had infra allocations,"" Keith said, using shorthand for infrastructure. ""You go to some places in Europe and they've got a very good feel for infrastructure, but haven't really done secondaries.""

Keith has led the business since its inception, watching both the infrastructure and the secondary markets evolve from exciting experiments to essential components of the private markets. As the market continues to expand, Keith expects deal activity to accelerate.

""If you look at secondaries historically, you can predict the future pretty well by looking at how much capital's gone into a private market,"" Keith said. ""Infrastructure has been extraordinarily fast-growing in terms of the amount of capital that gets raised.""

This August, Perry will have spent a quarter century working for Strategic Partners, one of the largest secondaries investors in the world. In that time, the firm's ownership has changed three times, from the investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, to Credit Suisse, to, finally, Blackstone in August 2013.

Perry, who led negotiations for Strategic Partners, alongside Stephen Can, his then cohead and a founding partner, described the union with Blackstone as ""aspirational."" Under his leadership, the firm has grown from 27 professionals managing $9 billion in assets to 141 people managing $87 billion in assets.

""Over the last 24 years, we believe that my team has done more secondary deals than anyone else,"" Perry said. ""More than 2,200 deals, or one deal every three business days, on average.""

When Perry started, deals could be as small as $100,000. Now they could range from $1 million to over $5 billion.

""We recently completed what we believe to be the largest secondaries deal in history,"" Perry said, referencing Strategic Partners' $5.0 billion purchase of private equity funds from a major pension fund, which a person with knowledge of the matter said involved New York City's nearly $300 billion pension for teachers, police officers, and other city workers.

""It was $5 billion across over 100 underlying funds, with over 70 general partners and over 750 underlying companies,"" he said. ""We had a matter of weeks to value that portfolio.""

While the team has deep expertise in LP-led transactions, it has since expanded into GP-led deals, as well as real estate and infrastructure secondaries — each supported by dedicated funds. Perry has played a key role in that evolution, helping bring the secondaries market into the broader investment mainstream.

""I am one of the spokespeople for this market and have helped to put a face and a philosophy on what it is that we do,"" Perry said.

When Perriello first joined AlpInvest in 2007, the firm had about 20 people and managed capital exclusively for two Dutch pensions. Carlyle acquired a stake in 2011, completing the purchase in 2013.

At about the same time, AlpInvest launched its first fund with outside capital, raising $700 million from 18 investors.

""We went from that to today, where we have several hundred LPs,"" Perriello said. The team now has more than 50 professionals focused on the secondary market.

The firm declined to comment on fundraising specifics, but Carlyle CFO John Redett said in a May earnings call that the firm was getting ready to close its latest secondary fund soon.

Perriello said he's proudest of his role helping transform AlpInvest from the captive arm of a pension fund to a third-party fundraising organization. It now has over $34 billion in committed capital, $18 billion of which is in GP-led deals.

""I think my success here really came from my ability, together with the senior team, to lead the transition to a third-party fundraising organization and all the things that come with that fundraising,"" said Perriello, who became cohead of the business in 2023.

He now travels a lot in his role helping the firm raise money.

""If you look at the Middle East and Asia, they've become big investors in secondary funds,"" Perriello said. ""That's where I spend a lot of my time, out on the road, outside of the US.""

GP-led transactions — where private equity sponsors turn to secondaries investors to provide liquidity for their LPs — have become much more common in recent years. But AlpInvest has been active in this space from the start. In fact, its first deal was a GP-led transaction.

""What really separates us has been the fact that we didn't just get into the single-asset space in 2018, or we didn't start doing continuation funds in 2014,"" Perriello said.

Gombault cofounded Ardian's secondary team in 1998, back when the firm was still part of the French insurance giant Axa.

""At the time we raised a fund of $300 million,"" he said. ""By the time I left the company, it was a $70 billion platform.""

As Ardian expanded, so did Gombault's travel schedule — managing operations across 18 offices. Eventually, he retired, but it didn't suit him.

""I'm not passionate about golf,"" he joked.

That's when a former Ardian colleague, Ingmar Vallano, reached out. The two shared a vision: building software to automate the number crunching that underpins the secondaries market.

""The whole industry runs on Excel models,"" Gombault said. ""Excel is good, but it's 40 years old.""

They began working on a new software system, now named Tech-Enabled Secondaries System. The software automates portfolio data extraction from a wide range of sources — quarterly reports, news articles, and more — fundamentally transforming the secondaries workflow, Gombault said.

""In secondaries, 80% of the team's time is spent on data crunching on Excel, which, if you know the salaries of private equity, that doesn't make sense,"" Gombault said. ""Today, we swapped this ratio to 20% on controlling the data, and 80% on value-added work.""

The firm, which was founded in 2023 with backing from asset managers General Atlantic and Carmignac, declined to comment on when it might launch its first fund.

At Clipway, there are just as many tech staffers as there are investment staffers — and Gombault said they are paid like investment staff, including a form of compensation known as carried interest and an underlying share in the business.

""It is very funny because now I don't know if Clipway is a technology company or an investment company,"" Gombault said. He said TESS had proved game-changing because it could dramatically shorten the time needed to underwrite a portfolio with 50 funds or 500 companies. ""To do that today, you need a team of 20 or 30 people working for three weeks or a month,"" he said. ""With TESS, it takes a team of 10 one week at most.""

Coller has helmed Coller Capital since he founded it in 1990, and he credits Saddam Hussein of all people for convincing him to venture into private equity secondaries.

""In the late 1980s, private equity had been booming for a few years, everyone wanted a piece of it,"" Coller told BI in an email. ""Then Iraq invaded Kuwait, and suddenly investors got spooked and needed liquidity, and fast. So I thought if everyone was desperate to sell, it was a great time to be a buyer.""

When Coller started, there were just a few million dollars of deals annually in the market. Since then, the firm has racked up a range of firsts, including the first European secondary fund and the first global secondary fund.

Now, with 10 offices across four continents and $38 billion AUM, Coller Capital continues to set records. Last year, it completed the largest GP-led private credit secondary transaction, a $1.6 billion deal alongside Abry Capital. The firm has also launched offerings to bring secondaries investment to the private wealth market, broadening its investor base beyond institutional investors.

The Coller CIO's success extends to philanthropy. He endowed the Coller School of Management at Tel Aviv University, where he's deputy chairman of the board of governors.

Coller sees both his firm and the broader market continuing to grow, expecting total annual secondaries volume of at least $500 billion a year.

""Every time it looks like we've reached the top, we raise the bar a little higher,"" he said. ""The next highlight is always just around the corner.""

Goldman Sachs is best known for its investment bank, which facilitates thousands of deals. But its asset management arm also houses one of the largest secondaries investment platforms in the world, investing over $80 billion since it was founded in 1998.

When Hope joined the secondaries team in 2001, there were just four people on the team, he said, adding that there was a lot of room for innovation back then.

He recalled a wave of ""spin-out"" deals the firm did during the 2000s banking M&A boom, turning banks' captive private equity arms into stand-alone funds after mergers, alongside more traditional LP-led deals.

""We did the first deal in the US back in 2001 after Wachovia and First Union merged,"" Hope said.

That spirit of innovation has helped catapult Goldman's secondaries unit from a $400 million fund with just four people to one with more than $40 billion in assets and 90 investment employees, including more than 10 dedicated engineers, known as quantitative strategists.

Hope, who has led or co-led the team since 2008, sees continued innovation ahead as some of the same tools used in the public markets are applied to the private markets.

""It's very attractive to people to apply the same playbook they're using in more liquid structures to the private markets in order to free up some liquidity to concentrate on managers they like better,"" he said.

Brittain started out in investment banking, which prepared him well when he joined Hamilton Lane as a secondaries investor 15 years ago.

""I knew how to value companies, how to execute and negotiate transactions, and I knew a lot of private equity firms,"" Brittain said. ""That was the connection for me.""

Hamilton Lane was taking a chance on him, too, he said. ""I didn't know much about secondaries,"" Brittain said. ""But I learned quickly.""

Now, Brittain is cohead of the platform, which boasts $24 billion in assets under management.

Among his biggest milestones: He helped raise $5.6 billion for Hamilton Lane's sixth secondary fund — announced last year as the firm's largest closed-end fund to date.

He's also taken on a leadership role sourcing deals, helping double the team's deal flow in recent years.

Brittain sees more growth ahead. Before Trump's tariff proclamations rattled markets in April, deal flow in the market was up 60% from last year, ""on pace to be another record year,"" Brittain said. Activity has remained strong since, but buyers are becoming more selective, targeting higher-quality funds, he said.

""We will have another year where liquidity is going to be top for investors,"" Brittain said. ""That's going to lead to more volume in the secondary market.""

Keay joined HarbourVest in 1999, becoming the fifth member of a secondaries team that has been active since 1986. Over the past 38 years, the firm has committed $62 billion to the strategy.

Now a key figure atop the firm's secondaries investment committee, Keay credits HarbourVest's long-standing leadership stability for its success in the space.

""Our team's founder, Fred Maynard, and his partner, John Begg, were the only managing directors who have ever left the secondary team,"" Keay said. Both retired over a decade ago, and Keay soon stepped into his current role. Today, the team has grown to more than 60 members worldwide.

""We've gone from doing a couple hundred million dollars a year in a busy year to — I'm guessing we will invest $10 billion into the market this year,"" Keay said.

While HarbourVest was one of the earliest entrants into the secondaries market, Keay said it had continued to innovate. The firm has long been active in GP-led deals. Keay pointed to its spin-out transactions, which helped launch several now-prominent private equity firms — beginning with MidOcean Partners, the $11 billion AUM firm that HarbourVest spun out of Deutsche Bank.

""They picked a name and became an independent buyout manager,"" Keay said. ""We've since done that dozens of times.""

Despite his deep experience, Keay no longer spends much time landing deals — the original ""passion"" that he says brought him to secondaries. Instead, he focuses on mentoring the next generation of HarbourVest investors.

""I didn't create the culture at HarbourVest, which has been essential to our success,"" he said, ""but I do view that I play a key role in preserving that culture.""

Warren joined Lexington Partners just as the firm spun out of Landmark Partners, one of the earliest secondaries specialists, which is now owned by Ares. That was back in 1994, when the secondaries industry had barely begun.

Lexington, with over $40 billion invested in secondaries, has grown to one of the world's largest investors in the space. In 2020, it set a record for the largest secondaries fund in the world with $14 billion raised.

The firm's success attracted the attention of the asset manager Franklin Templeton, which acquired Lexington for $1.75 billion in 2021, more than Ares paid for Landmark earlier that year.

Lexington, which remains under Warren's leadership, has been busy ever since.

The firm has been working on a deal for a stake of the Harvard endowment's private equity allocation since late last year, according to a person with direct knowledge. As university endowments face continued challenges under the Trump administration, similar transactions are expected to follow.

This year, the firm launched a secondaries fund for private wealth investors, reaching nearly $1 billion in AUM. It's part of a broader trend of bringing wealthy individuals into the mix alongside traditional institutional capital.

Lexington did not respond to comment requests for this story.

Perkins has been investing in secondary private markets since the 1990s, beginning his career at the storied Wall Street firm Bankers Trust before its acquisition by Deutsche Bank in 1999. A veteran of the space, Perkins is bullish on today's environment.

""Having invested in secondary private equity for more than two decades, this appears to me to be one of the most attractive environments I have experienced,"" he told BI.

After Deutsche Bank exited its private equity investments, Perkins and some of his Bankers Trust colleagues jumped to Neuberger Berman, launching the firm's secondaries platform with an $800 million fund in 2005. Neuberger's secondaries business has since raised $20 billion for secondaries investments, including a real estate secondaries arm helmed by Scott Koenig.

Perl, who joined the firm after working as a private equity investor for Lehman Brothers, eventually joined Perkins's team.

""One of the things I loved about the secondary market was the opportunity to complete dozens of investments in a given year, Perl said. ""Many of my peers at buyouts firms only make one or two investments a year, and some years they don't make any at all.""

Now a managing director, Perl has played a key role in expanding Neuberger's secondaries platform, which has completed over $16 billion in GP-led deals across 55 transactions since its founding.

Perl said he'd seen deals grow more complicated as the industry matured, especially financial sponsor deals. He recalled a recent GP-led transaction involving a private equity firm managing five companies within a $5 billion fund.

""One of the things they said to me at the end of the process was that this was one of the hardest transactions they had ever done,"" Perl said. ""They said it was like landing five planes simultaneously.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","What's really fueling Elon Musk's latest outburst against Trump's tax bill?","https://www.businessinsider.com/behind-elon-musk-trump-tax-bill-outburst-doge-tesla-spacex2025-6","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 12:43:00 GMT","

Good morning! Doing one thing every day that makes you smarter is a good goal to have. Here's my suggestion for today: Subscribe to BI Tech Memo. Alistair Barr is the best in the biz at breaking down what's going on in Big Tech. (And it's free!)

In today's big story, Elon Musk had some not-so-nice things to say about President Donald Trump's tax bill.

What's on deck

Markets: They might be in secondaries, but they're still on top. Meet the key execs in Wall Street's hottest market.

Tech: What a top Microsoft exec learned from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.

Business: Florida real estate is showing cracks, and it could be a red flag for the rest of the country.

But first, I just can't stand it anymore.

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and Elon Musk doesn't see anything pretty in the ""Big Beautiful Bill.""

The billionaire railed against President Donald Trump's tax bill Tuesday afternoon, calling it a ""disgusting abomination.""

Musk, known for keeping his opinions to himself, posted on X that he ""just can't stand it anymore,"" before criticizing the ""massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill.""

""Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,"" he added.

He's not the only one attacking Trump's bill. Some within the president's own party have gone after it for fueling the government's growing deficit.

So what's behind Musk's outburst?

We're less than a week removed from his decision to leave Washington. Why jump back into the fray?

Here's what could be rubbing him the wrong way about the bill:

DOGE disappointment: According to one estimate, Trump's tax bill will increase the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years. That's probably a difficult pill to swallow for Musk, who was tasked with cutting that down via DOGE.

The group took extreme measures trying to achieve that, and Musk faced plenty of professional and personal backlash. Now he's seeing the tax bill ""undermine"" — his words, not mine — all of that work.

Musk Inc. and the tax bill: Despite his recent foray into politics, Musk is still a business owner at heart. Trump's tax bill has real implications for his companies, both good (SpaceX) and bad (Tesla). BI's Ana Altchek, Alice Tecotzky and Kelsey Vlamis have a breakdown on what it means for his portfolio.

The end of a friendship: Since the Trump-Musk bromance first blossomed, people have speculated when it might end. As BI's Peter Kafka put it shortly after the election, ""both men are famously short-fused"" and ""adore the spotlight.""

""And that combination makes it easy to imagine a break-up down the line,"" Peter added.

We've seen cracks in the relationship before. The dustup over the government funding bill led to jokes about Musk being the real leader of the GOP. That elicited a response from a Trump spokesperson. Musk also clashed with Trump's base over H-1B visas.

Just Elon being Elon: Sometimes the best explanation is the simplest. Musk has a history of shooting from the hip with his takes. (Being the richest person in the world affords you that privilege.) He's already said that he and Trump didn't always see eye to eye. This could just be another example of that.

1. The Nvidia hype is back. The chip giant's stock has climbed 20% over the last month. After bottoming in April during a broader market sell-off, Nvidia's stock is now up 45%. These are four big catalysts spurring it on.

2. Six Wall Street veterans on the best trades they've ever made. Senior money managers told BI about the highlights of their investing careers, from buying undervalued stocks to making well-timed exits. One talked about shorting GameStop.

3. Power players in secondaries. The secondaries market — in which investors buy and sell secondhand shares of private funds — is on pace to break last year's record highs of $160 billion. Meet 14 people who took the industry from niche to new heights.

1. How can you make AI your coworker, not your replacement? The HR-tech startup Lattice thinks it has the answer. The CEO of the company, which makes AI agents for the workplace, told BI that embracing AI now would help protect jobs, not threaten them.

2. Microsoft's copycat strategy. The company's latest exec Jay Parikh is adopting Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's strategies for his new AI organization, Core AI, according to an internal email viewed by BI. Parikh shared takeaways from an annual letter Jassy sent to Amazon shareholders in a memo. Here are three of his takeaways.

3. The pure internet is gone. Did anyone save a copy? Since ChatGPT came out, the internet has been flooded with AI-generated content. That's sent researchers diving deep to preserve content made by humans prior to 2022, BI's Alistair Barr writes.

1. Trouble in paradise. Florida was the undisputed winner of the pandemic relocation boom, luring millions of new residents with its beaches and low taxes. Now, Floridians are experiencing an affordability crisis, hurricane-fueled insurance nightmares, and more. It's also a warning for America's real-estate market.

2. A business immigration lawyer on Trump 2.0. The Trump administration is being as strict as possible when it comes to work-visa applications, attorney Jason Finkelman told BI. With the amount of effort and hoops to jump through, Finkelman believes it's designed to frustrate US companies into giving up on hiring foreign workers.

3. This longtime middle manager supports flattening middle management. Alvaro Munevar Jr. told BI he'd seen middle management practices that siloed workers and slowed productivity. But as Big Tech culls those roles, the remaining ones could still evolve significantly. A LinkedIn executive said managers will need to be more like coaches to keep teams' energy up.

The CEO of BarkBox, the company that offers a monthly subscription service for boxes of dog toys and treats, has issued a public apology for a ""disrespectful and hurtful"" internal message that leaked on social media.

A screenshot of the message that circulated on Reddit described the decision to immediately pause paid ads and lifecycle marketing pushes for the company's Pride kit.

""While celebrating Pride is something we may value, we need to acknowledge that the current climate makes this promotion feel more like a political statement than a universally joyful moment for all dog people,"" the message reads in part. ""If we wouldn't feel comfortable running a promotion centered around another politically charged symbol (like a MAGA-themed product), it's worth asking whether this is the right moment to run this particular campaign.""

""Right now, pushing this promo risks unintentionally sending the message that 'we're not for you' to a large portion of our audience,"" the message concludes.

BarkBox confirmed to Business Insider the authenticity of the screenshot. The author of the message is unclear.

Founder and CEO Matt Meeker apologized for the ""disrespectful and hurtful"" message in an Instagram post on Wednesday.

""I do not agree with the content of the message. It wasn't good, it doesn't reflect our values, and I'm deeply sorry that it happened,"" he said.

""We stand by the products,"" he wrote about the Pride kits, noting that the company had no plans to remove them. While the company has donated a portion of profits from its Pride collection to an organization supporting LGBTQ people in past years, it'll donate 100% of the revenue from the collection this year, he added.

The company's Pride collection is available as an optional add-on for BarkBox and Super Chewer subscribers, and has been offered for the past four years.

The initial pullback on Pride isn't unique to BarkBox. Some of the biggest retailers in the US have walked back their support for diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, with some taking cues from the Trump administration's stance on the matter. Target last year scaled back its Pride Month collection after receiving backlash from conservatives over the merchandise in prior years. In late November, Walmart announced it was ending some of its DEI initiatives and taking down some LGBTQ-related merchandise from its website.

Posting on his Truth Social platform after he said the two spoke by phone, Trump made no reference to additional sanctions or his repeated calls for a ceasefire, which Putin has ignored, nor a potential meeting between leaders, which Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenksiy said he supports.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Yale University, whose embrace of private equity and venture capital spawned legions of followers, is finalizing the sale of as much as $2.5 billion of those assets ahead of potential tax changes. 

The Ivy League school's endowment is in advanced talks on the portfolio sale, code-named “Project Gatsby,” with an overall discount expected to be less than 10%, according to people with knowledge of the discussions, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Potential buyers had valued parts of the portfolio at a haircut of as much as 15%, some of the people said.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The U.S. Education Department said Wednesday that Columbia University has failed to meet the standards for accreditation because it ""is in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws"" for allegedly tolerating harassment of Jewish students on campus.

The Education Department's Office of Civil Rights notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, an accrediting institution that Columbia belongs to, of the alleged violation.

The department noted that federal regulations, ""accreditors are required to notify any member institution about a federal noncompliance finding and establish a plan to come into compliance.""

""If a university fails to come into compliance within a specified period, an accreditor must take appropriate action against its member institution,"" the department said.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon, in a statement, said, ""After Hamas' October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, Columbia  University's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students on its campus.""

""This is not only immoral, but also unlawful,"" McMahon said.

""Accreditors have an enormous public responsibility as gatekeepers of federal student aid. They determine which institutions are eligible for federal student loans and Pell Grants. Just as the Department of Education has an obligation to uphold federal antidiscrimination law, university accreditors have an obligation to ensure member institutions abide by their standards.""

CNBC has requested comment from Columbia on the department's move.

The U.S. economy has contracted over the past six weeks as hiring has slowed and consumers and businesses worried about tariff-related price increases, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday.

In its periodic ""Beige Book"" summary of conditions, the central bank noted that ""economic activity has declined slightly since the previous report"" released April 23.

""All Districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty, which have led to hesitancy and a cautious approach to business and household decisions,"" the report added.

Hiring was ""little changed"" across most of the Fed's 12 districts, with seven describing employment as ""flat"" amid widespread growth in applicants and lower turnover rates.

""All Districts described lower labor demand, citing declining hours worked and overtime, hiring pauses, and staff reduction plans. Some Districts reported layoffs in certain sectors, but these layoffs were not pervasive,"" the report said.

On inflation, the report described prices as rising ""at a moderate pace.""

""There were widespread reports of contacts expecting costs and prices to rise at a faster rate going forward. A few Districts described these expected cost increases as strong, significant, or substantial,"" it said. ""All District reports indicated that higher tariff rates were putting upward pressure on costs and prices.""

There were disparities, however, over expectations for how much prices would rise, with some businesses saying they might reduce profit margins or add ""temporary fees or surcharges.""

""Contacts that plan to pass along tariff-related costs expect to do so within three months,"" the report said.

The report covers a period of a shifting landscape for President Donald Trump's tariffs.

In early May, Trump said he would relax so-called reciprocal tariffs against China, which responded in kind, helping to set off a rally on Wall Street amid hopes the duties would not be as draconian as initially feared.

However, fears linger over the inflationary impact as well as whether hiring and the broader economy would slow because of slowdowns associated with the tariffs.

Tariffs were mentioned 122 times in Thursday's report, compared to 107 times in April.

Regionally, Boston, New York and Philadelphia all reported declining economic activity. Richmond, Atlanta and Chicago were among the districts reporting better growth.

In New York specifically, the Fed found ""heightened uncertainty"" and input prices that ""grew strongly with tariff-inducted cost increases. Richmond reported a slight increase in hiring despite Trump's efforts to trim the federal government payroll.

Republican Sen. Ron Johnson on Wednesday blasted President Donald Trump's ""one big, beautiful bill"" as ""immoral"" and ""grotesque,"" and reiterated that he will vote against it unless his GOP colleagues make major changes.

""This is immoral, what us old farts doing to our young people,"" Johnson said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" after sounding alarms that the massive tax-and-spending-cut bill would add trillions of dollars to national deficits.

""This is grotesque, what we're doing,"" Johnson said. ""We need to own up to that. This is our moment.""

""I can't accept the scenario, I can't accept it, so I won't vote for it, unless we are serious about fixing it,"" he continued.

Johnson has been among the Senate's loudest GOP critics of the budget bill that narrowly passed the House last month.

Johnson and other fiscal hawks have taken aim over its effect on the nation's debt. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated later Wednesday that the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

Johnson has proposed splitting the bill into two parts, though Trump insists on passing his agenda in a single package.

""The president and Senate leadership has to understand that we're serious now,"" Johnson said of himself and the handful of other GOP senators whose opposition to the bill could imperil its chances.

""They all say, 'Oh, we can pressure these guys.' No, you can't.""

Republicans hold a narrow 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they can only afford to lose a handful of votes to get the bill passed in a party-line vote.

""Let's discuss the numbers, and let's focus on our children and grandchildren, whose futures are being mortgaged, their prospects are being diminished by what we are doing to them,"" Johnson said.

Johnson's comments came one day after Elon Musk ripped into the spending bill, calling it a ""disgusting abomination"" that will lead to exploding deficits. The White House brushed aside Musk's comments.

Johnson said Musk's criticisms bolster the case against the bill.

""He's in the inside, he showed … President Trump how to do this, you know, contract by contract, line by line,"" Johnson said of Musk. ""We have to do that.""

Johnson said his campaign against the bill in its current form is not a ""long shot,"" because he thinks there are ""enough"" Republican senators who will vote against the bill.

""We want to see [Trump] succeed, but again, my loyalty is to our kids and grandkids,"" he said.

""So there's enough of us who have that attitude that very respectfully we just have say, 'Mr. President, I'm sorry, 'one, big, beautiful bill' was not the best idea,"" he added.

In this article

Forecasts for Apple and Samsung shipment growth this year were sharply slashed by Counterpoint Research on Wednesday amid uncertainty over U.S. tariff policy.

The research outfit said it had revised down its 2025 global smartphone shipment growth forecast to 1.9% year-on-year from 4.2% previously, citing ""renewed uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariffs.""

U.S. President Donald Trump announced ""reciprocal tariffs"" on imports from countries around the world in April, but exempted smartphones and other electronics from those duties days later.

Still, with tariff uncertainty looming, Counterpoint Research slashed its growth forecast for the world's two biggest smartphone players. Apple shipments are expected to grow 2.5% year-on-year in 2025, down from a previous forecast of 4%, according to Counterpoint Research. Samsung shipments are now anticipated to see no growth this year, compared with the 1.7% rise that was previously projected.

But it is not just tariffs behind these revised forecasts.

""All eyes are on Apple and Samsung because of their exposure to the US market. Although tariffs have played a role in our forecast revisions, we are also factoring in weakened demand not just in North America but across Europe and parts of Asia,"" Counterpoint Research Associate Director Liz Lee said in a press release.

Apple's downgraded shipment growth will be driven by the iPhone 16 series of devices, as well as by emerging market customers buying more expensive phones, Counterpoint said.

Shipments are not equivalent to sales and represent the number of devices that smartphones vendors send to retailers. They are one measure of the demand that smartphone vendors are expecting.

Apple in particular has come under scrutiny amid talk of U.S. tariffs on China, where the U.S. giant makes 90% of its iPhones. Apple has ramped up its shipments to the U.S. from India, where it has been steadily increasing production of its flagship product.

But this has also drawn the ire of Trump, who last month said that he doesn't want Apple building iPhones in India, and that they should be manufacturing them in the U.S.

Counterpoint Research flagged Huawei as a bright spot in the sea of lowered forecasts, with the Chinese tech giant expected to notch a 11% year-on-year shipment growth in 2025.

""We are seeing an easing around sourcing bottlenecks for key components at least through the rest of the year, which should help Huawei grab substantial share in the mid-to-lower-end segments at home,"" Ethan Qi, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said in a press release.

Huawei has seen a rebound in smartphone sales in its home market of China since late 2023, where a breakthrough in semiconductors for its devices, helped revive its fortunes.

In this article

Reddit is suing artificial intelligence startup Anthropic for what it's calling a breach of contract and for engaging in ""unlawful and unfair business acts"" by using the social media company's platform and data without authority.

The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco on Wednesday, claims that Anthropic has been training its models on the personal data of Reddit users without obtaining their consent. Reddit alleges that's has been harmed by the unauthorized commercial use of its content.

Reddit shares closed up more than 6% on Wednesday.

The company opened the complaint by calling Anthropic a ""late-blooming"" AI company that ""bills itself as the white knight of the AI industry."" Reddit follows by saying, ""It is anything but.""

""For its part, despite what its marketing material says, Anthropic does not care about Reddit's rules or users: it believes it is entitled to take whatever content it wants and use that content however it desires,with impunity,"" the filing said.

In an emailed statement, an Anthropic spokesperson said, ""We disagree with Reddit's claims and will defend ourselves vigorously.""

Since the generative AI boom began with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, Reddit has been at the forefront of the conversation. Its 20-year-old site is filled with user-generated information about hundreds of thousands of topics and has been a main source of training for large AI models, including Anthropic's Claude.

Reddit announced a partnership with OpenAI in May that will allow the company to train its AI models on Reddit content. The company has a similar agreement with Google.

In the lawsuit, Reddit said that ""other giants in the AI space understand and respect Reddit's rules."" It named OpenAI and Google as companies that ""are permitted to use public Reddit content but only after agreeing to Reddit's licensing terms"" protecting user privacy.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is a former board member and major shareholder in Reddit, with a stake now worth well over $1 billion.

In March, Anthropic was valued at $61.5 billion in a funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and including participation from Salesforce Ventures and Cisco Investments. The company, founded in 2021 by ex-OpenAI executives, has been backed heavily by Amazon.

Reddit held its IPO in 2024 and now has a market cap of about $22 billion.

Reddit says it has established rules dictating how its data can be used, which the company says in the filing ""are clearly memorialized"" in the Reddit's user agreement.

""While Reddit has always been of the mind that the community should be open to all humans looking for connection and community, it has never allowed its platform and the countless communities who find a home on it to be appropriated by commercial actors seeking to create billion-dollar enterprises and offering nothing in return to Reddit and its users,"" the complaint says.

Reddit said the aim of the lawsuit is to seek damages and compel Anthropic to abide by its contractual and legal obligations. It's asking for a jury trial.

 The company concluded its first year of Bitcoin reserve operations with 4,449 BTC on its balance sheet. 

Medical tech company Semler Scientific has deepened its Bitcoin strategy, revealing a new $20 million investment for 185 BTC between May 23 and June 3. The latest acquisition brings its total holdings to 4,449 Bitcoin (BTC), purchased at an average price of $107,974 per coin.

According to a June 4 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Semler's total investment in the cryptocurrency now stands at $410 million, valued at approximately $472.9 million as of June 3. Its Bitcoin yield is up by 26.7% since it began accumulating BTC in May 2024.

Semler has made regular Bitcoin purchases over the past year. The company also revealed the addition of $50 million to its Bitcoin reserve in May, after it acquired another $10 million BTC between February and April.

The BTC strategy does not appear to be attracting investors' interest. As of June 4, the company's shares are down 37% in 2025, according to Google Finance. Since May 29, 2024, when it announced its pivot to add a Bitcoin reserve, the share price is up 16% at this writing.

Companies that are betting on Bitcoin reserves are experiencing mixed results in their share prices in 2025. Strategy's shares are up 33% year-to-date, while Japanese firm Metaplanet has seen a 265% spike in its share price. 

Bitcoin has had a volatile ride in 2025. Despite climbing 11.8% year-to-date and reaching an all-time high of $112,000, the asset has also dropped below $77,000. Ongoing trade wars and broader macroeconomic uncertainty have weighed on its performance.

According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, approximately 3.4 million BTC are currently being held in treasuries. Exchange-traded funds and public companies make up the largest groups holding Bitcoin, while governments come in third.

Ethereum is showing impressive resilience as it continues to hold above critical levels despite ongoing market volatility. While Bitcoin struggles to break past its all-time highs, ETH remains stable, maintaining bullish structure and fueling hopes for a broader altcoin rally. Analysts across the market are eyeing a potential altseason, with Ethereum expected to lead the charge once it clears major supply zones.

However, the spotlight is shifting to a less discussed but highly significant chart—ETHBTC. According to top analyst Daan, the ETHBTC pair has been consolidating in a tight range between 0.022 and 0.026 since the last squeeze. This consolidation suggests a period of accumulation and reduced volatility, but it also acts as a crucial signal for altcoin momentum.

If ETHBTC breaks above the 0.026 resistance level, Daan suggests it could trigger a temporary but powerful rally in ALT/BTC pairs. Sectors closely tied to Ethereum—such as DeFi protocols, ETH-based memecoins, and Layer 2 ecosystems—could benefit most from such a move. Until then, investors are closely monitoring ETH's performance relative to BTC, as it remains one of the most reliable indicators of capital rotation within the crypto market.

ETHBTC Chart Becomes Key to Altseason Outlook

Ethereum is currently trading at a pivotal range, with investors closely watching for a breakout that could lead to new highs and potentially ignite the long-anticipated altseason. Despite global tensions and continued macroeconomic uncertainty—particularly surrounding the aggressive and unstable Bond market—ETH has remained relatively strong. Bulls are optimistic, viewing the current consolidation as a healthy pause before the next leg up.

One of the most important signals for altcoin momentum is not found on the USD chart, but in the ETHBTC pair. Daan points out that Ethereum's price relative to Bitcoin has been consolidating between the 0.022 and 0.026 BTC range since the recent squeeze. This range now acts as a pressure point for the market. A breakout above 0.026 would likely catalyze a surge in altcoin strength, especially among Ethereum-related assets like DeFi protocols, ETH-based memecoins, and Layer 2 solutions.

However, Daan warns that if ETHBTC drops below 0.0224, it could signal weakness for alts relative to BTC. It's important to remember that ALT/BTC pairs can fall even if altcoin USD prices rise, particularly during aggressive BTC rallies. The same applies in reverse. For now, ETH's position in this range remains one of the most telling signs of where the broader crypto market might head next.

Ethereum Faces Resistance As Bulls Attempt Breakout

Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,640, showing signs of strength after holding its ground above the $2,500 mark. On the daily chart, ETH is forming a clear consolidation pattern just below a key resistance zone defined by the 200-day moving average (currently at $2,676). This level has repeatedly capped price action over the past few weeks, signaling strong supply pressure in this area.

Despite the lack of a decisive breakout, Ethereum is maintaining a bullish structure with higher lows and consistent volume support. The 34-day EMA has turned upward and currently sits at $2,418, providing dynamic support and reinforcing the short-term uptrend. If ETH can reclaim the 200-day SMA and push above $2,700, a broader rally could follow, potentially opening the path toward $3,000 and beyond.

On the downside, if price fails to break this resistance and sellers take control, immediate support lies near $2,500, followed by stronger demand around $2,350–$2,400 where the 50- and 100-day SMAs converge. For now, Ethereum remains in a balanced state, showing resilience, but still needs a strong catalyst to overcome the technical ceiling that continues to stall upward momentum.

Ethereum has attracted over $109 million in ETF inflows as institutions shift from Bitcoin. Can ETH break through the $3,000 mark this week? 

As the crypto market gradually gains momentum, hinting at a potential bullish recovery, institutional investors are increasingly loading up on Ethereum. With BlackRock now favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin, could ETH cross the $3,000 threshold this week?

On June 3, the total daily net inflow into U.S. Ethereum spot ETFs reached $109.43 million, marking the 12th consecutive day of positive inflows. BlackRock led the day's activity with $77.06 million in inflows.

Meanwhile, on May 30 and June 2, BlackRock Bitcoin ETF registered massive outflows totaling $561 million. However, at the close of the most recent trading day (Tuesday), BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF reported a positive inflow of $58 million.

While notable, this figure still falls short compared to the inflows into its Ethereum ETF. Some analysts interpret this as a sign that BlackRock is restructuring its holdings, shifting funds from Bitcoin to Ethereum, in preparation for a potential altcoin season.

According to IntoTheBlock's Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator, Ethereum's immediate resistance zone lies between $2,726 and $2,856. It contains about 4.13 million ETH held by 2.7 million investors.

Meanwhile, the current out-of-the-money zone holds a significantly larger supply, 12.32 million ETH held by 10.77 million investors, with an average acquisition price of $2,613.

Ethereum's uptrend will likely continue because the at-the-money zone represents a much larger supply than the immediate resistance zone.



In a recent tweet, Joao Wedson, CEO of Alphractal, highlighted activity from Ethereum market makers. He shared a three-month aggregated liquidation heatmap, noting significant accumulation at lower levels, suggesting the potential for a major breakout move, depending on the duration of the accumulation phase.

Wedson projects a price target of $2,830 following a breakout above $2,660. He also identified a potential stop-loss level at $2,556.

On the daily chart, Ethereum showed over 1% growth on Wednesday, pushing weekly gains above 3%. However, ETH remains within a consolidation range between the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $2,395 and the 50% level at $2,699.

A recent bullish crossover between the 50-day and 100-day EMAs supports a short-term recovery. Additionally, the daily RSI indicates a bullish spike.

According to Fibonacci levels, a breakout above the 50% level could pave the way for a test of the $3,000 mark, aligning with the 61.8% Fibonacci level. Ethereum could target the 78.6% level at $3,436 if recovery extends further.

 Ether's price is up 46% in the past 30 days, and analysts say continued demand for spot Ethereum ETFs and strengthening structure may trigger a breakout. 

Key takeaways:

Ether's price is up 46% in 30 days.

ETH/BTC is up 30% in the past month, signaling stronger demand for Ether.

Spot Ethereum ETFs see 12 consecutive days of inflows.

Ether's price is up by 7% over the last three days, leading to optimism among traders that the biggest altcoin is ready for a breakout. Interestingly, the ETH/BTC trading pair has also increased, boosting Ether's recovery prospects in the coming days.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed Ether's (ETH) price trading at $2,630, up 46% over the last 30 days.

“ETH appears poised for a significant upward breakout,” said MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe in a June 3 post on X.

An accompanying chart showed the ETH/USD pair trading above a key support area around $2,400 on the six-hour chart.

A key resistance area is between $2,680 (where the 200-day simple moving average currently sits) and $2,850. 

According to van de Poppe, ETH price needs to break above this level before making a “new high for the year.” 

“Ethereum is trying to reclaim $2,500 as support and solidify it as the new range low of the $2,500-$4,000 macro range,” said fellow analyst Rekt Capital in his latest ETH/USD analysis on X. 

The analyst referred to Ether's close above $2,500 on May 31, which ETH bulls are now trying to flip into support on the monthly chart. 

If history repeats itself and Ether holds above $2,500 in June, a significant rally toward fresh all-time highs becomes likely.

Analyst Crypto Eagles said that the ETH price appears to be repeating the 2016-17 technical structure, potentially setting the stage for a rally to $6,000. 

Ether is up 46% over the last 30 days, outperforming Bitcoin, whose price has risen by 16.5% vs the US dollar over the same period. 

The ETH/BTC pair is also up 30% over the last month, reaching a 10-week high of 0.02618 on May 14. ETH/BTC trades at around 0.02503, up 48% from the multi-year low of 0.01766 reached on April 22.

Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades spotted the ETH/BTC consolidating between the 0.022-0.026 range and said that a “break above that should temporarily give another boost to ALT/BTC pairs.” 

As Cointelegraph reported, an ETH/BTC breakout from a cup-and-handle pattern could trigger a 55% rally, signaling the start of a new altseason.

The rise in the ETH/BTC ratio indicates increased demand for Ether, with institutional investors opting for ETH over BTC in the past few days.

US spot Ethereum ETFs have witnessed net inflows for twelve consecutive days.

On the other hand, spot Bitcoin ETFs broke their 10-day streak of inflows last week, recording outflows for three consecutive days between May 29 and June 2, totaling $1.23 billion.

12 consecutive days of inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs “indicates growing interest from institutions and big players in $ETH,” said pseudonymous crypto analyst Coiniseasy in a June 4 post on X, adding:

Additional data from CoinShares revealed that global Ethereum investment products saw inflows totaling $321 million last week, marking the strongest run since late December 2024. Bitcoin ETPs saw $8 million in outflows, ending a 6-week run of inflows totaling $9.6 billion.

Bitcoin's current price action is marked by a consolidation around the $105,500 price level. Although it reached an intraday high of $106,807, it has since returned to $105,500, and its dominance also witnessed a minor fall. Notably, Bitcoin's dominance metric, the BTC.D, which measures its share of the total crypto market capitalization, has stalled around the 64% level in recent weeks. 

This stalling behavior drew attention from a certified market analyst, especially in light of many altcoins struggling to gain momentum in an environment dominated by Bitcoin's inflow.

BTC Dominance Hits Resistance, Candlestick Flash Warnings

According to certified Level III CMT analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino, the 64% region on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart could mark a meaningful reversal point. Sharing his insights alongside a technical chart of Bitcoin's market cap dominance on the monthly timeframe, Severino pointed out that the latest monthly candlestick formed a Doji right at the bottom of a previous Falling Window. 

In Japanese candlestick theory, such “windows” are not just gaps to be filled but serve as critical zones of support or resistance. The fact that BTC.D formed a Doji candle precisely at this window, according to Severino, is a textbook reaction suggesting the dominance rally may be losing strength.

This candlestick structure brings the focus onto how the current monthly candlestick plays out. If the current monthly candle becomes an Evening Star candlestick and closes below 62%, the odds of Bitcoin dominance rolling over increase significantly. 

Altcoin Season Not Quite There Yet

As noted by Tony, if Bitcoin's dominance candlestick this month forms an Evening Star pattern and closes below 62%, it has a high possibility of marking the end of the cryptocurrency's current dominance. However, the analyst added a key caveat: the BTC.D Relative Strength Index (RSI) closed the previous month above 70, still suggesting strong momentum and keeping the larger trend in flux.

Despite these early signals, Severino warned against jumping the gun. Although the technical evidence points to a possible short-term reversal in dominance, he clarified that it does not necessarily guarantee a full-fledged altcoin season. In his words, “I am still not of the mindset that we will get a typical altcoin season, but I am seeing some of the first signs that BTC.D might reverse here.”

For now, Bitcoin continues to hold steady above $105,000, and until BTC.D breaks convincingly below 62%, the cryptocurrency is in dominance. Nonetheless, the altcoin market could soon be looking at its first real window of opportunity in months.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,500, down by 0.1% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin dominance is currently at 63.1%, down by 0.57% in the past 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, increased its market share by 2.13% to 9.6%.

Online tracking has become an inevitable part of daily digital experiences, often enabling personalised services but sometimes using information in ways users may not understand or expect. 

The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) and (UK) GDPR requirements are notoriously challenging for the digital advertising industry to meet because they fail to take into account the realities of the business model. 60% of cookie-related complaints received by the ICO in 2024 concerned people not being given the option to reject non-essential tracking, although people are also tired of endless pop-up banners asking for consent, often with non-GDPR-compliant cookie notices.  For regulators and individuals alike, the picture has been further complicated by emergence (following a string of CJEU rulings) of the 'consent or pay' model for online advertising – both in the EU and, to a lesser extent, in the UK.  

It's not new for regulators to focus on online tracking.  The European Data Protection Board has been active in this space and, at a national level, the French CNIL stands out.  For the ICO, the challenge focuses on enforcing data privacy law in alignment with the government's pro-growth strategy.

On 23 January 2025, the ICO published its online tracking strategy for the year (strategy). It outlines the ICO's plans to promote compliance with data protection laws in the online tracking ecosystem, with a focus on safeguarding and empowering people to have meaningful control over their data while promoting responsible innovation and sustainable economic growth.

The strategy outlined the ICO's plans to ""go further and faster"" in 2025, heralded as part of a broader package of measures announced by the ICO on 16 January 2025, aimed at driving economic growth while maintaining high data protection standards (see here for more). It follows on from a series of actions the ICO took in 2024, including consulting on fresh guidance for storage and access technologies like cookies and fingerprinting, examining 'consent or pay' business models, reviewing the UK's top 200 websites, and concluding investigations and audits of data management platforms.  

The ICO identified four areas where users are not being given the control to which they are entitled under UK data protection law.

The ICO is concerned that without action, compliant organisations face a 'first mover disadvantage' compared to competitors which continue with non-compliant practices, creating weak incentives for investment in approaches which respect users' privacy. The ICO wants to level the playing field, to make it easier for businesses to comply, and ensure user control over personal data.

The focus of the strategy is on online advertising and, in particular, user control.  Many of the initiatives complete or extend the work done in 2024.

Making it easier for publishers to adopt more privacy-friendly forms of online advertising

The ICO wants to make it easier for publishers to adopt more privacy-friendly forms of online advertising that don't involve extensive profiling of individuals. It will explore where PECR requirements might be hindering industry-wide shifts toward more privacy-friendly advertising approaches, such as contextual models, and will publish a statement outlining low-risk processing activities. The ICO plans to work with the government to develop secondary legislation to amend PECR consent requirements, to create an exemption for specific low-risk advertising purposes.

Ensuring publishers give people meaningful control over how they are tracked on websites

The ICO will continue to enforce consent requirements to ensure users have meaningful control over how their information is used. It is extending its monitoring around online tracking and personalised advertising from the top 200 to the top 1,000 most popular UK websites, implementing automated compliance monitoring.

Ensure people have meaningful control over tracking on apps and connected TVs

For the first time, the ICO will extend its scrutiny beyond web browsers to include apps and connected TVs, preventing non-compliant tracking from migrating to these platforms.  The ICO will consult on guidance for IoT devices and intervene with app developers and TV manufacturers to promote compliance.

Confirm how publishers can deploy 'consent or pay'

Alongside its online tracking strategy, on 23 January 2025 the ICO published guidance on 'consent or pay' business models, clarifying how publishers can implement these approaches while allowing users to have meaningful control over their data. These models allow users to choose between consenting to tracking for free access or paying for access without being tracked.

Provide industry with clarity

The ICO will publish final guidance on storage and access technologies after the Data (Use and Access) Bill is finalised.  The ICO will also work with the online advertising industry to develop a certification scheme which will enable organisations to demonstrate compliance with data protection laws, and support businesses looking to introduce novel solutions through its Regulatory Sandbox and Innovation Advice services.

Investigate compliance failures in the adtech ecosystem

Building on the audits it concluded last year, the ICO plans to investigate potential non-compliance in data management platforms that connect online advertisers and publishers. It will also examine the case for further action to ensure that people can easily withdraw consent from all organisations with which their personal information has been shared.

Support the public to take control of how they are tracked online

The ICO will publish guidance for the public on understanding and controlling how their information is used online, raising awareness of their rights.

The strategy takes a comprehensive view of the online tracking ecosystem, addressing not just websites but also apps, connected TVs, and data management platforms, emphasising that all participants in the digital advertising supply chain will face regulatory scrutiny.

The ICO's expanded monitoring scope and implementation of automated compliance checks suggest a more rigorous enforcement landscape for businesses operating in the UK digital advertising ecosystem.   The strategy places particular emphasis on protecting vulnerable users who may face greater risks from unchecked tracking, including potential discrimination or unwanted disclosure of sensitive information.

As UK Information Commissioner John Edwards indicated in his letter to the Prime Minister, the ICO aims to balance its protective role with supporting economic growth. This means that the ICO's approach recognises how important personalised advertising is to organisations. The ICO's guidance on 'consent or pay' models and exploration of privacy-friendly alternatives like contextual advertising show a desire to help businesses find compliant revenue models and the ICO clearly wants to work with the industry, not against it. This is why it plans to offer regulatory sandboxes and innovation advice, and to develop certification schemes to help businesses demonstrate compliance with data protection laws.

For organisations involved in online advertising or tracking, the message is clear: the ICO is increasing scrutiny, expanded monitoring, and making a determined push towards ensuring users have genuine control over how their data is collected, used, and shared online.  This applies whatever tracking technology is used.  Despite this, the ICO will not lose sight of the economic importance of digital advertising, and aims to help businesses comply with their privacy obligations.

              Highlights            



                        Stablecoins show promise for global payments but remain largely unused in everyday commerce due to user friction, regulatory hurdles and back-end complexity, especially in developed markets like the U.S.                      


                        Success may depend on making stablecoin use seamless and invisible to users, allowing traditional institutions to integrate them behind familiar interfaces while handling blockchain complexities in the background.                      


                        Emerging markets are leading adoption, with stablecoins already seen as more stable alternatives to local currencies and enabling efficient cross-border transactions through integrations with domestic payment systems like PIX, M-Pesa and GCash.                      

Outside of perhaps AI, few technologies have generated as much curiosity and confusion as stablecoins have within payments and commerce over the past 18 months.

Despite the hype, and their utility across non-U.S. payment landscapes, these digital assets, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to an allegedly stable mix of assets like U.S. treasuries, have yet to enter the mainstream of everyday commerce.

Try buying a Diet Coke from a vending machine with a stablecoin, for example, and you'll quickly hit a wall. Same with using it to pay for something like school tuition. But that hasn't stopped both the payments and crypto industries from working to build solutions that can help make stablecoins practical, scalable, and seamlessly integrated into real-world business flows.

“Stablecoins are a great way to transfer value,” Kirill Gertman, CEO of Conduit, told PYMNTS in an interview. “You can send USDC from here in New York to Singapore in seconds, and that's great. But the challenge happens when you actually need to use USDC or USDT for something.”

For financial institutions (FIs) and payment service providers (PSPs) that are no longer asking if they should engage with blockchain, but how best and most responsibly to do so, stablecoins likely top the list of interest.

But the journey from zero to crypto isn't plug and play. Institutions face steep learning curves around regulation, compliance and back-end complexity. With consumer trust and regulatory scrutiny on the line, the challenge is to build systems that deliver all the benefits of stablecoins without exposing end-users to the friction or opacity of the underlying blockchain.

The goal, after all, is not to turn everyone into a crypto user. The goal is to give them better payments.

For stablecoins to achieve mass adoption within mainstream financial services, user experience must be indistinguishable from today's digital money. This means hiding the complexity of blockchains from end-users and giving institutions tools to manage that complexity behind the scenes.

The most promising models do not require users to hold private keys, manage gas fees, or understand token standards. Instead, users interact with familiar interfaces such as mobile apps, dashboards, payment portals; all while the stablecoin machinery operates invisibly in the back end.

“We sell trust. We take your money and send it somewhere else. You need to trust us that it's going to land where we say it will,” Conduit's Gertman said.

His firm, which raised a $36 million Series A last week (May 28), aims to facilitate cross-border B2B and B2B2C flows by letting businesses move money globally using stablecoins as the liquidity rail.

“Our core focus is business-to-business payments,” Gertman said. “We have customers who have consumers, so we can go B2B2C. But we ourselves don't do B2C directly.”

Traditionally, cross-border B2B trade has leaned heavily on net-30, -60 or -90 payment terms. Buyers delay payments to optimize working capital. But Conduit is seeing this model shift.

“Customers are now saying, ‘I can pay you today. But can you give me a lower price?' And often, the answer from suppliers is yes,” Gertman said. “There are advantages in instant settlement. You don't need as much working capital. You're not exposed to FX gain/loss.”

The goal of stablecoins, at least in a cross-border context, is to connect the existing vibrant but siloed domestic payment ecosystems — PIX in Brazil, M-Pesa in Kenya, GCash in the Philippines — into a single global mesh.

While the U.S. consumer remains largely unfamiliar with stablecoins, the picture looks different elsewhere. In Kenya, Nigeria, Brazil and across Latin America, stablecoins are already popular and often seen as more reliable than local currencies.

“Imagine sending money from here to Uruguay,” Gertman said. “You open your Venmo, type in the amount, and your friend receives it via PIX in Brazil. You never leave your app. That's where we're going … The way to win in payments is to build a network.”

To get there, the backend may look complex — currency conversions, stablecoin burns, bank settlements. But to the user, it just works.

For FIs and PSPs, stablecoins can serve as on-ramps to more sophisticated digital finance use cases, ranging from real-time FX and supply chain finance to smart contract-based credit scoring.

Visa, for example, recently launched a pilot using stablecoins for treasury settlements between subsidiaries. The entire process is automated, fast and invisible to the end customer.

The crypto era once promised to disrupt traditional finance. Today, a more nuanced story is unfolding. Stablecoins are not replacing banks; they're upgrading them. For institutions that embrace this evolution, the potential is significant: faster settlements, broader reach and programmable financial products that operate at internet speed.

A private donor has offered the San Francisco Police Department a $9.4 million upgrade to its crime-fighting technology, and now it's up to the police commission to approve the proposed gift.

Crypto billionaire Chris Larsen, a tech executive and angel investor who helped develop Ripple software, says the donation is intended to benefit improve SFPD's technology and surveillance capabilities with license plate readers and drones.

A new location for the department's Real-Time Investigation Center also would be included at a vacant office at 315 Montgomery St., in the heart of the financial district. It's a space Ripple currently leases but is no longer using.

San Francisco police commissioners on Wednesday will debate whether or not to accept Larsen's gift. Larsen is a San Francisco native who also created and funded the SF Police Community Fund.

Mayor Daniel Lurie, who has helped raised almost $38 million in private funding for the city's future budget proposals, supports the improvements Larsen's proposed donation would make.

""RTIC has already supported hundreds of arrests, with crime down 30% citywide, and with this new facility, the SFPD will have the tools and the technology it needs to take this work to the next level and help our officers keep our street safe,"" Lurie said in a statement.

If the police commission approves the proposed gift, San Francisco supervisors would then have the final say.

Crypto exchange Rails has raised $14 million in a token sale to launch its trading platform combining self-custody and high-speed execution, the company said in a press release Wednesday.

The company raised $14 million in a token sale to investors in April this year, and $6 million in a seed round that closed in January 2024, the firm said.

Investors include Kraken, Slow Ventures, CMCC Global, Quantstamp and Round13 Capital, the company said.

Rails said it is designed to solve crypto's core trade-off: speed versus security. 

The platform enables users to retain custody of their assets while accessing performance traditionally reserved for centralized exchanges, Rails said.

“Our hybrid model delivers the best of both worlds,” co-founder and CEO Satraj Bambra, said in the release. “Users get the transparency of on-chain custody without giving up speed.""

Rails will support trading for major crypto assets, the company said, and will leverage zero-knowledge proofs and Merkle trees to validate trades securely. 

The platform will deploy exclusively on Kraken's layer-2 network, Ink, to boost transaction speed and reduce costs, the company said.

China-based Webus International (WETO) filed a Form 6-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday with plans to build a $300 million XRP-focused corporate treasury.

The filing follows an earlier May announcement by the firm, which aims to fund the initiative using loans and credit facilities rather than new share issuances.

Webus plans to integrate Ripple's payment network into its business, aiming to streamline cross-border payments and improve booking transparency across its global chauffeur services.

The announcement follows VivoPower International's plans to build a $121 million XRP treasury, indicative of growing interest from corporations in the fourth-largest token by market cap.

The financing plan is non-binding and subject to final agreements and due diligence.

The provider of customizable car and touring services for travelers worldwide added that it was renewing a partnership with Tongcheng Travel Holdings, one of China's largest online travel agencies, to extend their “Wetour x Tongcheng” charter lines, stating they would aim to use the XRP Ledger to settle cross-border rides and driver payouts.

XRP is up 2% in the past 24 hours, alongside muted gains in the broader crypto market. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq-listed firm's shares rose about 9% in early trading on Wednesday.

 Corporate Bitcoin buyers should brace for impact or abandon their strategy if they are unprepared for an 80% BTC price drop, Saifedean Ammous said. 

Key points:

Bitcoin is approaching its bull market top, and even corporate buyers may not survive the plunge, Saifedean Ammous warned.

BTC price action is still capable of an 80% drawdown, said the author of “The Bitcoin Standard.”

Bitcoin OGs are increasingly warning about the potential lack of attention given to bear markets.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching “very shaky ground” as it prepares its next blow-off top, celebrated author and educator Saifedean Ammous said.

Speaking on the Coin Stories podcast on June 3, “The Bitcoin Standard” author warned that the bull market was coming to an end.

Bitcoin has limited time before its next bear market despite institutional involvement and changing market structure, Ammous said.

Discussing phenomena such as institutional buyers and corporate treasuries, he stressed that regardless of market maturity, BTC/USD could still crash by up to 80% during its comedown from bull market peaks.

“I just hope my message out there to everybody in this business is, Bitcoin has done -70% and -80% before, and it can do it again,” he told Coin Stories host Natalie Brunell. 

Ammous explained that in prior price cycles, the long-term top appeared “between one year and 18 months” after the last block subsidy halving event.

While accepting that BTC/USD could still hit $200,000 or more this cycle, he acknowledged that current trough-to-peak gains sit at over 600%.

“Since the bottom, we're up from $15,000 to $109,000; that's not inconsiderable,” he continued. 

His comments come as more and more corporations choose to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets.

The trend has expanded outside the US, with Paris-based cryptocurrency company Blockchain Group acquiring another $68 million worth of Bitcoin this week to bring its total holdings to nearly 1,500 BTC.

Echoing Ammous, Bitcoin commentator Max Keiser shared doubts over the ability of industry newcomers to withstand the kind of price volatility common to all Bitcoin bear markets.

“The Strategy clones have not been tested in a bear market. Saylor never sold and just kept buying, even when his BTC position was underwater,” he wrote on X about the acquisition policy of Strategy, the firm with the world's largest Bitcoin treasury. 

BTC price forecasts, meanwhile, continue to vary, with $200,000 and higher still a popular target for 2025.

Metrics details

Ferrous iron (Fe2+) is essential in all eukaryotic cells for various oxidoreductase reactions, including the demethylation of DNA and proteins. Histone demethylation is required for normal epigenetic regulation of the Y-chromosomal sex-determining gene Sry in developing gonads during male sex determination1,2. Here we investigate the potential connection between iron metabolism, histone demethylation and sex determination in mammals. We found that Fe2+-producing pathways are substantially activated in mouse embryonic gonads during the sex-determining period. Chelation of iron in cultured XY gonads reduced the level of KDM3A-mediated H3K9 demethylation of Sry, mostly abolished Sry expression and caused the gonads to express ovarian markers. In vivo, conditional deletion of the gene Tfrc—which is required for iron incorporation—in fetal XY gonadal somatic cells, or acute pharmaceutical suppression of available iron in pregnant mice, resulted in male-to-female gonadal sex reversal in a proportion of offspring, highlighting the pivotal role of iron metabolism in male sex determination. Finally, long-term feeding of pregnant mice with a low-iron diet, when combined with a heterozygous variant of Kdm3a that by itself has no observable effect, suppressed Sry expression and caused male-to-female sex reversal in some of the progeny, revealing a connection between maternal dietary iron and fetal developmental outcomes.

a, Schematic representation for the isolation of NR5A1+ gonadal somatic cells. Gonadal somatic cells expressing the cell surface marker protein CD271, under the control of a CD271 transgene driven by the Nr5a1 promoter, were immunomagnetically isolated from gonad/mesonephros as described previously1. b, Gene-expression profiles of NR5A1+ and NR5A1− cells examined by quantitative mRNA expression analysis. Schematic illustration of mitochondrial iron metabolism (left). Slc25a37/MFRN1 and Slc25a28/MFRN2 import Fe2+ from the intermembrane space of the mitochondria. Flvcr1 gene encodes FLVCR1A and FLVCR1B. FLVCR1B, locales in the mitochondria, regulates haem export into the cytosol. Ftmt/FTMT catalyses the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ and stores iron. NR5A1+ and NR5A1− cells were separated from XY gonad/mesonephros at E11.5, and then applied into quantitative mRNA expression analysis. Expression profiles of Slc25a37, Slc25a28, Flvcr1, and Ftmt are shown on the right. Numbers of embryos examined are shown above the bars. Data are presented as mean ± s.d. All differences between means with P < 0.01 are indicated; two-tailed paired t-tests. c, Box-and-whisker plot showing expression (log-normalized counts) of Nr5a1, Kdm3a, Sry, Tfrc, Scara5, Slc11a2, Steap3, Ncoa4, Hmox1, Slc40a1, and Heph of XX or XY gonads in annotated cell populations. The populations were Coelomic epithelial cells, Endothelial cells, Germ cells, Mesonephric mesenchymal cells, Mesonephric tubules, pre-Supporting cells, and Supporting-like cells. Data were extracted from scRNA-seq analysis of XX or XY embryos at E11.5 (GEO: GSE184708). Numbers of cells examined are shown in the legend. Boxes encompass the interquartiles (25th–75th percentiles), The horizontal lines are medians, dots are outliers, and range bars show the maximum and minimum values excluding outliers. d, Comparison of expression levels of KDM3A, SRY, and iron-metabolism genes in human XY NR5A1+ and NR5A1− cells. Data were extracted from scRNA-seq analysis of human embryonic stages at 6, 7, 8, and 12 weeks post-fertilization (GEO: GSE143356). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01; Wilcoxon rank sum test. The embryonic stages from 6 to 8 weeks post-fertilization are highlighted as the sex-determining period.

Metrics details

Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is the most common somatic alteration in men and is associated with higher mortality from epithelial cancers1,2,3. In tumours, epithelial LOY is also associated with poor survival4,5,6,7. This raises several fundamental questions, such as why LOY in PBMCs drives cancer mortality and whether there is a relationship between LOY in PBMCs, PBMC-derived immune cells and cancer cells (and, if so, what its consequences are). We sought to answer these questions through a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data from 29 human tumour types, along with autochthonous and syngeneic mouse models. In human and mouse tumours, malignant epithelial cells had the highest LOY prevalence, yet LOY was also present in tumour stromal and immune cells, with LOY in malignant epithelial cells predicting LOY in benign cells. LOY also correlated between paired tumour and PBMC samples from patients. Among benign cells, LOY induced the strongest shift in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with both showing transcriptomic signatures of immunosuppression. Furthermore, the magnitude of LOY in epithelial cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells independently predicts survival, with tumours exhibiting concurrent epithelial and T cell LOY having the worst outcomes. Here we establish a model that links LOY in immune cells to LOY in malignant cells, which may explain in part why LOY in PBMCs is associated with increased cancer mortality.

LOY in tumour cells is associated with poor prognosis4,5,6. This was found to be partially due to immune evasion from T cell exhaustion in some tumour types7. LOY in PBMCs is the most common somatic alteration in healthy men and has been associated with increased risk8,9 and mortality from cancer1,2,3. As PBMCs consist of immune cells including lymphocytes (T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells), monocytes and dendritic cells10, these data raise the question of whether LOY in PBMCs, PBMC-derived tumour immune cells and malignant cells are related, and whether this relationship drives increased cancer mortality.

Here we address this question through a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of the genomic, histopathological, biological and clinical consequences of LOY in benign and malignant cells, using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from human tumour types. Further, to gain additional insights that are difficult to obtain from human data and to generalize our findings, we also examine numerous data types from autochthonous, syngeneic and human xenograft models of cancer in mice.

Our data show that a substantial proportion of non-malignant cells, including both immune and non-immune cell subtypes in the tumour microenvironment (TME), have LOY. The presence of LOY in non-malignant cells is associated strongly with malignant epithelial cell LOY in human data and in mouse models. Furthermore, the proportion of LOY in PBMCs is correlated with that in immune cells and malignant cells in the TME. When present in benign cells, LOY induces the strongest phenotypic shift in CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, with both cell types showing signs of immunosuppression. Clinically, the prognosis of patients with LOY epithelial tumours deteriorated further when LOY CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were present in the TME, with tumour cells and T cells independently affecting prognosis.

Together, these findings document a relationship between LOY in PBMCs and in non-malignant and malignant cells in the TME. We also show that LOY in T cells in the TME can affect cancer mortality in patients. Given the prevalence of LOY in healthy older men, these findings may also have implications for tumour-infiltrating T cell (TIL) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies. More broadly, they lay the conceptual foundation for an experimentally tractable model that may explain in part why men with LOY in PBMCs are at higher risk for cancer death.

To investigate the impact of LOY at a pan-cancer level, we developed a ‘Y chromosome transcriptional signature' (YchrS) that predicts DNA-based LOY classification (LOY/Y− (LOYDNA) versus wild type/Y+ (WTYDNA))5. Differential analysis of Y chromosome genes between LOYDNA and WTYDNA tumours from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with available exome capture data identified 26 genes with lower expression in LOYDNA tumours, which we then filtered further using the Human Protein Atlas to focus on nine genes (DDX3Y, UTY, KDM5D, USP9Y, ZFY, RPS4Y1, TMSB4Y, EIF1AY and NLGN4Y) that are expressed stably at both the RNA and protein levels across several male tissues11 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a).

Mean YchrS scores are anticorrelated with LOYDNA frequency across cancer types, and, compared with a signature including all Y chromosome genes (YwholeS), YchrS was more predictive of LOYDNA (area under the curve (AUC)) 0.98 versus 0.90; P < 0.01; Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 1b). We further validated the YchrS signature using data from 778 male cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), integrating YchrS with copy number alteration (CNA) data from whole-exome sequencing (WES). Cell lines were classified into LOYBR (LOY identified using bulk RNA-seq evaluation) and WTYBR (WTY chromosome identified using bulk RNA-seq evaluation) groups based on the mean YchrS value. Examining CNAs, we found LOYBR cell lines have extremely low average Y chromosome-specific CNAs compared with WTYBR lines, indicating there was prominent LOY in the former group (Extended Data Fig. 1c–e).

Next, we used TCGA data to examine whether YchrS was associated with any specific clinical characteristics (Supplementary Table 1). Patient age is correlated inversely with YchrS (Fig. 1d), and we also found significant racial differences in the degree of tumour LOY, with Black/African American patients having the lowest YchrS (Fig. 1e). There is also an inverse association between YchrS and smoking: in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) and kidney chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (KICH), patients who have never smoked exhibit significantly higher YchrS scores than current or former smokers (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive patients with HNSC have higher YchrS scores than HPV-negative patients (Fig. 1f), but no association is observed between YchrS and hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), or between YchrS and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD; Extended Data Fig. 2b). We found a strong negative correlation between the YchrS and cancer-testis antigen (CTA) signatures (Fig. 1g)—proteins that are normally restricted to germ cells but often overexpressed in cancers and linked to worse survival12.

We noted that the YchrS distribution appeared to be bimodal and that the mean served as a better separator of the two peaks while also performing better than the median in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with the mean falling closer to the top-left corner (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Given this, we next investigated whether mean YchrS could stratify patient outcomes. Indeed, patients with LOYBR have worse outcomes, including poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1h and Supplementary Table 2). When analysing TCGA data, we found that the YchrS signature effectively stratifies pan-cancer survival outcomes in white and Asian patients (Extended Data Fig. 2e). However, this stratification was not significant in Black patients (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Similarly, at the genetic ancestry13,14 level, the YchrS signature stratifies pan-cancer survival in European, African-admixed and East Asian patients, but not in African patients (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Moreover, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis found that the WTYBR/LOYBR classification is independent from genetic ancestry, self-reported race and tumour type in predicting OS, suggesting that it has a foundational role in cancer outcomes (Extended Data Table 1). Finally, we also found that higher expression of each of the nine YchrS genes predicted better OS and DSS in TCGA data (Extended Data Fig. 2g,h).

To investigate why men with tumour LOY have worse survival1,4,5,7, we examined genomic and transcriptional signatures in TCGA tumours based on their LOYBR classification (Supplementary Table 3). Tumour mutation burden (TMB) and tumour neoantigen burden (TNB) are associated with worse survival without immunotherapy but better immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response15,16,17,18. We found that LOYBR tumours have elevated TMB and TNB at both the small insertion/deletion mutation (Indel) and single nucleotide variant (SNV) levels, as well as higher mutation rates (both non-silent and silent mutations; Extended Data Fig. 3a). YchrS scores are also correlated inversely with aneuploidy and ‘fraction altered' across several cancers (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Moreover, homologous recombination defects (HRD, including in HRD score19, loss of heterozygosity (LOH)20, large-scale state transitions21 and telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI)22) are higher in LOYBR tumours (Extended Data Fig. 3c). LOYBR tumours also have higher signature scores for homologous recombination, mismatch repair, DNA damage response and DNA repair.

In terms of phenotype, LOYBR tumours have higher stemness signature scores, encompassing DNA methylation-based stemness, epigenetically regulated DNA methylation-based stemness, differentially methylated probe-based stemness and enhancer element methylation-based stemness23 (Extended Data Fig. 3d). LOYBR tumours also have higher signature scores for proliferation and activation of proliferation-related pathways, including DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, mitotic spindle, KRAS signalling, G2M checkpoint, E2F targets and apoptosis. They also have higher scores for oncogenesis-related pathways such as MYC, MTORC1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT; Extended Data Fig. 3d). However, on the basis of gene expression, they demonstrate decreased activity of the Hedgehog signalling pathway.

Beyond the pathways listed above, LOYBR tumours have elevated angiogenesis, glycolysis and hypoxia pathway scores, suggesting a distinct TME (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). Furthermore, they display diminished androgen response and elevated oestrogen response scores (Extended Data Fig. 3g). Finally, LOYBR tumours have increased expression of immune checkpoints and co-inhibitory genes such as CTLA4, PDCD1, TIGIT, LAG3, CD27, IL2RA, HAVCR2, CD40, CD274 and PDCD1LG2 (Extended Data Fig. 3h), indicating they have an immunosuppressive TME.

To study the implications of LOY at the cell-type level, we consolidated scRNA-seq data from 17 epithelial cancer types (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 4a–d and Supplementary Table 4). Because we found that YchrS often misclassified low-RNA-count cells as having LOY, we developed a machine-learning model to predict single-cell-level LOY or WT status in scRNA-seq data (LOYSCR and WTYSCR), by training a Random Forest model to predict male versus female cells from adjacent normal scRNA-seq samples using expression levels of the nine YchrS genes (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). When the model was used to classify male tumour cells, those predicted to have LOY had minimal expression of Y chromosome genes, but had normal overall sequencing counts, and had normal expression of genes not known to be affected by LOY such as GAPDH, Y gene paralogues on the X chromosome and genes located on other chromosomes (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 5d–f). To further validate model accuracy, we analysed a colorectal cancer (CRC) dataset24 comprised of 23 tumours with paired WES, bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. Here we found a strong positive correlation between average Y chromosome CNA (WES) and YchrS scores (bulk RNA), and negative correlations between LOYSCR cell proportions and the former two measures (Extended Data Fig. 5g).

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that epithelial cells (Fig. 2d) with LOYSCR downregulate pathways associated with immune recognition (major histocompatibility complex (MHC)), aerobic energy metabolism (regulation of aerobic respiration, aerobic electron transport chain, mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport, ATP synthesis coupled electron transport) and pathways related to protein synthesis (ribosomal large subunit biogenesis, cytoplasmic translation; Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 5). LOYSCR epithelial cells also upregulate pathways associated with glycolysis (glycolytic process through fructose-6-phosphate and glucose catabolic process) and hypoxia, altogether indicating a metabolic shift consistent with tumorigenesis and progression25,26 (Fig. 2f). Finally, LOYSCR epithelial cells also have lowered expression of specific MHC class I and MHC class II genes (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 6a), indicating that these cells may have immune evasion capabilities27,28.

In terms of oncogenic pathway signature expression, LOYSCR epithelial cells have elevated KRAS, MYC, RAS, TGFβ and oestrogen response activity (Extended Data Fig. 6b). They also display upregulation of proliferation-related pathways, such as the cell cycle, DNA replication, mitotic spindle formation and the G2M checkpoint (Fig. 2h). As for genomic instability, LOYSCR epithelial cells express high levels of signatures corresponding to repair of double-strand breaks (DSB) through homologous recombination, non-homologous end joining and the p53 pathway (Fig. 2i). A signature of repair of single-strand breaks (SSB) via mismatch repair was also increased, while base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair pathways show less pronounced changes. Inferred copy number variation (inferCNV) analysis also indicated elevated CNAs in LOYSCR epithelial cells, particularly those from bladder cancers (BLCA) and cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d).

To develop a mouse model to study LOY mechanistically, we performed RNA-seq on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-isolated CD45− cells from tumours generated by subcutaneous injection of CRISPR induced Y-KO (confirmed by WES to have lost the Y chromosome) (Extended Data Fig. 7a) or control cells that were infected with a scrambled CRISPR guide (Y-Scr). Excluding Y-linked genes to prevent bias, we identified LOY-associated changes through differential expression analysis (Supplementary Table 6). A LOY phenotype score, calculated by comparing scaled signature scores of genes that were upregulated or downregulated between Y-KO and Y-Scr CD45− tumour fractions, was higher in LOYBR BLCA samples than in WTYBR BLCA samples in the TCGA (Extended Data Fig. 7b), confirming the relevance of our mouse model findings. The LOY signature was also higher in LOYBR tumours from other cancer types (Extended Data Fig. 7c).

To study the genes altered in LOY cancer cells, we used in vitro7 RNA-seq data on MB49 cells with CRISPR–Cas9-mediated selective elimination of the Y chromosome (Y-KO). GSEA pathway enrichment analysis of the Y-KO and Y-Scr in vitro RNA-seq data indicated that the former cells have increased genomic instability (DSB repair) and cell cycle regulation and reduced antigen presentation (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 7d,e) compared with Y-Scr cells. Specifically, key DNA repair genes are overexpressed in Y-KO cells (Fig. 2k), including Brca1 (homologous recombination for DSB repair), Atm (DSB repair), Msh2 (mismatch repair) and Tert (DNA repair and telomere maintenance). Genes that regulate chromosome segregation, such as Bub1b, Aurkb, Ccnb1 and Plk1, are also upregulated in Y-KO cells. Furthermore, cell cycle regulation-related genes (Cdk2, Ccna2, Ccnb1, Ccnd1, Mki67) show upregulation, whereas antigen-presentation genes (H2-D1, B2m) show downregulation (Fig. 2k). Finally, WES revealed higher numbers of large-scale chromosomal alterations in Y-KO cells. These include unique single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels, which appear preferentially enriched in intronic and intergenic regions, suggesting that LOY may predispose cells to widespread genomic alterations rather than targeting specific genomic loci (Extended Data Fig. 7f–h).

In studying LOYSCR cell percentages in human scRNA-seq data, we noticed that, whereas LOYSCR frequency is the highest in epithelial cells, other cell types also show significant LOYSCR (Fig. 3a; top). This finding was supported when we examined a signature (YchrSmus) representing Y mouse chromosome genes (Ddx3y, Uty, Kdm5d and Usp9y) in scRNA-seq data from autochthonous mouse bladder tumours generated with the N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) carcinogen protocol29,30 (Fig.3a (bottom) and Extended Data Fig. 8a–d). To determine whether there was a relationship between epithelial LOY and the prevalence of LOY in non-epithelial cells in the same tumour, we measured correlations of LOYSCR cell proportions between different cell types. Including all tumour types in our human scRNA-seq dataset, we found that the rates of LOYSCR in any one cell type are highly predictive of LOYSCR rates in other cells (Fig. 3b).

Source Data

We also used the inferCNV algorithm on the human scRNA-seq data to assess whether non-malignant cells in the TME, particularly macrophages, display tumour-like copy number variation (CNV) signatures, which could indicate the presence of ambient or phagocytosed nucleic acids from malignant cells. Epithelial cells displayed elevated CNV scores, confirming their distinct genomic profiles, whereas all examined immune cell types, including macrophages, CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells, showed minimal CNV signals (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f). These findings suggest that the LOY signals of benign cells are unlikely to be the result of debris from malignant cells. This also indicates that the YchrS scores used in the survival curves above (Fig. 1h) and DNA-based LOY evaluations5 used to assess malignant cell LOY may reflect the overall LOY levels from a variety of cell types within the TME and not just cancer cells.

Next, we analysed orthogonal datasets to test for evidence of LOY in benign cells. scRNA-seq data on mouse BLCA (MB49) LOY tumours and normal bladder samples from male and female C57BL/6N mice as controls31 revealed that benign cell types within LOY tumours display higher LOY levels compared with normal bladders (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Furthermore, scRNA-seq or single-nucleus RNA sequencing of CD45+ and CD45− sorted mouse hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumour populations indicate that LOY is present in both malignant cells and immune cells whose sequencing libraries were prepared separately from the malignant cell fraction (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c). We also analysed available human scRNA-seq data from CD45-based FACS-sorted HNSC32, CHOL33 and BLCA34 samples (Supplementary Table 7), which revealed that the CD45+ (immune) populations exhibit LOY (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Notably, we also observed a positive correlation between LOY proportions in CD45− and CD45+ cells from the same patients in these data (Extended Data Fig. 9e). scRNA-seq data from a CRC xenograft model35, in which human LOY CRC cells were subcutaneously injected into immunocompromised mice, also displayed higher LOY levels in benign mouse cells in the TME compared with corresponding cells from normal male mouse tissues (Extended Data Fig. 9f). Further, on intact tissue sections, we combined a clinical grade fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay used for prenatal sex determination with CD45 immunohistochemistry (IHC) to examine LOY in 33 BLCA specimens and found that both CD45− and CD45+ cells in cancer samples exhibit LOY (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 9g).

As a final validation that stromal and immune cells in the TME display LOY, and to better investigate whether malignant cell LOY promotes LOY in benign populations, we injected lineage-related Y+ and LOY MB49 mouse BLCA cells subcutaneously into C57Bl/6N mice. We used three models for this experiment: (1) naturally occurring Y+ and LOY cells7; (2) a LOY clonal line; and (3) CRISPR Y-KO and CRISPR Y-Scr cells7. For each model, the DNA levels of four Y chromosome genes (Kdm5d, Uty, Eif2s3y and Ddx3y) were assessed, before subcutaneous injection of the cells into immune-competent mice (Fig. 3d). After formation, tumours were then disrupted mechanically, and cells separated on the basis of surface CD45 expression using double selection by magnetic beads and FACS (Supplementary Fig. 1). As the genetically engineered Y-KO and Y-Scr lines co-express a TdTomato fluorescent marker and the Cas9 gene, we also sorted these cells by TdTomato expression to minimize epithelial cell contamination in the immune cell fractions. We then used DNA qPCR to detect the Cas9 gene in each sorted population, confirming the purity of the different compartments (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). As expected, only the TdTomato+ epithelial cells showed a high copy number of Cas9, whereas the immune compartments exhibited negligible Cas9 levels, indicating successful separation (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Next, the four Y chromosome genes used to validate LOY above were analysed via DNA qPCR to assess their presence in CD45+ immune and CD45− non-immune cell populations. There were lower DNA levels of Y chromosome genes in the CD45+ cells from tumours generated by LOY MB49 cells compared with those generated with Y+ lines (Fig. 3e,f). Furthermore, when this experiment was repeated with a sorting strategy that allowed T cell LOY to be examined specifically (CD45+CD11b−B220−CD3+TCRb+), we found that infiltrating CD3+TCRb+ T cells in Y-KO tumours had increased LOY compared with those from Y-Scr tumours (Extended Data Fig. 10c). However, no evidence of LOY was found in PBMCs from mice bearing Y+ or LOY tumours (Fig. 3g).

Given the incidence of LOY in PBMCs and its relationship to increased cancer mortality1, other key questions remain, such as how LOY levels in human PBMCs compare with those in tumour-infiltrating immune cells. If the latter exhibit higher LOY levels than PBMCs, that would suggest either preferential accumulation of PBMCs with LOY into tumours or tumour-induced LOY in Y+ PBMCs that have infiltrated the tumour. To begin answering this question, we examined a dataset from patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC)36 that included tumour and PBMC samples from the same patients. Our analysis indicated that T cells and myeloid cells in tumours exhibit significantly higher LOY proportions than their matched PBMC counterparts (Fig. 4a). In both the above and one additional HNSC dataset37,38 on CD45-sorted tumour cells and matched PBMCs, we confirmed that LOY proportions were correlated in the tumour and blood (Fig. 4b–d). We also analysed specific immune cell subtypes and found that tumour immune cells, especially T and B cells, had significantly higher LOY proportions than PBMCs (Fig. 4e). To put the mouse data in context, PBMCs from mice treated with the BBN protocol showed no evidence of LOY (Extended Data Fig. 10d).

B, blood sample; T, tumour sample.

To examine the molecular profiles associated with LOY in non-epithelial cell populations in the TME, we conducted a cell-type-specific differential expression and pathway analysis (Fig. 5a–e and Supplementary Table 8). GSEA using the Gene Ontology database (https://www.geneontology.org/) found that LOY has the greatest impact on CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Fig. 5a). LOYSCR CD4+ T cells have elevated expression of several immune checkpoint and co-stimulatory molecules (for example, IL2RA, HAVCR2, ICOS, TNFRSF9, TNFRSF4, CTLA4 and TIGIT (Fig. 5b)) as well as increased expression of signatures of exhaustion and the T regulatory (Treg) cell phenotype (Fig. 5c), while displaying lower expression of CD4+ T cell specific signatures of naive and T cell receptor (TCR) signalling. Conversely, LOYSCR CD8+ T cells show reduced expression of HAVCR2, BTLA, TNFRSF9, LAG3, CTLA4, PDCD1, TIGIT, ITGB2 and TOX, as well as signatures of cytotoxicity, TCR signalling and exhaustion (Fig. 5d,e). LOYSCR CD8+ T cells also increase expression of a naive CD8+ T cell signature, indicating these cells are not contributing to an active anti-tumour immune reaction.

Example: TCGA-02-2483 (43-year-old, high LOYSCR epithelial/CD8+ score, low CD4+ score) with a total score of 223, predicting 15% (less than 2 years), 28.6% (less than 5 years) and 39.1% (less than 8 years) mortality risk.

To further explore the relationship between T cell LOY and T cell exhaustion, we conducted in vitro experiments in which mouse primary T cells were subjected to prolonged activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 coated plates over a 3-week period. Although LOY was not observed in T cells after extended culture and stimulation, markers of exhaustion such as Pdcd1, Tim3 and Ctla4 were induced, whereas the naive T cell marker Tcf7 was reduced as expected (Extended Data Fig. 10e–g). This indicates that chronic activation in vitro alone does not drive LOY in T cells. In addition, we also analysed publicly available transcriptomic datasets from Giles et al.39, in which gp33-specific CD8+ T cells from TCR-transgenic mice were subjected to acute (LCMV Armstrong) and chronic (LCMV Clone 13) LCMV infections. Over the course of the infection, T cells in the chronic model exhibited upregulation of canonical exhaustion markers such as Tox, Pdcd1 and Ctla4 and downregulation of Tcf7 (Extended Data Fig. 10h). As in the previous experiment, expression levels of Y-linked genes (Uty, Kdm5d, Ddx3y, Usp9y) remained unchanged in exhausted T cells compared with their non-exhausted counterparts, indicating that chronic activation alone does not drive LOY in T cells (Extended Data Fig. 10i).

Given that CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells are the benign TME cells most affected by LOY (Fig. 5a), we further examined their role in patient prognosis and whether combined loss of the Y chromosome in epithelial cells and in these immune cell types may have clinical implications. To this end, we developed cell-type-specific LOYSCR and WTYSCR gene signatures and conducted Kaplan–Meier survival analysis using TCGA data (Supplementary Table 9). This analysis suggests that LOYSCR CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and epithelial cells are associated with patient survival outcomes, including OS and DSS (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 11a). Specifically, LOYSCR epithelial cell, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell signature expression levels emerged as risk factors, whereas WTYSCR epithelial cell, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell signature expression levels were identified as protective. Moreover, patients with high predicted levels of LOY epithelial cells in conjunction with elevated predicted levels of LOY CD4+ T or CD8+ T cells have the poorest survival outcomes, whereas those with low predicted levels of LOY epithelial and T cells show the most favourable survival (Fig. 5g).

To validate the findings above, we analysed a publicly available liver cancer scRNA-seq dataset that includes 94 male patients with matched survival data40. By calculating the proportions of LOYSCR epithelial, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in each sample and correlating these proportions with long-term outcomes, we find patients with co-existent high proportions of LOYSCR in epithelial cells and in CD8+ or CD4+ T cells have the worst survival outcomes compared with patients with co-existent low proportions of LOYSCR in all cell types (Extended Data Fig. 11b,c). Patients with co-existent high epithelial and CD8+ T cell LOYSCR show worse outcomes than patients with high epithelial cell LOYSCR alone. This pattern was consistent with our bulk pan-cancer RNA-seq findings, reinforcing the link between LOYSCR epithelial and T cells and poor patient prognosis in cancer (Extended Data Fig. 11b,c).

We next conducted a multivariate Cox analysis to determine whether the LOYSCR epithelial, LOYSCR CD8+ T cell, and LOYSCR CD4+ T cell signatures independently contribute to patient outcomes. Owing to the unavailability of tumour stage, smoking and race-related data for certain cancer types, and recognizing the previously published correlation between age and LOY, only age was included in our analysis. As the LOYSCR epithelial signature shows non-linearity, we categorized patients into low or high LOYSCR epithelial, CD8+ T cell or CD4+ T cell signature groups, based on corresponding cut-offs determined from the Kaplan–Meier plot analysis above (Fig. 5f), where we observed that all variables are independent risk factors for poor OS (Extended Data Table 2).

Finally, we constructed a nomogram that incorporates age, as well as LOYSCR signature scores for epithelial, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to provide ‘proof of principle' for a potentially clinically beneficial tool that could forecast survival rates among patients with cancer (Fig. 5h). Each patient is assigned a score corresponding to each prognostic parameter, wherein a higher total score indicated a poorer prognosis for the patient. The nomogram offers three distinct probability scales for predicting mortality, in less than 2 years, 5 years or 8 years. Additionally, calibration plots demonstrated that the performance of the nomogram closely resembles that of an ideal model (Extended Data Fig. 11d).

LOY in a portion of PBMCs is associated with increased risk of death from many cancer types1,2,3. This is particularly interesting because PBMCs comprise key immune cells such as T cells and B cells, monocytes/macrophages, NK cells and others that form part of the TME10. Several possible models could explain how this happens. For example, LOY in PBMCs may be a marker of genome damage due to environment (smoking, carcinogens and so on) or aging41, with such damage driving both LOY and tumour progression in the malignant cells. This latter notion is supported by the finding that LOY in tumours is associated with poor prognosis4,5,6,7. It is also possible that LOY in PBMCs, and thus in key immune cells, may cause these cells to be less competent in restricting tumour growth. There is a paucity of evidence to support any of these models. Our study extends previous findings that LOY contributes to immune evasion, tumour growth and poorer survival in BLCA1,5,7 to a pan-cancer context. Our WES findings revealed that LOY cells harbour a higher burden of large-scale chromosomal alterations compared with WTY cells. This observation supports a model in which LOY could impair genomic maintenance systems, leading to a ‘vicious cycle' of escalating chromosomal aberrations.

Our work found significant LOY in benign cells in the TME and that the prevalence of LOY in malignant epithelial cells is predictive of LOY in other cell types within the same tumour. Speculatively, if LOY tumour cells express specific chemokines, cytokines or adhesion molecules that preferentially attract LOY immune cells, this would explain how a relatively small percentage of PBMCs with LOY can have an impact on cancer death1,2,3. We also show evidence for another possible mechanism to explain this correlation, namely the ability of LOY epithelial cells to induce LOY in benign cells, including T cells. One mechanism underlying such a phenomenon could involve tumour-derived extracellular vehicles42 containing pro-inflammatory or genome-altering cargo transferred from LOY cancer cells that stimulate molecular changes leading to LOY in neighbouring benign cells. Notably, the ‘preferential attraction' and ‘induction' models are not mutually exclusive and could be operating in the same tumour.

One consequence of LOY in T cells is a prominent increase in the Treg signature in CD4+ T cells. Treg cells are characterized by their immunosuppressive properties43. Our analysis also revealed that LOY CD8+ T cells exhibit decreased activation, TCR-signalling and cytotoxicity signatures, indicating reduced contribution to an immune response. These findings allow us to posit a speculative model in whichk tumours with high LOY are more aggressive owing to increased levels of dysfunctional LOY T cells and enrichment of LOY Treg cells. Finding LOY in T cells has also potentially important implications for TIL and CAR-T cell therapy in patients with cancer44,45. Given the features of LOY CD8+ T cells compared with those without this change, enrichment or selection of cells for such engineering without knowing their Y chromosome status may lead to variable clinical efficacy and confound clinical trial outcomes. This caveat would be particularly relevant in tumours with high levels of epithelial LOY, which have a proportionately high T cell LOY. This possible dual role of LOY, driving both genomic instability in tumour cells and functional exhaustion in immune cells, provides a plausible explanation for its association with shortened survival.

Our study has several limitations. There is an absence of relevant scRNA-seq data for certain tumour types, primarily because of incomplete gender information or quality control issues. Related to this, we were able to identify only one scRNA-seq dataset in which there were enough male patients with long-term follow up to allow analysis of the consequences of combinatorial LOY in epithelial and T cell compartments. Thus, we had to use bulk RNA-seq deconvolution based on cell-type-specific signatures of LOY to perform this analysis in a pan-cancer manner. Also, the nomogram that was developed here needs thorough validation on additional datasets and in specific tumour types. Although our RNA-seq analyses reveal significant changes in gene expression and pathway enrichment, it is important to recognize that these findings are correlative. Functional assays are essential to establish causative relationships between LOY and the observed biological processes. Laboratory experiments are also needed to substantiate the observed associations, particularly concerning the mechanisms by which interactions between epithelial cancer cells with LOY and benign cells in the TME lead to LOY in the latter.

In summary, our research lays a new conceptual framework that will serve to accelerate the nascent field of Y chromosome-focused cancer research. These results provide new insights such as showing the profound impact of epithelial LOY on reshaping the TME, the prevalence of LOY in various benign cell types in a tumour, the ability of LOY epithelial cells to promote LOY in benign cells (including T cells) and the consequences of LOY in benign cells. Finally, our study provides evidence that LOY in both epithelial and non-epithelial cells are independent prognostic markers of outcomes, demonstrating the impact of multicellular LOY in cancer.

In this study, we used bulk RNA-seq, WES somatic mutation data, and clinical data (Supplementary Table 1) sourced from TCGA project (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). The data matrices obtained from UCSC Xena (https://xena.ucsc.edu/) have been standardized, normalized and corrected for batch effects and platform differences. Additionally, mutation data generated by the PanCancer Atlas consortium (https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas) were incorporated. A total of 29 tumour types and 4,127 male participants were included in our analysis. Survival outcome metrics, including OS, OS time, DSS and DSS time were calculated as in Liu et al.46 (Supplementary Table 2).

We used the DESeq2 R package (v.1.42.1) to uncover Y chromosome gene expression differences between LOYDNA and WTYDNA47. Differentially expressed genes were called on the basis of a log2FC cut-off of −1 and a −log10-adjusted P value cut-off of 200. This gene set resulted in the LOY prediction signature. Subsequently, we conducted a gene set intersection analysis with a gene set in the male-specific region of the Y chromosome seen expressed across 24 human tissues. This analysis required that genes exceeded 0.1 reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped per tissue or that they had presence in IHC data from the Human Protein Atlas RNA-seq11. This approach identified nine signature genes making up our Y chromosome signature (YchrS): DDX3Y, UTY, KDM5D, USP9Y, ZFY, RPS4Y1, TMSB4Y, EIF1AY and NLGN4Y. Based on single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA)48 conducted with the GSVA49 R package (v.1.44.5), we observed that patients with low levels of YchrS exhibited characteristics similar to those of people with LOYDNA, whereas those with high YchrS levels resembled people with an intact Y chromosome (WTYDNA). We partitioned all patients into low YchrS group (LOYBR) and high YchrS group (WTYBR) with a mean value cut-off. Additionally, a similar approach was applied to analyse the Ywhole signature (YwholeS), using a signature comprising all Y chromosome genes.

To validate the nine-gene Ychr Signature (YchrS), we downloaded the batch-corrected transcriptomic data and corresponding CNA data for 778 male cancer cell lines from the CCLE project (https://depmap.org/portal/ccle/). YchrS was calculated by the same method as for TCGA data. Cell lines with a YchrS lower than the mean value were categorized as LOYBR, otherwise they were called WTYBR. Average CNA for chromosome i in each cell line was calculated using the following formula to evaluate its integrity:

n is the total number of segments in chromosome i.

Consensus ancestry for TCGA cases was obtained from ref. 14, determined by combining ancestry inference from five independent classification methods using SNP array and/or WES data. Only ancestries with more than 50 patients were included in the survival analysis, which spanned 3,893 patients: European (n = 3,319), East Asian (n = 286), African (n = 190) and African-admixed (n = 98).

Aneuploidy scores for TCGA cases were obtained from ref. 50. Arm-level statistics were calculated using the GISTIC (v.2.0)51 copy number significance software. These scores were derived by tallying the total number of amplified or deleted arms, collectively termed ‘altered'. Samples were initially categorized by tumour type, alteration type (amplification or deletion) and chromosome arm. Subsequently, samples were clustered on the basis of specific arm attributes, and arms were classified as altered if part of a cluster had a mean fraction altered of at least 80%. Intratumour heterogeneity used to generate DNA damage scores was determined by ABSOLUTE52. ABSOLUTE analysed segmentation data from Affymetrix SNP6.0 arrays and variant calls from the MC3 variant file.

We used two measures to assess HRD. The first was derived by Knijnenburg et al.53 and quantifies HRD by aggregating separate metrics of genomic scarring: large (more than 15 Mb) non-arm-level regions with LOH20, large-scale state transitions (breaks between adjacent segments of greater than 10 Mb, LST21 and subtelomeric regions with allelic imbalance. The second measure, introduced by Telli et al.19, incorporates LOH and TAI22. The HRD score for samples analysed via custom hybridization sequencing assay were computed using reads covering SNP positions54. The HRD score was determined as the unweighted sum of LOH, TAI and LST, represented as: HRD score = LOH + TAI + LST.

We screened samples using mRNA and DNA methylation profiles to compute four stemness scores: DNA methylation-based stemness score, epigenetically regulated DNA methylation-based stemness score, differentially methylated probe-based stemness score and enhancer elements/DNA methylation-based stemness score as outlined in previous studies23.

Two methodologies were used to identify potential neoantigens arising from SNVs and Indels. For SNVs, somatic nonsynonymous coding SNVs were identified and minimal peptides encompassing mutation sites were extracted, followed by prediction of binding to autologous MHC using NetMHCpan v.3.0 (ref. 55). On the other hand, Indel variants meeting specific criteria were extracted, and downstream protein sequences obtained to generate nine-mer peptides. These peptides were then evaluated for their ability to bind MHC molecules using the pVAC-Seq v.4.0.8 pipeline56, also using NetMHCpan v.3.0. The mutation data, specifically encompassing missense mutations and nonsense mutations, were obtained from the PanCancer Atlas consortium and used in this analysis. The dataset (https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas) underwent filtering, requiring mutation calls to be generated by two or more mutation callers (NCALLERS > 1).

To study the consequences of LOY, a literature review was performed, and a variety of tumour-associated signatures gathered (Supplementary Table 3)57,58,59,60,61,62. Each signature was assessed using ssGSEA implemented through the GSVA R package49 (v.1.44.5). Scoring methods are in the figure legends. Where information is not provided in the figure legends, the methodologies were documented in the respective citations.

To validate the CRISPR–Cas9-mediated Y-KO MB49 (Y-KO)-derived gene expression signature in human BLCA data, we first performed a differential expression analysis between the Y-KO and Y-Scr groups, which identified a robust set of upregulated and downregulated genes. We then calculated a Y phenotype score by dividing the signature scores of upregulated genes by those of downregulated genes, with all values scaled to the [0,1] interval.

For pan-cancer scRNA-seq data, transcriptome data of 346 samples from 251 people across 20 scRNA-seq datasets were obtained from public studies63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82, from which tumour samples were selected for later analysis. Accession numbers for each scRNA-seq dataset and detailed clinical information for patients and samples are summarized in Supplementary Table 4. To avoid issues related to platform heterogeneity, only datasets generated from 10x Genomics droplet based scRNA-seq datasets were included.

We performed quality control filtering and integration using the Scanpy package (v.1.9.5). Filtering was performed based on (1) confirmation that information was available for all nine Y signature genes, (2) cells had greater than 200 detected genes and (3) the mitochondrial gene counts were below 20%. Additional quality filters were applied to the data to remove barcodes that fell into any of the following categories: possible debris with too few genes expressed (less than 400) and too few unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) (less than 500), possibility of duplicate cells based on genes expressed (more than 5,500) or UMIs (more than 30,000). Count matrices and AnnData objects were then combined using a concatenate function, normalized to log transcripts per million units using the ‘sc.pp.normalize_total' function, and log-transformed using the ‘sc.pp.log1p' function. The normalized HNSC dataset from GSE150430 was then combined. Subsequently, non-tumour samples were removed, and we retained 1,030,968 high-quality cells and 14,689 genes for downstream analysis.

We used the scVI Python package (scvi-tools; v.1.0.4)83 to integrate and batch correct scRNA-seq data. The scVI model was trained on the scRNA-seq data, considering samples as covariates. Following batch correction, the corrected data were integrated if multiple batches were present. The effectiveness of batch correction was evaluated by assessing the reduction in batch-specific variation while ensuring preservation of signal. Downstream analyses such as clustering, differential expression analysis or pathway enrichment analysis were performed on the batch-corrected data. Visualization of the results was achieved through two-dimensional UMAP plots, illustrating cell types, batches, datasets, gender, organs and cancer types.

To annotate cells, we used the scANVI algorithm from the scVI Python packages (scvi-tools; v.1.0.4) and the Luo et al.71 dataset, where cells were pre-labelled as epithelium, endothelium, fibroblast, lymphocyte, myeloid or plasma cell. Subsequently, we performed unsupervised clustering of the scANVI latent space, and then used Leiden clustering, followed by cluster assignment to specific cell types. The scANVI model was configured with max_epochs = 20 and cluster labels were transferred and predicted, guided by a sample size of n_samples_per_label = 100. The integrated latent embedding provided by scANVI served as the basis for downstream analysis, with the dataset segregated by cell type for further investigation. To delineate cell subtypes within myeloid cell, lymphocyte and plasma cell populations, we merged corresponding AnnData and mitigated batch effects and other sources of variation using scVI. Subsequently, we predicted subtypes using Celltypist84 (v.1.6.2), using ‘majority voting' with default parameters and the pre-trained ‘Immune_All_Low.pkl' model.

We collected scRNA-seq pan-cancer data from paired tumour and adjacent normal samples and, following preprocessing, categorized cells from adjacent normal samples as: male cells as having wild-type Y (WTY) chromosomes and female cells as LOY cells. Employing the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection, we divided data from the normal samples into training and test sets, with a split ratio of 70% for training and 30% for testing. Next, we trained a Random Forest classifier model (RandomForestClassifier from the sklearn.ensemble Python package (v.1.3.2)) to differentiate LOY and WTY cells based on the expression levels of the nine Y chromosome genes used for the bulk RNA-seq classification of LOY samples. The performance of the model was assessed using the test set, achieving an accuracy score of 0.83.

To further validate LOY prediction by a Random Forest model, we obtained 23 samples from Liu et al.24, including sequencing data for single-cell RNA (GSE245552), bulk RNA (GSE255163) and WES (GSE255165). YchrS and average CNA of Y chromosome were calculated using the same method as CCLE data. LOY at the single-cell level were predicted by the same Random Forest model used for the pan-cancer single-cell datasets. Owing to absence of RPS4Y1 expression, it was set as 0 for all the cells when applying the Random Forest model.

Genomic DNA was isolated from CRISPR Y-KO cells and CRISPR–Cas9-mediated Scr MB49 Y+ control (CRISPR Y-Scr) cell lines using the Invitrogen kit (catalogue no. K1820) following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples for WES were submitted to Novogene, where library preparation, sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were conducted. The genomic DNA was fragmented randomly into short pieces, end-repaired, A-tailed and ligated with Illumina adaptors. Following PCR amplification, size selection and purification, hybridization capture of libraries was performed. Captured libraries were further enriched by PCR amplification and assessed for quality using Qubit and bioanalyzer systems. The libraries were pooled and sequenced using Illumina platforms with the PE150 strategy. Sequencing data were processed using the GATK best practices workflow. Paired-end clean reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm39/mm39) using the Burrows–Wheeler aligner. The resulting alignments were sorted with Sambamba and duplicate reads were marked using Picard. The coverage and sequencing depth were computed, and SNP and INDEL variants were identified.

A total of 1 × 105 LOY MB49 cells (a LOY clonal line, MB49 clone 5 (C5)) were injected subcutaneously into C57Bl/6N mice (n = 4). Once the tumours reached 500 mm3, they were removed and processed for scRNA-seq. The tumours were cut and transferred immediately to MACS C-tubes along with chilled DMEM and tumour dissociation enzymes for mouse (Miltenyi Biotech, catalogue no. 130-096-730). The dissociated tumours were then processed using ACK Lysis buffer (Gibco, catalogue no. 2537772), dead cell removal kit (Stem Cell Technologies, catalogue no. 17899) and EasySep Mouse CD45 Positive Selection Kit (Stem Cell Technologies, catalogue no. 18945). The CD45-enriched cells were next stained with Hashtag antibodies (TotalSeq-B0301 anti-mouse Hashtag 1 Antibody; TotalSeq-B0302 anti-mouse Hashtag 2 Antibody) and stained sequentially for CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11b, F4/80 and B220 along with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and sorted for CD4+, CD8+ and CD11b+ and mixed into equal ratios. This mixture of highly enriched CD45+ cells was combined in a 1:1 ratio with live CD45− cells to make a final mixture that was sent for scRNA-seq.

The Cedars-Sinai Applied Genomics, Computation and Translational Core used 10x genomics 3′ scRNA-seq to sequence all samples to around 60% saturation. Samples were processed using Cell Ranger (10x genomics) based on a pre-mRNA GRCh38 reference. Since the samples were not hashed, potential doublet cells were identified using Scrublet applied to the filtered feature barcode matrices from Cell Ranger. Scrublet analysed the 10% most variable genes, identified by Scanpy package (v.1.9.5, scanpy.pp.highly_variable_genes function), predicting a 10% doublet rate, and then discarded doublet cells. Finally, nuclei with over 10% of their UMIs linked to mitochondrial genes or those in the top and bottom 5% based on the number of unique genes and UMI count were also removed.

One female and one male normal healthy C57BL/6N bladder sample from our previous study31 were also analysed. Filtering was performed based on: (1) cells had more than 200 detected genes and (2) the mitochondrial gene counts were below 20%. Additional quality filters were applied to the data to remove barcodes that fell into any of the following categories: possible debris with too few genes expressed (less than 400) and too few UMIs (less than 500), possibility of duplicate cells based on genes expressed (more than 30,000) or UMIs (more than 5,500). We normalized the data to 1 × 104 counts per cell and calculated the base-10 logarithm. We used sc.pp.combat to remove the batch effect and applied subsequent downstream analyses on the batch-corrected data. To annotate cells, we used the scVI and scANVI algorithm from the scVI Python packages (scvi-tools).

To further investigate the ability of LOY malignant cells to induce LOY in benign cells in the TME, we downloaded public scRNA-seq datasets of human xenografts in immunocompromised mice from GSE254890 (ref. 35) (SW480 cells from a male patient with CRC injected into male mice, 14 samples were incorporated as SW480 group), GSE110501 (ref. 85; only eight samples from normal tissues were incorporated as male control) and GSE144236 (ref. 86; A431, SCC and CAL27 injected into female mice, three samples incorporated as female control). Based on scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data provided, SW480 cells used were LOY cells, which matched with the Y chromosome information obtained by our CCLE analysis on RNA-seq data. Mouse cells were selected either by tumour cell depletion using FITC conjugated antibodies, or by expression level of mouse genes compared with human genes. Potential debris (cells with fewer than 200 expressed genes or 400 UMIs) and possible doublets (cells with more than 8,500 expressed genes or 30,000 UMIs) were filtered out. After normalization, batch correction and cell type annotation were performed by scVI and scANVI. YchrS was calculated ‘scanpy.tl.score_genes' using all Ychr gene expression.

MUP-uPA+ on C57BL/6 (ref. 87) background 1 were bred and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in an American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved barrier facility at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. MUP-uPA+ mice were fed a Western diet (Teklad, catalogue no. TD.88137) for 8 months beginning at 8 weeks after birth. HCC development was analysed at 10 months of age.

Mice were killed by CO2 inhalation and livers were perfused with PBS containing 2% of heparin (20 USP units ml−1) to remove traces of blood. For single-nucleus preparation, livers were isolated, tumour tissues were dissected and cut into 50 mg tumour tissue pieces for single-nucleus isolation and sequencing. Tissue was frozen in dry ice (solid CO2) and kept in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. For single-cell preparation, livers were isolated, and tumour tissues were dissected and digested using a cocktail of digestion enzymes containing collagenase I (450 U ml−1) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. C0130) and DNase I (120 U m−1) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. D4263) in PBS (with Ca2+/Mg2+) for 30 min at 37°C with gentle shaking at 150 rpm for liver immune cell isolation. After incubation, cell suspensions were filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer. Immune cells were enriched by density-gradient centrifugation over Percoll (GE Healthcare, catalogue no. 17-0891-01) at 1,000g for 25 min without brake (40% Percoll in RPMI-1640 and 80% Percoll in 5% FBS/PBS). Leukocyte rings on a border of gradient were collected, washed and stained. Immune cell suspensions were stained with Zombie Aqua (BioLegend, catalogue no. 423101) on ice for 15 min to exclude dead cells, incubated with Fc Block TruStain FcX (Clone 93, BioLegend, catalogue no. 101320, RRID: AB_1574975) for 20 min in 2% FBS-PBS and then stained with fluorochrome labelled antibody for 30 min on ice (CD45-PerCP/Cyanine5.5 (QA17A26, BioLegend, catalogue no. 157612; RRID, catalogue no. AB_2832558, 1:100)). All the flow cytometry antibodies were validated by the manufacturer (BioLegend) and were validated in the laboratory in single channel controls. Live, CD45+ cells were sorted by BD sorter Aria III using a 100-µm nozzle.

The single-cell droplets were generated with a Chromium X controller using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v3.1 (Dual Index) (10X Genomics, catalogue no. 1000268). Approximately 8,000 to 10,000 cells were collected to make cDNA at the single-cell level. cDNA amplification and library construction were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cDNA and libraries were quantified via Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer. Gene expression libraries were sequenced at a targeted depth of 50,000 reads per cell on the Illumina Novaseq X plus (Illumina) at Novogene. Fastq files were obtained and then processed with Cell Ranger v.8.0.1 aligning to the mouse (mm10) 2020-A reference genome on 10x Genomics Cloud Analysis.

Single nuclei were isolated from frozen tumour tissues using the Chromium Nuclei Isolation Kit (10x Genomics, catalogue no. 1000493) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA amplification, library construction, sequencing and genome mapping were performed in the same way as for mouse scRNA-seq.

Processed scRNA-seq data and corresponding cell type information for 116 liver cancer samples from 94 male patients40 were analysed using our Random Forest model to predict LOY at the single-cell level. Only primary tumour or metastasis samples were included in the survival analysis.

For the results presented in Extended Data Fig. 8e,f, CNVs in the scRNA-seq data were predicted using the InferCNV tool (https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV; v.1.13.0), so that differences in the frequencies between the LOYSCR and WTYSCR epithelial cells of gains or deletions of entire chromosomes or large chromosomal segments could be identified. The algorithm was run with default parameters, using all WTYSCR stromal cells and immune cells as reference cells. For the results presented in Extended Data Fig. 6c,d, the analysis and figure were generated using Infercnvpy (https://github.com/icbi-lab/infercnvpy; v.0.4.5).

We used the ‘scanpy.tl.score_genes' function from the Scanpy Python package (v.1.9.5) to compute gene set scores across cells. This function calculates gene scores for each gene listed62,88,89 in ‘gene_list' across all cells stored within the dataset.

We used three distinct models to examine LOY in vivo: (1) naturally occurring Y+ and LOY (Y−) cells7, (2) an established LOY clonal line (C5) and (3) CRISPR-engineered Y-KO and Y-Scr cells7. For the tumour challenge, 1 × 105 cells from each line—MB49 clone 5 (C5), Y− (LOY), Y+ (WTY), CRISPR Y-KO and CRISPR Y-Scr—were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of C57Bl/6N mice (n = 7 per group) obtained from Taconic Biosciences7.The DNA levels of Y chromosome genes in each engineered cell type were checked for abundance before injection. Subcutaneous tumours from each group were disrupted mechanically, filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer (Corning, catalogue no. 352350) with RPMI-1640 cell culture grade media (Gibco, catalogue no. 11875093). ACK lysis buffer (Gibco, catalogue no. A1049201) was used to disrupt the infiltrating red blood cells. The single cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 1× HBSS buffer (Gibco, catalogue no. 14025092) and counted in a cell counter machine. Tumours with viability of greater than 60% were used for subsequent procedures. EasySep Dead Cell Removal (Annexin V) Kit (Stem Cell Technologies, catalogue no. 17899) was used to increase the viability of each tumour and remove the dead cells. Viable cells were next processed with EasySep Mouse CD45 Positive Selection Kit (Stem Cell Technologies, catalogue no. 18945). The CD45 cells with the positive magnetic beads were purified and resuspended in EasySep Buffer (Stem Cell Technologies, catalogue no. 20144). These cells were next stained with CD45-Alexa Fluor 488 (BioLegend, catalogue no. 103122, 1:40) and Viability ghost dye Red 710 (Cytek, catalogue no. SKU 13-0871-T100) and sorted for only CD45+ cells in BD AriaIII machine. These highly purified CD45+ immune cells were next used for isolating high-quality genomic DNA with Monarch Nucleic Acid Purification Kits (NEB) and quantified. The flow through obtained after the CD45 positive selection, containing stromal, endothelial or other blood cells, was next processed with the EasySep Mouse Epithelial Cell Enrichment Kit II (Stem Cell Technologies, catalogue no. 19868), to isolate only the epithelial cells. The purity of pre- and post-isolation populations was assessed by antibody staining of random samples from each group, using the CD45 AF488 (BioLegend, catalogue no. 103122, 1:40) antibody and the BD Symphony A5, with results being analysed using Flow Jo software v.10.9.0.

For isolating T cells from these tumours (n = 6 each group) and their respective PBMCs, the following panel was used: CD45 (BioLegend, catalogue no. 103116; 1:40); CD3 (BD, catalogue no. 749276, 1:40); TCR β chain (TCRb, BioLegend, catalogue no. 109205, 1:40); CD11b (BD, catalogue no. 563553, 1:40); CD45R (BD, catalogue no. 612950, 1:40); Ghost dye Red 710 viability dye (Tonbo Biosciences, catalogue no. 13-0871-T100). Three compartments were sorted with BD FACSymphony S6 machine: epithelial (Ghost Red 710 dye−CD45− or CD45−TdTomato+); non-T immune cells (Ghost Red 710 dye−CD45+CD11b+B220+) and T cells (Ghost Red 710 dye−CD45+CD11b−B220−CD3+TCRb+). The sorting gates and FACS data are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Subsequently, the sorted cell compartments from tumours from the both groups were used for high-quality DNA extraction and subsequent qPCR. FC was calculated by comparing individual dCT values to respective average WTY(Y+) dCt or average Y SCR dCt values.

To get substantial amount of viable T cells for DNA isolation from subcutaneous tumours, the tumours of one group were mashed and pooled together and then proceeded for sorting. However, after sorting, the T cells were aliquoted randomly to four tubes and then processed for DNA isolation, to increase the efficacy of the result and decrease the chances of human error. Therefore, even if each group had six tumours pooled together, the graph in Extended Data Fig. 10c (right panel) shows four dots of one colour.

Tumours derived from subcutaneous injection of CRISPR Y_KO and CRISPR Y-Scr cells into the flanks of C57BL/6N mice were removed and processed. Tumour-derived single-cell suspensions were subjected to FACS to isolate CD45− cells as described above. Total RNA was extracted from the isolated cells using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit with gDNA Eliminator columns (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA sequencing library preparation and sequencing were performed by Novogene. Quality assessment of RNA-seq data, including sequence, alignment and quantification metrics, was conducted using FastQC v.0.12.1 and summarized with MultiQC v.1.13. Illumina Truseq adaptor, polyA and polyT sequences were trimmed using Trimmomatic v.0.39. The trimmed reads were aligned to the mouse genome (GRCm39/mm39) using STAR aligner v.2.5.2b, with parameters aligned to the ENCODE long RNA-seq pipeline recommendations (https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/long-rna-seq-pipeline). Gene-level expression was quantified using featureCounts v.1.5.3, using Ensembl gene annotations (release v.113) for both alignment and quantification.

Genes with low expression were filtered out by applying a threshold of sum of estimated counts (from featureCounts) of at least ten. Differential gene expression analysis was performed on filtered estimated read counts using the R Bioconductor package DESeq2 v.1.42.1, using a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution. Differentially expressed genes were identified based on a Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value < 0.05 and FC cut-off (≥2 or ≤−2). To validate the Y-KO-derived gene phenotype signature in human cancer data, we first excluded all Y-linked genes to prevent bias in the differential expression results. We then calculated a LOY gene phenotype score by dividing the signature scores of up-regulated genes by those of down-regulated genes, with scores scaled to a [0,1] interval.

For the BBN experiment, 8-week-old mice (n = 3–4 mice per timepoint) were administered with 0.5% BBN water for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, BBN was replaced with standard tap water. Mice were killed at 2, 4, 12, 20 and 25 weeks using isoflurane. Subsequently, blood was drawn directly from the heart using an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-prewet insulin syringe and collected in an EDTA Microvette. From each mouse, a range of 700 to 1,000 µl of blood was collected. To enhance yield and DNA quality, mice were pooled in each group. Pooled samples were diluted 1:1 (v:v) with PBS-EDTA 0.1 M and then stratified on Histopaque-1077 Ficoll (Sigma, catalogue no. GE17-5446-02) at a ratio of 3:1 (v:v). Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 400 rcf, with acceleration and break ramps set to 0 to allow gradual phase separation. The resulting PBMC ring was collected and washed once with PBS (1X). A subsequent centrifugation of 5 min at 400 rcf (with acceleration and break ramps set to maximum speed) resulted in a pellet that was processed for DNA extraction.

A human BLCA tissue microarray (TMA) with 33 unique cases comprised of triplicate cores from each patient tumour with an individual core size of 1 mm was used. The TMA was comprised of both male (n = 18) and female (n = 15) patients. Cores from female patients were used as controls for FISH.

The unstained TMA formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections (4 μm) were baked at 55–60 °C overnight before subjecting the slide to the following steps on the Abbott VP2000 FISH Instrument: (1) deparaffination of the slide using xylene, (2) pre-treatment of the slide using 0.2 N HCl and 1 M NaSCN, (3) protease treatment with pepsin, (4) fixation in 10% buffered formalin and, finally, (5) dehydration in series of increasing concentration (70%, 85% and 100%) ethanol. The slide was then subjected to a co-denaturation step using ThermoBrite (melting temperature 73 °C, 5 min; hybridization temperature 37 °C overnight). Post hybridization the slide was washed twice with SSC/0.3% NP-4 72 ± 1 °C for 2 min and twice with 2× SSC/0.3% NP-4 15–30 °C for 1 min. Finally, the slide was counterstained with nuclear DAPI before sealing with coverslip for visualization. The fluorescence tags were as follows: CEPX Xp11.1-q11.1—Spectrum Green (excitation, 497 nm; emission, 524 nm) CEPY Yp11.1-q11.3—Spectrum Orange (excitation, 559 nm; emission, 588 nm) and 18S RNA probe—Spectrum Aqua (excitation, 433 nm; emission, 480 nm).

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples were sectioned at 4-μm thickness onto Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. 12-550-15). IHC staining was performed on the Ventana Discovery Ultra Instrument (Roche) as described90. After applying antigen retrieval buffer (CC1 (Tris, pH 8.0) (Roche Ventana, catalogue no. 950-124), CD45 primary antibody (Cell Signaling, catalogue no. 13917S, rabbit monoclonal) was applied. Primary antibody was diluted antibody dilution buffer (Roche Ventana, catalogue no. ADB250) for 1 h at room temperature: anti-CD45 (1:500). DISC anti-Rabbit HQ (Roche Ventana, catalogue no. 760-4815) was then applied for chromagen staining. After DAPI nuclear counterstain, the tissue area was covered coverslipped and mounted with ProLong antifade medium (Invitrogen, catalogue no. P36984).

XY FISH immunofluorescence slides were scanned using the ZEISS Axio Scan.Z1 whole slide scanner at ×20 magnification (Plan-Apochromat lens (numerical aperture, 0.8; M27)). TMA tissue cores were outlined with permanent marker pen on the coverslip for tissue detection. Region of scan was generated by a polygon tool and the raw focus map was generated using the ‘every-2-tiles' strategy (z-range 150 µm, 21.04-µm step size) under ×5 lens (Fluor ×5/0.25 M27), while a fine focus map was generated using onion skin (z-range 100 µm, 2.06-µm step size, 0.1 density, 24 maximum number of points). Both focus maps were generated in the DAPI channel at 2% LED intensity, 50-ms exposure time. Spectrum Green (X probe) was excited at 495-nm wavelength (5% LED intensity, 150-ms exposure time) and detected at 500–550-nm bandwidth. Spectrum Orange (Y probe) was excited at 548-nm wavelength (25% LED intensity, 150 ms exposure time), detected at 570–640-nm bandwidth. Nuclear DAPI fluorescence was excited at 420-nm wavelength (2.5% LED intensity, 50-ms exposure time), detected at 430–470-nm bandwidth. Spectrum Aqua (18S RNA probe) was excited at 434-nm wavelength (5% LED intensity, 150-ms exposure time) and detected at 460–500-nm bandwidth. All signals were detected by Hamamatsu Orca Flash camera and 16-bit depth format image setting was applied. Standard IHC slide was imaged using the Leica Aperio AT2 whole slide scanner at ×20 magnification.

The whole slide image obtained from Zeiss Axio scan system was imported into HALO AI Module (Indica Labs), v.4.0.5107.318, for analysis. Upon import, the TMA image underwent segmentation to identify individual tissue cores. Missing cores were identified and removed from the analysis. The remaining cores were processed using the Nuclei Segmentation AI module, following the manufacturer's guidelines. For AI training, seven distinct regions of interest were selected, comprising a total of 43 nuclei, to refine the Nuclei Segmentation plugin. Following segmentation, FISH analysis was conducted using the HALO FISH module, v.3.2.3, to detect nuclear signals. The resulting data were exported as.csv files, containing object-level (cell) data for subsequent analysis.

To further validate the results and minimize the impact of mis-annotating LOY epithelial cells as LOY immune cells, we analysed 21 CD45-based FACS-sorted samples from three independent public scRNA-seq datasets (HNSC, GSE182227 (ref. 32); CHOL, GSE171899 (ref. 33) and BLCA, GSE211388 (ref. 34)). This collection included 12 matched CD45+ and CD45− samples from six tumours. Detailed dataset and sample information are provided in Supplementary Table 7. The same quality control, normalization and batch correction procedures described for the pan-cancer human scRNA-seq datasets were applied. CD45 expression was validated to ensure the purity of the FACS-selected samples. LOY cells were predicted using a Random Forest model.

To further validate the accumulation of LOY immune cells in tumours, we analysed two additional datasets: RCC dataset36 (accession number, EGAD0001008030), comprising 14 matched tumour (also included in the pan-cancer datasets) and blood samples. HNSC dataset (accession number, GSE139324 (ref. 37)), containing 38 matched TIL and PBMC samples. Detailed dataset and sample information are presented in Supplementary Tables 4 and 7. The same quality control, normalization, batch correction and LOY cell prediction methods were applied. Additionally, cell types were identified using the scANVI algorithm and marker gene expression, with annotated pan-cancer scRNA-seq datasets serving as references.

Mouse CD8+ T cells were isolated from spleens of C57BL/6N mice using the Mouse CD8+ T Cell Isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, catalogue no. 130-104-075). CD8+ T cells were then activated by seeding onto six-well plates coated with 1 µg ml−1 anti-CD3 (clone 2C11, BioLegend, catalogue no. 100302) and anti-CD8 (clone 37.51, BioLegend, catalogue no. 102102). T cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% insulin transferrin sodium selenite as well as 0.1 µg ml−1 IL-7 (Peprotech, catalogue no. 217-17) and IL-2 (Peprotech, catalogue no. 212-12). T cells were kept at no higher than 1 × 106 ml−1 and transferred to new coated plates every 2–3 days to maintain activation. DNA and RNA was isolated at the timepoints indicated using the Monarch Genomic DNA Purification Kit (New England Biolabs, catalogue no. T3010L) or RNeasy Plus Mini Kit with gDNA Eliminator (Qiagen, catalogue no. 74134), respectively. CDNA was generated with Maxima H Minus cDNA Synthesis Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, catalogue no. M1662) followed by qPCR. Data were normalized to day 1.

Genomic DNA (10 ng per reaction) was used to detect and quantify Y‐chromosome-specific genes associated with LOY signatures—Kdm5d, Uty, Eif2s3y, Ddx3y, Ssty1, Ssty2 and Zfy1/2—as well as to detect the presence of Cas9 in immune and epithelial compartments. Housekeeping genes (B2m, Gapdh and Actb) served as endogenous controls. All qPCR reactions were carried out using SYBR Green Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, catalogue no. 4309155) on a Quant Studio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). To assess Y chromosome copy number in various TIL immune cell populations (T cells and non-T cells), we compared cycle threshold (Ct) values from each sorted population against Ct values from wild-type male tumour cells, using the ΔΔCt method to calculate FC. For Cas9 detection, Ct values in sorted immune populations were compared with DNA from wild-type C57Bl/6N mice, which have no Cas9 integration, using Gapdh and Actb. Absence (or near-absence) of Cas9 amplification in immune compartments confirmed that these cells were not contaminated by, or had phagocytosed, genome-edited epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 1).

FC values were calculated using the ΔΔCt method relative to the appropriate wild-type controls. Data were used to quantify the relative copy number of Y chromosome genes in tumour‐derived immune subsets or to confirm the absence of Cas9 in cells not genetically engineered.

The publicly available processed scRNA-seq dataset from Giles et al.39 was analysed to investigate the impact of chronic stimulation on the stability of the Y chromosome in T cells. This dataset included gp33-specific CD8+ T cells from TCR-transgenic mice subjected to acute (LCMV Armstrong) and chronic (LCMV Clone 13) LCMV infections. Chronic stimulation of T cells was validated through the upregulation of canonical exhaustion markers, including Tox, Pdcd1 and Ctla4, and the downregulation of Tcf7. To evaluate LOY, the expression levels of Y-linked genes (Uty, Kdm5d, Ddx3y, Usp9y) were analysed.

To generate cell-type-specific gene signatures for LOYSCR/WTYSCR epithelial cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells from scRNA-seq data, we conducted differential analysis using the ‘sc.tl.rank_genes_groups' function of the Scanpy (v.1.9.5) package. This analysis used Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann–Whitney U) tests to identify significant differences across each LOYSCR and WTYSCR cell type. We first identified genes significantly up-regulated (log2FC > 1, adjusted P value < 0.05) in the LOYSCR versus WTYSCR epithelial cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells separately. To establish unique signatures for each cell type, we then excluded genes expressed in more than 15% of any other LOYSCR or WTYSCR cell type. We then performed deconvolution on normalized bulk expression data from TCGA cancer types using the ssGSEA algorithm, evaluating the relationship of these signatures with patient outcome.

Time-to-event outcomes were presented by using Kaplan–Meier curves and compared by using log-rank test or univariate Cox proportional hazards model (survival R package; v.3.5.8) as noted in each figure. Two multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fitted, each as a function of (1) YchrS with ancestry and race as known risk factors and confounders; (2) LOY signatures scRNA-seq signatures, including LOYSCR CD4+ T cell, LOYSCR CD8+ T cell, and LOYSCR epithelial cell signatures, with age as known risk factors and confounders. Hazard ratio along with 95% CI based on multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were reported. The function surv_cutpoint from the survminer R package (v.0.4.9) was used to determine the optimal cut-off value for the LOYSCR signatures in relation to the time-to-event outcome. This method uses maximally selected rank statistics from the maxstat91 R package (v.0.7-25) to classify two groups (low- versus high-risk) based on the optimal cut-point. Moreover, continuous variables included as covariates in the Cox proportional hazards model were evaluated92. Linearity was assessed to ensure model adequacy.

According to clinical risk factors and risk scores of multivariate Cox regression coefficients for Extended Data Table 2, a prognostic nomogram was established using the ‘rms' R software package (v.6.8-0), and the prediction accuracy of the nomogram was assessed using the calibration curve to evaluate the match between expected and observed events at 2, 5 and 8 years.

All human specimens and associated data were collected following protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol 43021) at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, adhering strictly to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant or their legal guardian. Detailed information regarding patient recruitment, sample collection (including TMA preparation), and data management can be found within IRB protocol 43021.

All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol 8253) at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines specified in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Protocol 8253 comprehensively describes animal housing conditions, care standards and experimental methodologies. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional IACUC protocols. Mouse were housed under standard conditions with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, temperatures maintained between 68 °F and 79 °F (20–26 °C), and relative humidity between 30% and 70%.

All analyses were conducted using R (v.4.3.1) and Python (v.3.10.9). Before commencing tests, data were assessed for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, followed by Bartlett or Levene tests to evaluate homogeneity of variances. For normally distributed variables, the unpaired Student's t-test (Stats R package; v.4.3.1) was applied, whereas non-normally distributed variables were analysed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. The correlation between paired variables was assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficients. Data presentation and multiple comparison corrections are as stated in figure legends. Statistical significance was considered when P values were less than 0.05, including adjusted P values. Discovery analyses involving more than 20 comparisons underwent multiple testing correction using the p.adjust function in R or multipletests function in Python, applying the Benjamini–Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate at 0.05. To compare ROC curves, we used the roc.test function from the pROC R package (v.1.18.5). This allowed us to assess differences between AUC of YchrS and the AUC of YwholeS or LOYDNA. Python packages such as Scanpy (v.1.9.5), Pandas (v.2.0.0), Statsmodels (v.0.14.0), NumPy (v.1.24.2), Scipy (v.1.10.1), Matplotlib (v.3.8.0), Seaborn (v.0.11.2) and Sklearn (v.1.3.2), were used for data analysis. The R package ComplexHeatmap (v.2.11.1) was used to generate heat maps, and visualization was facilitated using ggplot2 (v.3.3.5), ggpubr (v.0.6.0), ggrepel (v.0.9.2), Statannot (v.0.6.0), Circlize (v.0.4.16), GseaVis (v.0.0.5), Enrichplot (v.1.22.0), GridExtra (v.2.3.0), Pheatmap(v.1.0.12) and DEGreport (v.1.38.5) R packages. For data manipulation, Readr (v.2.1.5), Readxl (v.1.4.3), Dplyr (v.1.1.4), Plyr (v.8.9), Apeglm (v.1.24.0), Tidyr (v.1.3.1), Tidyverse (v.2.0.0), Tibble (v. 3.2.1), Iranges (v.2.36.0), Biobase (v.2.62.0), BiocGenerics (v.0.48.1), Lubridate (v.1.9.3), Stringr (v.1.5.1) and AnnotationDbi (v.1.64.1) were used for analysis.

Metrics details

How does the brain convert visual input into specific motor actions1,2? In Drosophila, visual projection neurons (VPNs)3,4 perform this visuomotor transformation by converting retinal positional information into synapse number in the brain5. The molecular basis of this phenomenon remains unknown. We addressed this issue in LPLC2 (ref. 6), a VPN type that detects looming motion and preferentially drives escape behaviour to stimuli approaching from the dorsal visual field with progressively weaker responses ventrally. This correlates with a dorsoventral gradient of synaptic inputs into and outputs from LPLC2. Here we report that LPLC2 neurons sampling different regions of visual space exhibit graded expression of cell recognition molecules matching these synaptic gradients. Dpr13 shapes LPLC2 outputs by binding DIP-ε in premotor descending neurons mediating escape. Beat-VI shapes LPLC2 inputs by binding Side-II in upstream motion-detecting neurons. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments show that these molecular gradients act instructively to determine synapse number. These patterns, in turn, fine-tune the perception of the stimulus and drive the behavioural response. Similar transcriptomic variation within neuronal types is observed in the vertebrate brain7 and may shape synapse number via gradients of cell recognition molecules acting through both genetically hard-wired programs and experience.

Animals rely on visuomotor transformations to convert object locations in eye coordinates into directional movements8. The brain regions and neural circuits regulating this transformation in both vertebrates9,10 and invertebrates11 have been characterized. The precise neuronal connectivity underlying learned12,13 and innate visuomotor14 tasks is shaped by genetically hardwired mechanisms, experience or both.

In flies, visuomotor transformation occurs between VPNs and descending neurons15,16 (Fig. 1a). VPNs include lobula columnar (LC) and lobula plate/lobula columnar (LPLC) neurons4 comprising approximately 30 cell types with 20–200 cells of each type per hemibrain3,4. For simplicity, we refer to these collectively as VPNs. The dendrites of each VPN type span 20–40° of visual space, forming a retinotopic feature-detecting map17,18 in the optic lobe. Their axons converge and terminate within VPN-type-specific optic glomeruli in the central brain, where they synapse onto the dendrites of descending neurons and other neurons (Fig. 1a). Most VPN types lose axonal retinotopy4,5, meaning spatially organized visual inputs onto VPN dendrites do not translate to ordered axonal projections.

We recently demonstrated that the transformation from visual input to motor output in VPN–descending neuron circuits relies on synaptic gradients, which form in most cases independent of axonal retinotopy5. We define synaptic gradients as connectivity patterns where the number of synapses from a presynaptic population (for example, a VPN type) to postsynaptic targets (for example, descending neurons) varies topographically along the anteroposterior or dorsoventral axes of visual space. This synaptic organization underlies directional behavioural responses5. Although these gradients originate from retinotopically guided dendritic inputs, the resulting axonal synaptic connections often encode visual space in a non-spatial, abstract manner. The molecular mechanisms underlying this transformation remain unclear.

To uncover the molecular basis of synaptic gradients, we examined a VPN type called LPLC2 neurons, a population of approximately 100 cells per hemibrain. Each LPLC2 neuron acts as a local looming detector, responding to dark, radially expanding motion centred on its receptive field6,17. The axons of LPLC2 neurons transmit visual information to the giant fibre (GF), a descending neuron that triggers a rapid looming-evoked escape takeoff19,20 (Fig. 1b). Previously, our analysis of two electron microscopy-based connectomic reconstructions21,22,23 revealed that LPLC2 neurons form a dorsoventral synaptic gradient, with dorsal LPLC2 neurons making more synapses with the GF than ventral neurons (Fig. 1c,d). Here we show that flies respond more strongly to dorsal than ventral looming stimuli correlating with the synaptic gradient.

To investigate the molecular basis of this gradient, we combined single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics and genetics with morphological, behavioural and physiological studies. We identified two cell recognition molecules expressed in a gradient across the LPLC2 population. Dpr13 regulates a gradient of synaptic inputs to the GF, and Beat-VI controls a synaptic gradient onto the dendrites of LPLC2. We demonstrate that varying levels of these proteins in LPLC2 specify different numbers of synaptic inputs and outputs. This represents a new mechanism regulating synaptic specificity.

To assess the function of the dorsoventral synaptic gradient between LPLC2 and the GF, we quantified escape responses to looming stimuli at different elevations. Flies take off in two modes: a faster short mode (featuring leg extension only, and taking the fly less than 7 ms to jump24) and a slower long mode (coordinated wing depression and leg extension24). Short-mode takeoffs are driven solely by the GF activation20. If LPLC2 neurons with more dorsal receptive fields form more synapses with the GF than ventral LPLC2 neurons, we predicted more short-mode takeoffs in response to higher-elevation stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we analysed thousands of previously collected25 high-speed videos of takeoffs elicited by looming stimuli at different elevations, and classified takeoffs by mode. The short-mode takeoff percentage increased as stimulus elevation changed from −30° to 77° (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1a–c), as would be expected from higher engagement of the GF in response to more dorsal looming.

The GF receives direct visual input from only one other VPN type (LC4)26 in addition to LPLC2. LC4 neurons do not form a dorsoventral synaptic gradient with the GF5, suggesting the increase in GF-driven short-mode takeoffs at high elevations results directly from the LPLC2–GF synaptic gradient. We tested this by blocking synaptic transmission in LPLC2 and quantifying the looming responses in these flies (Extended Data Fig. 1f–h). Without LPLC2 input, the percentage of short-mode takeoffs did not change across elevations (Extended Data Fig. 1h), with the percentage of short-mode takeoffs greatly reduced at high (77°) elevations compared with control flies. To directly test whether LPLC2–GF connectivity biases GF activation, we performed in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the GF during looming stimuli at three elevations. GF membrane depolarization was larger in response to dorsal than to ventral looming (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). This provides direct evidence that the LPLC2–GF synaptic gradient generates a corresponding gradient of GF activation, ultimately shaping escape behaviour.

Electron microscopy reconstruction studies established that LPLC2 axons projections are not retinotopic (that is, intermingled) and yet form different numbers of synapses onto GF dendrites according to the location of the stimulus in the visual field to which they respond4,5 (Fig. 1g). We hypothesized that this pattern of synapses could be achieved through differential molecular recognition: individual LPLC2 neurons sampling different regions of visual space could express different levels of the same cell recognition molecule, which, in turn, would specify the number of synapses they form onto GF dendrites.

To investigate whether LPLC2 neurons exhibit molecular variation that correlates with the synaptic gradient, we examined the LPLC2 transcriptome at three developmental stages during and after synaptogenesis (48 h after puparium formation (APF), 72 h APF and 96 h APF; Fig. 1h). In addition to LPLC2, we profiled a related cell type, LPLC1, which forms synaptic gradients without axonal retinotopy with other descending neurons5, and LC4, a VPN type with axons arranged in a retinotopic manner5. As neuronal transcriptomes are highly dynamic during development and are affected by genetic background27, we introduced internal controls at each time point to account for transcriptional heterogeneity driven by these factors.

We used genetic multiplexing to perform pooled single-cell profiling across biological replicates27,28,29 (including different genetic backgrounds and developmental stages; see Methods). Our dataset included approximately 600 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes per cell type and time point (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). We validated the identity of each VPN cell type (LPLC2, LPLC1 and LC4) using known marker genes27 (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). This provided approximately 30-times higher per-cell-type coverage than existing single-cell atlases of the Drosophila optic lobes27,30.

To explore heterogeneity in gene expression across each VPN cell type, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) separately for each cell type and time point (Fig. 1k–m and Extended Data Figs. 2c–e and 3a,b). At 48 h APF, PC1 captured genes expressed in a graded manner across difference LPLC2 neurons (Fig. 1k). For example, the most differentially expressed gene was dpr13, encoding a cell recognition protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF)31. There was, however, no clear boundary separating neurons with high versus low dpr13 expression levels. Many of the most differentially expressed genes also encode cell recognition molecules: IgSF (for example, tei, beat-VI and dpr17), leucine-rich-repeat (for example, trn) and cadherin (for example, Cad87A) families31,32 (Fig. 1k).

To test whether the transcriptional heterogeneity within LPLC2 neurons reflects discrete subtypes or a continuous gradient, we artificially clustered neurons and shuffled gene expression in two ways: across all cells or only within artificial clusters (Extended Data Fig. 3c–g). Shuffling across all cells disrupted the gradient, indicating that the observed variation arises from coordinated gene expression. Shuffling gene expression only within arbitrarily separated clusters of neurons introduced artificial gaps, showing that the original data do not naturally separate into discrete subtypes. Thus, the transcriptomic heterogeneity across LPLC2 neurons forms a continuous gradient.

The distribution of neurons along PC1 also did not correlate with developmental age, sex, genetic background or mRNA coverage (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Figs. 2e and 3a,b), indicating that molecular heterogeneity had a different origin. The graded expression of the top differentially expressed genes associated with PC1 at 48 h APF (dpr13, beat-VI and tei (encoding IgSF molecules), as well as SiaT (encoding sialyltransferase)) persisted through development (Fig. 1m).

In LPLC1 neurons, PC1 also captured gradients of IgSF-encoding transcripts (for example, DIP-κ, CG33543, dpr3 and sdk) that persisted through development (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Similar to LPLC2, molecular gradients in LPLC1 could not be explained by any of the confounding factors (Extended Data Figs. 2e and 3a,b). By contrast, PC1 in LC4 correlated with technical factors (for example, transcript count per neuron; Extended Data Figs. 2e and 3a,b), indicating that its molecular heterogeneity was not biologically relevant.

In summary, we identified stable gradients of transcripts encoding recognition molecules in LPLC1 and LPLC2, but not in LC4, suggesting that molecular heterogeneity is a feature of VPNs forming synaptic gradients independent of axonal retinotopy5.

To verify gene expression gradients in LPLC2 neurons, we used single-molecule hairpin chain reaction fluorescent in situ hybridization33 (HCR-FISH), an epansion-assisted light-sheet microscopy (ExLSM)34 to visualize and count transcripts within LPLC2 neurons (Fig. 2a). The cell bodies of adjacent LPLC2 neurons exhibited striking differences in transcript levels of dpr13 and SiaT, the two most differentially expressed genes in the LPLC2 dataset (Fig. 2b,c). Similar patterns were observed for beat-VI and dpr17 (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d).

We quantified differential gene expression inferred from HCR-FISH analysis using Flyseg35, an automated volumetric instance segmentation algorithm that we previously developed (see Methods). The results of scRNA-seq and HCR-FISH were similar for genes exhibiting antiparallel (for example, dpr13 and SiaT; Fig. 2d, top) and parallel expression patterns (for example, dpr13 and beat-VI; Fig. 2d, bottom). Most of these relationships remained consistent throughout development (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 2), supporting our findings from scRNA-seq data. One exception was muscleblind(mbl); although this gene exhibited graded expression in scRNA-seq (Fig. 1k), it showed low, uniform expression in HCR-FISH. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. In summary, most gene expression gradients across LPLC2 neurons from scRNA-seq data were confirmed by HCR-FISH.

We next investigated whether there was a correlation between the retinotopic position of LPLC2 dendrites and gene expression levels. As the cell bodies of the LPLC2 neurons were arranged in a salt-and-pepper manner (Fig. 2c), we used a genetic intersection strategy to visualize the expression of transcriptional reporters for different genes in LPLC2 neurons in dendrites in different topographical locations in the visual field (Fig. 2f,g). Genes encoding recognition molecules dpr13, beat-VI and Cad87A, which showed correlated expression in scRNA-seq (Fig. 1k), were predominantly expressed by LPLC2 neurons with dendrites in the dorsal region of the lobula at 48 h APF (Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Conversely, the expression of SiaT, dpr17, CG03419, Tsp42Ef and stacl was limited to the ventral region at the same developmental stage (Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). By combining reporter expression and HCR-FISH, we confirmed this heterogeneity, showing significantly higher dpr13 and beat-VI transcript levels in dorsal LPLC2 neurons (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). Heterogeneous expression of genes encoding recognition molecules in LPLC1 neurons had similar retinotopic correlates (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f), suggesting that such retinotopically biased expression gradients are a general feature of many VPN types.

To see whether these transcriptional gradients persist at the protein level, we used MIMIC-based protein traps36 generating GFP-tagged versions of two recognition proteins: Dpr13 and Beat-VI. This facilitated visualization of protein expression under their endogenous regulatory elements. Despite GFP accumulation in cell bodies (probably due to impaired trafficking), significant differences in GFP levels between dorsal and ventral LPLC2 neurons indicated that mRNA expression trends are maintained at the protein level (Extended Data Fig. 4i–l).

In summary, individual neurons of the same VPN type that sample different regions of visual space exhibit molecular heterogeneity. These neurons express gradients of recognition molecules that match the orientation of their synaptic gradients. Therefore, despite spatial intermingling, the axons retain distinct molecular identities. Next, we investigated the functional relevance of these molecular gradients.

LPLC2 neurons express genes encoding IgSF recognition proteins in a dorsoventral gradient, with dpr13 and beat-VI having higher expression levels in dorsal LPLC2 neurons and dpr17 having higher expression levels in ventral neurons. We hypothesized that one or more of these molecular gradients could specify the gradient in synapse number between LPLC2 axons and GF dendrites (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). If this were the case, the GF would need to express cell-surface proteins that bind to one or more of these three recognition molecules. This would allow the differential molecular expression in LPLC2 neurons to be converted into differential cell adhesion between individual LPLC2 neurons and the GF. Dpr proteins bind to DIP proteins, a related but different IgSF subfamily31. There are multiple paralogues of each, and interactions between them have been characterized37. Similarly, Beat proteins bind to Sides, which are also IgSF members31,38 (Fig. 3a). As a step towards testing our hypothesis, we assessed expression levels of genes encoding binding partners of Dpr13, Beat-VI and Dpr17 (DIP-ε, Side-II and DIP-γ, respectively) in the GF using HCR-FISH. DIP-ε, encoding a binding partner of Dpr13, was the only gene with strong expression in the GF during development (Fig. 3b,c).

To determine whether DIP-ε regulates synaptic connections between LPLC2 axons and GF dendrites, we explored the interaction between them in DIP-ε-deficient flies. Animals with no DIP-ε (DIP-εnull allele) displayed an approximately tenfold reduction in axo-dendritic overlap (Fig. 3d,e). Knockdown of DIP-ε specifically in the GF using two different RNA interference (RNAi) lines also significantly reduced this overlap (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 6c). Wild-type levels of overlap were restored in DIP-εnull flies through targeted expression of DIP-ε in the GF (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 6d). Thus, DIP-ε promotes interaction between LPLC2 axons and GF dendrites.

To assess whether this effect was associated with a decrease in synapse number, we visualized presynaptic sites (marked with T-bar-associated endogenously tagged Bruchpilot (Brp) protein) in sparsely labelled LPLC2 neurons using a modification of the synaptic tagging with recombination (STaR)39 technique (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). RNAi knockdown of DIP-ε in the GF led to a significant reduction in the number of LPLC2 T-bars contacting the GF dendrites (Extended Data Fig. 7c–f). Thus, DIP-ε is required in the GF to establish synaptic connectivity with LPLC2 axons.

If DIP-ε is required to form functional LPLC2–GF synapses, then we would expect loss of DIP-ε to reduce the GF responses and to disrupt short-mode takeoffs. We also anticipated that, if too few LPLC2–GF synapses formed to make a dorsoventral gradient, then the number of short-mode takeoffs would no longer increase with increasing elevation of the looming stimulus. To test these assumptions, we first performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the GF while presenting looming stimuli to both DIP-εnull and control flies. As predicted, we observed a reduction in the peak magnitude of the GF response in DIP-εnull animals and in those expressing DIP-εRNAi in the GF compared with controls (Fig. 3h,i and Extended Data Fig. 8). DIP-εnull and DIP-ε-RNAi-expressing animals also had dramatically reduced short-mode takeoffs across all stimulus elevations and a smaller difference between 0° and 77° than controls (Fig. 3j,k and Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). These results support a role for DIP-ε in the GF in establishing graded synaptic connectivity with LPLC2 neurons.

We next tested the causal role of the Dpr13–DIP-ε gradient on takeoff behaviour. We did this in two ways. First, we sought to retain strong LPLC2–GF connectivity while altering the connectivity gradient. To do this, we increased the level of dpr13 uniformly across the LPLC2 population (heretofore referred to as ‘overexpression', that is, superimposed on the endogenous dpr13 gradient). This disproportionately increased dpr13 mRNA expression in ventral LPLC2 neurons (193% in ventral versus 39% in dorsal; Extended Data Fig. 4g). Compared with controls, animals overexpressing dpr13 in LPLC2 exhibited a higher percentage of short-mode takeoffs (Fig. 3l and Extended Data Fig. 9c). This gain of function was most pronounced at lower (0°), decreased at medium (45°) and was absent at higher (77°) stimulus elevations, resulting in no significant change in short-mode escape frequency across elevations (that is, animals responded uniformly to dorsal and ventral looming stimuli). Thus, when the dpr13 gradient was flattened, the dorsoventral gradient of short-mode takeoffs was eliminated (Fig. 3l). This manipulation also led to a modest increase in LPLC2–GF axo-dendritic overlap (Fig. 3m and Extended Data Fig. 6e). Our data support a causal relationship between the level of dpr13 and the number and graded distribution of LPLC2 synapses onto the GF.

In a second series of experiments, we examined the consequences of removing Dpr13. dpr13null flies showed no reduction in the overlap between LPLC2 axons and GF dendrites or the number of LPLC2 T-bars contacting the GF dendrites (Fig. 3m and Extended Data Figs. 6f,g and 7c–f). This may be due to redundancy, as LPLC2 neurons also express four other Dprs that bind to DIP-ε (dpr14, dpr18, dpr19 and dpr20; Extended Data Fig. 6h,i). To test this, we ectopically expressed DIP-ε in LPLC2, promoting cis-interactions that block trans-interactions with the GF (an effect observed for other DIP–Dpr pairs40,41). This manipulation reduced LPLC2–GF overlap (Fig. 3o and Extended Data Fig. 6k,l), mimicking the phenotype of DIP-ε removal from the GF.

Of the Dpr paralogues that bind to DIP-ε, only Dpr13 is expressed in a graded manner (Extended Data Fig. 6j). Although dpr13null flies displayed no changes in the LPLC2–GF axo-dendritic overlap, they no longer maintained the dorsoventral gradient of short-mode takeoffs (Fig. 3n and Extended Data Fig. 9d). This mainly resulted from a significantly increased short-mode takeoff percentage at lower stimulus elevations. The reason for this is unknown. However, it raises the possibility that it is not the absolute level of Dpr13 expression that determines synapse number, but rather the relative differences in expression levels between different LPLC2 neurons.

In summary, DIP-ε and Dpr13 function as a ligand–receptor pair to regulate LPLC2–GF synaptic connectivity. Our findings support a model in which the gradient of Dpr13–DIP-ε interactions shapes the synaptic gradient (Fig. 3p).

We next investigated the function of other genes displaying dorsoventral expression gradients in LPLC2 neurons (Fig. 1k). beat-VI, encoding another IgSF recognition molecule38, exhibited a dorsoventral gradient, with higher expression in dorsal and lower expression in ventral LPLC2 neurons (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 10a). Neither the loss of Beat-VI nor its binding partner Side-II affected LPLC2–GF axo-dendritic overlap (Extended Data Fig. 10b,c). Given that LPLC2 dendrites also receive graded synaptic inputs (see below), we tested whether beat-VI controls this gradient.

Each LPLC2 neuron has four dendritic branches in the lobula plate (LoP), one in each layer, extending in four cardinal directions and corresponding to motion sensitivity in each layer6 (Fig. 4a, bottom). The response measured at the LPLC2 axon is a non-linear sum of the activity in each of these four branches. Individual LPLC2 neurons thus serve as local looming detectors. They respond most strongly to looming stimuli originating at their receptive field centre extending radially outwards and simultaneously generating motion in all four cardinal directions6. Using the FlyWire22,23 connectome, we found that two of the four classes of T4/T5 neurons, T4c/T5c and T4d/T5d, form antiparallel dorsoventral synaptic gradients onto LPLC2 dendrites in LoP3 and LoP4 layers, respectively (Fig. 4b).

We and others have shown that Beat-VI regulates synaptic specificity in the Drosophila motion detection system42,43. Beat-VI and its interacting partner Side-II38 are required for matching downwards motion-detecting T4d/T5d neurons with their postsynaptic partners (for example, LLPC3 and VS neurons) in LoP4 (refs. 42,43). Because LPLC2 is part of this circuit, we hypothesized that the Beat-VI gradient might selectively regulate the inputs of T4/T5d neurons to the dendrites of LPLC2 in LoP4.

We next sought to test whether the Beat-VI gradient regulates the gradient of synaptic inputs to LPLC2 in LoP4; that is, the dorsal and ventral LPLC2 neurons may receive different amounts of upwards and downwards motion information, potentially linked to the Beat-VI levels. Supporting this, RNAi knockdown of beat-VI altered LPLC2 dendritic morphology in a location-dependent manner. LoP4 branches were missing in dorsal LPLC2, moderately affected in central LPLC2 and unaffected in ventral LPLC2 neurons (Fig. 4c,d and Extended Data Fig. 10d,e). Removing Side-II from T4/T5 neurons produced a similar graded phenotype affecting dorsal, but not ventral, LPLC2 neurons (Fig. 4e). Thus, the severity of the loss-of-function phenotype correlated with the beat-VI expression level across LPLC2 neurons.

That beat-VI functions in an instructive manner was supported by the finding that overexpression of beat-VI selectively in LPLC2 caused the opposite effect, increasing LoP4 dendritic branch length in ventral, but not dorsal, LPLC2 neurons (Extended Data Fig. 10f–h). This phenotype corresponded to a relatively stronger increase in beat-VI mRNA levels across ventral, rather than dorsal, LPLC2 neurons (280% versus 81%, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 4h). These findings indicate that graded Beat-VI–Side-II interactions regulate synaptic connectivity between T4d/T5d axons and LPLC2 dendrites. As the dendrites of ventral LPLC2 neurons are unaffected in beat-VI and side-II removal, these dendrites must be regulated by a Beat-VI-independent mechanism or by such a mechanism acting in a redundant manner with Beat-VI and Side-II.

To determine whether loss of Beat-VI in LPLC2 has functional consequences, we assessed the response of LPLC2 neurons in head-fixed animals to small dark bars moving in different directions across a white background using calcium imaging (Fig. 5a–c and Extended Data Fig. 11a). Wild-type dorsal and ventral LPLC2 neurons exhibited different responses to these directional stimuli (Fig. 5d–g and Extended Data Fig. 11b–d,f). Ventral LPLC2 neurons showed little to no response to downwards motion, as would be expected if they received little input from downwards sensing T4d/T5d neurons in LoP4 (Figs. 4b and 5d–g and Extended Data Fig. 11b,c,f). By contrast, dorsal LPLC2 neurons were more sensitive to motion in both upwards and downwards directions (Fig 5d–g and Extended Data Fig. 11b,c,f). In response to beat-VI knockdown, dorsal LPLC2 neuron responses became biased for upwards motion similar to wild-type ventral neurons. This is consistent with the reduction of downwards-selective T4d/T5d input (that is, loss of LoP4 dendritic branches; Fig. 4c). However, beat-VI knockdown had little effect on ventral LPLC2 neurons, which remained biased for upwards motion (Fig. 5d–g and Extended Data Fig. 11c,f). Uniform overexpression of beat-VI in LPLC2 neurons superimposed on the normal beat-VI expression pattern caused the opposite effect. Dorsal neurons remained unaffected, whereas ventral neurons gained downwards motion sensitivity, making bidirectionally responsive-like wild-type dorsal neurons (Fig. 5d–g and Extended Data Fig. 11d,f). Thus, both beat-VI knockdown and overexpression disrupted the normal directional tuning biases across LPLC2 neurons (Fig. 5g,h and Extended Data Fig. 11e).

In summary, Beat-VI and Side-II act as a ligand–receptor pair to control synaptic connectivity between T4d/T5d and LPLC2 neurons. Our data support a model in which the dorsoventral gradient of Beat-VI–Side-II interactions contributes to the formation of the dorsoventral gradient of synaptic weights between T4d/T5d and LPLC2. This results in a decreased response to downwards motion by LPLC2 neurons with ventral receptive fields (Fig. 5i).

In this study, we identified the molecular origins of two parallel dorsoventral synaptic gradients in the axons and dendrites of looming-detecting LPLC2 neurons. These synaptic gradients translate retinotopic information from the visual field of the fly into specific motor outputs. We showed that a gradient of Beat-VI through interactions with its binding partner Side-II regulates graded synaptic inputs from T4d/T5d axons onto LPLC2 dendrites. This regulates differential integration of the downwards motion component of the looming stimulus across different regions of the eye. Similarly, a gradient of Dpr13 working through its binding partner DIP-ε shapes graded synaptic outputs of LPLC2 onto the GF. This biases the escape towards faster takeoffs in response to looming stimuli from the dorsal visual field.

These synaptic gradients, however, are distinct from each other. The dendritic synaptic gradient follows a retinotopic match between populations of presynaptic (T4d/T5d) and postsynaptic LPLC2 neurons (that is, many to many with retinotopy). By contrast, the axonal synaptic gradient follows a many-to-one pattern, in which multiple LPLC2 axons form different numbers of synapses onto a single GF neuron, independent of retinotopy. Despite these differences, both synaptic gradients rely on varying levels of recognition proteins across LPLC2 neurons, which establish synapse numbers that ultimately shape behaviour.

The relationship between the gradients of beat-VI and dpr13 expression and the number of synaptic inputs to and outputs from LPLC2 was also explored. In beat-VI loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments, the severity of functional effects and the extent of branching in LoP4 correlated with beat-VI expression levels. It remains unclear whether this phenotype arises from a failure to extend dendrites or to stabilize them. We propose that Beat-VI and Side-II promote adhesion between T4d/T5d axons and LPLC2 dendrites. This protein interaction could influence synapse number either indirectly, by increasing the area of contact between T4d/T5d axons and LPLC2 dendrites, or directly, by controlling synapse formation.

Similarly, Dpr13–DIP-ε interactions are required for LPLC2–GF synaptic connectivity. Loss of DIP-ε reduced the overlap between LPLC2 axons and GF dendrites, leading to significant defects in GF responses to looming. Analysing the loss of Dpr13 function is complicated by the expression of four additional Dpr paralogues in LPLC2, which bind to DIP-ε with similar affinities37. By ectopically expressing DIP-ε in LPLC2, we inhibited all DIP-ε-interacting Dprs in LPLC2. This mimicked the DIP-ε loss-of-function phenotype in the GF and provided additional support for the interactions between DIP-ε in the GF dendrites with its cognate Dprs in LPLC2 axons. We propose that multiple Dpr paralogues establish baseline LPLC2–GF connectivity, whereas Dpr13 specifically defines the synaptic gradient. In support of this, both gain and loss of Dpr13 function eliminated the graded behavioural response to dorsal versus ventral looming stimuli. Thus, Dpr13–DIP-ε interactions precisely regulate synapse number, forming a behaviourally relevant synaptic gradient. Future studies will explore the mechanistic basis of this regulation.

The Dpr13–DIP-ε gradient differs from Eph–Ephrin gradients in vertebrate retinotectal maps44. Although both relay visual-spatial information, they use different strategies. Ephrins and Ephs form topographical maps by maintaining retinotopy, ensuring the spatial relationship between retinal ganglion cells in the retina and the location of their axon terminals in the midbrain45. By contrast, the Dpr13–DIP-ε gradient translates retinal positional information into synapse numbers in the brain independent of anatomical mapping.

As most VPNs form synaptic gradients5, differential expression of recognitions molecules may be a common mechanism for synapse number regulation. In mammals, altering levels of SynCAM1, another IgSF molecule, also affects synapse number in the hippocampus46. Thus, cell recognition molecules not only match synaptic partners32,47 but their expression levels may also influence the number of synapses between matched neurons with functional and behavioural consequences. This variation holds enormous potential for fine-tuning behavioural responses driven by neural circuits.

Our work reveals continuous molecular heterogeneity within VPN cell types. This differs from discrete27,30 or stochastic48 variations in gene expression within neuronal types previously described in Drosophila. Beyond recognition molecules, we identified many graded genes in VPNs, suggesting that molecular gradients may regulate broader cellular functions. Cell types in the mammalian cortex also exhibit spatially patterned transcriptomic continuity7,49,50. Thus, within-cell-type molecular variation could be a common mechanism for generating neuronal diversity which, in turn, contributes to synaptic specificity.

In conclusion, we have described a molecular strategy regulating neural circuit assembly. This became possible by combining detailed electron microscopy connectomics16,21,22,23, single-cell genomics, genetics, physiology, biochemistry and behaviour. We anticipate that merging these approaches to study other circuits in the fly and mammalian brain51,52 will uncover new molecular principles underlying wiring specificity.

Flies were reared under standard conditions at 25 °C and 50% humidity with a 12-h light–12-h dark cycle on a standard cornmeal fly food. Supplementary Table 1 provides detailed descriptions of fly genotypes used in each experiment and origins of transgenic stocks. For developmental experiments, white pre-pupae (0 h APF) were collected and incubated at 25 °C for the indicated number of hours.

Virgin female flies carrying LPLC2, LPLC1 or LC4 split-GAL4 driver lines were crossed to male flies expressing a nuclear GFP reporter and carrying unique 3rd chromosomes from the isogenic wild-type strains with known genotypes (Drosophila Reference Genetic Panel (DGRP)29). Each experimental condition (cell type and time point) was crossed to six unique DGRP strains (see Supplementary Table 1 and Source Data for details; the LC4 driver was crossed into four DGRP strains for 72 and 96 h APF time points). Each of these crosses was considered independent biological replicates. F1 generation animals were collected at 0 h APF and incubated for either 48, 72 or 96 h at 25 °C. To introduce a control for developmental age, we split six DGRPs (for each cell type and time point) into equal ‘early' and ‘late' groups (Fig. 1h; see Source Data for a detailed breakdown). Animals from early DGRPs were continuously staged and collected within the 2-h time window, after which we continuously staged and collected animals from late DGRPs within the next 2-h time window. This ensured that by the time brains were dissected (after 48, 72 or 96 h), animals from the early group were on average 2 h older than their late counterparts. Brain dissociation was performed as previously described27. Single-cell suspensions were used to generate scRNA-seq libraries using the 10X Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ kit (v3.1) following the manufacturer's protocol. Each sample (corresponding to a single time point) was loaded to a single lane of 10X Chromium. The libraries were sequenced using NovaSeq 6000 platform, with 100 bp + 100 bp reads for the 48-h sample and 28 bp + 91 bp reads for the 72-h and 96-h samples. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the Technology Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics at UCLA.

Raw scRNA-seq reads were processed using Cell Ranger (10X Genomics, v7.1.0). The reference genome and gene annotations were downloaded from FlyBase54 (release 6.29). Each time point was processed separately. Six biological replicates were tagged with a unique wild-type chromosome, and demultiplexed based on a unique wild-type chromosome using demuxlet28 (v2; https://github.com/statgen/popscle). Demultiplexing was performed using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from seven DGRP strains used in experiments (see Supplementary Table 1 for the full list of genotypes and Source Data for the list of DGRP strains used for each genotype and time point) and three additional DGRP strains as negative controls (line_129, line_427 and line_712). SNPs were filtered using the following criteria: (1) only biallelic SNPs on the 3rd chromosome without missing data (called in all 10 strains); (2) non-reference allele only in 1 of 10 strains. We quantified allelic counts for filtered SNPs using samtools mpileup55 (v1.10). SNPs with a minimum total coverage of 10 in all three samples (time points) and a maximum non-reference allele frequency of 0.25 were kept for downstream analysis (34,655 SNPs). Only a few cells (0.1–0.2%) were erroneously assigned to negative controls; 5–15% of cells were classified as ‘doublets' and ‘ambiguous' (mostly cells with low transcript coverage). We removed cells with less than 10,000 or more than 50,000 transcripts per cell (and more than 10% of mitochondrial transcripts). The final dataset included 2,595 cells for 48 h APF, 2,369 cells for 72 h APF and 1,039 cells for 96 h APF.

The scRNA-seq analysis was performed using Seurat56 package (v5.0.1). The analysis was performed separately for each time point using the standard Seurat workflow: raw transcript counts were normalized, 1,000 highly variable genes were scaled and used for PCA, first 5 PCs were used for clustering (resolution of 0.05) and to calculate tSNE projections. We used tSNE projection only for the summary visualization of the dataset. Clusters were annotated based on known marker genes27 (Fig. 1i,j and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Most of the cells corresponded to LPLC2, LPLC1 and LC4 neurons. To explore further heterogeneity within VPN type, we subsetted each cell type at each time point, identified 500 highly variable genes and repeated PCA. We plotted known biological and technical covariates along each analysed PC (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3), including developmental age, DGRP genotype, sex and coverage (that is, transcripts per cell). PC1s in LPLC2 and LPLC1 did not correlate with any of these covariates and were driven by similar sets of genes (Fig. 1l,m and Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Further in vivo validations using orthogonal approaches confirmed that these PCs captured true molecular heterogeneity within each of these cell types (Fig. 2).

A high-throughput takeoff assay was performed with the FlyPEZ system25, which allows for the near-automated collection of fly behaviours in response to visual stimulation in large sample sizes. FlyPEZ experiments were performed as previously described25. A single stimulus was presented per fly. All behavioural experiments were performed 4 h before incubator lights were switched off, which coincides with the activity peak of the flies in the afternoon light cycle.

A 7-inch-diameter back-projection-coated dome was placed centred over the glass platform to present visual stimulation. Specifically, dark looming disks that approach the fly from azimuth of 0° (front looms) or 90° (side looms), at elevations of −30°, 0°, 23°, 45° or 77° in fly coordinates, were used. Looming stimuli were generated using the same equation as described for calcium imaging experiments (see below). All looming stimuli have l/v = 40 ms. Experiments in Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1a–c show trials that were performed in the past (from 2014 to 2024) using control flies shown looming disks with a starting size ranging from 1–30° expanding to either 45°, 90° or 180°. Experiments in Fig. 3 include trials with looming disks expanding from 10° to 180° only.

To quantify the duration of the takeoff sequence, videos were manually annotated to identify the start of the sequence (the first frame of wing rising) and the end of the sequence (the last frame that shows T2 legs in contact with the platform). Takeoff sequence durations between 0 ms and 7 ms were considered short-mode takeoffs, and takeoff sequence durations longer than 7 ms were considered long-mode takeoffs, as previously described20. The total takeoff percentage was calculated by the number of takeoffs divided by the total number of trials. Short-mode takeoff percentage was calculated by the number of short-mode takeoffs divided by the total number of takeoffs. For experiments in Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1a–c, takeoff sequence duration longer than 50 ms was eliminated as outliers. All takeoff sequence durations were less than 50 ms for experiments in Fig. 3.

Statistical comparison of the percentages of short-mode takeoffs was performed with the Chi-squared test, with post-hoc Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Statistical comparison of takeoff sequence distributions between two samples was performed with the Mann–Whitney U-test. Statistical comparison of takeoff sequence distributions between more than two samples was performed with the Kruskal–Wallis test, with post-hoc Dunn correction for multiple comparisons. Analysis and plotting were conducted with custom scripts in MATLAB 2022b, and Scipy 1.13.0 and Seaborn 0.13.2 in Python 3.

In vivo whole-cell, current-clamp electrophysiology was performed on behaving, tethered flies as previously described57.

Visual stimuli were back-projected onto a 4.5-inch diameter mylar cylindrical screen covering 180° in azimuth via two DLP projectors (Texas Instruments Lightcrafter 4500) as previously described57.

For electrophysiology experiments in Fig. 1, visual stimuli were back-projected at 360 Hz onto a 4-inch diameterdome at 768 × 768 resolution as previously described5. Looming visual stimuli were generated using Psychtoolbox as previously mentioned. To maximize GF responses, a column of three black looming disks was displayed on a white background on the experimentally accessible visual field of the fly from elevation of −25° to 25°. The looming disks expand from 0° to 30° at a constant velocity of 500° s−1. Looming stimuli from different elevations were shown in randomized order for five times per animal, with a 15-s inter-stimulus interval. The baseline region of each trial corresponded to the 2-s time window before the onset of the looming stimulus, and the response region was the 150-ms period after the onset of the stimulus. To estimate the magnitude of depolarization in response to looming stimuli, membrane potentials were averaged across individual trials, and the peak response (mV) and area (ms × mV) relative to the baseline were calculated in the 150-ms response region using custom MATLAB scripts. Statistical comparison of the looming responses in the GF across elevations was performed with repeated-measures one-way ANOVA test, with post-hoc Sidak correction for multiple comparisons.

Calcium imaging was performed with a VIVO Multiphoton Open (Intelligent Imaging Innovation, Inc.) system based on a moveable objective microscope (Sutter Instruments). The excitation of the sample was delivered by a Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon Vision I, Coherent) tuned to 920 nm with power ranging from 15 to 30 mW (depending on imaging depth). A dual axis mirror galvanometer was used for x–y laser scanning (RGG scanbox, Sutter Instrument). We imaged with a ×20 water-immersion objective (W Plan-Apochromat ×20/1.0 DIC, Zeiss) and a band-pass filter (Semrock 525/40 nm) was placed in front of the photomultiplier tube (H11706P-40, Hamamatsu) to reduce the blue light from the visual display. Microscope and data acquisition were controlled by Slidebook 2024 (Intelligent Imaging Innovation, Inc.). Single plane images were sampled at 9 Hz with a spatial resolution of approximately 180 × 180 pixels (95.7 × 95.7 μm, pixel size ≅ 0.53 μm and dwell time ≅ 2 μs). Images and external visual stimuli were synchronized a posteriori using frame capture markers (TTL pulses from Slidebook 2024) and stimulus events (analogue outputs from the visual display) sampled with a data acquisition device (USB-6229, National Instruments) at 10 kHz.

Flies were prepared and head-fixed to a custom objective stage fly holder as previously described53. The cuticle above the right optic lobe was removed and the brain bathed in isotonic saline. The holder with the tethered fly was placed under the objective at the centre of the visual display in the horizontal plane. GCaMP7f responses of dendritic branches from individual LPLC2 neurons were recorded from a posterior view. The fly head was pitched forwards, pointing down at the visual display so that the equator of the fly eye held a pitch angle of approximately 60° relative to the imaging plane. For each fly, we identified the most dorsocaudal dendritic arbors in the LoP and then moved the focal plane approximately 10 μm below them to start mapping the receptive field centres of dorsal LPLC2 neurons, or moved approximately 50 μm to probe ventral LPLC2 receptive fields, similarly to previous calcium imaging experiments in LPLC2 (ref. 6). Random steps (±5 μm) between these two bracketed Z-planes were used to probe the receptive field centres of dorsoventrally intermediate LPLC2 neurons. Unstable recordings or recordings from preparations that did not respond during the receptive field scanning trials were not included in the dataset.

A visual display composed of 48 8 × 8 dot matrix LED panels arranged in a semi-cylinder58 was used for visual stimulation as previously described53. Four layers of filter (071, LEE Filters) were placed over the display to reduce its light intensity. To compensate for the angle of the eye's equator and optimize the extension of the surrounding visual context, the display was tilted forwards at an angle of 30° from the horizontal plane. Visual presentation was confined to the right half of the visual field, ipsilateral to the recording site. Visual stimuli were generated and controlled using custom-written MATLAB (MathWorks) scripts that communicated to the display through the microcontroller serial port. Looming stimuli simulated an object approaching the fly at a constant velocity, equivalent to twice the inverse tangent of the ratio between the half-size and the approach speed of the object (see description of electrophysiological experiments). The display background was set to 70% maximum intensity, whereas foreground objects (looming or moving bars) were set to 0%. The set of visual stimuli was presented in random block design and repeated two times. Each visual stimulation lasted 4 s and was composed by 0.5 s of uniform background, and 0.5 s of visual motion followed by 3 s of static pattern. Each trial was followed by 3 s of rest in which flies faced the visual background.

We imaged from the unbranched neurite that connects an LPLC2 dendrites in the LoP to their dendrites in the lobula. Neurites in this location were previously shown to have weak responses to a small bar moving in each of four cardinal directions (that is, stimuli exciting LPLC2 dendrite branches in a single LoP layer) and a much larger response to looming (that is, stimuli exciting LPLC2 dendritic branches in all four LoP layers simultaneously)6. We identified an active neurite from a single neuron in the multiphoton field of view (Extended Data Fig. 11a). The receptive field centre of that neurite was identified in real-time and subsequently scanned for directional sensitivity. We developed a custom GUI in MATLAB, which allowed for real-time modifications to stimulus positions on the visual display. This interface enabled hand-triggered looming stimuli and the visual inspection of GCaMP responses. To identify the receptive field centre of an LPLC2 dendritic branch, we created a rectangular grid of 48 positions across the right half of the visual display.

The positions were spaced every five LEDs in both horizontal and vertical directions, with each LED covering approximately 2.2° on the retina at the eye's equator. Using the GUI, the experimenter presented a looming stimulus centred at each grid position. The looming stimulus simulated a circular object with a 0.5-cm radius, starting from a distance of 50 cm and travelling at 62.5 cm s−1. This caused the object to expand from 0.6° to 14° with a loom velocity (l/v) of 8 ms. If a response was visually detected, the surrounding grid positions were probed next. The position with the highest peak response was taken as the receptive field centre for the subsequent directional tuning experiment. We tested directional selectivity by moving a dark edge outwards from the centre of the receptive field in 24 different directions (Fig. 5b, top, and Extended Data Fig. 11). The edges moved at 20° s−1 with orientations ranging from 0° to 345° in 15° increments. Each edge subtended 15° at the eye's equator and swept 15° orthogonal to its orientation, filling a 15° black square upon completion. In addition, a looming stimulus centred within the receptive field, with the same dynamics as those used for the receptive field scans, was included in this battery of dark moving edges.

We sampled neurons along the dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes of the lobula and confirmed their anatomical locations by mapping the receptive field centres onto the fly eye (Fig. 5b, bottom). To identify the putative individual LPLC2 neurons stimulated by the receptive field centre scans, we mapped the horizontal coordinates of their retinal positions onto the 2D retinal ommatidia lattice. We identified specific dorsal and ventral retinal ommatidia and their corresponding columnar LPLC2 in the connectome, verifying the recorded locations of LPLC2 neurons (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 11a). Coordinates were calculated using a 3D reconstruction of the fly head, holder and visual display in AutoCAD (Autodesk). We estimated the fly ommatidia with overlapping horizontal coordinates through the following steps: (1) identified the locations of the ommatidia pointing to positions 16 and 40 based on a Mollweide projection of 3D ommatidia directions from a microCT scan59; (2) mapped these ommatidia locations onto identified visual columns of the male optic lobe connectome16; (3) used T4 neurons included in these visual columns to identify downstream LPLC2 neurons.

For each recording, the direction sensitivity index (DSI) was computed as follows:

where \({R}_{{\rm{up}}}\) is the peak response to an upwards moving edge (0° direction) and \({R}_{{\rm{down}}}\) is the peak response to a downwards moving edge (180° direction). The index ranged from −1 to 1, with negative values indicating downwards sensitivity and positive values indicating upwards sensitivity. The heatmap of the DSI for the tested positions was smoothed with a Gaussian filter (σ = 1).

Images exported from Slidebook 2024 were processed following established protocols53. We used a custom MATLAB toolbox developed by B. J. Hardcastle (available at https://github.com/bjhardcastle/SlidebookObj) to correct for motion artefacts in the x–y plane and to delineate regions of interest (ROIs) around individual LPLC2 neurites within the dendritic tree. For each recording, a time series was generated by calculating the mean fluorescence intensity of pixels within the ROI (Ft) in each frame. These mean values were then normalized to a baseline value using the formula:

where \({F}_{0}\) is the mean of Ft during the 0.5 s preceding stimulus onset. This approach ensures accurate correction for motion artefacts and reliable quantification of fluorescence intensity changes in LPLC2 neurites.

The time series for each ROI were then exported from MATLAB and imported in RStudio by using the R package ‘R. matlab'60. Custom R scripts were then written for data plotting and statistical analyses. Given the repeated sampling and unbalanced sample sizes between groups and conditions, we used linear mixed effects models to fit the DSI values. This method maintains statistical power by avoiding averaging procedures and provides more accurate estimates of model parameters, including both fixed and random effects. The fixed effects were defined by the interaction between genotype (control, beat-VI RNAi or UAS-beat-VI) and condition (dorsal or ventral), whereas the random effects were attributed to individual flies61,62. We modelled the data using the R package ‘lme4'63 assuming residuals followed a Gaussian distribution. ANOVA was then run for the model by using the R package ‘car'64. Pairwise post-hoc comparisons of the fixed effects were conducted using t-tests with Bonferroni adjustments, implemented through the R package ‘emmeans'65. With the same package, we calculated the Cohen's d effect sizes as the pairwise difference between model estimates divided by the standard deviation of the data (Supplementary Table 2). In addition, to estimate the mean DSI differences across groups and conditions without assuming a specific distribution, we performed standard bootstrap simulations with 10,000 replicates using the R package ‘boot'66,67. Dot plots were generated with the R package ‘ggplot2'68. Smoothed heatmaps were generated with the R package ‘spatstat'69.

The coding sequences of DIP-ε, dpr13 (isoform RB) and beat-VI were cloned into a modified pJFRC5 vector (Addgene: 5×UAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP, plasmid #26218) by replacing the mCD8::GFP coding sequence. Cloning strategies were designed using SnapGene 4.1.9 (GSL Biotech). Synthesis and cloning were carried out by Genewiz, Inc. Plasmids and sequences are available on request. Flies were generated by injecting the plasmid into embryos for recombination into attP1 sites (BDSC #8621) by BestGene, Inc.

The DIP-εnull allele was generated as previously described70. In brief, two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were used to generate a frameshift deletion in the DIP-ε coding sequence. High-score spacer sequences were chosen using the SSC tool71. Each sgRNA was cloned into pU6-2-sgRNA-short (Addgene #41700) plasmid and two plasmids were co-injected into the vas-Cas9 line (BDSC #51324) by Bestgene, Inc. Injected larvae were crossed with balancer lines and PCR screened in F1 for single flies carrying the deletion. A mutant stock was established from this single F1.

The sgRNA target sequences used for DIP-εnull allele generation were GCTGTTCTGTGGTCATACGATAGC and CTTCAATCGATTGACGGTGGAGC.

The dpr13null allele was similarly generated. sgRNA sequences were identified with an efficiency score above 5, as defined by the CRISPR Efficiency Predictor (https://www.flyrnai.org/evaluateCrispr/). The sgRNA sequence oligos were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies) and cloned into the pU6b-sgRNA-short vector72 to generate a large approximately 30-kb deletion spanning most of the dpr13 genomic region. All pU6 vectors generated were verified by Sanger sequencing. Two plasmids were co-injected into the vas-Cas9 line (BDSC #51323) in Bestgene, Inc. Injected larvae were crossed with balancer lines and PCR screened in F1 for single flies carrying the deletion. A mutant stock lacking the entire coding sequence of dpr13 was established from this single F1.

The sgRNA target sequences used for dpr13null allele generation were CGATATAATCCACTTGATGC and ACGTAGCAGCTCCAGGATGT.

Detailed protocols are available on request.

All protocols in immunohistochemistry and DPX mounting were performed exactly as described in our previous study5.

Immunofluorescence images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with 488-nm, 561-nm and 633-nm lasers using Zen digital imaging software with a Plan-Apochromat ×63/1.4 oil DIC M27 objective. Serial optical sections were obtained from whole-mount brains with a typical resolution of 1,024 μm × 1,024 μm, and 0.5-μm-thick optical sections. Image stacks were exported to either Fiji 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52k or Imaris 10.1 (Oxford Instruments) for level adjustment, cropping, removal of off-target brain regions and background noise, and 3D volume reconstructions.

To measure the axo-dendritic overlap between LPLC2 axons and GF dendrites, confocal image stacks of colocalized LPLC2 glomeruli and GF dendrites were imported into Imaris 10.1 for 3D reconstruction using the Surfaces tool to create masks for membranes of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons from the corresponding channels. A Surfaces detail value of 1 μm was used for both LPLC2 and GF surfaces to ensure accurate reconstruction. Background subtraction was applied with a diameter of the largest sphere that fits into the object set to 1 μm to minimize noise and nonspecific signals. The overlap between the two reconstructed surfaces was then assessed to quantify the spatial relationship between the LPLC2 axons and GF dendrites. A similar approach was used to measure the overlap between Brp puncta and the GF dendrites in STaR experiments (Extended Data Fig. 7), but the number of overlapping reconstructed surfaces was considered regardless of the overlap. To measure LoP4 dendritic branch length in sparsely labelled LPLC2 neurons, corresponding image stacks were imported into Fiji 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52k, rotated so that LoP3 and LoP4 branches were oriented antiparallel, and the distance from the point of bifurcation to the most distal tip of the LoP4 branch was measured along Lop4. Dorsoventral differences in Beat-VI and Dpr13 at the protein level were measured in FIJI 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52k. ROIs corresponding to the cell bodies dorsal or ventral LPLC2 clones were drawn manually. Mean grey value (average pixel intensity) was used as a proxy of the GFP fluorescence intensity and was measured for two ROIs per sample after background subtraction.

Tissue staining, gelation and expansion for ExLSM protocols were adapted from Sanfilippo et al.73 with minor changes. After dissection, fixation and permeabilization, brains were stored in RNAse-free 0.5% PBST containing anti-GFP nanobody (N0304-At488-L, NanoTag Biotechnologies) overnight at 4 °C. All samples were subsequently processed using a protein and RNA retention ExM protocol with minor modifications73,74 and minor adjustments for the fly brain34.

The HCR-FISH protocol was adapted from Wang et al.74 with minor optimizations for the fly brain34. Following digestion with proteinase K, gels with embedded brains were washed three times with PBS, transferred into 24-well plates (4624-24, Laguna Scientific) and digested with DNAse diluted in RDD buffer (RNase-Free DNase Set, 79254, Qiagen) to limit DAPI signal to RNA only and facilitate subsequent analysis for 2 h at 37 °C. After three washes in PBS, gels were equilibrated in probe hybridization buffer (Molecular Instruments) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then transferred to new 24-well plates containing custom-designed probes (Molecular Instruments) diluted in pre-warmed probe hybridization buffer (1 μl of 1 μM stock probe solution per 200 μl of buffer) and left shaking overnight at 37 °C. The following day, gels were washed four times with pre-warmed probe wash buffer (Molecular Instruments) for 20 min at 37 °C, then washed twice for 5 min with SSCT buffer (SSC with 0.05% Triton X-100; AM9763, Thermo Fisher) at room temperature and transferred to new 24-well plates with HCR amplification buffer (Molecular Instruments) for equilibration. Hairpins (HCR Amplifiers, Molecular Instruments) conjugated with AF546 or SeTau647 dyes were diluted in amplification buffer (2 μl of each hairpin per 100 μl of buffer), heat-activated in a thermal cycler (90 s at 95 °C), removed and kept for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. After 30 min, the hairpins were added to the 24-well plates with gels (300 μl per well) and incubated with shaking at room temperature in the dark for 3 h. The hairpin solution was then removed, and the gels were washed four times with SSCT and two times with SSC for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Gels were subsequently stored at 4 °C in SSC until final expansion.

Samples were expanded to approximately three time in 0.5× PBS containing 1:1,000 SYTO-DAPI (S11352, Thermo Fisher) at room temperature for 2 h before mounting onto PLL-coated coverslips (see description for DPX mounting above). The coverslips were then bonded with Bondic UV-curing adhesive (Bondic starter kit, Bondic) onto a custom-fabricated sample holder (Janelia Tech ID 2021-021) to be suspended vertically in the imaging chamber. Mounted samples were imaged in 0.5× PBS with 1:10,000 SYTO-DAPI after a minimum of 1 h of equilibration in the imaging chamber. Unexpanded gels were stored at 4 °C in 1X PBS + 0.02% sodium azide (S8032, Sigma-Aldrich) for up to 14 days before final expansion and imaging.

Images were acquired on a Zeiss LS7 microscope equipped with 405-nm, 488-nm, 561-nm and 638-nm lasers. Illumination optics with a ×10/0.2 NA were used for excitation (400900-9020-000, Zeiss). Detection was performed using a W Plan-Apochromat ×20/1.0 DIC M27 water immersion objective (421452-9700-000, Zeiss). The LS7 optical zoom was set to 2.5×, resulting in a total magnification of ×50. DAPI and Alexa Fluor 546 dyes were simultaneously excited by the 405-nm and 561-nm laser lines, and emission light was separated by a dichroic mirror SBS LP 510 with emission filters BP 420-470 (404900-9312-000, Zeiss) and a modified BP 527/23 (ET672/23m, Chroma). Similarly, Alexa Fluor 488 and SeTau647 dyes were simultaneously excited via 488 nm and 638 nm, and the emission was split through a dichroic SBS LP 560 with emission filters BP 505-545 and LP 660 (404900-9318-000, Zeiss). To eliminate laser transmission, a 405/488/561/640 laser blocking filter (404900-9101-000, Zeiss) was added to the emission path. Images were captured using dual PCO.edge 4.2 detection modules (400100-9060-000, Zeiss) with a 50-ms exposure time. Filter and camera alignment were manually calibrated before each imaging session. Image volumes were acquired at optimal Z-step and light-sheet thickness, and the Pivot Scan feature was used to reduce illumination artefacts by sweeping the light sheet in the xy plane. The LS7 microscope was operated using ZEN Black 3.1 (v9.3.6.393).

The full details of our analysis are available in our previous publication35. The acquired light-sheet z-stacks, stored in CZI format, were imported and pre-processed to remove noise and artefacts generated by the imaging modality. These artefacts included limited channel contrast, variations in contrast across images within a dataset, background noise fluctuations due to both intra-channel variations and inter-channel crosstalk, and localized brightness changes caused by varying fluorophore concentrations within and among stained nuclei. Pre-processing involved the following steps: full-scale contrast stretching to normalize luminosity across different channels, local background removal using a 3D Gaussian filter, a second full-scale contrast stretching to compensate for any contrast loss due to background removal, and a final median filter to eliminate any remaining localized noise. These pre-processed stacks served as the starting point for instance segmentation of the nuclei. First, nuclear centres were identified using a Laplacian-of-Gaussian filter. Then, the imaged volume was subdivided into 3D Voronoi cells, using the detected centres as seeds and Euclidean distance. Each cell contained one nucleus, which was segmented using a threshold obtained by minimizing an energy functional designed to find the optimal surface separating the nucleus from the surrounding cytoplasm. Once nuclei were segmented, the FISH puncta were identified within the associated 3D volume using a Laplacian-of-Gaussian filter, and only the puncta within the nucleus region and its immediate surrounding volume were counted. Pre-processed products, segmented nuclear features, associated FISH puncta, and their features were stored for further analysis. Puncta counts were normalized by the maximum count for each brain. The significance of gene expression relationships inferred from HCR-FISH (Fig. 2) was assessed using both a linear regression model and a multi-level negative binomial generalized linear mixed model, accounting for inter-animal heterogeneity: random effects were attributed to individual animals (Supplementary Table 2). The package was written in Python, is open source and is available for download on GitHub (https://github.com/avaccari/DrosophilaFISH).

To assess gene expression patterns within VPN cell types, we used a combination of GAL4 and LexA binary expression systems. Expression of a LexAop-FRT-stop-FRT-membrane marker controlled by a cell-type-specific LexA driver remained blocked until the FRT-stop-FRT cassette was excised by Flippase, driven by a gene-specific T2A-GAL4 driver line75. In addition, a constitutive membrane marker controlled by the same LexA driver was used to visualize the entire cell population. The list of fly stocks used is available in Supplementary Table 1.

To visualize single-cell morphology of LPLC2 dendrites in the LoP (Fig. 4) and to perform HCR-FISH analysis (Extended Data Fig. 4), we used MultiColor FlpOut76, a genetic tool for sparse labelling of individual cells within a population downstream of a given GAL4 driver. Twenty-four-hour-old pupae were heat shocked in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min to achieve the labelling of one LPLC2 neuron per hemibrain on average.

To analyse the FlyWire connectome, we developed an open-source Python package, available on GitHub (https://github.com/avaccari/DrosophilaCon). The primary library used by DrosophilaCon to interface with the FlyWire connectome is fafbseg23,77 (v3.0.0). This package enables users to specify the labels of ‘source' and ‘target' neurons and generates a connectivity diagram where target neurons are colour-coded based on the total count of synapses with the source neurons. Once the labels are specified, the package queries the latest available annotations to identify all neurons matching (or containing) the labels. The primary sources of annotation used to identify the neurons are: (1) free-form community annotations provided through the neuroglancer user interface (https://github.com/google/neuroglancer); (2) systematic annotations for the entire brain23; and (3) systematic cell types for the right optic lobe78.

Next, the latest version of the FlyWire production dataset was queried for the adjacency matrix representing the connectivity between each neuron in the source and each neuron in the target on the selected side of the brain. This information was returned as an adjacency table, providing the counts of synapses between each source–target pair. There are two versions of the synapse datasets: one filtered by synaptic cleft and one unfiltered. We used the unfiltered dataset because the filtered version applies a fixed threshold for distance, resulting in reduced synapse counts. The adjacency table was used to evaluate the total synapse counts for each target neuron. These counts were normalized by the maximum count observed across all target neurons. The mesh representation for each identified target neuron was downloaded from the FlyWire dataset, skeletonized for optimized processing and visualized with colour-coding corresponding to the normalized synapse count, allowing for comparison across different source–target pairs.

All statistical analyses were performed using RStudio 1.4.1103, MATLAB 2022b or Prism 9.2.0 (GraphPad). Significance levels were defined as follows: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001 for all figures. Statistical tests were chosen based on data distribution, which was assessed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test in R with a P value threshold of less than 0.05 for normality. Two groups of normally distributed datasets were tested for statistically significant differences using unpaired t-tests with Welch's correction for non-identical variance. For comparisons involving more than two groups, we used either one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference test for post-hoc pairwise comparisons or the Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons post-hoc test with Bonferroni correction. Binary data were compared using Chi-squared tests. Detailed statistical analyses for behavioural data, HCR-FISH data and neuroanatomical data are described in Supplementary Table 2. All other statistical tests, number of replicates, significance levels and other elements of the statistical analysis (including measure of centre and error bars) have been reported within the corresponding figure legends. No data were excluded from the analysis unless specified in the corresponding Methods section. All neuroanatomical and behavioural measurements were taken from distinct samples (that is, individual brains or hemibrains and individual flies, one takeoff per fly).

X indicates unknown ectopic cell types. c, Heatmaps of the expression patterns of the top 30 genes with the highest contribution (loading) to differentially expressed genes along Principal Component 1 (PC1, 15.2% variance explained) across LPLC1 neurons at 48 h APF (see Fig. 1 legend for details). Genes encoding cell recognition molecules (IgSF superfamily) are highlighted in bold. d, PCA plots of LPLC1 neurons at 48, 72, and 96 h APF, colored by the expression levels of two cell recognition molecules from c. e, PCA plots of LPLC2, LPLC1, and LC4 neurons at 48 h APF colored by genotype, age (early vs late collection), genotype (DGRP line), sex (male-specific transcript), and coverage.

Source data

a-b, PCA plots of LPLC2, LPLC1 and LC4 neurons at 72 h APF (a) and 96 h APF (b) colored by genotype, age (early vs late collection), genotype (DGRP line), sex (male-specific transcript), and coverage. Shown are PC1-6. Variance explained by PC1 at 72 h: 32% for LPLC2, 17% for LPLC1, 11% for LC4. Variance explained by PC1 at 96 h: 28% for LPLC2, 15% for LPLC1, 21% for LC4. c-e, Scatter plots of LPLC2 cells (48 h APF) embedded in the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) colored by their cluster labels (n = 2, inferred from K-means clustering). PCs are calculated using the top 1000 highly variable genes based on the actual data (c), after shuffling gene expression levels for each gene independently across all cells (d), and after shuffling each gene only within each cluster (e), respectively. Shuffling gene expression across all cells (d) disrupts this gradient, indicating that the observed differences reflect coordinated gene expression rather than uncorrelated variation. Shuffling within each cluster (e) disrupts the internal gradient of each cluster, creating artificial gaps not present in the original data (c), which suggests that the continuous gradient observed in the original data cannot be represented as a set of discrete clusters. f, Scatter plots of cells in PCA embeddings after shuffling genes within each cluster for an increasing number of fine-grained clusters (n = 2,5,30). g, Gap size as a function of the number of clusters. Gap size is defined as the minimum distance in PC1 and PC2 space needed to connect 90% of cells into a single graph component. The gap size decreases and plateaus as the number of clusters increases. This means that a continuum can be approximated by a large number of discrete clusters. However, a small number of clusters (like 2) is insufficient to capture the continuous nature of the data.

Metrics details

Building a useful photonic quantum computer requires robust techniques to synthesize optical states that can encode qubits. Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill (GKP) states1 offer one of the most attractive classes of such qubit encodings, as they enable the implementation of universal gate sets with straightforward, deterministic and room temperature-compatible Gaussian operations2. Existing pioneering demonstrations generating optical GKP states3 and other complex non-Gaussian states4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 have relied on free-space optical components, hindering the scaling eventually required for a utility-scale system. Here we use an ultra-low-loss integrated photonic chip fabricated on a customized multilayer silicon nitride 300-mm wafer platform, coupled over fibre with high-efficiency photon number resolving detectors, to generate GKP qubit states. These states show critical mode-level features necessary for fault tolerance, including at least four resolvable peaks in both p and q quadratures, and a clear lattice structure of negative Wigner function regions, in this case a 3 × 3 grid. We also show that our GKP states show sufficient structure to indicate that the devices used to make them could, after further reduction in optical losses, yield states for the fault-tolerant regime. This experiment validates a key pillar of bosonic architectures for photonic quantum computing2,12, paving the way for arrays of GKP sources that will supply future fault-tolerant machines.

Photonic architectures for quantum computing share a common challenge: converting the classical light provided by conventional sources such as lasers into non-classical resource states that accommodate digital qubit encodings and convenient logical gate operations. High-purity sources of such states invariably rely on parametric nonlinear optical interactions and photon counting; the long and established history of quantum optics owes many of its pioneering accomplishments to spontaneous parametric downconversion and spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM). These mainstays of photonics provide squeezed vacuum states on demand, which are useful in their own right for quantum sensing13 and fundamental quantum information processing tasks14. However, further processing is required to yield useful qubit states for computation.

For linear-optical quantum computing15, the traditional processing approach is to pump the nonlinear interaction weakly and generate a two-mode squeezed vacuum state with small squeezing amplitude. Sending one output arm to single-photon detectors enables single-photon states to be heralded with low probability, offering a probabilistic source of high-purity single photons for use in dual-rail qubit encoding schemes16. Multiplexing techniques17 can then be applied to boost probabilities to sufficient levels for computation, provided optical losses associated with the multiplexer components can be mitigated. However, even with sufficiently high-probability qubit generation, implementing gate operations with single-photon dual-rail-encoded qubits is non-deterministic, leading to extra multiplexing requirements after input state synthesis. Furthermore, the single-photon detectors required to access a universal set of gates leads to nearly all components preferring integration within a cryogenic environment18.

Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill (GKP) states1 offer a powerful alternative photonic qubit encoding that bypasses many of the challenges associated with optical quantum gate implementation. By leveraging the full infinite-dimensional Hilbert space hosted by an optical mode, qubit states can be accessed for which Clifford operations are implemented deterministically using only beamsplitters, phase shifters and homodyne detectors. Non-Clifford gates are in turn accessed through the preparation of qubit magic states2. This family of states also enjoys an innate resistance against Gaussian errors, including those arising from small levels of optical loss19. Their uses extend beyond purely computation; they are promising candidates for applications in quantum communication20,21 and sensing22. Fault-tolerant cluster states can be built deterministically from beamsplitters and sources of single-mode GKP states defined over any phase-space lattice23. A full architecture2,12 comprises three stages: initial state creation, refinement and cluster state synthesis, as shown in Fig. 1, with optical GKP qubit creation being the key technological bottleneck. High-quality GKP states have been reported in trapped ion24,25 and superconducting circuit platforms26,27,28, but their use for large-scale quantum computation in those domains does not enjoy the ease of scaling and networking available to photonic approaches12. To fully leverage the attractive features of GKP qubits, a source of such states in the optical domain is needed.

GKP qubits are generated using GBS sources. Many GBS outputs are combined at a refinery to boost the overall quality and probability of GKP sources12. Arbitrary cluster states can be synthesized from these states deterministically using a network of beamsplitters23. The need for scalable fabrication of GBS sources is evident for a scalable and high-quality cluster state.

Here we report the synthesis and characterization of optical GKP qubit states in the 1,550-nm wavelength band. These states show several quantitative and qualitative features that place them on a clear path to compatibility with future utility-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. Furthermore, the techniques used to generate these states are rooted in a technological context that enables scalability to the millions of independent sources eventually required to furnish such a machine with sufficient qubits for useful applications12. Thus, we use photonic integrated circuits manufactured on a customized silicon nitride 300-mm wafer platform using a fabrication process that was specially optimized for low optical loss, the most critical physical imperfection for these systems, while preserving the nonlinearity needed for non-classical light generation. For state heralding, we use custom efficiency-optimized transition edge sensor detectors with measured detection efficiencies as high as \(99.8{9}_{-0.53}^{+0.11} \% \), providing intrinsic photon number resolution. This convergence of advances in chip fabrication and detection, combined with techniques for rigorous optimization of programmed circuit parameters for state synthesis, produces a source of GKP qubits that we show is directly connected (after further necessary improvements in optical losses) to a device compatible with fault-tolerant operation.

The approach used in this experiment to synthesize GKP states relies on linear-optical interference to entangle four separate single-mode squeezed states, followed by heralding from photon number resolving (PNR) detection on three of the output modes using transition edge sensor detectors12. We refer to this as a four-mode Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) source or GBS device. The level of squeezing, interferometer settings and photon detection pattern determine which state is heralded (exact settings can be found in the Supplementary Information).

A high level schematic of the experiment is shown in Fig. 2. The chip used in this experiment was fabricated on a low-loss silicon nitride (SiN) waveguide platform and integrates all the elements necessary to prepare a multi-mode entangled Gaussian state. The chip is optically packaged using fibre array units (FAUs), and electrically packaged by wire bonding. On the chip, to produce single-mode squeezed states of light, degenerate SFWM is resonantly enhanced using an array of integrated micro-ring multiresonator devices based on a photonic molecule design optimized to suppress unwanted parasitic nonlinearities29. The SFWM is pumped by pulsed light from two pump lasers (P1 and P2), input to the chip together with control light (locks) for stabilizing the micro-ring resonators and the optical phase of the generated state. Following the chip layout of Fig. 2, the light input to the chip is first filtered using an asymmetric Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI) to suppress noise photons at the squeezing wavelength. Using three symmetric MZIs, the pump light is distributed to the four on-chip squeezers to generate nonlinear gain consistent with 10 dB of squeezing (before loss) from each of the first two squeezers and 8 dB of squeezing (before loss) from each of the second two squeezers. The generated squeezing is near-single mode with measured Schmidt number of K = 1.12 (Supplementary Information). Following squeezing generation, the pump and resonator control light is filtered out using asymmetric MZIs and collected for monitoring and stabilization purposes. The squeezed states propagate through a linear-optical interferometer, programmed to prepare a four-mode entangled state designed for heralding GKP states. Finally, the four-mode state is coupled out of the chip. Three modes are filtered using fibre coupled wavelength division multiplexing filters and measured using PNR detection, while the remaining mode is measured using balanced homodyne detection for state tomography. To prevent pump light leaking into the homodyne detection, the first mode sent to the homodyne detector is filtered using an on-chip asymmetric MZI just before light is coupled out of the chip. Another filter is present in the second mode, allowing the experiment to be reconfigured to operate the chip as a three-mode GBS source were we to disable the first mode and use the second mode as the output mode.

A series of pump and reference laser fields are sent over fibre to the input of an optically and electrically packaged chip. The strong classical fields are filtered and distributed (1) to an array of four squeezers based on a two-resonator photonic molecule design (2). The generated pulsed, nearly single-temporal-mode, squeezed vacuum states are separated from the pump laser light by on-chip optical filters (3), before being entangled by a programmable linear interferometer or unitary (4). Another array of integrated filters further suppresses the pump light (5). Three of the optical modes are sent to PNR detectors that, when the correct detection pattern is observed, herald the production of a GKP qubit state in the remaining optical mode, which is then analysed using homodyne detection (HD).

The experiment is operated at a 200 kHz repetition rate. At every repetition, the outcome of the three PNR detectors, (n1, n2, n3), is recorded together with the quadrature measurement in the homodyne detection. Data from a total of 12.8 × 109 repetitions are recorded and sorted by PNR outcome. We discard 20% of the noisiest PNR outcomes from each PNR detector to reduce counts from stray light (Supplementary Information), and a corresponding density matrix is then reconstructed from the quadrature measurements of the remaining PNR outcomes. The linear-optical interferometer and squeezing levels were optimized for the (3, 3, 3) PNR outcome, heralded with 2.9 × 10−4 success probability leading to a 58 Hz success rate before discarding PNR outcomes and a 0.83 × 58 Hz ≈ 30 Hz success rate with the chosen discarding ratio. The resulting state is shown in Fig. 3a, and is a rectangular GKP state, where rectangular refers to the lattice structure of the Wigner function. In general, if one has a reconfigurable GBS device that can prepare a GKP state with one lattice, then one can always map to a new set of parameters that will produce a GKP state on a different target lattice, because the two lattices are related by a Gaussian transformation30,31. In this device, we did not have the full reconfigurability needed to target an arbitrary lattice as, for ease of calibration, the input squeezing levels in the first two modes were constrained to be equal. Instead, we used simulations of the device (Supplementary Information) subject to that constraint to find device settings that optimized the GKP figure of merit (Methods) for the (3, 3, 3) PNR detection outcome, resulting in a rectangular lattice. Following the Z-basis convention from Gottesman et al.1, this is equivalent to a GKP \(| 1\rangle \) state in the code space stabilized by a position shift of α and momentum shift of 4π/α, where α = 1.86. Here we have set ħ = 1 and adopt this convention throughout the remainder of this work.

a, Wigner function heralded by the (n1, n2, n3) = (3, 3, 3) PNR outcome with position, q, and momentum, p, quadrature probability (prob) distributions and symmetric, p and q effective squeezing (\({\varDelta }_{\text{sym}}^{2}\), \({\varDelta }_{p}^{2}\), and \({\varDelta }_{q}^{2}\), respectively) shown. White and grey homodyne bins corresponding to a rectangular GKP lattice indicating probability overlap with obtaining 0/1 and +/– outcomes. The state generated is a GKP \(| 1\rangle \) state on a rectangular lattice. b, Wigner functions of a subset of heralded states for different PNR heralding pattern, (n1, n2, n3): (1, 1, 1) shows a heralded cat state; (1, 3, 3), a GKP state with hexagonal lattice structure; and (3, 3, 5) and (4, 4, 4) show rectangular GKP states. States presented in a and b are reconstructed by state tomography using up to 2 × 106 quadrature measurements for the (1, 1, 1) and (1, 3, 3) state, and roughly 5.9 × 105, 3.6 × 105 and 1.9 × 106 quadrature measurements for the (3, 3, 5), (4, 4, 4) and (3, 3, 3) states, respectively. Each colour bar range shows the minimum and maximum of the corresponding Wigner function. The ħ = 1 convention is used.

Despite targeting a particular GKP state for a fixed outcome pattern of (3, 3, 3), in Fig. 3b we report examples of non-Gaussian states containing Wigner negativity heralded by other outcome patterns (see Supplementary Information for more discussion). Outcome (1, 1, 1) heralds Schrödinger cat states containing three negative regions. Outcome (1, 3, 3) heralds states with a hexagonal lattice structure. Outcome (4, 4, 4) heralds states with a 4 × 3 grid structure. We also find examples such as the (3, 3, 5) events in which the state produced has a 3 × 3 grid structure, as in Fig. 3a, and could be used in a refinery12 to help boost the probability of GKP qubit generation (Fig. 1).

The quality of approximate GKP states can be quantified using the stabilizer expectation values (see Methods for more details). In this experiment, we produced an approximate GKP state heralded by PNR pattern (3, 3, 3) with stabilizer expectation values \(| \langle {\widehat{S}}_{p}\rangle | =0.273\pm 0.0012\) and \(| \langle {\widehat{S}}_{q}\rangle | =0.241\pm 0.002\), where \({\widehat{S}}_{p}={{\rm{e}}}^{i\alpha \widehat{p}}\), \({\widehat{S}}_{q}={{\rm{e}}}^{2{\rm{\pi }}i\widehat{q}/\alpha }\) and α = 1.86. This corresponds to effective squeezing in each quadrature of \({\varDelta }_{p}^{2}=0.82\pm 0.02\) and \({\varDelta }_{q}^{2}=0.43\pm 0.02\) dB, and symmetric effective squeezing of \({\varDelta }_{{\rm{sym}}}^{2}=0.62\pm 0.02\) dB. The uncertainties are estimated by bootstrapping (Supplementary Information). Integrating the state's position and momentum probability distributions against the binning functions shown in Fig. 3a allows us to compute Pauli expectation values for the qubit, resulting in \((\langle \widehat{x}\rangle ,\langle \widehat{y}\rangle ,\langle \widehat{z}\rangle )=(-0.002\pm 0.002,-0.002\pm 0.0013,-0.313\pm 0.003)\) (reconstructed marginal data for Pauli-y available in the Supplementary Information). It is worth noting that the stabilizer expectation values for the state generated exceeds the simultaneous maximum, which can be achieved with a Gaussian pure state, \(| \langle {\widehat{S}}_{p}\rangle | =| \langle {\widehat{S}}_{q}\rangle | =0.208\) (Supplementary Information).

Our work delivers optical states with two key structural features that are critical for fault tolerance: both position and momentum probability distributions show four resolvable peaks, and the state has high degree of non-Gaussianity as measured by the number of negative regions in the Wigner function. Having a greater number of peaks in the q quadrature is necessary for reaching the higher p-effective squeezing (\({\varDelta }_{p}^{2}\)) values, with four peaks being in principle sufficient for reaching 10-dB quality states (and similarly for peaks in p and \({\varDelta }_{q}^{2}\)), as shown in supplementary fig. S1 of Aghaee et al.12. Wigner negativity is a necessary resource for universal quantum computation32, and Wigner functions for GKP states consist of a lattice of positive and negative peaks in phase space1; here we see our state achieves a 3 × 3 grid of negative Wigner regions.

If the levels of loss were reduced further, then our simulations show that the device used in this experiment would be capable of producing states with quality sufficient for fault tolerance. The current experiment already satisfies the required number of peaks in position and momentum. Effective squeezing can be improved by reducing loss, as shown in Fig. 4. Estimates for transmission in the optical paths to the PNR detectors and to the homodyne detectors in this experiment are in the 78–82% range, resulting in the (3, 3, 3) PNR pattern yielding the highest symmetric effective squeezing. Were the end-to-end transmission, from squeezing generation to detection, to exceed around 99.5%, many PNR patterns of the form (n, n, n) with n > 7 produce GKP states with symmetric effective squeezing greater than 9.75 dB, which is the fault-tolerance threshold from Aghaee et al.12. This is also consistent with an analysis of stellar rank (Supplementary Information).

Symmetric effective squeezing for simulated output states of the four-mode GBS device as a function of the transmission of the heralding and heralded paths, η. Here we restrict to outcomes of the form (n, n, n) as they are among the highest quality output states. We see for transmissions in the range of 70–82% that the (3, 3, 3) outcome (dashed line) is best, as presented in this experiment. As transmission crosses 99.5%, the device is sufficient for making approximate GKP states compatible with fault tolerance.

The specific photonic circuit used in our demonstration was selected to yield a richly featured GKP state in the presence of moderate losses and without the complicating additions of further processing stages after heralding. Although we have shown that this device architecture is in principle sufficient for generating GKP states compatible with fault tolerance, the required losses would be below 1%. A more general loss-tolerant architecture was presented in Aghaee et al.12. There it was shown that GBS devices with fewer modes (two or three) are probably preferable for a full-scale system, when many PNR outcomes are used to herald states, and multiplexing and breeding33,34,35,36 stages are implemented after the GBS devices to boost the success probability, quality and overall loss tolerance, thereby reaching loss tolerance in the range of 1%. The four-mode GBS device architecture from our experiment is from the same ‘staircase' family of devices presented in the supplementary section IV of Aghaee et al.12, and could be easily modified for incorporation into a full-scale system. From Fig. 3b we see that several outcomes herald states with a grid structure. As the quality of the states produced increases, the probability could simultaneously be improved by accepting states heralded by a greater number of outcomes, with small deviations in the lattice structure being accounted for by means of measurement-based squeezing or adaptive breeding operations12,36 (discussion in the Supplementary Information). With continuing loss reduction in chip components, fabrication and packaging, alongside development of suitable chip platforms for multiplexing and breeding, we expect future demonstrations to yield GKP qubit states of even higher quality. Our results thus illuminate an encouraging development path towards GKP qubit generation for fault-tolerant photonic quantum computers.

Here we provide experimental details on each major component in this experiment: the laser subsystem, photonic integrated chip, PNR detectors for state heralding and the homodyne detection system used for state tomography. Further details can be found in the Supplementary Information.

The laser subsystem is composed of five lasers: two lasers (P1 and P2) for driving the dual-pump SFWM process that generates squeezing, a local oscillator laser used to perform homodyne detection and also as a frequency reference, a reference laser used to stabilize the optical phase of the quantum state and a probe laser to lock the resonance frequency of the on-chip resonators. The phase and frequency of each of these lasers are stabilized by comparing it to the local oscillator, which thus serves as a frequency and/or phase reference for the entire experiment. A portion of the local oscillator is deeply phase modulated using fibre optic phase modulators to produce an electro-optic frequency comb that spans more than 1.2 THz. Each laser is locked to one tooth of the frequency comb using an optical phase-locked loop. Using amplitude modulators, 0.5-ns pump pulses are prepared from P1 and P2, 25-ns local oscillator pulses are prepared from the local oscillator and interleaved pulses are prepared from the reference laser (20 ns) and the probe laser (100 ns). Pulses are prepared with 200 kHz repetition rate. The P1, P2 and local oscillator pulses are amplified using erbium-doped fibre amplifiers: P1 and P2 pulses are amplified to deliver 300–400 pJ to each of the four on-chip squeezers; the local oscillator is amplified to optimize homodyne detector shot noise clearance. The pulsed light is coherently distributed such that pulsed P1, P2 and a portion of the pulsed reference laser proceed to the chip, while the pulsed local oscillator and the remaining pulsed reference laser proceed to the homodyne detector. The phase of the interferometer formed by these two paths is stabilized using a fibre phase modulator by detecting the reference laser's interference at the homodyne detector. The phase noise in this interferometer is measured independently by leaking a small portion of the local oscillator through the chip, and is measured to be 1.7° standard deviation. When combined with 1.2° standard deviation phase noise from the initial frequency and/or phase lock between P1, P2 and the local oscillator, the overall phase noise is 2.1° standard deviation.

The chip was fabricated using a custom silicon nitride process, optimized for low linear loss. All samples were fabricated on 300-mm wafers using a manufacturing process that is compatible with state-of-the-art, high-volume semiconductor manufacturing (see Supplementary Information for details). The fabrication process steps were optimized to mitigate the impact of absorption and scattering losses, resulting in ultra-low propagation losses in single-mode waveguides. Reference structures are used to calibrate the loss contributions of each relevant component. Directional couplers in the filters and interferometer have roughly 4 mdB of loss, and the loss from edge coupler to SMF-28-Ultra fibre for the packaged devices is consistently less than 0.5 dB. The squeezers are based on a photonic molecule design29 and are composed of a primary resonator coupled to an auxiliary resonator with a larger free spectral range (FSR). The ratio of primary FSR to auxiliary FSR is chosen to allow the resonances that would contribute to unwanted parametric nonlinear processes to be spectrally split or displaced, thereby suppressing these parasitic effects. The average loaded and intrinsic quality factors of the squeezer resonators on the chip are measured to be 3.33 × 105 and 1.28 × 107, respectively, corresponding to a 580-MHz full-width at half-maximum resonance bandwidth and 97.4% escape efficiency for the signal resonance. The resonances of each resonator can be independently shifted using two integrated thermo-optic phase shifters. The squeezer design is highly engineered to combine high escape efficiency, strong resonant enhancement, suppression of spurious processes and support pulsed single-temporal-mode operation. The input filter, pump filter and post-interferometer filters are all based on an asymmetric MZI design. The programmable interferometer is composed of a cascaded ‘staircase' of tuneable couplers, with the last coupler being fixed at a 50/50 splitting ratio (see Supplementary Information for a corresponding circuit diagram). Although not universal, this arrangement has been shown to be capable of generating optical GKP qubits using the fewest optical elements (to reduce loss)12. The first two couplers in the interferometer staircase are tunable to allow different state preparation depending on the amount of available squeezing and desired state. The chip itself is fully electro-optically packaged. The input and output waveguides are coupled to fibre array units of medium mode field diameter fibre (6.4 μm MFD, Corning HI 1060 Flex), which are then spliced to Corning SMF-28 Ultra fibre. The combined coupling efficiency from the chip waveguide to SMF-28 Ultra fibre is measured to be 0.45 dB (90%). The chip is wirebonded to a carrier printed circuit board that interfaces with the electronics required to drive the thermo-optic phase shifters and program the chip.

The PNR detectors are based on a cryogenic transition edge sensor design operated in a dilution fridge at 14 mK, but can be operated at temperatures up to 50 mK (ref. 37). Advancements in device fabrication, simulation, metrology and packaging have resulted in significant improvements in detection efficiency compared to results reported in the literature. The implementation of in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements and new rigorous finite-difference time-domain simulations have enabled precise optimization of stack layer thicknesses during fabrication. A multifaceted metrology approach, incorporating transmission electron microscopy along with complementary techniques, has been implemented to provide comprehensive verification of the fabricated stack. Furthermore, optical packaging of the PNR detectors has been refined with improved concentricity, coupled with either a roughly 70 or 96% larger detection area compared to previously published work12, leading to more misalignment-tolerant light coupling. The three detectors involved in the heralding operation have a measured detection efficiency of \(99.8{9}_{-0.53}^{+0.11}\), 98.40 ± 1.19 and 96.45 ± 1.04%, where uncertainties represent a 95% confidence interval (k = 2). The primary contributor to these uncertainties is the absolute calibration of the optical power meter, which has an uncertainty of 0.42% (k = 2). Many more detectors were yielded with measured detection efficiencies above 99%; the two sensors with slightly lower detection efficiency in this experiment were chosen as they had superior electrical noise performance. This characteristic is related to electronic packaging yield and is not correlated with detection efficiency. Finally, the transmissions of each wavelength division multiplexing filter before each PNR detector are measured to be 93.7, 94.1 and 94.8%.

The homodyne detector used for state tomography is composed of a pair of high quantum efficiency photodiodes in a custom trans-impedance amplifier circuit. The quadratures of the electro-magnetic field are measured by interfering the quantum state with a strong local oscillator field on a balanced beamsplitter, detecting the two outputs with the two photodiodes and measuring the photocurrent difference. The temporal mode of the quadrature measurement is defined by the local oscillator field. Using an IQ modulator, the local oscillator field is shaped from the initial 25-ns local oscillator pulse to match the temporal mode profile of the squeezing (measured by mode tomography: Supplementary Information). The measured quadrature is defined by the relative phase between the quantum state and local oscillator. For state tomography, the local oscillator phase is varied over 32 different phase settings between 0 and π. At each phase setting, measured quadrature values are recorded for different PNR heralding events. Up to 2 × 106 quadrature measurements are recorded for each heralding event. From the quadrature measurements the density matrix of the quantum state is reconstructed using maximum-likelihood techniques38. The state reconstruction is done without any loss compensation, and the resulting states presented in Fig. 3 include end-to-end loss from squeezing generation to homodyne detection. We estimate the total homodyne detection efficiency to be 97%. This includes photodiode quantum efficiency (less than 99%), 21.3-dB electronic noise clearance (99.2%), mode overlap between shaped local oscillator pulse and quantum state (more than 99%) and polarization visibility (more than 99%).

The defining feature of ideal GKP Pauli eigenstates is that they are eigenstates of a pair of displacements that form a parallelogram with a phase-space area 2π. For example, a rectangular lattice GKP qubit \(| 1\rangle \) is stabilized by \({\widehat{S}}_{p}={{\rm{e}}}^{i\alpha \widehat{p}}\) and \({\widehat{S}}_{q}={{\rm{e}}}^{2{\rm{\pi }}i\widehat{q}/\alpha }\), which correspond to α and 2π/α shifts in phase space along the q and p quadratures1. For any approximate GKP state, the absolute value of the stabilizer expectation values will lie between 0 and 1, with 1 only attained by ideal GKP states. The stabilizer expectation values can be related to the effective squeezing of the peaks of the GKP state, with \({\varDelta }_{p(q)}^{2}=-\,\text{ln}(| \langle {\widehat{S}}_{p(q)}\rangle {| }^{2})/{\rm{\pi }}\) (ref. 22). This formula can be understood as the per-peak squeezing of an approximate GKP state were it to be transformed to the lattice defined by \(\alpha =\sqrt{2{\rm{\pi }}}\) by a single-mode Gaussian unitary that implements a symplectic transformation on the phase-space lattice. This allows us to compare the quality of GKP states on different lattices39. Both finite energy effects and sources of decoherence, such as photon loss, contribute to lowering the effective squeezing. We can also consider the symmetric effective squeezing, which is defined as \({\varDelta }_{{\rm{sym}}}^{2}=({\varDelta }_{p}^{2}+{\varDelta }_{q}^{2})/2\), the average variance of the peaks in both quadratures12,39. Effective squeezing can be expressed in dB units through \(-10{\log }_{10}{\varDelta }^{2}\).

Metrics details

Elevated postprandial glycemic responses (PPGRs) are associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. PPGRs to the same foods have been shown to vary between individuals, but systematic characterization of the underlying physiologic and molecular basis is lacking. We measured PPGRs using continuous glucose monitoring in 55 well-phenotyped participants challenged with seven different standard carbohydrate meals administered in replicate. We also examined whether preloading a rice meal with fiber, protein or fat (‘mitigators') altered PPGRs. We performed gold-standard metabolic tests and multi-omics profiling to examine the physiologic and molecular basis for interindividual PPGR differences. Overall, rice was the most glucose-elevating carbohydrate meal, but there was considerable interindividual variability. Individuals with the highest PPGR to potatoes (potato-spikers) were more insulin resistant and had lower beta cell function, whereas grape-spikers were more insulin sensitive. Rice-spikers were more likely to be Asian individuals, and bread-spikers had higher blood pressure. Mitigators were less effective in reducing PPGRs in insulin-resistant as compared to insulin-sensitive participants. Multi-omics signatures of PPGR and metabolic phenotypes were discovered, including insulin-resistance-associated triglycerides, hypertension-associated metabolites and PPGR-associated microbiome pathways. These results demonstrate interindividual variability in PPGRs to carbohydrate meals and mitigators and their association with metabolic and molecular profiles.

One in three adults in the United States has prediabetes, and 70% of these will develop type 2 diabetes (T2D), posing a substantial public health burden1 via complications such as kidney disease, vision loss, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer2,3,4,5,6.

High postprandial glycemic responses (PPGRs) are a hallmark of prediabetes and T2D and are risk factors for T2D, CVD and all-cause mortality independent of fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c7,8,9. However, our understanding of glucose dysregulation, especially regarding PPGRs, remains incomplete. Interindividual variability in PPGRs to the same foods has been described7,10. A variety of factors have been identified as contributors to PPGRs, including glycemic index, the total carbohydrate amount, carbohydrate characteristics (starch and simple carbohydrates), food processing, meal macronutrient composition, meal timing, ethnicity and the microbiome11,12,13,14,15,16. However, the contribution of individual physiologic and metabolic factors to PPGRs and whether they interact with food characteristics have not been well studied.

A gap in understanding how underlying metabolism and physiology affect PPGRs exists largely because quantifying metabolic functions, such as insulin resistance, insulin secretion and the incretin effect, is laborious and costly and has not been extensively employed. However, these metabolic traits differ between individuals17,18,19 and likely explain, in part, the observed interindividual PPGR differences. Glycemic responses to the oral glucose tolerance test have been linked to underlying physiology such as insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction19. Prespecified timed blood draws may miss the peak glucose, but continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices enable a detailed evaluation of PPGRs and can be linked to individual metabolic traits. Indeed, using CGM, we previously showed that individuals with higher and more variable daily glucose excursions were more insulin resistant (IR) than their lower-glycemic counterparts10. Thus, CGMs have the potential to link underlying metabolic phenotypes to individual responses to food.

To further study individual PPGRs to foods and their association with metabolic subtypes and omics profiles, we conducted a rigorous investigation of responses to a wide variety of standardized carbohydrate meals and standardized preloads (‘mitigators') to a rice meal in individuals whose metabolic traits were comprehensively profiled with gold-standard tests and whose blood and stool were profiled for metabolites, lipids, proteins and microbiome. We hypothesized that individual PPGRs are associated with the underlying metabolic physiology (for example, insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction) as well as molecular markers.

The overall study design is illustrated in Fig. 1a. A cohort of 55 participants with no prior history of T2D underwent deep metabolic phenotyping using gold-standard tests for insulin resistance by steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG), beta cell function by disposition index, hepatic insulin resistance and adipocyte insulin resistance (Methods)19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28. At baseline, we collected metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics, microbiome and clinical data.

a, Overview of study design and data types. Left, at the baseline, the data on omics and clinical tests were collected. Mid-bottom, each individual ate seven different carbohydrate meals and three different mitigator foods with rice with CGM data and food log collected. Mid-top, an example CGM curve of a day is presented. Right, participants were then stratified into carb-response types based on which meal produced the highest spike and into metabolic traits results. b, Mean CGM curves of PPGR after different meals. c, Glucose AUC above baseline and time from baseline to peak for different meals. CGM curves are extracted into different features (and presented with mean and standard errors (error bar indicates 2 standard errors). Bars of standardized carbohydrate meals were ordered by mean value. The number of CGM curves (each dot) is as follows: rice 115, potatoes 92, bread 99, pasta 65, grapes 98, beans 46 and mixed berries 53. Extracted CGM features are compared between different carbohydrate meals.

Asterisks indicate significance (pFDR < 0.05). P values were FDR-corrected for the whole matrix. Illustration in a created with BioRender.com.

Source data

To quantify individual PPGRs to different carbohydrates and evaluate potential mitigation, participants underwent seven different standardized carbohydrate meal tests (50 g) and three preloaded mitigator meal tests while wearing a CGM at home and following their regular diet otherwise (Fig. 1a). The seven carbohydrate meals, each containing 50 g total carbohydrates, included five starchy meals—rice (jasmine rice), bread (buttermilk bread), potatoes (shredded), pasta (macaroni, precooked per instructions, cooled and frozen) and beans (canned black beans, high fiber)—as well as two different simple-carbohydrate meals—mixed berries (blackberries, strawberries and blueberries, high fiber) and grapes (low fiber) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 6) (details in Methods). The three preloaded mitigators included pea fiber, egg white and cream, representing fiber, protein and fat, respectively (Methods), which were consumed 10 min before a standardized 50 g carbohydrate meal (for example, rice). Each meal test was performed at least twice. After processing, there were 848 CGM curves (55 participants), 267 CGM curves with mitigators (47 participants, 32 for rice + mitigators) and 33,920 glucose time points in total.

Among the 55 participants with CGMs, 24 were male, 27 were female, and 4 were unknown (Table 1). Of the participants, 26 were with healthy weight, 18 with overweight, 9 with obesity, 1 with underweight and 1 with unknown weight status. None of the participants had a prior medical history of diabetes; 27 participants were euglycemic, 26 had prediabetes, and one had T2D based on HbA1c measured during the visit (6.5%) (one was unknown). The racial and ethnic distribution was 37 European, 13 Asian, 4 Hispanic and 1 mixed Asian and European individuals. Eighteen were IR (SSPG ≥ 120 mg dl−1), 25 were insulin sensitive (IS; SSPG < 120 mg dl−1), and the mean SSPG and disposition index were 120.1 ± 72.9 mg dl−1 (mean ± s.d.) and 1.55 ± 0.82.

We assessed the variability between CGM curve replicates for the same meals consumed by the same individual on different days (Supplementary Fig. 1). CGM curves from most individuals were reproducible between replicates based on the area under the curve above the baseline (AUC(>baseline)) with intraindividual correlation coefficients (ICCs) of AUC(>baseline) from 0.26 for beans to 0.73 for pasta, indicating consistency between meal replicates of the same individual except for meals with low PPGRs (Supplementary Table 9)13. The correlation coefficients between replicates were also similar to previously published studies7. To reduce the effect of within-individual variation, results below were computed based on the average of each participant's replicates.

The seven different standardized carbohydrate meals with equivalent carbohydrate loads elicited different PPGRs, emphasizing the impact of food composition (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Typical postprandial CGM curves of standardized carbohydrate meals slightly decreased initially after meal consumption and then increased to a single maximum and returned to baseline within three hours (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Of the five starchy carbohydrate meals, rice, bread and potatoes produced high peaks at approximately 1 hour post consumption. Grapes had high glucose peaks that reached maxima at earlier time points. Beans and pasta reached maxima at similar times as other starchy meals but exhibited significantly lower peaks, with beans eliciting the lowest (Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Table 1). Mixed berries reached maxima at similar times as grapes but had much lower peaks. Beans and mixed berries produced the lowest peak measured by both AUC(>baseline) and delta glucose peak (the difference between the peak and baseline glucose) as compared with other meals.

From CGM curves, we extracted 11 different features of principally two types: (1) scale (for example, AUC(>baseline) and delta glucose peak) and (2) rate (for example, time baseline to peak and time return to baseline) (Fig. 1d; details in Methods). Different AUC-based features had similar patterns, which were similar to that of delta glucose peak, except for grapes (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Time baseline to peak, time return to baseline and delta glucose peak at 170 min show similar patterns. Using scale and rate dimensions, three exemplar meals (beans, mixed berries and rice) were clustered into partially separated groups (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Across different meals, delta glucose peak (Fig. 2a) and AUC(>baseline) (Supplementary Fig. 7a) were also positively correlated with each other. Besides single-meal features, we also defined the potato versus grape ratio (PG-ratio), which is the ratio between the delta glucose peak of potatoes and grapes, highlighting the differences between a starchy carbohydrate with a high amount of resistant starch and a simple-carbohydrate meal.

The delta glucose peak was calculated as the difference between the peak and baseline. The suppression mitigator effects were defined by subtracting the delta glucose peak of rice + mitigator from that of rice and then normalizing it by that of rice. b, Examples of CGM curves of participants with different carbohydrate meals with the highest PPGR (carb-response type). c, Number of participants assigned to each carb-response type. The carb-response types are defined by both delta glucose peak and AUC(>baseline).

Delta glucose values were averaged between replicates and scaled by the carbohydrate with the highest value. Insulin resistance, disposition index (DI) and HbA1c were also presented.

Source data

PPGRs to different carbohydrate meals were associated with the nutrient composition of the standardized meal. The total dietary fiber content (measured in grams) in the carbohydrate meal negatively correlated with AUC(>baseline) (−0.71, 95% confidence interval (−0.96,0.11), P = 0.088) and delta glucose peak (−0.75, 95% confidence interval (−0.96,0.04), P = 0.066) (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 6).

PPGRs varied considerably across individuals, which differed from the conventional idea of a fixed glycemic index value for a single food (Figs. 2b–e, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 18 and Extended Data Fig. 3). Although overall the PPGRs tended to correlate positively across carbohydrate meals (Fig. 2a), for different individuals, PPGRs to different meals were ranked differently; and for each individual, different meals produced the highest PPGR (Fig. 2b–e and Extended Data Fig. 3). For example, 19 participants exhibited the highest average delta glucose peak from rice (participant #18), whereas others were highest with bread, grapes, potatoes or pasta (Extended Data Fig. 3).

We aimed to type individuals based on their PPGRs to different carbohydrate meals. Participants were stratified as carb-response types (also referred to as ‘spikers') according to the meal that produced the highest average PPGR for that individual, as measured by delta glucose peak and AUC(>baseline). Using the delta glucose peak, rice-spikers were the largest group (35%), followed by bread-spikers (24%) and grape-spikers (22%); no participants had the highest spike in response to beans or mixed berries (Fig. 2c), possibly due to higher fiber and/or protein (beans) content (Fig. 1f). Stratification based on AUC(>baseline) largely agreed with results based on delta glucose peak, except that even more individuals were classified as rice-spikers and fewer as grape-spikers (Fig. 2c). Carb-response-type classification was stable between replicates of meals, and results based on individual meal replicates largely agree with those based on the average (Extended Data Fig. 4). In addition, ICC for delta glucose peak and AUC(>baseline) was moderate to high for most meals (Supplementary Table 9). ICC values were lower for meals with smaller PPGRs (for example, beans), potentially because of a lower signal-to-noise ratio.

We investigated individuals' PPGRs as a function of their underlying metabolic physiological traits. PPGRs, measured as both delta glucose peak and AUC(>baseline), were significantly greater in IR (measured by SSPG) compared with IS individuals for potatoes and pasta (179% and 152% for delta glucose, respectively; Figs. 2e and 3 and Supplementary Figs. 5, 13a and 17). We measured starch content and found that potatoes had significantly more resistant starch and pasta had significantly more slowly digestible starch than other starchy foods (bread and rice) (Extended Data Fig. 5). The IR group also exhibited a higher baseline (premeal) glucose and higher absolute glucose peaks compared with IS individuals (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Figs. 16 and 17). Individuals with impaired beta cell function also demonstrated higher PPGRs to potatoes (Figs. 2e and 3 and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 17). The contributions of both insulin resistance and beta cell function were still significant after adjusting for confounding factors, BMI, age and sex (Supplementary Table 2). When modeled together, only SSPG remained an independent predictor of PPGRs. Normoglycemic IR individuals also exhibited higher PPGRs to potatoes than IS individuals with prediabetes (based on HbA1c), indicating the dominance of the insulin-resistance effect (Supplementary Figs. 6c and 14). Other differences noted in potato-spikers included higher HbA1c, FBG and free fatty acids (FFA) during the SSPG test (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 8). Grape-spikers, conversely, exhibited significantly lower SSPG (indicating insulin sensitivity) and the lowest FBG. Among individuals who are IS or with normal beta cell function, grape- and rice-spikers were the most frequent groups.

We observed that whereas the PPGR to potato consumption differed between IR and IS groups and between beta cell normal and dysfunctional groups, the PPGR to grape consumption changed little (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 17). We thus calculated the PG-ratio based on delta glucose peak as a normalization of the PPGR to potatoes. The PG-ratio was consistently different between IR and IS subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 13c and Supplementary Table 2). The sex interaction with beta cell function and insulin resistance was also significant in estimating the PG-ratio, with males having less effect from insulin resistance (intersection term coefficient −0.49) and beta cell dysfunction (intersection term coefficient −0.58) (Supplementary Table 2).

To test the potential suppressing effect of other foods on PPGRs to standardized carbohydrate meals, other meals containing fiber, protein and fat (mitigators) were tested. Thirty-two individuals consumed fiber (10 g, via pea fiber), protein (10 g, via egg white) or fat (15 g, via cream) 10 min before the consumption of white rice (50 g of carbohydrates), the most glucose-elevating carbohydrate meal on average. The mitigation effect was calculated as a normalized difference based on PPGRs (delta glucose peak and AUC(>baseline)) of rice + mitigator relative to rice alone. A negative mitigation effect indicated that consuming the mitigator reduced the rice PPGR.

The effects of different mitigators positively correlated with each other with a correlation of 0.79 between fat and protein and approximately 0.5 between fiber and others (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 7a). Across the entire cohort, all three mitigators, when consumed before rice, weakly but significantly decreased the delta peak glucose (Cohen's d: fiber 0.12, protein 0.19, fat 0.05). Fat, but not protein or fiber, increased time (baseline to peak) (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Tables 1 and 7). However, similar to the interindividual variability in PPGRs to different carbohydrate meals (carb-response types), highly divergent patterns were observed in mitigation effects between individuals (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 3). Many individuals exhibited mild mitigation effects (for example, participants #18 and #48), one had strong mitigation effects (participant #14), and some even had higher glycemic responses with mitigators (for example, participants #33 and #69) (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 3). For most participants, (fiber 23, protein 22 and fat 20) mitigators reduced glycemic responses (Fig. 4f). The mitigation effect of protein was significantly greater in the rice-spikers versus non-rice-spikers (Fig. 4g).

Source data

Similar to PPGRs to standardized carbohydrate meals, mitigation effects differed according to underlying metabolic features. IR individuals showed little beneficial response to mitigators, whereas IS individuals responded more to mitigators, with fiber decreasing delta glucose peak (P = 0.031) and AUC(>baseline) (P = 0.057) (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Table 8). Individuals with normal beta cell function also had beneficial protein mitigation effects on delta glucose peak (P = 0.028) (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6b and Supplementary Table 8). The different mitigation responses across individuals explained the lack of strong mitigation effects in the population average (Fig. 1b,c).

We searched for other potential factors that contributed to differential PPGRs, including demographic and clinical data. In total, 15 continuous variables and three categorical variables (ethnicity, sex and BMI groups) were examined. Asian participants were more likely than non-Asian participants to be rice-spikers (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.05, positive false discovery rate (pFDR) = 0.21) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 8). No other significant associations were found between PPGRs (carb-response types and mitigator effect) and ethnicity, sex or BMI groups (Supplementary Fig. 20).

Among the 15 continuous measurements, associations were uncovered between carb-response types using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a pFDR threshold of 0.3. Bread-spikers exhibited significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to other carb-response types after correcting for BMI and age (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 19 and Supplementary Table 2). The analysis in this section is exploratory and has higher risks of random variation than results in other analyses.

To identify potential biomarkers and mechanisms of carb-response types, we performed baseline omics analyses, including untargeted metabolomics (731 annotated metabolites, nine classes), targeted lipidomics (652 lipids, 13 classes), targeted proteomics (1,470 proteins) and metagenomics microbiome analysis (Extended Data Fig. 6).

In addition to higher blood pressure levels, bread-spikers also presented significantly higher N1-Methyladenosine than other participants (Figs. 5a and 3c and Supplementary Table 3)29,30. Potato-spikers had higher levels of certain triglycerides (TAG) and fatty acids (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 21), aligning with their increased insulin resistance23,31. In addition, proteins positively associated with potato PPGRs were significantly enriched in hepatic stellate cell activation and fibroblast activation pathways (Supplementary Data 1). Black bean PPGRs were positively associated with keto acids and metabolites related to ketone-related metabolism and amino acid metabolism, including gamma-glutamylthreonine, hydroxybutyric acid, alpha-ketoisovaleric acid, 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid and beta-citryl-l-glutamic acid (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). In addition, metabolites enriched in the histidine pathway were both positively (1-methyl-histidine, glutamate and methylimidazole acetic acid) and negatively (histidine and imidazole acetaldehyde) associated with bean-PPGR, indicating variability in histidine catabolism (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Data 1). PPGRs to mixed berries were positively associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and unsaturated TAGs in plasma metabolomics and lipidomics (Supplementary Data 1).

Microbiome analyses also revealed taxa and functional pathways associated with PPGRs. PPGRs to most carbohydrate meals were positively associated with glycosyl hydrolase family 85 (GH85), lactate utilization domain and heme exporter protein B and negatively associated with d-alanyl-d-alanine carboxypeptidase (Extended Data Fig. 7). In addition, Klebsiella, Sutterella and starch degradation III were negatively or beneficially correlated with the mitigation effect (Supplementary Table 5).

To further investigate the potential mechanisms of different PPGRs, we next explored the associations between multi-omics features and metabolic traits. Correlation matrix analyses between omics and clinical measurements revealed two clusters, with some omics features associated with healthy metabolic function and others with compromised metabolic function (Fig. 5b, Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9 and Supplementary Fig. 12)18,31,32,33,34,35. For instance, tyrosine, hydroxybutyric acid, glutamic acid and TAGs were significantly positively associated with plasma glucose or insulin resistance, whereas phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine and threonic acid were significantly negatively correlated (Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9). Similarly, among microbiomes, Slackia and Tyzzerella were positively correlated with plasma glucose or insulin resistance, and Butyrivibrio, Asaccharobacter, Adlercreutzia and Fusicatenibacter were negatively correlated (Fig. 5b). In an integrated statistical model to predict SSPG, strong predictors include fasting insulin, BMI, FFA and TAGs contributing to the IR state and phosphatidylcholine contributing to the IS state (Extended Data Fig. 10).

To further trace potential causal mechanisms, we then conducted a mediation analysis with microbiomes as the input, metabolomics and lipidomics as the mediators and clinical measurements as the outcomes (Supplementary Table 4)36,37. In Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, pathways involving protein autophosphorylation, lactose catabolism and histidine phosphotransfer kinase activity positively mediated hepatic insulin resistance and fasting insulin via a single metabolite with an inferred formula, C9H15NO3, but no annotated match in public databases (Fig. 5c).

The results of the current study demonstrate differential PPGRs in response to a broad array of standardized carbohydrate meals and reflect underlying metabolic physiology, including insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Using standardized carbohydrate meals given in replicates with CGM data captured, we showed that on average, rice was the most glucose-elevating carbohydrate, whereas some individuals exhibited higher elevations in response to consumption of potatoes, pasta, bread or grapes (Extended Data Fig. 3). Individuals with the highest PPGR to potato consumption relative to other carbohydrates (potato-spikers) were more IR with lower beta cell function, whereas grape-spikers were more IS. Furthermore, a high glucose response to potatoes relative to grapes (PG-ratio) was statistically significantly associated with insulin resistance (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 13). These results indicate that CGM-detected glycemic responses to carbohydrate meals reflect underlying physiology.

The results of this study also highlight that the mitigation effect differs between individuals according to underlying physiology, in that the mitigation effect was only beneficial in reducing delta glucose in the IS or normal beta cell function groups (Supplementary Table 8). The specific mechanisms of mitigator function were not studied in detail in this study, but a potential hypothesis is that mitigators can lower PPGRs by at least two main pathways that work in synergy. The first is decreasing carbohydrate absorption, and the second is through the process of incretin induction, insulin secretion and insulin action38. In healthy individuals, mitigators greatly reduce PPGRs because the two mechanisms work in synergy. However, with insulin resistance or beta cell dysfunction, the single effect of absorption rate reduction may be too small without the synergistic interaction with insulin function.

In addition to explaining the reduced mitigator effect in individuals with insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction, this hypothesis also explains the elevated PPGRs to potatoes and pasta in those individuals. The potatoes provided were cooked and cooled, increasing the level of resistant starch, a type of fiber, compared with other starch meals, and so it was itself a starch food with fiber (Extended Data Fig. 5)14,39. Pasta, which was also cooked and cooled, contains some resistant starch and also more slowly digestible starch39. Grapes and rice contain lower levels of fiber and thus do not exhibit PPGR differences between individuals with different metabolic traits. Beans have higher levels of fiber and proteins but lower PPGR in general, limiting the possible effect size to be measured. We also observed that protein has the strongest mitigation effect in individuals with beta cell normal function, potentially indicating a stimulation effect on insulin secretion (Fig. 4d)40. Additional factors affecting the PPGRs and mitigation effect might come from individual microbiomes, accessibility of starch in the meal and the interaction between sex and metabolic traits.

Carb-response types are linked to glucose dysregulation subtypes and potential complications. Potato-spikers had significantly higher fasting glucose, insulin resistance and fasting levels of several TAGs and fatty acids. Enriched proteomics pathways such as hepatic stellate cell activation and fibroblast activation (Supplementary Data 1) in potato-spikers might be related to the activation of hepatic stellate cells to myofibroblast-like cells and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)41. In population-wide T2D studies, the severe IR diabetes group was associated with MASH17. We hypothesize that there is a similar group of individuals with higher potato PPGRs, higher insulin resistance and early signatures of MASH in the stages of prediabetes and even normoglycemia, which needs further validation in larger cohorts. In addition, Asian individuals were more likely to be rice-spikers, which aligns with higher rice glycemic responses among Asian compared to European individuals in the study of glycemic indexes15,16. We note that there may be other confounders in genetics and habits (for example, consuming rice frequently). Bread-spikers exhibited significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure and N1-Methyladenosine, a metabolite associated with hypertension in mice, compared to other carb-response types, suggesting potential CVD risk (Figs. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 19 and Supplementary Table 2). The positive correlation between black bean PPGRs and keto metabolism suggests that individuals with baseline predispositions toward enhanced fatty acid oxidation or amino acid catabolism may exhibit different glucose responses to beans. The variability of histidine metabolism associated with PPGRs to beans might be shaped by differences in gut microbiota composition or habitual diet42. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that different strategies may be useful for nutrient intervention in groups with different ethnicities and metabolic functions.

Microbiome features were also associated with PPGRs and mitigation effects. GH85 in Roseburia intestinalis was positively associated with PPGRs to all carbohydrate meals (Extended Data Fig. 7). The GH85 family is known to degrade glycosylated proteins, and Roseburia is known to degrade complex carbohydrates (for example, fiber)34,35. Elevated GH85 in Roseburia intestinalis might indicate degradation of mucins when fiber from meals was insufficient. D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase was negatively associated with PPGRs to most carbohydrate meals and has a role in cell wall synthesis. Klebsiella (the highest level in Klebsiella pneumonia) and Sutterella (the highest level in Sutterella parvirubra) were significantly negatively (beneficially) associated with the mitigation effect (Supplementary Table 5). Klebsiella is known to reside in the small intestine, and the PPGR reduction might come from its competing usage of glucose43. Sutterella is a known factor in glucose control improvement after gastric bypass, and this might be related to its mitigation effect44. The starch degradation III in Eubacterium hallii was significantly negatively associated with the mitigation effect (Supplementary Table 5). This might indicate a competing usage of starch when the human digestive process was slowed by mitigators. Overall, a myriad of microbial biochemical pathways in different microbes could likely impact PPGRs.

Our work is built on previous PPGR studies and provides a deeper mechanistic understanding of the PPGR. Interindividual PPGR variation and correlation across foods have been discovered in both early small-scale blood-sample-based and later CGM-based studies7,13,45,46. However, early studies were limited to a small variety of standardized meals, so they did not systematically investigate the real-life heterogeneity of PPGRs7,13. Our work demonstrates that PPGRs were more consistent within individuals than between individuals, and each individual can be classified into one carb-response type with different clinical profiles. We also provided a statistical analysis of interindividual and intraindividual variability of PPGRs based on ICCs to a broad scope of carbohydrate meals. In addition, previous cohorts were not comprehensively profiled in metabolic traits. We found associations between PPGRs and blood glucose and omics features, and their relationship to the specific metabolic dysfunctional phenotype, including insulin resistance and beta cell function, enabling a deeper understanding of interindividual variation in PPGRs.

Limitations of the current study include its size of 55 well-phenotyped individuals in California. Although there was a balanced distribution of participants by sex and race, there were insufficient numbers in each race to identify more race-specific patterns. Larger studies could address these potential differences. Furthermore, for practical reasons, we cannot compare more than seven carbohydrates (for example, whole wheat bread, bananas and cooked and cooled versus hot potatoes) and include mitigator tests for all carbohydrates. Our meals also lacked variability in cooking time and solid state versus liquid state. The mitigator effects presented were systematically studied but still cannot be extrapolated to a mixed meal. Rather, we can only conclude about the effect when the mitigator was given 10 min before the rice meal. Although participants were instructed to remain sedentary for three hours post-meal, we did not track physical activity and evaluate the effects. The protocol adherence was closely monitored by the dietitian through food logs, but the meals were consumed in the home setting, so other external variables could affect the results. Our study explored the association between PPGRs and omics and clinical measurements but presented no direct links to hard clinical endpoints47,48. Further studies are needed to quantify the long-term consequences of different PPGR subtypes and intervention effects objectively and directly.

Overall, our results represent an initial step in evaluating the effect of different meals and mitigators on PPGRs and their associations with metabolic physiology, especially because individuals, both healthy and at risk, have increased access to CGMs to optimize health by modifying their diet. Our research also may be relevant for stratification-based approaches that leverage CGM data to cluster individuals based on metabolic health and potentially optimize their diet to prevent progression to T2D and CVD. Our potential approach of stratifying participants into subgroups with relatively homogeneous PPGRs could provide advantages of more precise recommendations than the broad public health recommendation and more accessible data collection than the individualized machine-learning approach. Future studies could enable routine meal recommendations through expanded PPGR profiling with an even broader scope of mitigators in bigger cohorts and novel algorithms.

Our study aligns with the NIH definition of Basic Experimental Studies in Humans studies and aims to understand the fundamental process of postprandial responses. Male and female (based on self-report) participants of different ethnicities (based on self-report) were recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area, California. Inclusion criteria were age >18 and <75 years, BMI < 40 kg m−2 and no known diagnosis of diabetes. Exclusion criteria included major organ diseases, uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure > 160/100 mmHg), pregnancy or lactation, use of diabetogenic medications, malabsorptive disorders (for example, celiac sprue), chronic inflammatory conditions, malignancy not at least five years in remission, alcohol use >2 standard drinks per day, use of weight loss medications or specific diets, weight change of more than 2 kg in the last three weeks and a history of bariatric surgery. Additionally, individuals were excluded if they were deemed to be unable to use the technology correctly, adhere to the study protocol or give written informed consent. Details are available in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03919877). The first participant consented on 24 May 2018 and the last one on 15 February 2023.

Participants underwent evaluations, screening tests and metabolic tests at the Clinical and Translational Research Unit (CTRU) after an overnight fast. Metabolic tests assessed metabolic health related to T2D and included the oral glucose tolerance test, SSPG test and isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion (IIGI) test19,20,21,22,49. There were four basic visits: a screening + OGTT visit, an SSPG visit, an IIGI visit and an omics sample collection visit. During the screening and the omics visits, stool, urine, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, plasma and serum samples were collected. Some individuals had multiple omics visits to monitor omics changes throughout the study. Participants were then instructed to complete the at-home diet cycles, during which they collected CGM and food log data.

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at Stanford University School of Medicine Human Research Protection Office (Institutional Review Board no. 43883). All participants provided written informed consent.

Seven standardized carbohydrate meals (50 g carbohydrates each) and three mitigators were included in the study (Supplementary Table 6). We investigated individual responses to different standardized carbohydrate meals and determined whether other meals could mitigate the PPGRs. Among the seven carbohydrate meals, there were five starchy meals and two meals with mostly simple carbohydrates. The five starchy meals were jasmine rice (precooked frozen Trader Joe's brand), potatoes (shredded, frozen precooked, Trader Joe's brand), pasta (macaroni, cooked in the CTRU kitchen per package instructions and then frozen), white sliced bread (Trader Joe's buttermilk bread) and beans (canned whole black beans). The two simple-carbohydrate meals were grapes (red grapes) and mixed berries (170 g raspberries and a mix of blackberries, strawberries and blueberries, about 85 g each). The three mitigators were fiber (pea fiber powder, 14 g providing 10 g of fiber), protein (boiled egg white, 100 g, providing 10 g of protein) and fat (Bellwether Farms Creme Fraiche, 38 g, providing 15 g total fat). The weight of the mitigators was chosen to approximate regular meal sizes.

Participants were instructed to use microwaves to heat the meal at home and consume each on separate days without adding any condiments or other meals. They were to consume the standardized meals as the first meal in the morning, after a 10–12 hour fast, not consume any other food or drink and remain sedentary for 3 hours after consumption of the provided meals. For mitigator tests, participants were instructed to consume the mitigator first, followed by the carbohydrate meal (rice) 10 min later. They were also advised to avoid exercise the afternoon and evening before the test. The starting time point (zero minutes) was the recorded time of consuming the standardized carbohydrate meals in the food log.

During the diet cycle, participants were instructed to consume the standardized meals as described in the last section while otherwise following their regular diet. Participants were instructed to keep detailed logs of food intake, including the time and portions of all foods and drinks consumed using the ‘Cronometer' app. A dietitian assisted participants in adhering to the cook and eat instructions. Food logs with specific food and time were collected to evaluate adherence to the assigned instructions.

Two versions of CGM were used during the study period: Dexcom G4 and G6 Pro. For the G4, calibration was needed, requiring participants to measure blood glucose levels by fingerstick with provided glucose meters, glucose-reading strips and a lancet device. Participants were instructed to calibrate before the standardized meals. The G6 Pro required no calibration. Glucose values were blinded to participants until after the study. Participants were instructed to wear the CGM devices continuously throughout the study. The G4 sensor lasted seven days, and the G6 Pro lasted ten days. Trained study personnel inserted the sensor and educated participants on its use and care. Multiple CGM sensors were provided as needed.

Metadata were downloaded from REDCap and cleaned manually. The data included demographic information, clinical blood test results and responses from health and physical activity surveys19,26. The data were homogenized and manually checked with unreasonable values labeled and removed. Missing clinical values (for example, BMI) were estimated if the corresponding independent variables for calculation existed. If multiple values existed, they were averaged across visits.

Participants were instructed to fast for 12 hours before each metabolic test. The tests were conducted on three different days. Details of the metabolic tests are available in previous publications19,26.

The OGTT measured postprandial glycemic response to a standard glucose drink (75 g glucose)19. Blood samples were collected through an antecubital intravenous catheter before and after the glucose drink at −10, 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min. Blood glucose was checked at the aforementioned time points and at 10, 20, 40, 50, 75, 105, 135 and 150 min. Baseline levels of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon were measured.

The two-stage insulin suppression test (called the SSPG test in the paper) quantified insulin suppression of lipolysis (adipose tissue insulin resistance) and insulin-mediated glucose uptake (muscle insulin resistance), as previously described20,21,22,23,49. During the test, participants received an infusion of octreotide (0.27 μg m−2 min−1) for 240 min to suppress endogenous insulin secretion. During the first stage of the test, insulin was infused at 6 mU m−2 min−1 and glucose at 50 mg m−2 min−1, and blood samples were collected at 100, 110 and 120 min for measurement of glucose, insulin and FFA concentrations23. The glucose, insulin and FFA values collected during the last 20 min of the first stage were averaged to calculate SSPG, steady-state plasma insulin and steady-state plasma FFA concentrations. During the second stage of the test, insulin was infused at 32 mU m−2 min−1 and glucose at 267 mg m−2 min−1. Blood samples were drawn at 210, 220, 230 and 240 min to measure the second-stage steady-state plasma insulin and SSPG concentrations.

The IIGI test measured the incretin effect, which is the ability of oral nutrients to stimulate insulin secretion beyond that stimulated by comparable plasma glucose administered intravenously27. It quantified the incretin effect by comparison with OGTT measurements. During the IIGI test, an intravenous catheter was placed in the antecubital vein for administration of continuous dextrose infusion at a rate needed to obtain the desired glucose level to match the curve generated by the OGTT. Blood samples were collected from a second intravenous catheter at the same time points as the OGTT, with immediate results generated by a bedside YSI plasma glucose analyzer and the rate of dextrose infusion adjusted as needed to maintain the desired glucose curve that matched values obtained during the OGTT. Plasma from this test as well as the OGTT was collected for measurement of insulin and C-peptide to calculate the incretin effect.

Although all participants were free of diabetes by self-report, they were stratified for analysis purposes according to HbA1c drawn at their baseline visit and American Diabetes Association criteria as follows: normoglycemia (HbA1c < 5.7%), prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7%–6.4%) and T2D (HbA1c ≥ 6.5%).

SSPG (mg dl−1) measured the level of insulin resistance, with higher values indicating greater insulin resistance20,21,22,23,49. A cutoff at 120 mg dl−1 was used to classify participants into IR and IS groups19,24. This threshold was based on physiology, prospective studies and a natural separation point between clustering observed in our cohort24. An alternative cutoff excluded intermediate results (IR, SSPG > 120; IS, SSPG < 100). Results followed the default cutoff if not otherwise specified.

Beta cell function was expressed as disposition index, reflecting insulin secretion adjusted for insulin resistance. The calculation was by insulin SECretion (ISEC) software, based on C-peptide concentrations measured during OGTT at time points 0, 15 and 30 min and with adjustment for age, sex and BMI19,50. We calculated the disposition index (pmol dl) per (kg ml), defined as the area under the insulin secretion rate divided by the SSPG (as measured during the insulin suppression test). Participants were stratified into normal (disposition index > 2.2), intermediate (1.2 ≤ disposition index ≤ 2.2) and dysfunctional (disposition index < 1.2) beta cell function17.

Incretin effect was calculated based on the difference in C-peptide concentrations between OGTT and IIGI at seven time points (0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min)17,24,28. A higher incretin effect may indicate either increased secretion of incretin (for example, glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and/or increased beta cell responsiveness to incretin. Participants were stratified into normal (incretin effect% > 64), intermediate (39 ≤ incretin effect% ≤ 64) and dysfunctional (incretin effect% < 39) incretin effects. An alternative cutoff excluded intermediate results (dysfunctional, incretin effect% < 40; normal, incretin effect% > 60). Results followed the default cutoff if not otherwise specified.

Hepatic IR was estimated using a surrogate index based on insulin, HDL, BMI, age and sex. Participants were stratified into hepatic IS (index < 3.95), intermediate (3.95 ≤ index ≤ 4.8) and IR (index > 4.8) (refs. 26,28,51). Participants were stratified into adipose IS (FFA ≤ 0.15), intermediate (0.15 < FFA < 0.5) and IR (FFA ≥ 0.5) (ref. 23). We followed previous papers in the calculation of homeostatic model assessment values52. Details of calculations are available in the previous publications19,26.

There were two groups of participants for metabolic tests, including groups 1 and 2. Group 1 had the most metabolic test measurements on most participants and is the one we focused on for metabolic traits. Group-wise comparisons across metabolic subtypes (different insulin resistances, beta cell function and incretin function) were based on group 1 unless otherwise specified, and other correlation analyses are based on all available data. Group 2 had a distribution shift, was mostly IS and had SSPG only among subtype measurements. In group 1 and among those with standardized meal CGM data, we quantified SSPG (n = 30), disposition index (n = 28), incretin effect (n = 28), hepatic IR (n = 28), FFA (n = 22) and homeostatic model assessment insulin-resistance surrogate (n = 28). Group 2 had basic clinical measurements and SSPG (n = 13) and was mostly IS (SSPG > 120, n = 2; SSPG > 130, n = 1).

CGM data were analyzed over a period from 25 min before to 170 min after the consumption of standardized carbohydrate meals. The reference time point (0 min) corresponds to the consumption time of the standardized carbohydrate meals, as recorded in the food logs. The CGM data were downloaded from Dexcom devices, processed and integrated with food log data. Standardized meals were identified and selected from the Cronometer food logs. Food names were cleaned and unified for the standardized meals. Duplicate records of identical meals were merged. We only kept those mitigator records correctly following the procedure: (1) rice must be consumed within 30 min after the mitigators; (2) rice must be consumed after the mitigators. Other food intake before and during (2 hours) the standardized meal tests was also recorded. Time shifts from daylight saving were automatically recorded and corrected. CGM data were then merged with food log data.

We kept CGM records with relatively complete data in the time range of interest ([−25,170] minutes) and removed data with more than 30-minute gaps. We then applied a smoothing spline and resampled the data into a uniform time grid of 40 time points.

We manually checked each CGM curve and corrected mistakes in dates and times, including traveling between time zones. CGM curves with mistakes, such as discontinuities after device calibration or an indication of noncompliance, were removed. Traveling between time zones often produced an integer-hour time discrepancy between CGM and food log records, which was corrected by shifting integer hours.

The reproducibility and consistency of PPGRs were assessed based on AUC(>baseline). The glucose response was analyzed from the time of carbohydrate meal consumption until either 180 or 120 min post consumption. Replicate 1 and replicate 2 data for each carbohydrate meal type were extracted, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. ICC was also calculated to evaluate consistency within replicates of the same individuals.

We projected each CGM time series ([0, 170] minutes) into features19. The AUC (mg min dl−1) was calculated using the composite trapezoidal rule. AUC above a certain value (for example, AUC(>baseline) and AUC(>140)) was calculated by shifting the curves to these thresholds and integrating the positive parts. The baseline glucose level was defined as the glucose value with the minimal absolute distance to the zero time point. The peak value was defined as the maximal glucose value in the time range. Delta glucose peak (mg dl−1) was defined as the difference between the peak glucose value and the baseline glucose value. Delta glucose peak at a specific time point (for example, delta glucose peak at 120 min) was defined as the difference between the glucose value at the chosen time point and the baseline glucose value. Time (baseline to peak) (min) was defined as the time difference between the baseline time point and peak value. Time (return to baseline) was defined as the minimal time for the glucose level to decrease to or below the baseline glucose level. If the glucose level had not returned to baseline within 170 min, the time was set as 170 min. Slope (baseline to peak) (mg (dL min)−1) was defined as the division between delta glucose peak value and time from baseline to peak.

Mitigation effects were measured by subtracting the delta glucose peak of rice + mitigator from the delta glucose peak of rice alone and then normalizing by the rice delta glucose peak. A similar quantification of the mitigation effect was also calculated based on AUC(>baseline). The mitigation effect measured the relative suppression effect on glycemic response.

The x axis is time (minute), and the y axis is glucose level (mg/dL). The blue line is the mean curve of the meal, computed from all participants and replicates. The pink area is the confidence interval calculated by 2 standard errors.

Source data

a: Delta glucose peak (relative peak value to baseline) (mg/dL) and return time (min) for different food combinations. CGM curves are extracted into different features and presented with mean and standard errors (the error bar indicates 2 standard errors). The x axis is different food combinations, and the y axis is the feature value. Bars are ordered by mean value. The number of CGM curves (each dot) is: rice 115, potatoes 92, bread 99, pasta 65, grapes 98, beans 46, mixed berries 53, rice+fiber 64, rice+protein 61, and rice+fat 60. Extracted CGM features are compared between different carbohydrate meals. Each participant was instructed to eat each meal at least twice on two different days. b: the scatter plot for three exemplar meals visualized with 2 relatively independent features. The x axis is time to peak (the slope from baseline to peak, mg/(dL*min)), and the y axis is delta glucose peak. Different colors indicate different meals. Each point is one CGM curve.

Source data

The value was averaged among replicates and normalized by the maximum for that participant. Insulin resistance (insulin resistant IR vs insulin sensitive IS), SSPG, disposition index (DI), and HbA1c were also presented.

Carb-response-type in this paper was classified based on the average of PPGRs (delta glucose peak) of replicates. Here, we also classified each individual into different carb-response-type based on each single meal replicate (1 and 2) and compared it with the classification based on averaged PPGRs. The x axis is different carb-response-types from the averaged PPGR classification. The y axis indicates the percent of average-based classification to be assigned to the same group based on single replicates. Green indicates that the meal with the highest PPGR corresponding to the carb-response-type is still classified as the highest and red indicates that the original highest meal is classified as the second highest. For example, in participants classified to be bread-spiker by the averaged PPGR, most meal replicates still hold the same classification (bread as the highest PPGR meal) (62%), and a small chunk of meal replicates (15%) classified bread as the second highest meal.

Source data

The starch composition was measured, and the amount of rapidly digestible starch, slowly digestible starch, and resistant starch were quantified (detail in Methods). The boxplot presents the ratio between resistant starch and total starch and the ratio between slow digestible starch and total starch. Asterisks indicate Holm corrected p-value of the t-test (default, two-sided) of the selected pairs, *: pFDR < =0.05, **: pFDR < =0.01. The number of replicates is 3 for each food. The boxplots show the center line as the median and the hinges as the 25th and 75th percentiles. The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value not bigger than 1.5 times the distance between the hinges. Data beyond the whiskers are outliers. pFDR is: potatoes vs rice (left) 0.0014, potatoes vs bread (left) 0.019, pasta vs rice (right) 0.047, and pasta vs bread (right) 0.021.

Source data

Omics samples are colored according to sex (row 1) and hepatic insulin resistant (hepatic IR) states (row 2). The x axis is principal component 1 (PC1), and the y axis is PC2. Color distinguishes different groups, and each point is one sample. Each column is a different omics.

Source data

Strong microbiome features are selected (pFDR<0.1) from features of GO, KEGG, metacyc pathway, pfam, and reactions. Red indicates positive and blue indicates negative correlation. Asterisks indicate correlation original p-value < 0.05. The partial Spearman correlation was run with additional covariates, sample weight, and two-sided t-tests were run.

Source data

Metabolic features that are significantly associated (pFDR<0.05) with selected T2D-related clinical measurements (A1C, FBG, OGTT @120 mins, SSPG, disposition index (DI), Incretin effect, hepatic insulin resistance (hepatic IR), HOMA IR, adipose IR) are listed in the row. All clinical features are listed in columns. Red indicates positive and blue indicates negative correlation. Asterisks indicate p-value < 0.05 and double asterisks indicate pFDR<0.05. FDR corrections were implemented for each clinical feature. P-values were calculated with asymptotic t approximation with a two-sided test.

Source data

Lipidomics features that are significantly associated (pFDR<0.05) with selected T2D-related clinical measurements (A1C, FBG, OGTT @120 mins, SSPG, DI, Incretin effect, hepatic IR, HOMA IR, adipose IR) are listed in the row. All clinical features are listed in columns. Red indicates positive and blue indicates negative correlation. Asterisks indicate p-value < 0.05 and double asterisks indicate pFDR<0.05. FDR corrections were implemented for each clinical feature. P-values were calculated with asymptotic t approximation with a two-sided test.

Source data

a: SSPG estimation model. Left: Root mean squared error (RMSE) of SSPG estimation. The x axis indicates different tested models. Right: Coefficient values of the top predictive features of the cooperative model for SSPG estimation. Coefficients with more than 30% of the absolute value of the maximum features are presented. Positive value contributed to higher SSPG. The Null model used mean as the estimation. b: Model performance and coefficient of the PG (Potatoes/Grapes) ratio estimation model. Each of these models was built 100 times with different train/test splits. The model performance is presented with mean and standard errors (the error bar indicates 2 standard errors).

Pathway enrichment result for metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics associated with meal-specific postprandial response. Omics features significantly (P < 0.05) associated with PPGRs (delta glucose peak) to each meal were selected and enriched with GO, KEGG, Reactome and HMDB. The P value was adjusted by FDR for each cluster, within each omic and for each database or ontology (for example, GO pathways enriched from proteins positively correlated with rice PPGRs).

Kári Stefánsson's genomics firm deCODE became an early leader in conducting genome-wide association studies.Credit: Halldor Kolbeins/AFP via Getty

It's been a month since Kári Stefánsson, the founder and former chief executive of the pioneering Icelandic genomics company deCODE genetics, says he was summarily fired by deCODE's parent company, the biotechnology giant Amgen, and Stefánsson is his usual candid — some have said abrasive — self.

“The possibility certainly exists that I'm simply a dislikable individual that they wanted to get rid of,” he says. “A significant proportion of my old friends would agree with that.”

Stefánsson, a neurologist and neuroscientist, left a faculty position at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, to found deCODE in 1996. The company convinced a large proportion of Icelanders to share their genomic data, and a controversial 1998 law enabled deCODE to create a national database containing medical records from Iceland's healthcare system.

How a trove of cancer genomes could improve kids' leukaemia treatment

The firm was an early leader in conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that linked common single-letter DNA variations to people's risk of developing complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes1 and schizophrenia2 , as well as other traits (I attended a talk in the 2000s at which Stefánsson said they had even found a gene variant associated with enjoying crossword puzzles). Thanks mainly to deCODE's efforts, Icelanders accounted for 11.5% of GWAS participants between 2007 and 2017, one study found3.

 “The amazing thing is that in this tiny little country with a population of about 390,000 people, we managed to build up a genetics organization that was second to none,” Stefánsson says.

After financial troubles forced deCODE into bankruptcy in 2009 and a subsequent takeover by private investors, Amgen bought the firm in late 2012 for US$415 million. Stefánsson says that deCODE has operated more or less autonomously from Amgen for most of the past 12 years.

“We have had a very free-spirited atmosphere where people have worked on the assumption that chaos is a very important beginning point to all research you do,” Stefánsson says.

Stefánsson attributes his downfall to a recent shift in deCODE's relationship with Amgen, which, he says, sought closer integration between the two. “When you are working in a very goal-oriented work environment to serve drug discovery and development, this is a very noble activity, but you lose some of that freedom.”

What went wrong at 23andMe? Why the genetic-data giant risks collapse

Stefánsson says he was blindsided when, on 1 May, while he was visiting Amgen's headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California, the company's vice-president for research and development, Jay Bradner, told him his services were no longer needed at deCODE.

“I was asked to come to another building, put into a room where Jay Bradner sat in front of me and said, ‘You are fired', basically. Before I arrived back in Iceland, they had sent out a press release announcing my departure from deCODE,” he says. “I think it is not a graceful way of parting with the founder of the company who had run it for 29 years.”

Amgen declined to comment on Stefánsson's characterization of his dismissal. But in a statement to Nature, a representative said the decision “reflects a strategic evolution in the way our deCODE and other Amgen scientists work together to advance research in service of patients”.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Trumpworld Is Fighting Over ‘Official' Crypto Wallet","https://www.wired.com/story/trumpworld-is-fighting-over-official-crypto-wallet/","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 17:27:47 GMT","

As Donald Trump and his family stretch into nearly every corner of the cryptocurrency sector, a dispute has broken out over which corporate entities are permitted to wield the Trump brand to promote the crypto products they launch.

On Tuesday, the X account for the US president's Trump memecoin—which is administered by Fight Fight Fight LLC, formed by longtime Trump ally Bill Zanker—announced plans to launch a crypto wallet and trading platform in partnership with NFT marketplace Magic Eden. The corresponding website, first identified by independent crypto researcher Molly White, pitches the product as “the official $TRUMP wallet by President Trump.”

However, in X posts of their own, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. later repudiated the announcement, which they claimed had not been greenlit by the family. Eric Trump implied that the Trump Organization, the holding company for many of the family's business ventures and intellectual property, could take action against Magic Eden.

“This project is not authorized” by the Trump Organization, wrote Eric on X. “I would be extremely careful using our name in a project that has not been approved and is unknown to anyone in our organization,” he added, tagging the Magic Eden handle.

In a separate post, Donald Trump Jr. revealed that a separate crypto wallet is under development at World Liberty Financial, a crypto company that he and Eric helped to launch in September. “Stay tuned—World Liberty Financial, which we have been working tirelessly on, will be launching our official wallet soon,” he wrote.

World Liberty Financial and Fight Fight Fight did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The White House and Magic Eden declined to comment. Eric Trump did not respond directly to questions from WIRED, saying only, “I know nothing about this project nor is there any contractual relationship.”

To some crypto watchers, the initial wallet announcement made by Fight Fight Fight had the ring of truth about it, not least because it was coming from the organization behind the Trump memecoin. In the past year, despite a chorus of complaints relating to alleged abuses of office and conflicts of interest, the Trump family has forged into almost every segment of the crypto market, from stablecoins to memecoins, crypto investment products, and bitcoin mining. To launch a crypto wallet appeared to some as a plausible next step: “It makes perfect sense for anyone who has their eye on where the puck is going,” says Brad Harrison, head of crypto platform Venus Labs.

The dispute over the wallets soon to be launched by World Liberty Financial and Fight Fight Fight, though, marks the second time in as many weeks that Trump-affiliated entities have thrown themselves into competition with one another as expansion on multiple fronts complicates the family's crypto empire.

On May 27, Trump Media and Technology Group, a publicly traded company in which the Trump family owns a majority stake, announced it had raised $2.5 billion to accumulate a “bitcoin treasury.” The deal puts the conglomerate in competition with a growing stable of bitcoin-accumulation stocks, which act as a substitute of sorts for investing in bitcoin—among them American Bitcoin, the crypto mining firm launched recently by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., which is pursuing a similar strategy.

The wallet conflict also underlines the inscrutability of the relationships and interplay between the Trump Organization, Trump Media and Technology Group, World Liberty Financial, American Bitcoin, Fight Fight Fight, and the Trump family.

The full ownership structure of Fight Fight Fight is obfuscated by layers of corporate filings unavailable to the public. The X posts by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday appear to allege that, as the leaders of the Trump Organization, they reserve the right to limit the company's use of their family name to the Trump memecoin.

Meanwhile, though World Liberty Financial has sought to underline its independence from Donald Trump's political affairs—“We're a private company having private-sector conversations,” wrote World Liberty Financial cofounder Zak Folkman in a recent statement—the wallet dispute has underscored its entanglement with the president's family brand. In his X post on Tuesday, Donald Trump Jr. appeared to present the crypto wallet soon to be issued by World Liberty Financial as the real Trump family wallet, as set against what he alleges is the unauthorized Trump-branded wallet backed by Magic Eden.

In cryptoland, confusion reigns: “Not really sure what's real and what's not,” says Tom, the pseudonymous leader of peer-to-peer crypto exchange Raydium.

In the wider crypto industry, the ease with which anybody can put any name to an undifferentiated crypto product has long created problems, claims Cory Klippsten, CEO at bitcoin services company Swan Bitcoin.

“In crypto, it's far too easy to spin up scams masquerading as innovation,” alleges Klippsten, “especially when you can hijack a brand and pump a token before anyone asks who's behind it.”

AMD's latest acquisition could help reduce Nvidia's market dominance when it comes to AI hardware.

Semiconductor giant AMD on Wednesday announced it acquired AI software optimization startup Brium. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Brium is a startup that appears to be in stealth mode. The startup builds machine learning applications to enable AI inference, the process a trained AI model uses to draw conclusions from new data, across a variety of different hardware options, according to a blog post on Brium's bare-bones website.

Cutting through that jargon a bit, Brium can help retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware than it might have been designed for originally.

In a press release, AMD said its acquisition of Brium will help its commitment to “building a high-performance, open AI software ecosystem that empowers developers and drives innovation.”

While AMD is saying that this acquisition helps create a more open AI ecosystem, which isn't wrong, it seems clear that it's also meant to help AMD overcome one of its biggest roadblocks: a large percentage of AI software is being designed for Nvidia hardware and chips.

Brium's sole blog post, which came out in November 2024, talked about the industry's reliance on Nvidia and called out AMD specifically.

“In recent years, the hardware industry has made strides towards providing viable alternatives to Nvidia hardware for server-side inference,” the blog post reads. “Solutions such as AMD's Instinct GPUs offer strong performance characteristics, but it remains a challenge to harness that performance in practice as workloads are typically tuned extensively with Nvidia GPUs in mind. At Brium, we intend to enable efficient [model] inference across a range of hardware architectures.”

This is AMD's fourth strategic acquisition in the past two years, with the company's goal being to foster an open source AI ecosystem, according to the press release. The company previously acquired Silo AI (in July 2024), Nod.AI (October 2023), and Mipsology (August 2023).

TechCrunch has reached out to AMD for more information.

Reddit is suing Anthropic for allegedly using the site's data to train AI models without a proper licensing agreement, according to a complaint filed in a Northern California court on Wednesday. Reddit claims in the complaint that Anthropic's unauthorized use of the site's data for commercial purposes was unlawful, and alleges the AI startup violated Reddit's user agreement.

Reddit's lawsuit makes it the first Big Tech company to legally challenge an AI model provider over its training data practices, joining a litany of publishers that have sued tech companies on similar grounds.

The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft for training on its news articles without payment or permission. Meanwhile, Sarah Silverman and other book authors have sued Meta for training AI models on their books without approval. Music publishers and artists have also brought similar claims against AI audio, video, and image generation startups, alleging misuse of their content.

“We will not tolerate profit-seeking entities like Anthropic commercially exploiting Reddit content for billions of dollars without any return for redditors or respect for their privacy,” said Ben Lee, Reddit's chief legal officer, in a statement to TechCrunch.

Notably, Reddit has inked deals with other AI model providers, including OpenAI and Google, that allow these companies to train AI models on Reddit's data and have the site's posts appear in their respective AI chatbots' answers. However, in the filing, Reddit says it subjects OpenAI and Google to certain terms that protect its users' interests and privacy.

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has an 8.7% stake in Reddit, making him the third-largest shareholder, and was once a member of the company's board of directors.

In the filing, Reddit claims that it approached Anthropic and made it clear that the AI startup did not have authorization to scrape or use Reddit's content. However, Reddit alleges that Anthropic “refused to engage.”

“We disagree with Reddit's claims and will defend ourselves vigorously,” said Anthropic spokesperson Danielle Ghighlieri in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.

Reddit claims in its complaint that Anthropic's scraper bots ignored the social network's robots.txt files, a standard that signals to automated systems not to crawl websites. The online community platform alleges that, after Anthropic claimed to block its bots from scraping Reddit in 2024, Anthropic's bots continued to scrape the platform more than 100,000 times.

Reddit is asking Anthropic to pay compensatory damages, as well as restitution for the amount by which Anthropic has been enriched by scraping Reddit's content. Reddit also requests an injunction prohibiting Anthropic from continuing to use Reddit's content.

reply



EDIT: One library I found is https://github.com/thetarnav/streaming-markdown which seems to combine incremental parsing with optimistic rendering, which works good enough in practice, I guess.


reply



However, the second thing (not mentioned in the post) is that we are not rendering the markdown to HTML on the server, so []() markdown is sent to the client as []() markdown, not converted into <a href=...>. So even if a []() type link exists in a code block, that text will still be sent to the client as []() text, only sent in a single chunk and perhaps with the link URL replaced. The client has its own library to render the markdown to HTML in React.Also, the answers are typically short so even if OpenAI outputs some malformed markdown links, worst case is that we end up buffering more than we need to and the user experiences a pause after which the entire response is visible at once (the last step is to flush any buffered text to the client).

reply



(This comment when subjected to this processing could look like: ""Could this result in edge cases with "")


reply



There are some easy wins that could improve this further: line endings within links are generally not valid markdown, so if the code ever sees \n then just flush buffered text to the client and reset the state to TEXT.


reply



it formats its own stuff with markdown, so if i ask it for markdown but dont explicitly specify a downloadable file, it will produce valid markdown up to where it conflicts with its own markdown, and then it gets choppy and chunked.its an issue of my prompting is what im sure some customer service rep would be told to tell me :p because theres money to be made in courses for prompting skills perhaps, idk. (cynical view).sure is enjoyable to struggle together with the AI to format its responses correctly :'D

Yes, it may not make sense to use classical algorithms to try to recognize a cat in a photo.But there are often virtual or synthetic images which are produced by other means or sensors for which classical algorithms are  applicable and efficient.

I also feel the need to caution others that by letting the AI write lots of code in your project it makes it harder to advance it, evolve it and just move on with confidence (code you didn't think about and write it doesn't stick as well into your memory).

You can also make the AI review itself. Have it modify code, than ask to review the code, than ask to address review comments, and iterate until it has no more comments.Use an agentic tool like Claude Code or Amazon Q CLI. Then ask it to run tests after code changes and to address all issues until test pass. Make sure to tell it not to change the test code.

Sure - a destination is ""local"" if your machine has a route to that IP which isn't via a gateway.If your network is large enough that it consists of multiple routed network segments, and you don't have any ACLs between those segments, then yeah, you won't be fully protected by this browser feature. But you aren't protected right now either, so nothing's getting worse, it's just not getting better for your specific use case.

One internal site I spend hours a day using has a 10.x.x.x IP address. The servers for that site are on the other side of the country and are many network hops away. It's a big company, our corporate network is very very large.A better definition of ""local IP"" would be whether the IP is in the same subnet as the client, i.e. look up the client's own IP and subnet mask and determine if a packet to a given IP would need to be routed through the default gateway.

It would be nice to know when a site is probing the local network.

Sonos has made a name for itself with sound-playing Wi-Fi speakers that are perfect for immersive sound around the house. But a few years ago, Sonos tossed convention aside and created a Bluetooth (and Wi-Fi) portable speaker that you can carry with you wherever you go whether to the beach, a backyard barbecue, or the pool. The result is the Sonos Move 2 that combines the legendary Sonos sound with total portability.

Today, this tough speaker is hitting its all-time best price on Amazon, and it's an amazing deal to prepare your summer holidays. Usually, the Sonos Move 2 retails for $449 which is on par with other premium portable speakers. But with a 25% discount on Amazon, you can bring it home today for just $336. That's a $113 discount and the lowest price this speaker has ever been which makes it an elite deal for a speaker of this caliber.

See at Amazon

What sets the Sonos Move 2 truly unique is its exceptional audio quality: Sonos has reimagined the acoustic design for this new model. Instead of a single tweeter, the Move 2 features two which unveils a genuine stereo soundstage providing crisp vocals and detailed instruments. The bass is deep and dynamic and it is powered by a precision-tuned woofer that brings music to life with the emotional energy of a live performance.

You will also love Sonos' automatic Trueplay tuning built right in: This mode uses the internal microphones in the speaker to keep listening to its surroundings and adjust the sound on the fly. Whether you find yourself in a large backyard or a cozy little living room, the Move 2 tunes itself to deliver you the best sound you can have. You don't have to futz with settings or worry about where to put it as the speaker does it all for you.

Due to efficiency gains across the board, you can now have a maximum of 24 hours of uninterrupted playback from a single charge which is double the last generation. It means you can party throughout the day and well into the evening without running out of power. When the time comes to recharge, simply place the Move 2 on its included wireless charging base, now featuring a detachable power cord and shrinker adapter.

Its IP56 rating guarantees that the speaker is spill-proof, splash-proof, rain-proof, dirt-proof, and dust-proof.

If you love music wherever life takes you, this is the speaker to choose.

Dan Da Dan is set to make a highly anticipated return to streaming platforms. Ahead of the new season, Science Saru and GKids are collaborating again to release Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye, a theatrical cut featuring the first three episodes of the second season. This release will also include a special behind-the-scenes interview with co-directors Fuga Yamashiro and Abel Gongora.

After a special Los Angeles screening of Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye, io9 held a virtual interview with the English voice cast: Abby Trott (who voices Momo Ayase), A.J. Beckles (Okarun), and Aleks Le (Jiji Enjoji). During our conversation, the three cast members reflected on their favorite moments from the previous season and shared their excitement about the scenes they are eager for fans to experience in the upcoming compilation preview film, which will be released June 6, as well as the anime's new season premiering in July.

This interview has been edited for brevity. 

Isaiah Colbert, io9: You've voiced plenty of standout characters in anime, but Dan Da Dan's Momo Ayase is one of my personal favorites. With her being a co-lead in a shonen series—a genre that traditionally puts male protagonists in the spotlight—what about Momo makes her special to you,  and how do you think she stands out even more in the shonen landscape this season?

 

Abby Trott: I love voicing Momo. I've been having so much fun with her. And it's interesting that this anime, although maybe if you had to put a label on it, a shonen has a lot of elements from different genres incorporated into it. And I think that helps Momo stand out. We do see a romance element, whereas in a lot of typical shonen, the protagonist will typically not be aware of romantic advances or intentions from a female protagonist. But in this, very early on, there's a relationship there. We can only look forward to seeing how that is going to grow and develop over the course of however many seasons the show goes on. For forever. I think she's very confident, and she cares fiercely about her loved ones; she's willing to do anything to protect them. Those are things about Momo that I love.

I think that I read an interview with the mangaka, where he said that Momo is his favorite character, and that he compared her to Superman. She makes everyone else around her want to step up to the plate and do their best, too. And that's one element that I really like about her. She makes everyone want to do their best.

io9: In your last interview with io9, you mentioned being a fan of the Dan Da Dan manga and having read it before auditioning. Were there any specific scenes from the manga that you were particularly excited to bring to life in season two ?

 

 

A.J. Beckles: The whole first interaction with Evil Eye is so cool in the manga. Science Saru, like always, took it and made it so much better; they added so much more content. I went back and read it recently, just to make sure that I was prepared for a recording, and I was like, “Oh, wow!” when I went in. They added a lot, and they did a great job. I think those interactions are what I most looked forward to. Acro Silky was definitely a cool fight, but it wasn't like a traditional hand-to-hand combat situation that this was with Evil Eye and Okarun. So I was really excited to see what that would look like, and they knocked it out of the park—Evil Eye's ball thing that he uses is really cool.

Aleks Le: It's kind of Okarun's first fight fight. He's not just launching himself.

Beckles: He has to dodge and punch, or whatever else, which he doesn't really know how to do. You get to see that bit of awkwardness, too, that he clearly doesn't know what he's doing versus Evil Eye, who seems so experienced in comparison. It's interesting, and they did a great job of showing that.

io9: First off, congrats on your anime voice acting award for Solo Leveling, Aleks. You've really kept your finger on the pulse of fan engagement—not just by pushing your vocal limits as Sung Jinwoo but also by embracing the memes and sharing behind-the-scenes moments on TikTok.

In Dan Da Dan season one, you threw “Deez Nuts” into the mix, making it an unexpectedly perfect fit for the series' chaotic energy. Can you walk me through how that creative choice came about with the team at Bang Zoom? And are there any other localization line reads you're especially excited to bring to life in season two?

Aleks Le: First of all, thank you so much for the congratulations. I appreciate it. And as for that particular line, I made a video about that where I said that the line was actually adapted by our English dub director, Alex Von David, who is wonderfully talented. He put so many funny things into the dub like the usage of the word “bitch” by almost everybody. Those were always really fun. He had pitched the idea of for this joke.

He was like, “Maybe we should put deez nuts in there.” We were discussing it back and forth because it was just two words, but there was so much history behind the meme itself that we wanted to get it just right for the show. I feel like the meaning and the definition of deez nuts have been watered down over the years, and we really needed to hone in on it.

What ended up happening was that we performed it once initially, and Alex was like, “That's good. I think we should put the emphasis on deez, like deez nuts.” And I was like, “But I want to do it like the original.” So he was like, “Oh, the original, deez nuts?” and I'm like, “You've seen the video?” And he's like, “I've heard it thrown around, but I don't remember the video.” So I was like, “Okay,” [so] I pulled up the video, and our poor engineer had to just sit there as I showed him the deez nuts and then we were going back and forth on it. He was very insistent on one way and I was like, “I want to do it exactly like the video.” We did it so many times, and then we finally found one that we were both really happy with. So that was how deez nuts ended up in the show.

Alex is a driving force of this adaptation. In terms of improv, it's always the most unnoticeable, subtle moments of comedy, I feel, are where my strong suits come in. There's a lot of Jiji reads where I really want to make it sound as noncommittal as possible, as in it doesn't sound like somebody who's doing a performance. It sounds like you walked by a group of teenagers, and you had your microphone up to them, and you heard what they're saying. “Oh, my God, blah blah blah blah.” They shout basically drivel. That's my favorite part of the improv that we get to do.

We do have a lot of limitations on what we can and can't do. One of my favorite improvs that didn't make it was in episode 11 when Jiji first introduces himself. We had him singing the Dan Da Dan theme song, and it was really really good. But then we looked back on it, and we were just like “It's too meta. It wouldn't really make sense for the moment.” In the future, though, I hope we can throw it back in there somewhere.

io9: Alongside their seiyuus, you've all brought Okarun, Momo, and Jiji to life beautifully, capturing the essence of the anime's low-taper fade occult nerd, outspoken gyaru, and resident himbo. As season two approaches, what aspects of their dynamics are you most excited to explore, and how has your approach to voicing them evolved, especially while recording separately, and the energy each of you is bringing into the booth?

Trott: For Momo, this season kicks off with a lot of action. The first three episodes (that hopefully you'll go see in theaters, everyone) is a lot of yelling and a lot of [being] in the action. I'm looking forward to getting back to the elements, such as the relationships between the other characters Momo's relationship with Okarun. I love how Momo has this kind of cute way of speaking to him at times, which is her way of flirting. Just those little moments, I'm looking forward to the development of relationships.

Beckles: I'm looking forward to seeing how Okarun reacts to Jiji. Okarun is so polite, and he's very cognizant of thinking about what he says before he says it. He's very mature for his age in terms of how he views relationships and communication and Jiji throws all that out of the window. I'm interested to see how he handles it. It'll be fun to play like him handling those moments where he's trying to be a certain way, trying to be like kosher, and Jiji doesn't care. And how he's gonna handle coming out of his shell more. I think Jiji is gonna bring some of that out of Okarun.

But in the meantime, I think where we're at, it's very much Okarun knowing who Jiji is, but they haven't spent a lot of time together. Only just now, at the end of the last season, he's on the train, and they're talking about the magazine Okarun is sharing and Jiji is genuinely interested. Okarun's never had that before—a friend who's not picking on him—and I think that'll be really cool to see Okarun embrace and learn not to see Jiji as a threat to his new feelings he has towards Momo. Or maybe he still will. It'll be cool to see that unfold and watch all those different personalities interact—Momo instigating moments and trying to get them to be friends—and it'll be cool.

Le: I think we all know each other pretty well, and our performance styles. We are aware of how each of us would act. We have a good image in our heads of how one person would do a specific read or [how] one person would interpret the scene this way and, ultimately, the nuances of those performances in the final surprise us. But, for the most part, we have a really good idea of what the other person's gonna do.

I feel that closeness and understanding has given us the ability to performing these scenes basically in the dark, yet still having them mesh really well with each other. I feel like we all understand each other's sense of humor or acting choices pretty well, for the most part.

Dan Da Dan season two premieres this July on Netflix, Crunchyroll, and Hulu. Evil Eye hits theaters across the U.S. June 6.

This wireless desk can power almost your entire PC, no cables or batteries needed.

YouTube creator DIY Perks has partnered with startup Etherdyne Technologies to create a true wireless power system on a four-foot by two-foot desk, allowing him to run a complete workstation with its associated accessories without any cables. You can see in the YouTube video that he's running a wireless mouse, a wireless keyboard, true wireless stereo speakers, a wireless microphone, and even a wireless monitor —all powered by a flexible wire loop that generates up to 100 watts of wireless power.

According to Matthew Perks, the person behind the YouTube channel, Etherdyne's Wire-Free Power Zone kit works similarly to the wireless chargers most phones have. These wireless chargers generate an alternating electromagnetic field with a frequency between 110 and 205 kHz, which is enough to produce around 15 watts of power.

But because its frequency is so low, your device must be so close to the wireless charger that it will only work efficiently if the coils are perfectly aligned with each other. They also need to be in proximity, so much so that they're practically touching each other's surfaces.

On the other hand, Etherdyne's solution has a transmission frequency of 6.78 MHz, allowing it to deliver up to 100 watts of power at distances of up to three feet. You also don't have to align the coils perfectly to achieve wireless power transmission — as long as it's within the range of the ‘power dome', your devices will reliably get enough power, depending on the power coil you use.

To prove that the peripherals he's using aren't secretly battery-powered, Perks removed the battery from his wireless mouse and replaced it with the wireless power receiving loop. He also built the stereo speakers, a heated mug, and the wireless microphone from 3D printed and spare parts — all of which are powered wirelessly. He also modified a 24-inch monitor by building a custom base that integrated two 7-watt power loops. This allowed him to ditch the monitor's power cord entirely, and he then used a wireless HDMI receiver to connect it to a Framework that's built directly into the desk.

The DIY Perks is an excellent demonstration of the possibilities of Etherdyne Technologies' Wire-Free Power Zone tech. Unfortunately, it's not yet commercially available, although you can request an Evaluation Kit from the Etherdyne website if you're interested in experimenting with it. Some users might also have some health concerns about the amount of radio frequency the wireless tech is pushing out, but the company claims that its Eval Kit has already received FCC and CE certification, so it likely complies with safety regulations.

But if you want to try the wireless power tech for yourself without going through all the trouble of building your own desk, you can purchase the AirBrite Universal Wireless Lighting System, which uses the same technology to deliver lighting solutions to miniature builds. It's also planning to launch a Kickstarter for a sit/stand desk that implements the technology similar to how Perks does it.

Aside from these consumer applications, the company also highlighted commercial, industrial, and medical applications for its technology. These are promising applications for such an innovative technology, and it could even be the next step towards true wireless power. Etherdyne also isn't the first company to experiment with this, with researchers able to harvest low amounts of energy from radio and Wi-Fi. Still, the claimed 100-watt capacity of the Wire-Free Power Zone technology could be the game changer for wireless charging and power.

GF's announcement outpaces its annual construction spend by 10x


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


GlobalFoundries has announced new plans to dedicate $16 billion to expanding its U.S. chip production. The largest contract chipmaker in the U.S., GlobalFoundries announced the decision in response to ""unmet demand"" in the U.S. for local clients such as Apple and Qualcomm.

GlobalFoundries specified that $13 billion of the funds will go towards expanding the company's existing New York and Vermont fabs, with the remaining $3 billion dedicated to researching advanced packaging and other new technologies. The company claims it is carving out ""lucrative niches"" in the chipmaking world, such as the research of photonic chips or the use of gallium nitride (GaN) in chips.

The $16 billion commitment from GlobalFoundries is a major change in tradition for the company, which has spent around $1.4 billion every year for the past five years on new plants and equipment. Compare this to Intel's annual construction budget of $14 billion in 2024 and years prior.

New CEO Tim Breen, appointed to the position in February of this year, makes no claims about when the new funds will be spent. Breen prefers to ""stay flexible"" in the face of endorsements from high-profile clients, including Apple, Qualcomm, and General Motors.

Breen seemingly views GlobalFoundries as well-positioned in the face of much market and chip-industry insecurity prompted by the heavy tariffs consistently being issued from the White House. ""Supply security matters,"" said Breen in an interview, claiming that GlobalFoundries' clients are looking for more local production and to ""reduce dependence on suppliers that have their manufacturing concentrated in one location"".

The back half of the last quote is likely a dig at Taiwan-based TSMC, the largest contract chip fab in the world, which currently holds over 50% market share. Comparatively, GlobalFoundries' approximately 5% market share and inability to produce chips below its 12LP+ process node (comparable to TSMC's 10nm) would make it seem ill-positioned to be throwing meaningful digs at TSMC.

GlobalFoundries' reliance on legacy process nodes is still a profitable existence thanks to the ""AI boom"" seen in enterprise spending. Breen claims this most recent announcement is ""a strategic response to the explosive growth in artificial intelligence"" seen in recent years. GlobalFoundries' website marketing seems largely reliant on the low power consumption of its legacy chips, a key concern for enterprise clients as data center power draw grows beyond 100 MW.

How this $16 billion commitment manifests is yet to be seen. Thanks to GlobalFoundries' entrenchment in the U.S. and its commitment to plant expansions rather than new construction, it is thankfully highly unlikely that the company will pull a Foxconn and completely abandon its commitments. The insecurity and untrustworthiness of the barrage of tariff announcements, however, may lead to the timescale of these projects being pushed back later and later as time goes on.

That's a lot of shielding.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Nintendo Switch 2 is only just launching, and someone has already torn it down. YouTube channel ProModding has opened up the new handheld console, showcasing the new Nvidia chip, as well as taking a microscope to examine all the circuits.

The teardown starts with screws on the bottom of the system and behind the kickstand. It ends up toher screws are on the colored covers on each side of the system, where you attach the Joy-Con controllers. With screws and clips out of the way, the back cover comes right off.There is a lot of metal shielding, but ProModding dispatched that with a few screws after removing the antennae.After removing the cooler and disconnecting the battery, the motherboard came out. After prying off more shielding and removing the thermal paste, the new Nvidia chip was unveiled. The GMLX30-A1 name on the chip is similar to leaks posted back in 2024.

If you want to see every IC on the board, you're in luck. ProModder goes over the whole board with a microscope.With the exception of the screws on the sides of the device, this doesn't seem like a very arduous teardown. That being said, you probably shouldn't open your own Switch 2, as you may void your warranty or damage your console. Recently, Nintendo of America updated its End User License Agreement to note that you can't ""bypass, modify, decrypt, defeat, tamper with, or otherwise circumvent any of the functions or protections of the Nintendo Account Services, including through the use of any hardware,"" and that if you do, Nintendo may ""render... the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part."" So if you open it to make a change, you may be risking the possibility of your system working at all.Nintendo will likely have a more specific repair manual for its technicians. But until the launch tomorrow, June 5, we can watch modders on YouTube do their thing.

Medicare Advantage (MA) plans entice many seniors with their simplicity and bundled coverage, offering an alternative to the complexity of traditional Medicare's separate Parts A, B, and D. When launched under the 1996 Balanced Budget Act as Medicare+Choice, they were intended to expand options and reduce costs for Medicare beneficiaries by inviting private insurers into the fold, but over time they have become a profit center for private interests at taxpayers' expense.

Industry groups like AHIP insist that MA plans “deliver better services, better access to care, and better value.” Yet, independent voices, such as the Center for Medicare Advocacy, point out that “private plans were supposed to deliver better care more efficiently — and they have done neither.” The gap between marketing and reality is now too large to ignore.

One of the biggest draws for MA plans, which have enrolled nearly 33 million Americans, is the cap on out-of-pocket costs. Unlike traditional Medicare, which covers only 80% of expenses and requires a separate Medigap policy for the rest, MA plans set a maximum annual limit on what enrollees pay (up to $9350 for in-network services in 2025). Monthly premiums for MA plans also tend to be lower, averaging $17 in 2025, and in some cases, there's no additional premium at all.

The marketing is relentless: Seniors are bombarded with ads promising extra benefits like dental, vision, hearing, gym memberships, and even cash cards for everyday expenses. These commercials often paint a picture of comprehensive, affordable care that's hard to resist. However, many of these promises come with caveats. For instance, a plan might tout dental coverage but fail to mention the $160 annual cap, promote broad provider choice while restricting access to a narrow network of doctors and hospitals, or have directories that are out of date, listing physicians who are no longer in network.

What's more, many of the most generous-sounding benefits are available only to specific groups, particularly those who are “dual-eligible” for both Medicare and Medicaid. These beneficiaries are highly sought after by MA plans, not because they are sicker or need more help but because they bring in higher payments from the government, making them especially profitable for insurers. This raises an important question: Do MA plans truly deliver on their promises, or are they simply designed to attract the most lucrative enrollees? Here is how dual-eligible beneficiaries bring in more money:

Unmet needs remain, even for “extra” benefits. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provides nearly $20 billion per year in rebates to MA plans to fund supplemental benefits, but many low-income MA enrollees still report unmet dental, vision, and hearing needs due to cost. The reality is that advertised benefits often come with low annual caps or limited provider networks, leaving many seniors unable to access or afford the care they were promised.

Narrow networks limit your choice of doctors. Ads and brokers rarely mention that MA plans restrict which doctors and hospitals you can use. While traditional Medicare lets you see any provider who accepts Medicare (about 90% of US physicians), MA plans are notorious for “narrow” networks. For example, a recent “Network Adequacy” complaint to CMS described an MA plan in Florida that removed about 70% of rheumatologists in Palm Beach County from its network, leaving patients scrambling to find care. The Coalition of State Rheumatology Organizations (CSRO) has highlighted this and other growing problems in a recent webinar.

Prior authorizations create delays and denials. Another major issue unique to MA plans is the widespread use of prior authorizations. According to AARP, over 90% of MA plans require prior authorization for services ranging from lab tests and procedures to hospital stays. For medications administered in the doctor's office (Part B drugs), 98% of MA plans require prior authorization. These hurdles often result in delays, denials, and extra administrative burden for both patients and providers, and they are not present in traditional Medicare.

MA plans impose strict drug formularies and “fail first” (step therapy) policies. In these policies, which are often placed especially on provider-administered medications, patients are often forced to try and fail on less effective or unaffordable drugs before getting the therapy their doctor originally recommended. These utilization management tools are not used in original Medicare. Rheumatologists across the country, as reported to the CSRO's Payer Issue Response Team, consistently encounter these obstacles, which delay or block access to needed care.

Brokers have incentives to hide the risks of enrolling in MA plans. Seniors are often unaware that brokers earn higher commissions for enrolling them in MA plans than for signing them up for traditional Medicare with a supplement. Once enrolled in an MA plan, it can be difficult or expensive to switch back to traditional Medicare, as obtaining a Medigap plan may require medical underwriting — a barrier not present when enrolling in Medigap at the outset. Brokers rarely disclose these risks. Although CMS's 2025 Final Rule aimed to standardize and cap agent and broker compensation, lawsuits have delayed these changes, so strong financial incentives for brokers to steer seniors into MA plans remain in place.

Despite industry claims that MA plans save the government money, the independent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has repeatedly found the opposite. In its March 2025 report, MedPAC estimated that MA plans will cost the federal government $84 billion more in 2025 alone than if those same beneficiaries were enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare — a 20% overpayment. These excess costs are driven mainly by two factors: “coding intensity,” where MA plans document more diagnoses to increase risk scores and payments; and “favorable selection,” meaning MA plans tend to enroll healthier individuals whose costs are lower than their risk scores suggest.

MedPAC's analyses, echoed by other independent experts, show these overpayments have ranged from about $80 billion to as high as $140 billion per year. The commission also highlights that nearly half of MA enrollees face restricted provider networks, which can delay or limit access to care for complex conditions. For example, 68% of MA plans require prior authorization for rheumatology drugs, compared with 0% in traditional Medicare, leading to further barriers for patients.

In summary, MedPAC does not view MA plans as a cost-saving success and continues to urge Congress to reform payment policies and address these structural imbalances.

MA's evolution into a system where profits often take precedence over patient care is starkly illustrated by the recent Department of Justice criminal investigation into UnitedHealth's Medicare Advantage business practices, which follows allegations of Medicare fraud and inflated risk coding. At the same time, rising care costs and increased scrutiny have led some insurers to scale back: Many plans are exiting markets, shrinking service areas, or reducing benefits to preserve profit margins. In 2025, 60% of MA plans weakened their benefit offerings, meaning enrollees get even less coverage than before. Unlike traditional Medicare, where benefits are stable and guaranteed, MA plans can and do reduce care to maintain their bottom line — leaving seniors with fewer choices and more barriers when they need care most.

Greater scrutiny of insurers' business practices for MA plans appears to be on the way. CMS recently announced that it will immediately “audit all eligible MA contracts for each payment year in all newly initiated audits and invest additional resources to expedite the completion of audits for payment years 2018 through 2024.”

While not all MA plans are problematic, it appears that the significant issues seniors are already facing are likely to become increasingly more common in the future. If we are to preserve the original intent of this public-private partnership, we must institute some reforms: rigorous oversight, true accountability in health care decisions, and a renewed commitment to equity in care. Anything less risks turning Medicare Advantage's promise into little more than a marketing slogan, rather than the safety net our seniors deserve.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

 June 04, 2025  

MANCHESTER — Thousands of people in the United Kingdom with advanced heart failure are not being referred for potentially life-saving treatments, a leading heart transplantation expert said at the British Cardiovascular Society Annual Conference 2025. 

Owais Dar, a consultant cardiologist at Harefield Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, described a “systemic failure” in delivering transplants and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) to eligible patients in the UK. 

This failure was leading to a “deadly delay” in care, he said.

Presenting data from a National Advanced Heart Failure Audit, Dar estimated that 10,000 adults under 65 who could be eligible for a heart transplant or LVAD therapy had not been referred to specialist services. 

Furthermore, 130,000 adults with advanced heart failure were living with palliative care needs.

“If this was a cancer, we would be furious about this,” said Dar, who is also an honorary senior lecturer at King's College London. “We've got young people here who are not accessing [these therapies].”

Dar noted wide variation in referral patterns. Even in regions with the highest rates of referral, the numbers fell short of what was needed. “Generally, within the UK and Ireland, we're just not thinking about transplant or LVAD therapy as even an option,” he said.

Geraint Jenkins, a consultant cardiologist at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, Wales, told Medscape News UK, “The majority of the patients these days — because medical therapy is so good — get better.”

He observed that half of patients with an ejection fraction under 30% regain nearly normal heart function within a year, “and they don't get anywhere near a transplant centre.”

Jenkins warned that current referral criteria were “lax” and, if followed, could overwhelm specialist services. 

“We've got thousands of patients with ICDs [implantable cardioverter defibrillators], and the number of patients having ICD shocks every month is quite substantial,” he said. “If they all went to Harefield for assessment, that would swamp their services.”

Jenkins stressed the importance of identifying the right patients at the right time, which meant finding the “sweet spot” for patient referral. “That's what we're not doing well,” he said.

Separately, Dar told Medscape News UK that while there may not be enough hearts to match presumed demand, modern LVADs were “almost as good” an alternative.

LVADs are mechanical pumps that support circulation in patients with severely weakened hearts. They can be used for long-term support or as a bridge to transplant.

Theoretically there were “unlimited amounts of LVADs,” Dar said. As these were “off-the shelf” items, the waiting time should be shorter than for an appropriate organ donation. 

Many patients already had access to other advanced treatments like ICDs and cardiac resynchronisation therapies (CRTs), he added. “The only option they have is an operation that can allow them to live another 8 years.”

He emphasised the benefits for younger patients: “That's giving them back quality of life, where they can work again, exercise, and do things again — going from being bedbound and possibly dying within a year.”

Dar said advanced heart failure carries significant mortality risk. One-year mortality is around 40% using European Society of Cardiology (ESC) criteria, and 20% with American Heart Association benchmarks.

Based on US data, around 14% of a population of around 60,000 met ESC criteria for advanced heart failure, with 5% “within transplantable age” from 18 to 65, said Dar. 

Extrapolated to the UK with a total population of 68 million, 1 million would have a diagnosis of heart failure, 140,000 would have advanced disease, 50,000 would be under 65, and 10,000 eligible for transplantation or LVAD therapy.

A “feeling that we were not getting enough referrals” had led Dar and other transplant physicians across the UK and Ireland to form a working group to look into the issue. 

The aim was to create a heatmap of referrals that had been made to heart transplant and LVAD centres and assess inequality and equity of care. 

The working group audited 4 months of referral data, including 416 patients with a median age of 52. Most were men (67%) and White (73%), with a nonischaemic cause of heart failure (55%).

In 44% of outpatient referrals and 17% of inpatient referrals, patients were considered “too well” for transplant or LVAD. Respectively, 29% and 39% had contraindications to either option, with 19% and 31% progressing towards a transplant or device fitting. 

High body mass index was a key exclusion factor, alongside liver or kidney failure, diabetes-related organ damage, or smoking. 

The audit found significant regional variation — a ""postcode lottery"" in access. “There are large areas, particularly in Wales and the Northeast of England, that are simply not referring patients with advanced heart failure — for transplant or LVAD therapy,” Dar noted. Even areas around specialist transplant centres were not referring patients, he added. 

“It's affirmed what we suspected,” Dar told Medscape News UK. “So, I think the idea now is to speak to NHS England and colleagues to try and address this inequality and raise awareness of it to see how we can improve things.”

One approach, he suggested, might be to create a national pathway that sets out how quickly someone with suspected advanced heart failure was seen by a specialist team. 

Jenkins observed that travelling to specialist centres could be a problem for many patients living in more rural areas who could face long journeys. He suggested that specialists could perhaps hold monthly clinics within existing heart failure centres. 

Whatever the reason for the lack of referrals, Dar said it was clear that more needed to be done: “We're failing these patients. Speak to your local transplant centres about your patients and just have that conversation early on.”

Dar and Jenkins declared no relevant financial relationships.

At home in Australia, Mark Renton started playing football as soon as he could. He figured it would eventually lead to a career prescribing strength training and exercise regimens to athletes.

But as an undergraduate, the sports science curriculum included an exercise metabolism course that explored how cells turn energy into movement. This biological focus captured Renton's imagination, and he became increasingly interested in the mechanisms that underly muscle function, including developing force through contractions that mediate precise movements. Ultimately, Renton wound up earning a doctorate studying the heart, the body's most vital muscle.

Now continuing his heart research at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC, Renton has received a postdoctoral fellowship from the American Heart Association to study coronary microvascular dysfunction.

When most people think of heart disease, they think of heart attacks. But subtle cardiac problems can arise long before the first chest pain. In coronary microvascular disease, damaged blood vessels are impaired, which reduces blood flow to the heart. One condition puts patients at a particularly increased risk: obesity.

Renton will use the fellowship funding to continue studying the function of a particular protein, pannexin-1, that could hold the key to understanding obesity's effects on heart health. ""Pannexin-1 is a channel,"" said Renton, who works in the lab of Scott Johnstone. ""It sits on the outer surface of the cell membrane and allows ions to pass in and out of the cell and even into neighboring cells. These ions can initiate signaling processes within the cell, essentially telling the cell what it needs to do.""

The link between obesity and heart disease is long established, but the Johnstone lab team recently discovered that when pannexin-1 is removed, blood vessels in the heart lose their ability to expand and contract properly - a symptom that also occurs in obesity.

This loss of function can lead to blood vessel spasms and chest pain. Renton hopes to uncover whether the loss in function occurs because obesity leads to fewer pannexin-1 channels, changes how the channels function, or alters the signals they transmit.

If we can understand exactly how obesity disrupts these channels, we might be able to develop treatments that keep them working properly - potentially preventing heart problems before they start.""

Mark Renton, Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC 

The implications could be far-reaching, as blood vessels throughout our bodies use similar mechanisms to control blood flow. ""Obesity doesn't just affect the heart,"" Renton said. ""It affects the brain, liver, kidneys, and everything that needs a blood supply."" Understanding how pannexin-1 regulates blood flow could lead to new treatments for multiple obesity-related conditions.

""Mark is a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher, and this award allows him to further scientific understanding of how obesity is linked with blood vessel spasms in patients' hearts,"" said Johnstone, an assistant professor at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute. ""He continues to be extremely productive, working with world-class researchers as he builds momentum toward his eventual goal of starting his own research group.""

Renton also works closely with Professor Steven Poelzing and Assistant Professor Jessica Pfleger, both primary faculty in the institute's Center for Vascular and Heart Research.

Household environments, including owning a dog, may affect the likelihood of children developing eczema, according to an analysis of almost 300,000 people from across Europe.

The prevalence of eczema has rapidly risen in industrialised areas over the past 30 years, now affecting approximately 20% of children and 10% of adults in high-income countries.

The new study, published in Allergy, examined data from 16 European studies, to investigate whether those who are prone to developing eczema might respond differently to environmental factors.

The researchers investigated interactions between the 24 most significant eczema-associated genetic variants and 18 early life environmental factors during the mother's pregnancy and the child's first year of life. Representing the largest and most comprehensive analysis of gene-environments interactions to date, the findings provide new insights into what could cause eczema in children and how environmental factors may influence genetic risk.

The international study team was led by researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), University of Edinburgh, University of Bristol and Helmholtz Munich.

An initial analysis of more than 25,000 individuals suggested there may be a relationship between seven environmental factors - dog ownership, having an older sibling, cat ownership, breastfeeding, smoking, antibiotic use and washing practices - and at least one established genetic variant that predisposes a child to eczema. In the further analysis of a larger group of almost 255,000 people, the only strong interaction found was between dog ownership and just one of the 24 eczema-associated genetic variations. Children or babies with that gene whose families owned a pet dog had a lower risk of developing eczema.

This genetic mutation is located near DNA that codes for interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) - a protein involved in immune cell function and inflammation. Lab tests confirmed that in human skin cells with the genetic variant, molecular signals from a dog can suppress skin inflammation instead of causing allergy.

These results are preliminary; however, they point to the IL-7R protein as a potential area of focus to inform prevention of eczema in some individuals. The study also found a similar effect among young children with older siblings, but further studies are needed to confirm the link. The researchers speculated that more microbial exposure at an early age, through contact with dogs and other children, could be behind the protective effect.

The authors stressed that the study did not look at the effect of dog exposure in the treatment of existing eczema, cautioning that introducing a dog may make symptoms worse in some children.

Despite the large number of people studied, the researchers did not have enough participants to draw meaningful conclusions on many gene-environment interactions, suggesting that only weak interactions are likely to exist. Further research involving a larger population, as well as greater diversity of ethnic background, is needed is needed to better understand interactions between genetic and environmental factors linked to eczema.

These results are an important step in understanding how environmental risks affect childhood eczema and how we might develop ways to prevent it. 

While exposure to dogs stands out as a factor worth exploring further, the results do not support exposure to a dog as an effective strategy to prevent eczema now. The study also helps rule out strong genetic interactions for many other environmental factors, which will help focus future research efforts.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New screening tool enhances early detection of pulmonary hypertension","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250604/New-screening-tool-enhances-early-detection-of-pulmonary-hypertension.aspx","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 18:04:00 GMT","

A novel screening approach developed by physicians at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University shows significant promise for improving the detection of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-a life-threatening form of heart failure related to high blood pressure in the lung circulation that is often overlooked due to vague symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath.

The new research, published online April 5 in the American Heart Journal, shows that the virtual echocardiography screening tool (VEST), when incorporated into the electronic medical record (EMR) system, can generate accurate PAH risk scores-without the need for time-consuming manual calculations. The approach is the first of its kind in the field of pulmonary vascular medicine.

""Our EMR-based VEST tool proved highly accurate in identifying individuals likely to have PAH,"" said Anjali Vaidya, MD, FACC, FASE, FACP, Co-Director of the Advanced Pulmonary Hypertension, Right Heart Failure & Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH) Program at Temple University Hospital; Professor of Medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine and lead author on the new study. According to Dr. Vaidya, the novel technology could be game-changing for heart failure and pulmonary vascular care. By embedding a simple but powerful screening tool into everyday hospital workflows, PAH can be caught earlier, when treatment has the greatest chance of success.

In previous work, Dr. Vaidya and colleagues applied VEST scoring to echocardiogram data, which provides estimates on pressure in the pulmonary artery and detects heart changes that suggest further testing is needed. They found that most patients had positive VEST scores more than 200 days before they received a referral to an accredited pulmonary hypertension (PH) center to confirm and treat their PAH diagnosis. The majority were calculated to have a high risk of mortality by the time they were referred for expert PH care.

For their latest study, Dr. Vaidya's team developed the EMR-based VEST algorithm and then tested it in nearly 5,000 patients who had undergone an echocardiogram. VEST scores automatically calculated by the algorithm were then compared to manually calculated VEST scores and used to identify patients at highest risk for PAH. Individuals with high risk scores were further analyzed to determine whether they had been referred to a PH center or had undergone right heart catheterization, which is the gold standard for PH diagnosis.

Among the highest-risk patients flagged by the tool, degree of PH was severe-but a third had never been referred to a PH specialist.""

Dr. Anjali Vaidya, MD, FACC, FASE, FACP, Co-Director of the Advanced Pulmonary Hypertension, Right Heart Failure & Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH) Program at Temple University Hospital, Professor of Medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine

When patients were referred for expert PH care, nearly all underwent confirmatory testing and were diagnosed with serious disease, highlighting how the tool can guide timely, life-saving referrals. Among patients that were not referred for expert care, very few received right heart catheterization for diagnostic testing, let alone treatment.

The simplicity of VEST, along with its ability to accurately detect patients at high risk of PAH, render it highly adoptable for widespread application.

""VEST has already been adopted at Temple, and we are now in the process of collaborating with other centers, nationally and internationally, to facilitate its implementation elsewhere,"" Dr. Vaidya added.

The hope is that with broad uptake of the automated EMR-VEST algorithm, more patients will receive earlier diagnoses and expert care-ultimately improving survival and quality of life for those living with PAH.

Other researchers involved in the study included Suneesh Anand, Gabriela Narowska, Chethan Gangireddy, Martin Keane, Daniel Edmundowicz, Paul Forfia and John Enevoldsen from the Advanced Pulmonary Hypertension Program and Division of Cardiology at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study highlights the lasting toll of colorectal cancer on women's sexual health","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250604/Study-highlights-the-lasting-toll-of-colorectal-cancer-on-womens-sexual-health.aspx","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 18:16:00 GMT","

A new University of British Columbia-led study is shedding light on a long-overlooked consequence of colorectal cancer: the lasting toll it can take on women's sexual health, even years after treatment ends.

Researchers analyzed health data from more than 25,000 women in B.C. diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1985 and 2017, comparing their experiences to those of cancer-free women. Cancer treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation were linked to a range of long-term sexual health issues, including a 67 per cent higher risk of dyspareunia-pain during sex-a condition that can cause severe distress and affect quality of life. For women diagnosed before age 40, the risk jumped to 90 per cent.

The study also revealed that survivors were more than three times as likely to experience pelvic inflammatory disease and nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis. Among younger women, the risk of premature ovarian failure-or early menopause-was 75 per cent higher than in their cancer-free counterparts.

The study, published in JNCI: Journal of National Cancer Institute, is one of the first to use population-level data to explore sexual health outcomes for colorectal cancer survivors.

Sexual health is a fundamental part of quality of life, yet it's an area that needs much more emphasis in colorectal cancer survivorship care. What our study shows is that these issues aren't rare-they're common, significant, and often only diagnosed well after treatment has ended.""

Dr. Mary De Vera, senior author and associate professor in UBC's faculty of pharmaceutical sciences

Dr. De Vera is herself a colorectal cancer survivor. ""As someone who was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, I know how difficult it can be to deal with sexual health issues afterward. In my patient communities, I've seen how often these challenges are experienced-but with very little support. This study was inspired by those experiences and is an opportunity to use research to raise awareness and bring these issues into the open.""

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in Canada, with around 10,500 new cases diagnosed in 2023. While often seen as a disease that affects older men, rates are rising among women and younger people.

Co-author Dr. Lori Brotto, a professor in UBC's faculty of medicine and an expert in women's sexual health, said the findings highlight a critical gap in care.

""Addressing sexual health in cancer care is still not standard of practice, and many healthcare providers attribute this to lack of training in the various ways that cancer can impact a patient's sexual health. These findings highlight the importance of all healthcare providers receiving some training in identifying sexual problems, and in being aware of evidence-based supports for survivors,"" said Dr. Brotto.

The authors say their findings point to an urgent need for better education, early interventions and more open conversations in cancer care settings.

""Identifying and acknowledging these issues is the first step toward more comprehensive, compassionate care for women after cancer,"" said Dr. De Vera.

NWSL

ST. LOUIS, Mo.—Former U.S. women's national team defender Becky Sauerbrunn got a hometown hero's welcome on Tuesday at Energizer Park ahead of, during and after the USWNT defeated Jamaica 4-0 to close out a successful international window.

Having retired from professional soccer last December after a 16-year career, the former U.S. captain returned not only as part of TNT's broadcast crew covering this friendly, but also to receive a proper send-off.

“I'm not used to having a lot of spotlight on me for something like this, but it's really about celebrating the people who got you here,” Sauerbrunn told reporters Monday.

For someone who's never been entirely comfortable in the spotlight, Tuesday night must've been overwhelming — in a good way. Sauerbrunn was born in St. Louis and developed her game here as a budding talent until she left for the University of Virginia in 2003. Her hometown sent her off in style with a celebration that included fireworks, a very realistic bobblehead, a standing ovation and a birthday cake (she turns 40 years old on Friday — June 6) fit for a legend.

“You know you've made it when you've got a bobblehead,” U.S. head coach Emma Hayes told reporters in her pre-match press conference.

 

 

A post shared by The Athletic Full Time (@tafulltime)



A commanding presence at center back, Sauerbrunn made 219 appearances for the U.S., anchoring the backline to two Women's World Cup titles and Olympic gold in 2012. It's quite a legacy for someone who never sought the spotlight. And it's one the current USWNT squad deeply respects and hopes to carry forward.

As the team bid farewell to Sauerbrunn off the field, the next generation made sure she had no reason to worry about the future on it. Hayes' squad delivered a dominant win, applying relentless pressure for 90 minutes, having 82 percent possession and allowing only two shots from the opposition.

Though the accomplished defender never scored for her country, she came very close two years ago at the same stadium that bid her goodbye.

On Tuesday, it was rookie Ally Sentnor who scored twice in the first half and Sauerbrunn's close friend Lynn Biyendolo who added two more after she came on early in the second half. Meanwhile, the backline, Sauerbrunn's old territory, was anchored by captain Naomi Girma, a fitting torchbearer for the legacy she left behind.

“I know I just said nobody can (fill Becky's shoes), but I think the next obvious person would be Naomi,” Biyendolo said. “The two things that they have in common are that they didn't want the role, but it just found them. And I think that makes the best leaders, is somebody who just doesn't want it, but is so natural at it.”

Girma, now the most expensive transfer in women's soccer history, had a rocky start at Chelsea after joining in January, left sidelined by a string of injuries. However, she is back and delivering. With both a Women's Super League title and the FA Cup under her belt, she is proving to be worth every penny. As former Chelsea manager Hayes put it, bringing her back “is like getting the Rolls-Royce out of the garage.”

Girma told ussoccer.com, “Becky was one of the best leaders this team has ever had.”

That kind of legacy doesn't happen overnight.

Listening to her former teammates after the match, it was clear: the trust and respect Sauerbrunn commands were built over years of grit, consistency and quiet leadership, beginning with her debut in 2008, when she earned her first cap against Canada at the Four Nations Tournament in China, playing with a broken nose.

“Becky is a legend, an icon,” Kerry Abello, who made her debut Tuesday, said after the match. “The game of women's soccer will never be the same without her.” Abello was eight years old when Sauerbrunn debuted back in 2008. Like many of the new generation of USWNT players, she grew up admiring her.

On the pitch, Sauerbrunn was a tireless, dependable center back; off it, she was a steady leader who played a key role in collective bargaining negotiations with the U.S. Soccer, representing her fellow players at the table year after year, and helping the team achieve equal pay.

She was always calm and composed, even when somebody made a mistake. “Becky doesn't get mad often, but if you mess up, like pass to the wrong player… she'll give you this look,” Biyendolo said after Tuesday's match. “That ‘I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed' look. That's the Becky look.”

 

 

A post shared by U.S. Soccer WNT (@uswnt)



Ask anyone who played alongside Sauerbrunn about the “Becky stare,” and they'll know exactly what you're talking about.

Hayes didn't get the chance to coach Sauerbrunn — she took over the team in May last year — but her admiration also runs deep, especially for how the defender has shaped the next generation.

“It's always nice when the people you leave behind talk about someone in such a way,” Hayes said. “I've got a locker room — not just the senior players, but less experienced players — that talk about her in the highest esteem, both as a leader and as a human being, and I don't think you could want anything more than that in life.”

The U.S. women's national team completed a perfect first international window of June.

Emma Hayes' squad secured a 4-0 victory over Jamaica at Energizer Park in St. Louis, Missouri courtesy of braces from Ally Sentnor and Lynn Biyendolo.

The Americans jumped on Jamaica early with intense pressure from the moment the game kicked off. Less than 20 minutes in, Emily Fox took advantage of her continued runs forward with a cutback cross for Sentnor to open the scoring.

Not even ten minutes later, Sentnor doubled the hosts lead with a quick reaction finish to complete her brace – a fourth USWNT goal in as many international starts for the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year.

After halftime, Biyendolo made an immediate impact off the bench, bundling in a rebound following a corner on the stroke of the hour mark. It was so nice, she had to do it twice before the end of the match, joining Sentnor with a first-time finish on Avery Patterson's cross in the 88th minute to complete her brace.

Seemingly nobody is as accustomed to such a role as Biyendolo, who passed the retired great Alex Morgan for the most goals as a substitute since her debut October 2016 with 11 such tallies.

Lynn with the smoooooth finish! #USWNT x @VW pic.twitter.com/8rRtR0hoj2

Debutant Kelly Abello will also be able to remember her international introduction fondly by keeping a clean sheet in a 90-minute performance at left back. In turn, goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce is yet to conceded a goal in her first three USWNT appearances.

The 4-0 scoreline continued the USWNT's streak of scoring four or more goals in all six matches they have played against Jamaica, keeping a clean sheet on every occasion.

The USWNT will return to action with two friendlies against the Republic of Ireland on June 26 in Colorado and June 29 in Cincinnati before closing out the window against Canada in the Nation's Capital on July 2.

Matchdays look a little different for Becky Sauerbrunn these days. 

The US Women's National Team legend retired from professional soccer following the end of the 2024 National Women's Soccer League season, but the St. Louis native hasn't gone far, signing a multi-year deal with TNT Sports.

Gone are the days of pre-wrap and shutting down the best attackers in the world. Instead, she's bringing her insights to the broadcast booth. 

“You're not quite sure what your post-playing is going to look like,” she says. “To have an offer to stick around the game, I feel very fortunate.”

Sauerbrunn now brings the same preparation and zeal that helped her become one of the world's best defenders during 219 appearances with the national team. The TNT appearances aren't her only fore into sports media. The former FC Kansas City stalwart also appears on The Women's Game podcast with Sam Mewis and Lynn Biyendolo, among a growing list of past and present NWSL stars. The appearances double as a chance to hang out with friends and an outlet to discuss relevant topics about an increasingly global sport. 

“I feel a real responsibility telling these stories because it's all very near and dear to my heart,” Sauerbrunn says. “I take it very seriously, but I'm having a lot of fun.”

On Tuesday, before the US Women's National Team faced Jamaica in a friendly at Energizer Park, Sauerbrunn was honored in a pre-match ceremony, where she was joined by family and friends. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher and Arsenal legend Thierry Henry paid tribute to Sauerbrunn, and US Soccer supplied Sauerbrunn-inspired bobbleheads for fans.

“I'm not used to having the spotlight on me like this,” said Sauerbrunn, “but it really is about celebrating the people who got me here.”

As the USWNT squad crashed the broadcast booth, after winning the match 4–0, Biyendolo said, “For us to be able to send her out like that, in a place that is so special for her, it's special for us.”

For decades, the U.S. produced iconic men's and women's goalkeepers, but the game has changed and the search is on

Goalkeeper is a funny position. It's lonely and, at times, thankless. Overlooked much of time - until suddenly needed - goalkeepers tend to live in their own little world under their own little spotlight.

It also happens to be the position that has become the signature of American soccer.

For decades, the U.S. has repeatedly produced elite-level shot-stoppers on both the men's and women's sides. Legends of the game have worn the gloves for both national teams. While the world has shifted and talent has ebbed and flowed during various USMNT and USWNT eras, the two squads have always been able to rely on having a defined, go-to, elite star in goal.

Not anymore.

Currently at very different points of their World Cup cycles - the men's team focused on 2026, the women's side on 2027 - both the USMNT and USWNT find themselves in unfamiliar territory when it comes to the defining position: uncertainty.

For the first time in decades, neither have clearly established starters in goal. What has always been a lonely position - a clear starter, a clear hierachy - has suddenly become a crowded one, with both teams lining up numerous candidates, waiting for reliable World Cup stars to emerge.

A competition is brewing for the USWNT and, with a two-year runway to the World Cup, it's one that will take time to complete. USWNT boss Emma Hayes will spend the next year or more assessing all of the options, looking under every rock to unearth the shot-stopper that could be the next great USWNT No. 1.

For the first time in the team's modern history, there's no seamless transition. The USWNT is experiencing goalkeeper growing pains.

There's a similar competition underway on the men's side but, just a year out from the World Cup, there's no luxury of time for Mauricio Pochettino and his staff. There are multiple goalkeepers vying to be the USMNT No. 1 and, heading into the 2025 Gold Cup, that spot seems about as uncertain as ever. This summer will be vital in determining next summer's starter in what - oh by the way - will be the most important tournament in USMNT history.

The two teams have been united by their ability to find and develop the best-of-the-best at the position. And now, for the first time, American soccer is at a crossroads when it comes to the next generation of goalkeepers.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

United States goalkeeper Zack Steffen is expected to be out of action for up to six weeks with a knee injury, a source told ESPN, meaning he is set to miss this summer's Gold Cup.

Colorado Rapids announced on Wednesday that Steffen has withdrawn from the USMNT's training camp. Steffen, 30, had already missed the Rapids three previous league matches with an oblique strain.

A source with knowledge of the knee injury said Steffen is expected to miss anywhere from four to six weeks. A Rapids spokesperson declined to elaborate on the injury, and would only confirm that Steffen was en route back to Denver, where he would be evaluated further.

The USMNT will play friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland on Friday and Tuesday, respectively, ahead of beginning its Gold Cup campaign against Trinidad and Tobago on June 15.

Mauricio Pochettino's side will face further Gold Cup group matches against Saudi Arabia (June 19) and Haiti (June 22).

Steffen had been in excellent form for the Rapids so far this season and the injury comes at an inopportune time for the former Manchester City goalkeeper.

After he was surprisingly left off the U.S. roster for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Steffen had worked his way back into the USMNT frame and looked sharp in a 2-0 win over Panama in January.

He was expected to challenge incumbent starter Matt Turner for playing time following a club season with Crystal Palace in which Turner played in only a handful of cup matches with zero league appearances.

Now that task will fall to New York City FC's Matt Freese and the Chicago Fire's Chris Brady.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

LAFC were the final qualifier for the FIFA 2025 Club World Cup, which takes place from June 14 to July 13 across the United States.

The Black & Gold are one of three MLS clubs participating in this year's expanded, 32-team tournament, alongside Inter Miami CF and Seattle Sounders FC.

LAFC slot into Group D, which also features English Premier League powerhouse Chelsea, Brazilian titans Flamengo and Tunisian side ES Tunis. The top two teams per group advance to the knockout phase.

Full schedule: FIFA Club World Cup

One of the most famous clubs in the world, Chelsea are no stranger to domestic and continental success, with five English Premier League titles, eight FA Cup victories and a pair of UEFA Champions League titles. They also previously won the FIFA Club World Cup in 2021.

Coached by Enzo Maresca, the Blues enter the Club World Cup after a top-four finish in the English Premier League, which clinched a coveted UEFA Champions League spot. They're led by England international Cole Palmer, one of the top young players in the world, as well as Senegalese striker Nicolas Jackson and Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernández.

On the London club's books are MLS alums Gaga Slonina (Chicago Fire FC), Caleb Wiley (Atlanta United) and Djordje Petrovic (New England Revolution)

Espérance Sportive de Tunis are one of the most successful clubs in Africa and are making their fourth appearance at the FIFA Club World Cup. They've won 34 league titles, lifted the Tunisian Cup 15 times and four times captured the CAF Champions League crown.

ES Tunis finished atop the Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle table and are led by Brazilian midfielder Yan Sasse, Algerian international Youcef Belaïli, the centerback tandem of Mohamed Amine Tougai and Yassine Meriah, as well as Tunisian international Houssem Tka.

ES Tunis have a pair of FIFA Club World Cup wins under their belt, beating Chivas Guadalajara on penalties in the fifth-place match in 2018 and defeating Al-Sadd, 6-2, in the fifth-place match in 2019.

Flamengo are one of the country's most successful clubs with seven Brazilian Série A titles, five Copa do Brasil crowns, three Copa Libertadores among their championships, including a 1-0 win over fellow Brazilian side Athletico Paranaense in 2022, which booked their spot in the FIFA Club World Cup.

The storied Brazilian club are led by Filipe Luís, a former club legend and Brazilian international left back, and currently sit atop the Brasileirão table through 11 matchdays. They play their home matches at the famed Maracanã.

A club known for developing some of Brazil's top players through their academy, Flamengo's roster includes current Brazilian internationals Gerson and Danilo, while Jorginho reportedly could join the team from Arsenal ahead of the Club World Cup.

One of Major League Soccer's most successful clubs, LAFC reached the Club World Cup after defeating Club América in a play-in match following Club León's disqualification due to FIFA's multi-club ownership rules.

Steve Cherundolo's side are off to yet another strong start in MLS this season and will look to add to a trophy case which includes two Supporters' Shields twice, one MLS Cup and a US Open Cup. They've also twice reached the Concacaf Champions Cup final.

On a club that boasts World Cup winners Olivier Giroud and Hugo Lloris, Denis Bouanga is the unquestioned star. The Gabon international is coming off back-to-back 20-goal campaigns and scored the extra-time winner against América to book LAFC's ticket. They also feature rising star David Martínez in the midfield and former US international Aaron Long on defense.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

Jack Grealish joined Manchester City for a then-British record fee of £100m in 2021

Jack Grealish is expected to be left out of the Manchester City squad for the Fifa Club World Cup.

The 29-year-old's future at Etihad Stadium is unclear heading into the summer transfer window amid a growing sense he would benefit from a move before next season.

There is likely to be interest from clubs across Europe in Grealish, who may be attracted to a fresh start at a top club who could provide him with regular football.

It remains to be seen whether his reported £300,000-per-week wages will prove prohibitive towards any potential deal, whether on loan or permanent.

City have agreed a 55m euros (£46.3m) deal with AC Milan for Netherlands midfielder Tijjani Reijnders, while they are also in talks to sign Lyon forward Rayan Cherki and Wolves left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri.

Grealish, according to sources, is keeping an open mind over his future, with the extended 32-team Club World Cup running from 14 June to 13 July in the United States.

The former Aston Villa star joined City in 2021 for a then-British record fee of £100m and was a key part of Pep Guardiola's Treble-winning side in 2022-23.

In total, Grealish has won three Premier League titles with the club, as well as an FA Cup, Champions League and the Club World Cup in its previous guise.

However, he has struggled for regular playing time over the past two seasons and started just seven league games in 2024-25.

""Of course, Jack has to play,"" Guardiola said in May. ""He's an unbelievable player that has to play football every three days.

""It didn't happen this season and last season either. He needs to do it - with us or another place.

""It's a question for Jack, his agent, and the club. If he stays it will be fine and he fought like he fought from day one to make a contribution.""

A lack of football has also seen Grealish lose his place in the England squad. He wasn't picked for Euro 2024 and with a year until the 2026 World Cup, he is likely to need more first-team football to have a chance of forcing his way into Thomas Tuchel's plans.

Jack Grealish is expected to be omitted from the Manchester City squad for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup as he moves closer to a summer exit. 

The 29-year-old endured another frustrating campaign in 2024–25 and made just 20 Premier League appearances for the second successive season. He started only 16 of the 32 matches he featured in across all competitions, providing eight goal contributions for the struggling Cityzens. 

Such an underwhelming term has fueled speculation regarding his future and the fire was stoked further by Pep Guardiola's decision to leave him out of the squad for Man City's final Premier League game of the season against Fulham. 

That snubbing doesn't appear to be a one-off, with The Athletic reporting that Grealish is “likely” to be omitted from Man City's traveling squad for the upcoming Club World Cup which begins in mid-June. 

Grealish's exclusion could be the final nail in the coffin for the England international, who has managed just 17 goals in 157 appearances since his £100 million ($137.5 million) move from Aston Villa back in 2021. 

There is a growing expectation that his time at the Etihad Stadium has come to an end as Man City look to usher in a new era. There is unlikely to be a place for the ageing forward in Guardiola's squad moving into 2025–26. 

While the Cityzens are unlikely to recoup a significant chunk of the eye-watering fee splashed on Grealish, there will undoubtedly be an array of prospective buyers. In the Premier League alone, Newcastle United, former side Villa and, somewhat surprisingly, Arsenal have all been linked. 

There have been reports suggesting interest from Italian sides Inter Milan and Napoli, too, while there are likely to be suitors further afield—potentially in Saudi Arabia and the United States.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Chelsea outcasts have no future at club and will be left out of Club World Cup squad","https://talksport.com/football/3262198/chelsea-raheem-sterling-transfer-news-club-world-cup/","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 14:59:55 GMT","





Raheem Sterling is not expected to be part of Chelsea's Club World Cup squad with Arsenal confirming he will return to Stamford Bridge.

talkSPORT understands the 30-year-old, who spent the 2024/25 season on loan at the Emirates, is set for talks over his future this month with a departure anticipated.

Chelsea are likely to leave several names behind from their squad for the tournament that starts later this month in the USA, even though they can select 35 players.

Meanwhile, Axel Disasi could also be given June to find a new club following his loan spell at Aston Villa.

Ben Chilwell, Armando Broja and Alfie Gilchrist are three other names up for sale this summer after they were loaned out to Crystal Palace, Everton and Sheffield United respectively.

However, suggestions Noni Madueke could be sold are downplayed by Chelsea insiders. 

The England international remains valued by Enzo Maresca and only an offer too strong to turn down might make Chelsea to reconsider.

Newcastle held historical interest in Madueke, but it's believed they are not planning on rekindling interest, even if they miss out on Manchester United target Bryan Mbeumo.

Chelsea also want to resolve their goalkeeper situation before the Club World Cup.

The long-standing plan was to rank Robert Sanchez, Djordje Petrovic, Filip Jorgensen and the highly-rated Mike Penders during the Club World Cup and over the summer rather than necessarily bring in any new keeper.

Yet the club view Mike Maignan as an opportunistic target given Milan's lack of European football next season and the fact the 29-year-old only has one year left on his current deal.

Maignan is open to the move and Milan want at least £20million, but Chelsea are not prepared to go quite that high.

Should a move not materialise, Chelsea are content with the goalkeepers they have and will only look at elite options who can be secured at value.

The bigger priority is still to find a right-footed left winger.

Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens, Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho and Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams are three options considered.

Contact has already been made with Dortmund over Gittens.

Williams, meanwhile, has an appealing £50m release clause, but the overall cost of any deal is high given his wage and the agent fees involved, and the Spain international is also engaged in early-stage talks to renew at Athletic Bilbao.

This could put pressure on suitors to move fast since any new contract would likely have a new and higher release clause.

Chelsea will also be taking some new faces to America for the Club World Cup.

The club's preference is to have soon-to-be-announced striker Liam Delap in their squad, even though the 22-year-old was anticipating playing in the Under-21 Euros with England instead.

There is still ongoing dialogue as to the best approach, but Chelsea can chose to block Delap's inclusion in this summer's tournament in Slovakia if they wish as club football would take precedence.

Andrey Santos will also be part of Chelsea's Club World Cup squad following an impressive loan at Strasbourg in which he scored ten goals.

He is not considered for sale this summer despite genuine Bayern Munich interest.

Kendry Paez will also be part of the travelling party.

The 18-year-old midfielder joins from Independiente del Valle for £15m in a deal pre-agreed back in June 2023.

Paez has already visited Cobham to train and spent time with Strasbourg.

He is yet to be informed he is being loaned to Strasbourg next season, but talkSPORT understands this is a realistic possibility.

Mathis Amogou is also expected to be loaned to Chelsea's sister club next campaign, but could also play at the Club World Cup first.

Chelsea aren't technically done with 2024–25 just yet due to their participation in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

Enzo Maresca's side concluded their Premier League campaign with an important win at Nottingham Forest on the final day, which secured Champions League football for next season. They followed that up with a victory in the UEFA Conference League final over Real Betis, and have already made progress in the transfer market to ensure Maresca's project continues to ascend. 

The Blues are one of the clubs synonymous with glory in contemporary times, but it's been a little while since Chelsea were competing for the most prestigious honours. The reign of BlueCo, who took control of the club in 2022, has been tumultuous.

So, how are they competing at the 2025 Club World Cup? Here's an explanation. 

The expanded an reformatted Club World Cup gets underway following the conclusion of the June international break, with the first game of the tournament scheduled for June 14, 2025, as Lionel Messi's Inter Miami face Egyptian giants Al Ahly. 

Chelsea don't have to wait too long to get their campaign underway after the tournament opener, with their first group game against Los Angeles FC kicking off less than 48 hours later on June 16. 

Chelsea are one of 12 UEFA members to qualify for the tournament but one of only two Premier League teams flying out to the United States. 

While the Blues haven't won a league title since Antonio Conte dazzled the English top flight with his back three in 2016–17, they were one of the first teams to secure their place in the expanded competition by winning the Champions League under Thomas Tuchel in 2020–21. 

The German's side were underdogs entering that 2021 final against Manchester City, but they masterfully managed Pep Guardiola's titans, the Premier League champions that season, and claimed a 1–0 victory thanks to Kai Havertz's singular goal before half-time. 

With the Club World Cup now taking place every four years, UEFA‘s previous four Champions League winners, from 2021 to 2024, automatically qualified for the tournament. Chelsea, as a result of their aforementioned success, secured their spot for the first 32-team iteration.

Chelsea were drawn into Group D, and their final opponent of the group stage has only recently been confirmed due to Club León's expulsion. Los Angeles FC defeated Club América in a playoff to decide the Mexican side's late replacement, and the Blues will face the 2022 MLS Cup champions first. 

As a result, they'll take on former Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud in Atlanta on June 16. 

There's more familiarity with their second Group D opponent, as they face a Flamengo side coached by former left-back Filipe Luís. The Brazilian's time in west London was brief and forgettable, but Flamengo have also added one of Tuchel's starters from their 2021 Champions League final success. Jorginho has joined the 2022 Copa Libertadores winners on a free transfer from Arsenal. 

Their group-stage concludes on June 24 against a less familiar foe in Tunisian giants Espérance de Tunis. They're one of the most dominant teams in African football, having claimed four CAF Champions League crowns to complement their record 34 domestic league titles.

Joint complaint to UN agency about ‘rights violations'

Development starting to scale up before 2034 World Cup

Trade unions from 36 countries have filed a complaint with the International Labour Organisation over the treatment of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia.

The complaint calls for a “commission of inquiry” into labour rights in the country, one of the most powerful tools available to the ILO, a United Nations agency. The demand comes amid growing concern that not enough is being done to improve the conditions of workers as development begins to scale up before the Fifa World Cup, due to take place in the Gulf state in 2034.

Luc Triangle, the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, said the “scale and severity” of the issues in Saudi Arabia demanded the strongest response. “This is a call for immediate action towards genuine, inclusive and collaborative reform,” he said. “We cannot tolerate another death of a migrant worker in Saudi Arabia. We cannot remain silent while migrant workers, especially construction and domestic workers continue to face fundamental rights violations. This has to stop now.”

The news comes on the day the ILO announced a new cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia, signed on the sidelines of its key annual gathering, the International Labour Conference, held in Geneva this week. Under the initial two-year agreement Saudi Arabia is expected to begin to align its laws with international labour standards.

Human rights groups and trade unions have repeatedly warned that the World Cup, and other major projects, could be tarnished by abusive conditions endured by migrant workers in constructing the necessary infrastructure. These concerns include extortionate recruitment fees, non-payment of wages, false contracts, passport confiscation and exposure to extreme heat. Thousands of workers could be likely to die as construction ramps up, the rights group FairSquare claimed last month.

The number of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia has surged in recent years to more than 13 million, driven in part by a massive construction boom linked to the World Cup and so-called giga-projects.

The Guardian understands that Saudi Arabia's agreement with the ILO includes proposals for new measures to support fair recruitment and make it easier for workers to change jobs, the introduction of a minimum wage and the inclusion of migrant workers on workers' representative committees. Trade unions remain prohibited in the country.

The agreement also sets out commitments to improve the compensation system for workers who are injured or killed. In the longer term, it promises to strengthen protections for domestic workers, who have been excluded from key provisions of the labour law.

The planned reforms have failed to satisfy trade union delegates. Trade unions from the UK, Japan, Canada, Australia and 13 African countries including Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal pushed through the complaint, despite fierce opposition from the Saudis.

The complaint, which the Guardian has seen, lists dozens of cases of alleged human trafficking, forced labour, wage theft and physical and sexual abuse of migrant workers. “Africans go to Saudi Arabia looking for life but come back in coffins,” said Omar Osman, the general secretary of the federation of Somali trade unions and one of the signatories.

The complaint follows submissions made this year by the Building and Woodworkers International to the ILO over migrant workers in Saudi Arabia, and African trade unions raised with Fifa concerns over the treatment of workers.

Fifa says the human rights policy submitted as part of Saudi Arabia's bid for the World Cup commits the country to embedding ILO standards as part of the 2034 process. In a letter to Human Rights Watch in April, the secretary general of Fifa, Mattias Grafström, wrote that “the work to implement the measures outlined in the bid strategy has started and is a priority for Fifa”.

Host nation Germany face Portugal with Ronaldo and Fernandes set to start in first semifinal of UEFA Nations League.

Who: Germany vs Portugal
What: UEFA Nations League semifinal
When: Wednesday
Where: Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany

How to follow our coverage: We'll have all the build-up from 6pm (16:00 GMT) on Al Jazeera Sport.

Hosts Germany and Portugal, the winners of the 2019 inaugural edition, face off in the first of the UEFA Nations League semifinals.

Holders Spain and France play in the other tie on Thursday with their match being played in Stuttgart.

Al Jazeera Sport looks at the first of the games and where the tournament itself ranks:

The competition was formed to give more meaning to international matches played outside the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championships.

Instead of a flow of international friendlies, which had become devalued by players and fans alike, nations now compete in a structured format that ends in a country being crowned Nations League champions.

The teams that finish in the top two of their World Cup qualifying groups in Europe will automatically progress to the FIFA World Cup.

The four highest placed teams from the Nations League that did not finish in the top two of their World Cup qualifying groups are then given an extra shot at reaching the global game's showpiece event.

It is an added incentive to all teams as a back-up plan should their official World Cup qualifying campaign fall flat.

There are four groups in League A of the Nations League, four in League B and four in League C.

The top two teams from each of the League A groups qualify for the knockout stages of the competition, which begins at the quarterfinals stage. Leagues B and C try to gain promotion to League A to incentivise all teams in their international match-ups and to offer the chance of reaching the final and lifting the trophy to all.

Germany, who finished top of Group 3 in League A, beat Italy 5-4 in their last-eight encounter over two legs.

Portugal, who finished top of Group 1, beat Denmark 5-3 on aggregate in their quarterfinal.

Both sides were unbeaten in the six-match group stage, which concluded in November.

Cristiano Ronaldo is to start the semifinal for Portugal despite the mystery surrounding his immediate club future – which looks likely to result in an appearance at FIFA's Club World Cup this month.

The former Manchester United and Real Madrid star posted on social media on the final day of the Saudi Pro League that his time with Saudi Arabian top-flight team Al Nassr had come to an end.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino had already revealed that talks were under way for a loan for Ronaldo to play for one of the teams competing at the competition being staged in the United States.

A star performance by the 40-year-old in the semifinal and potential final of the Nations League would significantly up the stakes for his next move – and his potential late arrival as a headline act at the Club World Cup.

Portugal beat the Netherlands 1-0 in the 2019 final.

The match itself was played on home soil for the Portuguese at Porto's Estadio do Dragao, where Goncalo Guedes scored the only goal of the game in the 60th minute.

Julian Nagelsmann, Germany coach: “The goal is to win the Nations League title. We want to perform, deliver results and win titles, and for us as a group, it's very important. Spain proved how important this tournament can be when they won it before triumphing at Euro 2024. When I look at the faces of our players, I see motivation and excitement. I'm looking forward to the atmosphere in the stadium.”

Roberto Martinez, Portugal coach: “There aren't many opportunities in international football to win trophies, and there is nothing better than doing so. The important thing is that we are here, and the final four is where we have to be. This team have shown significant resilience over these two and a half years, and facing teams like Germany, followed by maybe Spain or France, are perfect challenges to continue preparing the team for the World Cup.”

This will be the 12th time that the two nations have met. Germany has won on seven occasions, and Portugal has recorded just one win.

The Germans have won the last five encounters, which had all been at either FIFA World Cups or UEFA European Championships.

Portugal's last win came in the group stage of Euro 2000 with Sergio Conceicao scoring all the goals in a 3-0 victory against the then-holders, who were eliminated.

The Germans have since exacted a heavy revenge on the Portuguese, including a 4-2 group stage win in their last encounter in 2021 at the delayed Euro 2020 championships.

Out: Amiri, Bisseck, Havertz, Henrichs, Kleindienst, Musiala, Rudiger, Schlotterbeck, Stiller

Germany have a string of injuries but do welcome back long-term absentee Marc-Andre ter Stegen in goal.

Who replaces Bayern Munich's Jamal Musiala in midfield will be one of the key questions, but the absences of Real Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger and Arsenal forward Kai Harvertz will also be heavily felt.

Out: Cancelo

Portugal are boosted by an almost fully fit squad with only Al Hilal defender Joao Cancelo leaving a void to be filled.

Possible Germany XI: ter Stegen; Kimmich, Tah, Koch, Raum; Goretzka, Gross; Adeyemi, Wirtz, Sane; Fullkrug

Possible Portugal XI: Costa; Dalot, Dias, Goncalo Inacio, Nuno Mendes; Vitinha, Fernandes, Neves; Silva, Ronaldo, Leao

The Allianz Arena, which is also hosting the first semifinal, will also stage the final on Sunday.

LAFC were the final qualifier for the FIFA 2025 Club World Cup, which takes place from June 14 to July 13 across the United States.

The Black & Gold are one of three MLS clubs participating in this year's expanded, 32-team tournament, alongside Inter Miami CF and Seattle Sounders FC.

LAFC slot into Group D, which also features English Premier League powerhouse Chelsea, Brazilian titans Flamengo and Tunisian side ES Tunis. The top two teams per group advance to the knockout phase.

Full schedule: FIFA Club World Cup

One of the most famous clubs in the world, Chelsea are no stranger to domestic and continental success, with five English Premier League titles, eight FA Cup victories and a pair of UEFA Champions League titles. They also previously won the FIFA Club World Cup in 2021.

Coached by Enzo Maresca, the Blues enter the Club World Cup after a top-four finish in the English Premier League, which clinched a coveted UEFA Champions League spot. They're led by England international Cole Palmer, one of the top young players in the world, as well as Senegalese striker Nicolas Jackson and Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernández.

On the London club's books are MLS alums Gaga Slonina (Chicago Fire FC), Caleb Wiley (Atlanta United) and Djordje Petrovic (New England Revolution)

Espérance Sportive de Tunis are one of the most successful clubs in Africa and are making their fourth appearance at the FIFA Club World Cup. They've won 34 league titles, lifted the Tunisian Cup 15 times and four times captured the CAF Champions League crown.

ES Tunis finished atop the Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle table and are led by Brazilian midfielder Yan Sasse, Algerian international Youcef Belaïli, the centerback tandem of Mohamed Amine Tougai and Yassine Meriah, as well as Tunisian international Houssem Tka.

ES Tunis have a pair of FIFA Club World Cup wins under their belt, beating Chivas Guadalajara on penalties in the fifth-place match in 2018 and defeating Al-Sadd, 6-2, in the fifth-place match in 2019.

Flamengo are one of the country's most successful clubs with seven Brazilian Série A titles, five Copa do Brasil crowns, three Copa Libertadores among their championships, including a 1-0 win over fellow Brazilian side Athletico Paranaense in 2022, which booked their spot in the FIFA Club World Cup.

The storied Brazilian club are led by Filipe Luís, a former club legend and Brazilian international left back, and currently sit atop the Brasileirão table through 11 matchdays. They play their home matches at the famed Maracanã.

A club known for developing some of Brazil's top players through their academy, Flamengo's roster includes current Brazilian internationals Gerson and Danilo, while Jorginho reportedly could join the team from Arsenal ahead of the Club World Cup.

One of Major League Soccer's most successful clubs, LAFC reached the Club World Cup after defeating Club América in a play-in match following Club León's disqualification due to FIFA's multi-club ownership rules.

Steve Cherundolo's side are off to yet another strong start in MLS this season and will look to add to a trophy case which includes two Supporters' Shields twice, one MLS Cup and a US Open Cup. They've also twice reached the Concacaf Champions Cup final.

On a club that boasts World Cup winners Olivier Giroud and Hugo Lloris, Denis Bouanga is the unquestioned star. The Gabon international is coming off back-to-back 20-goal campaigns and scored the extra-time winner against América to book LAFC's ticket. They also feature rising star David Martínez in the midfield and former US international Aaron Long on defense.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

On Wednesday morning, the Paris rain threatened to upset a scheduled practice for Juan Carlos Ferrero and Carlos Alcaraz. Before they eventually made their way to Court 2 at Roland Garros to continue preparations for the semi-final clash against Lorenzo Musetti, the 22-year-old's coach sat down with ATPTour.com to discuss how the defending champion is beginning to find ways to be prepared for anything.

“Carlos has always had the level, the problem is that it's very hard to produce it in every match,” explained the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “We know that when he plays positively, bravely, when he plays without fear, then he is a player with a potential that is still yet to be realised. But you also have to see the other side of it: pressure, tension, fear, difficulties, opponents, types of players, a tournament you want to win more than others, the importance we all put on it... all these things also come into play.”

Ferrero was talking about Alcaraz's flawless performance in his win over Tommy Paul. To reach the semi-finals, the World No. 2 brushed aside the American with a dazzling display of tennis. It was almost a perfect match.

“I don't think you can call it perfect because nobody is perfect, but it's true that he's getting close to a level that is very rare on Tour,” said Ferrero. “I think he knows that he has to work on his consistency. I've told him so many times and that's what we're doing. The problem is that when you hit the ball so hard it's difficult to be consistent sometimes. 

“Yesterday he went at practically everything and everything went in, but some days there will be more mistakes and it becomes 30 unforced errors. Then he won't be so brilliant, but the intention is there.”

With his charge having just turned 22, Ferrero is in no doubt that it is time for Alcaraz to make key decisions about his game, highlighting the importance of stepping up to the plate.

“It's a question of him also choosing how he wants to play,” explained the Murcia native's coach. “You can step out in the semi-finals with the tension of having to win or really try and go out and play every point and look for his A-game... so that it's the consequence of being able to win and playing well. I think Carlos is starting to focus more on himself and not on others, and really finding his maximum level.

“He has to trust that when he fights at 100 per cent, with his maximum intensity, he can make others struggle. That's the way we're heading, getting him to really focus on himself, on doing his own things well. The consequence will be that exceptionally high level he has.”



On top of this, progressing mentally — based on the work he has been carrying out for some time — is currently key for Alcaraz.

“The mental side is something we've tried to work on with him for a long time,” explained Ferrero. “Routines, ways of behaving on court, how to pick himself up when he's in trouble, pre-match chats, chats the day before, preparations for matches... All these kinds of situations that arise with a player, we've been working on them for some time.

“It's something that we do so that he can feel confident,” he added. “If he needs to talk about something, if he needs to talk about the match or anything else, he knows that we're there and we always try to do so in the same way.”

Djokovic had cruised into the quarter-finals but Zverev will be his toughest test of the tournament so far

Novak Djokovic battles Alexander Zverev for a place in the French Open semi-finals and a date with World No 1 Jannik Sinner at Roland Garros. 

At 38, Djokovic has safely made it through to a record 19th French Open quarter-final but the 24-time grand slam champion will be aiming for more as he targets a fourth title at Roland Garros. The Serbian is yet to drop a set during the tournament and recorded his 100th career win at the French Open by beating Cameron Norrie on Monday. 

Zverev reached last year's French Open final and was two sets up on Carlos Alcaraz before the Spaniard mounted a comeback. The German third seed is a dangerous opponent on the clay and defeated Djokovic in their last meeting when the Serbian retired injured from the Australian Open semi-final having lost the first set. 

Earlier, Sinner reached his second consecutive French Open semi-final after defeating Alexander Bublik in straight sets. On a dramatic day in the women's singles, home wildcard Lois Boisson stunned sixth seed Mirra Andreeva to continue her remarkable grand slam breakthrough and set up a semi-final meeting with Coco Gauff. 

Follow live scores and updates from the French Open below

Zverev comes through a tough game by finding the forehand winner past Djokovic. Over to the Serbian to level this up... 

Zverev looks frustrated with himself as a forehand goes long. Djokovic makes no mistake with the big serve down the T. He holds and moves a game away from the second yet. 

Shot of the match! From Djokovic! He bends low behind the baseline while on the run, flipping the backhand for a crosscourt winner. 

Djokovic goes on the assault, hitting a series of forehand attacks into Zverev's forehand corner, and it brings up break point. 

Zverev saves with the clever drop shot. Deuce. And the German saves a couple of points later behind big serving. Djokovic remains a break ahead. 

Zverev gets to deuce on the Djokovic serve by taking an aggressive approach and swatting away the smash. 

Zverev won't allow Djokovic the easy hold, winning a couple of long exchanges, then Djokovic comes into the net but finds the tap with the volley! 

Break point to Zverev, Djokovic resets his serving motion and finds his biggest serve out wide of the match so far to save. 

Ace from Djokovic out wide. He holds a nine-minute game to stay ahead. 

The errors are mounting from Zverev - he pushes a backhand long then, on 15-30, he does the same with the forehand as he looked for the winner. 

Two break points - the best chance Djokovic has had so far: Zverev saves one with the first serve, but the backhand goes long from Zverev! 

Three unforced errors in the game at least, and Djokovic breaks to lead in the second set. 

Djokovic applauds as Zverev leans to his left and redirects a drive volley from Djokovic back up the line for a winner! 

15-30 and a chance for Zverev. The German goes big on the forehand crosscourt, but pushes wide. Another unforced error on the forehand from Zverev. 

40-30. Djokovic moves in and lands a lovely soft drop volley. Solid hold from being in a spot of bother. 

Zverev belted a smash long of the baseline on the opening point, but recovers behind good serving to earn the hold. Impressive recovery. 

Opening hold for Djokovic. A couple of serves down the middle slide past Zverev to set up game point. He pulls Zverev close to the net with the angled drop shot and the German pushes long. 

Zverev is winning 93 per cent of his first-serve points and Djokovic has more unforced errors than the German so far. 

Still, it felt Djokovic's level was getting better throughout the set. 

Zverev catches Djokovic wrong-footed to get to 30-0, with Djokovic unable to do anything about the power at the net. Djokovic floats a return long and Zverev snaps up set point with an ace to take the opener! 

That opening break was decisive. Djokovic was caught cold and there was just one more break point opportunity, with Zverev saving at 4-3.

Emma Raducanu made tennis history when she won the 2021 US Open as a qualifier. Aged 18 and playing her fourth professional tournament, the Brit stormed through the draw without dropping a set to be crowned a Grand Slam champion.

But Chris Evert has issued a reminder that Raducanu had a very different path to the final than that of her opponent, Leylah Fernandez, who beat four top-20 seeds en route to the championship match before running out of gas.

Although Raducanu completed an unprecedented achievement, the highest-ranked player she faced on her run was 11th seed Belinda Bencic, and Evert has reflected on the 22-year-old's campaign.

“You have to remember a lot of people [top players] lost when she won that US Open and the player Emma beat in the final, Leylah Fernandez, had nothing left,” the 18-time Grand Slam champion told Tennis365.

“Leylah beat three players in the top five. Emma didn't beat anyone in the top ten. I remember commenting on the match and you could see that.

“If Leylah had won, her life may have changed forever, but Emma is the one who had to live through that experience. We will never see a qualifier come through and do what she did again, but it was tough for her after that.”

Raducanu was ranked at No. 150 when she won the US Open and immediately broke into the world's top 25.

Less than a year later, she reached a career-high ranking of No. 10 and Evert believes she could still get back there.

She added: “I think she can get top 10 again. If there is a solid commitment from her, I think top 10 can happen again.”

Raducanu is currently at No. 41 in the world. She dropped out of the top 300 after ending her 2023 season early to have three surgeries and has since been steadily climbing back up the ranks, and will return to the top 40 after the French Open.

After a promising clay swing, which ended with a disappointing second-round thrashing at the hands of Iga Swiatek in Paris, Raducanu will be hoping to build more momentum on the grass.

The 22-year-old is set to play in Queen's, Berlin and Eastbourne before Wimbledon.

“I do feel comfortable obviously being at home and having that environment around me. Last year I had a great season, and I'm looking forward to kind of being in the same environment, being at home, having the home support,” she said after her French Open loss.

France's Lois Boisson celebrates as she won the quarterfinal match of the French Tennis Open against Russia's Mirra Andreeva at the Roland-Garros stadium in Paris, Wednesday, June 4, 2025.

PARIS (AP) — Coco Gauff kept double-faulting. She kept missing plenty of other strokes. She kept losing games in bunches. And all the while, she would let out a sigh or bow her head or look generally uncomfortable.

What the 21-year-old Gauff never did Wednesday during a tense and topsy-turvy French Open quarterfinal against another American woman with a Grand Slam title, Madison Keys, was give up hope or go away. And, in a contest filled with plenty of mistakes, it was Gauff who emerged to grab eight of the last nine games for a 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-1 victory over Keys and a third trip to the semifinals at Roland-Garros.

“I have had that in me from a young age,"" said the No. 2-seeded Gauff, who won the 2023 U.S. Open as a teenager and was the French Open runner-up the year before. “When times become more difficult, knowing that I can dig deep in those tough moments.”

Where did that come from?

“Just a love to win, the will to win. It's not something that's taught or anything. It's just I have always had that in me, and not just in tennis but in everything. I'm a very competitive person,” she said. “My philosophy is if I can just leave it all out there, then the loss will hurt a lot less than regrets of maybe not giving it your all.”

Gauff needed to overcame 10 double-faults — three in the opening tiebreaker alone — and the first set she's dropped in the tournament, as well as deal with the big-hitting Keys, the No. 7 seed, who entered with an 11-match Grand Slam winning streak after her title at the Australian Open in January.

They combined for 101 unforced errors and just 40 winners across more than two hours under a closed roof at Court Philippe-Chatrier on a drizzly, chilly day.

Nearly half of the games — 14 of 29 — featured breaks of serve. But from 4-all in the second set, Gauff held four times in a row while pulling away. She made two unforced errors in the last set, including just one double-fault.

After falling behind 4-1 at the start, and twice being a single point from trailing 5-1, Gauff switched to a racket with a different tension in the strings to see if that would help.

“Maybe it did, and maybe it didn't. I'd like to think that it helped a little bit,"" she said. ""Sometimes that stuff could just be mental. Maybe you're thinking, 'Oh, I changed my racket, I'm going to play better, and you start doing it. I don't know.”

She'll play Thursday for a berth in another major final, facing 361st-ranked French wild-card entry Loïs Boisson, who is on one of the most stunning runs in tennis history. Boisson beat No. 6 Mirra Andreeva 7-6 (6), 6-3 in the quarterfinals to follow up her upset of No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the fourth round.

Boisson, 22, is the first woman to reach the semifinals in her Grand Slam debut since 1989, when Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati both did it at the French Open. A crowd that offered support to Gauff against Keys via shouts of “Allez, Coco!” was raucous as can be behind Boisson, rattling the 18-year-old Andreeva.

The other women's semifinal is quite a matchup: three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek vs. No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka. They advanced with quarterfinal victories Tuesday.

It was Swiatek who stopped Gauff at Roland-Garros in the semifinals last year and in the final three years ago.

“I have a lot more work left to do,” said Gauff, who raised her arms overhead then spread them wide apart after the last point against Keys, “but I'm going to savor this one today.”

Repeatedly, Gauff scrambled this way or that to get her racket on a shot from Keys and send it back, often leading to a miss.

“The court being a little bit slower, coupled with the fact that she covers the court so well, just put a little bit of pressure on me to go a little bit more for my shots and maybe press a little bit too much, too soon,” said Keys, who occasionally admonished herself with a slap on her right leg.

“There were a lot of points where I felt like, playing someone else,"" Keys said, “I would have won the point.”

Madison Keys won the first Grand Slam title of her career at the Australian Open earlier this year.

Keys beat Aryna Sabalenka to win the Australian Open back in January, and also had to save a match point in her semi-final against Iga Swiatek.

This is something that the American had been expected to achieve from a young age, with Keys looking to win more Grand Slams now.

Her bid to achieve that at the French Open has now come to an end, with Keys being beaten by Coco Gauff in the quarter-finals.

While winning the Australian Open is still the biggest achievement of Keys' career so far, 18-time Grand Slam champion Chris Evert believes it has also come with its downsides.

Keys is someone whom Evert knows well, having trained at her academy from 10 years of age.

During her quarter-final match against Gauff, seven-time French Open champion Evert was on commentary for TNT Sports and spoke about how Keys' profile has changed in America.

While this may be seen as a positive thing for some players, Evert suggested that Keys would not be enjoying this newfound attention.

“She's definitely being more recognised, I've already seen two new advertisements on American TV so she's getting a few more endorsements and I know tournaments want her to play,” said Evert. 

“She's a very, very private person and she's, she's just not outgoing and she's like ‘Woah'. This attention I don't think is going to sit that well with her, because she values her privacy especially since getting married.”

Evert continued, “Very humble, I've known her since she was 10-years-old, she trained at my tennis academy down in Florida for about six years, so we pretty much started her into the game and she went on as she turned pro. 

“She worked with the USTA, she worked with Lindsay Davenport, she's had a lot of good coaches since then. But, it's taken a while for her to mature into the competitor with a positive mindset as we see now.”

After her three set defeat to Gauff in the French Open quarter-finals, Keys will now switch her attention to the grass court season.

Despite winning her only Grand Slam title on hard courts, Keys has claimed grass is her favourite surface.

Keys' grass court season ended in heartbreak last year, as she was forced to retire at Wimbledon with a hamstring injury.

A sad ending to an incredible match 💔Madison Keys is forced to retire due to injury against Paolini on No.1 Court 😢#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/p1M80WYLgb

The world number eight will be hoping for a different outcome this year, and is scheduled to play her first grass court tournament at Queen's Club.

Keys will be the third seed at the returning WTA tournament beginning on Monday, June 9, before heading to the German capital of Berlin ahead of Wimbledon.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Coco Gauff showed tremendous determination to come back from a set down to beat her fellow American Madison Keys and reach the French Open semifinals on Wednesday.

Gauff, 21, lost the opening set at Roland Garros in a nervy tiebreaker to Keys but bounced back emphatically to eventually win 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-1, ending Keys' 11-match grand slam win streak.

Gauff will now face No. 6 seed Mirra Andreeva or world No. 361 and crowd favorite Lois Boisson in the last four.

“I changed something at 4-1 in that first set and after that I had chances to win the set,” Gauff said on court afterwards. “Madison was playing well, so I was just trying to get the ball deep and be aggressive, but it's tough because she was hitting the ball so fast and so low. I was just trying to fight for every point.

“She is obviously a very great player and her forehand is probably one of the best, if not the best, on tour. I was just trying my best to get it on the other side of the court, but she has a great inside-out and inside-in forehand.

“Honestly, I knew that I just had to be able to run today. As soon as the ball came short, I knew I had to punish her for it.”

Gauff, a losing finalist at the French Open three years ago, needed to show all her mettle to overcome the 2025 Australian Open champion.

It was Keys who raced into an early lead in the first set and, although Gauff was able to fight back, the 30-year-old found the necessary edge to take an early lead with her opponent missing a set point.

But Gauff looked much more assured in the second set, breaking Keys twice to put herself in front. But this time, it was Keys who came back, leveling the scores in the second set before Gauff broke once more and held serve to tie it at 1-1.

And in the deciding set, Gauff had finally found her stride, looking much more comfortable as she romped to a comfortable 6-1 set victory to take the match.

It was far from Gauff's most complete performance at Roland Garros – where she won the French Open doubles title last year – but she won't care as it books her spot in the semifinals.

“It means a lot, especially after getting through this tough match today,” the No. 2 seed said. “It wasn't an easy match and I'm very happy to get through it.

“I'm just very excited to be back in the semifinals here again. I have a lot more work to do, but I'm going to savor this one today. I'll be ready for tomorrow's match.”

The number of layoffs are described as being in the double digits, but well less than 100.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Warner Bros. Discovery is undergoing a new round of layoffs. The job cuts, which are numbered in the double digits but described to The Hollywood Reporter as being well under 100, come across the company's linear cable groups.


	No particular channel was affected more than others, a person with knowledge of the layoffs said, and no specific function was targeted.




	In December 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery took steps toward spinning its cable channels away from its studio and streaming businesses, a la NBCUniversal and the newly created Versant. A reorg at WBD created a global linear TV division, which is the one impacted today.

	The new corporate structure aims to bolster its “strategic flexibility and create potential opportunities to unlock additional shareholder value,” the company said back then.

	“Since the combination that created Warner Bros. Discovery, we have transformed our business and improved our financial position while providing world class entertainment to global audiences,” WBD president and CEO David Zaslav said at the time.


	“We continue to prioritize ensuring our global linear networks business is well positioned to continue to drive free cash flow, while our streaming and studios business focuses on driving growth by telling the world's most compelling stories. Our new corporate structure better aligns our organization and enhances our flexibility with potential future strategic opportunities across an evolving media landscape, help us build on our momentum and create opportunities as we evaluate all avenues to deliver significant shareholder value,” Zaslav added.

	











	In May, CNBC's David Faber reported that a NBCU/Versant-like split for WBD was “imminent.” Well, that hasn't happened — not yet at least.


	Cable television still generates cash for companies, but the value is dwindling fast. The jewels in a media-company's crown these days (and for the future) are their studios and streaming services.


	Earlier this week, Disney laid off several-hundred employees. A week or so prior, Disney's ESPN slashed 300 jobs. In March, about 6 percent of Disney Entertainment Networks and ABC News staffers were let go.

The documentary was picked up after Apple TV+ withdrew as a distributor when Oprah Winfrey severed ties with the production.


							By 

	Winston Cho



	Warner Bros. Discovery has been sued by Russell Simmons, who alleges that the filmmakers behind On the Record defamed him by turning a blind eye to evidence disputing accusations that he sexually assaulted women in his orbit.


	In a lawsuit filed in New York state court on Tuesday, Simmons brings claims for defamation, invasion of privacy and false advertising, among others. He seeks $20 million and a court order that would force WBD to remove the title from its platforms.




On the Record tells the stories of Simmons' accusers — including former Def Jam executive Drew Dixon, domestic violence awareness activist Sil Lai Abrams and screenwriter Jenny Lumet — as they decide to go public with allegations of sexual assault. It was produced by Oscar-nominated directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering via their production banner Jane Doe Films, all of whom are named in the complaint, with Dan Cogan for Impact Partners.

					Russell Simmons Sued For Defamation By Former Def Jam Recordings Executive		
			









	A distribution deal with Apple TV+ was severed when Oprah Winfrey publicly announced that she was pulling out as executive producer, citing creative differences with the filmmakers. It was later picked up by HBO Max as its first-ever festival acquisition.


	In Tuesday's complaint, Simmons alleges that the filmmakers intentionally ignored information, including interviews from over 20 witnesses across media and politics, that challenged their narrative that the music mogul assaulted and harassed various women. The evidence was presented to John Stankey, then-CEO of Warner Media, and Casey Bloys, chairman and CEO of HBO and Max Content, both of whom disregarded the materials, the lawsuit says.

	











	WBD and the documentary's producers additionally ignored ignored nine polygraph tests, as well as other information that “would have been discovered with due diligence and adherence to accepted journalistic standards,” writes Imran Ansari, a lawyer from Simmons, in the complaint.


	Also at issue: Apple withdrawing from distributing the documentary and certain media outlets, including CNN, the New York Post and MSNBC, declining to cover the allegedly defamatory content.


	The majority of the title follows Dixon, who last year filed a defamation lawsuit against Simmons for allegedly trying to undermine her sexual assault accusations against him. The former Def Jam Recording executive has alleged that she was raped by the music mogul in 1995.


	The complaint was filed on the heels of another suit against Simmons for sexual assault and battery from an ex-executive at the label he cofounded, who sued as a Jane Doe.


	At the On the Record's Sundance premiere, the audience gave the title multiple standing ovations. With its festival reviews, On the Record currently sits at a 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, while The Hollywood Reporter‘s Beandrea July called the film “a stunning feat of complexity that's both contained and expansive.” 


	Ansari, Simmons' lawyers, is a partner at Aidala, Bertuna & Kamins. Arthur Aidala, another partner at the New York law firm, is lead counsel for Harvey Weinstein in his New York sexual assault trial.

Meet the new boss… same as the old boss? As the industry prepares for the AI takeover, insiders question who's next in line at the major labels.


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


	The business of music long has been an incestuous one, even when the players aren't related. But some of the leaders of today's recorded music industry — 84 percent of which is housed under the three major label groups, Universal, Warner and Sony — actually are. When Lucian Grainge, chairman and CEO of UMG, took the reins in 2011, his son, Elliot, had barely graduated college. Today, the junior Grainge is running Warner's Atlantic Records (home to Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Bruno Mars) alongside another so-called “nepo baby,” WMG's billionaire majority owner Len Blavatnik‘s 27-year-old son, Val Blavatnik, who is a member of WMG's board of directors with an increasing presence at the company.

	Elliot was brought in at age 30 in late 2024 to turn around the label's declining market share (from 10 percent at the end of 2020, down to 5.7 percent last year). While the results of his appointment are yet to be assessed, his track record for breaking acts on platforms like TikTok at his record label 10K Projects — where his successes included Ice Spice and the controversial 6ix9ine — preceded him. (WMG bought a majority stake in 10K in 2023.)




			Related Video		







	“Everyone in the industry is doing the same stuff,” Elliot told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. “I'm not doubting any of the human capabilities of these great guys, women and companies — however, they grew up in the fax machine era.”


	Elliot's ascent to CEO brought with it some upheaval — namely the exit of Julie Greenwald, a beloved executive who had shepherded the Atlantic labels for 20 years. Now, the industry's eyes are on the bigger Warner picture. Specifically, the company's succession line.

	











THR talked to nearly a dozen executives across management, recorded music and publishing — all of whom requested anonymity to speak freely on the matter — who parroted a common refrain: that CEO Robert Kyncl, who joined WMG from YouTube in 2022, may be nearing the end of his run. (A rep for WMG says “these are just totally false rumors,” declining further comment.)


	While not everyone had the same theory about who would take over if that happened, the most likely candidate, most agreed, was Val Blavatnik. “Len will throw his kid in the seat as fast as he can,” one artist manager says. “It's the succession. Warner's like a vanity [asset] for Len.”


	Adds a top manager: “Val and Elliot are very close. It would make sense to bring Elliot in so he could sit and see for a while and help Val.”


	Another insider puts it more bluntly: “This has always been a dynastic play for Len and Val.” 


	To be fair, Kyncl is an easy target for rumor fodder given that he's the only CEO with a background in tech and media rather than music, and the music industry — with its less conventional work environment and reliance on intangibles like golden “ears” — hasn't typically embraced outsiders. Coming off an underwhelming Q1 earnings report (WMG's stock price is down 16 percent since this time last year) also makes it easy for onlookers to put Kyncl under the microscope even if the chatter is unfounded. A change would be somewhat ironic, though, at a time when AI is poised to upend the music business if a digital native wouldn't have the mandate to navigate those rough waters.

	











	While insiders are turned toward Warner, it's worth remembering the fickle and cyclical nature of the music business, where hits still remain the top currency. With enough of them, the conversation could change. Currently WMG holds five of the Top 10 slots on Spotify's Global 50 chart as Alex Warren's “Ordinary” (Atlantic) remains the biggest song in the world, Warner Records' Sombr hold two spots, “La Plena – W Sound 05″ out of Warner Music Latina is seventh, and Atlantic's Rosé and Bruno Mars are in eighth with Apt.”


	If the past tells us anything, it's that seismic technological shifts have often served as a precursor for a changing of the guard at the record companies. In the early days of Napster and peer-to-peer file-sharing, Doug Morris (and his Universal colleagues, including Jimmy Iovine, who would go on to sell his Beats by Dr. Dre headphone line to Apple for $3 billion in 2014) was tasked with fending off the death of the CD, to mixed results. The era of digital downloads followed, making Apple's iTunes the world's biggest music store. Still, the 2000s would see year-over-year declines as album sales (typically $9.99 and up) ceded to song sales at 99 cents.


	By 2011, just ahead of the streaming era, Lucian Grainge spearheaded Universal's acquisition binge, beginning with the catalog-rich EMI (bought for $1.9 billion in 2012, not coincidentally the year Spotify launched in the U.S.) and continuing to the present, where its holdings now claim two-thirds of music's global market share.

	











	Today, Grainge, who netted handsomely when the company public in 2021, is the longest-tenured CEO across the three label groups. Sony Music Group chairman Rob Stringer is a not-too-distant second. After working at the company all of his professional life, he replaced Morris as chief executive in 2017 and has gone on to see some formidable wins, including record-breakers like Adele, and culture-shifting albums by Beyonce and Tyler, the Creator, to say nothing of bringing to the world Harry Styles.  


	Is another change on the horizon? It's certainly a topic making the rounds as executives and industry insiders question when the old guard will pass the torch to a younger generation gearing up for the next era. Some wonder if Grainge will continue to occupy the top seat past his contract-end date in May 2028, though others suggest it's still premature to speculate on Grainge's successor as he's still very active in the company and has laid out a vision for the company for the years ahead. Still, succession has been discussed at UMG board meetings, and a source familiar with the agenda scoffs at the idea of going outside the UMG family in the future.


	Indeed, insiders and reports have cited Republic Collective CEO Monte Lipman (who runs the label group with his brother, Avery, its co-president and COO) and Interscope chairman/CEO John Janick as logical candidates from Universal's U.S. operations, but leaders in other territories shouldn't be counted out, says a source. “There's a deep bench of internal players who are more than qualified to step into this position.”

	











	As succession names float, a pattern becoming more apparent is the lack of women helming labels contending to take the top C-suite jobs. For a time just a few years ago, that picture looked brighter as Michelle Jubelirer was chairwoman and CEO of Capitol Music Group, Greenwald was chairwoman and CEO of Atlantic Music Group, Ethiopia Habtemariam was CEO of Motown and Sylvia Rhone was CEO and Chairwoman of Epic. (The publishing side fares slightly better as Jody Gerson logs a decade as CEO of Universal Music Publishing Group while Carianne Marshall has been Warner Chappell's COO since 2018.) “Old white men have had a choke hold on the industry for years,” says one female executive, who blames the lack of women on the industry's inability to properly groom talent. “It's pretty pathetic of the labels, but it's not surprising. … And now there's been such a revolt around DEI, everyone has permission to just do the easy thing and hire the average white man instead.“ (Rhone is the sole remaining female label head, but at 73, her retirement has become a perennial musing.)


	There are signs of hope under the conglomerate umbrella, however, with a slew of next-gen execs in the wings. At UMG's Island Records (home to Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan), Imran Majid and Justin Eshak were named co-CEOs in 2021; at Def Jam (Justin Bieber, Big Sean), Tunji Balogun came in as chairman CEO in 2022; and at Mercury (Post Malone), 32-year-old Tyler Arnold assumed the chairman and CEO title in March. Meanwhile at Sony, new leadership for Arista (Maneskin) was just announced with Clio Massey, daughter of outgoing chairman David Massey, transitioning to co-president alongside Matt D'Arduini. And WMG's own Warner Records has seen its parent company's most consistent recent successes between Zach Bryan, Benson Boone and Teddy Swims under the watch of co-chairman and CEO Aaron Bay-Schuck who, at 43, is among the more senior of the bunch.


	Elliot Grainge, now 31, certainly tips the scale towards a younger, more nimble record executive less constrained by the old-boys-club way of doing things. But when that elder is your father and mentor, the nepotism-whispers will linger until he's had enough hits of his own. And in a business where names like Azoff, Davis and Wasserman all evoke the nepo tag, the song remains the same.

	











	”Imagine if Bob Iger had a son who went to work at a competing company — it would never happen,” says one prominent industry lifer. “In music, it's like, ‘Oh well, we're fucking morons.' Time and time again, these CEOs refuse to leave or to do what's right as far as their corporate responsibility.”

The filmmaker's planned project follows David Gordon Green's 'The Exorcist: Believer' underperforming in 2023.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


	Fans of The Exorcist might feel their stomachs turn a bit upon learning that Mike Flanagan‘s planned film could take longer to hit theaters than expected.


	The filmmaker took to Tumblr to respond to a fan's question regarding whether his new movie in the franchise was still moving forward. The Hollywood Reporter reported last year that Flanagan would be writing, directing and producing a new project in the Exorcist universe for Universal Pictures that was scheduled for release on March 13, 2026.




	Flanagan explained in his post that his first priority is his Carrie series for Amazon MGM Studios that adapts Stephen King's 1974 novel. “Production hasn't started, we need to finish Carrie first,” Flanagan wrote. “No way it's coming out next March. Nothing to worry about though.”

	The director's new Exorcist feature that hails from Blumhouse and Morgan Creek was announced in May 2024 and will not be a sequel to a previous film in the franchise. This followed Universal shelling out a whopping $400 million in 2021 to land an Exorcist trilogy from director David Gordon Green. The trilogy was scrapped after Green's The Exorcist: Believer, which hit theaters in 2023, was poorly received by critics and collected $137 million at the box office.


	During an interview last year with THR, Flanagan addressed the pressure surrounding his Exorcist film being billed as a radical new take on the property. 


	“I chased The Exorcist very aggressively because I was convinced I had something that I could add,” he said at the time. “This is an opportunity to do something that I believe has never been done within the franchise — something that honors what came before it but isn't built on nostalgia. I really just saw an opportunity to make the scariest movie I've ever made. I know expectations are high. No one's more intimidated than I am.”

	











	Flanagan is known for the Netflix series The Fall of the House of Usher and The Haunting of Hill House and for helming features including Doctor Sleep. Neon releases his latest movie, The Life of Chuck, in select theaters Friday.

Bryana Bongolan also told jurors that the mogul threatened her life, telling her, ""I'm the devil and I could kill you.""

One of Cassie Ventura's friends testified Wednesday that Sean “Diddy” Combs dangled her over a 17th-floor balcony, telling jurors that the incident left her with “night terrors and paranoia.”


	On the witness stand during the fourth week of the music mogul's sex-trafficking trial, Bryana Bongolan said she had been at Ventura's apartment in 2016 when Combs stormed in unexpectedly, according to CNN. She told the jurors that the star dangled her over a balcony, then threw her into furniture.


	The attack left her with injuries both physical and psychological, Bongolan said: “I have night terrors and paranoia and scream in my sleep at times.”


	Bongolan is one of many witnesses already called by prosecutors, who claim Combs ran a criminal enterprise aimed at coercing Ventura and other women into participating in drug-fueled sex shows known as “freak-offs.” Defense attorneys have said the sex was consensual and that Combs merely operated a legitimate music business.


	The alleged balcony incident has long been one of the flashiest accusations against Diddy. It was referenced in Ventura's civil lawsuit that sparked the rapper's downfall, and prosecutors mentioned it in the indictment and in other pre-trial court filings. Bongolan herself described it in detail in a civil lawsuit she filed last year.


	On the witness stand Wednesday, she described it for jurors, saying it had left her with “a bruise on the back of my leg and back and neck pain.”


	Bongolan also testified that she once saw Diddy throw a knife at Ventura, and about another time that she saw Cassie with a black eye. She also told jurors about an alleged incident at a photoshoot in which Combs threatened her life.


	“He came up really close to my face and said something around the lines of, ‘I'm the devil and I could kill you,'” Bongolan said.


	Combs was indicted in September, charged with running a sprawling criminal operation aimed at facilitating the freak-offs — elaborate events in which Combs and others allegedly coerced Ventura and other victims into having sex with escorts while he watched and masturbated. Prosecutors also say the star and his associates used violence, money and blackmail to keep victims silent and under his control. (Read Billboard‘s full explainer of the case against Diddy here.)


	Once one of the music industry's most powerful men, Combs is accused of racketeering conspiracy (a so-called RICO charge), sex trafficking and violating a federal prostitution statute. If convicted on all of the charges, he faces a potential sentence of life in prison.


	The trial, which has already featured testimony from Ventura herself, another unnamed victim named Mia and numerous other witnesses, is expected to run until early July. Bongolan is expected to continue testifying in the afternoon.

Jimmy Buffett's widow Jane claims in a new court petition that business manager Rick Mozenter has ""belittled, disrespected and condescended to"" her.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Jimmy Buffett's widow has filed a court petition asking to replace her co-trustee on the late singer-songwriter's $275 million estate, saying a business manager tapped to handle the assets has been “openly hostile and adversarial” while ignoring her requests for financial transparency.


	The petition was filed Tuesday (June 3) by the late singer's wife of 46 years, Jane Buffett, who married Jimmy Buffett in 1977 and was made sole beneficiary of a marital trust holding the bulk of the hitmaker's assets upon his death in September 2023 at the age of 76. The court filing says these assets, including real estate and a 20% stake in his successful island-themed hospitality company Margaritaville, are worth roughly $275 million.


	Jimmy's will named Rick Mozenter, an accountant at the business management firm Gelfand Rennert & Feldman, as co-trustee to help Jane administer the estate. But Tuesday's petition says that rather than help Jane, Mozenter has actually made life more difficult following her husband's death.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Mr. Mozenter has failed to perform even the most basic tasks required of him in his role as co-trustee, including providing Mrs. Buffett with information concerning trust assets and finances, which has left Mrs. Buffett in the dark with regard to the state of her own finances,” write Jane's lawyers from the firm Sullivan & Cromwell. “Along the way, Mr. Mozenter has belittled, disrespected and condescended to Mrs. Buffett in response to her reasonable requests for information she undoubtedly was entitled to receive.”


	According to the court filing, Jane met with Mozenter a month after Jimmy's death in October 2023 and asked how much income she should expect to receive annually from the trust. Mozenter dragged his feet for 16 months, Jane's lawyers say, repeatedly ignoring her requests to get an answer as she tried to make plans for her future.


	Mozenter finally provided this estimate in February 2025, and the results were “shocking.” Mozenter told Jane she would see less than $2 million in annual income — an amount that would not cover Jane's expenses and “a remarkably poor return for a trust with an estimated $275 million in assets,” the petition states.


	Jane's lawyers say this estimate was especially surprising because the trust had received more than $14 million in distributions from Margaritaville over the previous 18 months. This made Jane concerned that Mozenter was mismanaging the trust and she requested additional financial information from him, but the accountant once again stonewalled.


	The court filing also claims Mozenter has been “unprofessional and combative” to Jane and that he refused her request to sell a piece of Bahamas real estate, even though the Buffett family rarely uses this property and its costs more than $300,000 a year to operate. Mozenter has billed more than $1.7 million in fees while engaging in this alleged wrongdoing, Jane's attorneys claim.


	“Faced with what clearly has become an unsolvable rift with Mr. Mozenter, and the prospect of having to continue to unsuccessfully request that he discharge his duties, on May 30, 2025, Mrs. Buffett asked that Mr. Mozenter resign as co-trustee,” says the petition. “Mr. Mozenter refused, insisting that he remain in a position of authority over her wealth. The situation is untenable and Mrs. Buffett requests this court's assistance to resolve it.”


	Jane's lawyers are asking a judge to remove Mozenter from the trust and replace him with a new co-trustee. The petition suggests Daniel Neidich, the CEO of investment firm Dune Real Estate Partners, for the job.


	Mozenter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the petition.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	There will be more Ma. 


Blumhouse announced at their Business of Fear symposium yesterday that Oscar winner Octavia Spencer is returning for a sequel to the 2019 revenge horror movie, Ma. 


	The first movie, directed by The Help‘s Tate Taylor, grossed more than $60 million at the worldwide box office off a reported $5M production cost. In the Scotty Landes written Ma, a lonely woman befriends a group of teenagers and decides to let them party at her house. Just when the kids think their luck couldn't get any better, things start happening that make them question the intention of their host.“Ma has proven to be a social phenomenon since its release in 2019, with fans eagerly embracing the film and Octavia's iconic performance as Ma. Ma likes to say ‘don't make me drink alone,' so we're thrilled Octavia will join us again for a second round,” said Jason Blum, Founder/CEO, Blumhouse.The Revenge subgenre is one of 24 thriving subgenres Blumhouse identified in a research study last year that aimed to assess the state of horror. Additional examples include Survival, Slasher, Psychological Thriller, and more. During its first The Business of Fear event on Tuesday, Blumhouse CEO/Founder Jason Blum and President Abhijay Prakash, Atomic Monster Director of Creative Production Alayna Glasthal and horror analyst/author Stephen Follows spoke about the ways in which horror has grown and expanded in recent years, with subgenres an important way to entertain the diverse tastes of its audience. Among the several graphs show during the confab, horror productions have surged since the 1940s in Hollywood, more than any other genre.  The 2024 Genre Categorization Survey of 2,000 respondents sought to classify 100 prominent horror films from the past 50 years into sub-genres. The research was conducted by Sage Outcomes and commissioned by Blumhouse in July 2024.

Executive Editor, Television


EXCLUSIVE: Nearly twelve months on from its last round of layoffs, Warner Bros. Discovery is initiating another round of cuts.


	Deadline understands that the company is set to lay off employees on the cable television side of its business. It is believed to be in the double digits but well under 100 as it looks for more efficiencies. These cuts will largely impact the Discovery side of the company, which runs cable networks including the Discovery Channel, Investigation Discovery, TLC and others.


	This comes as the global linear networks division saw operating profit fall 14% to $1.8B with revenue down 6% to $4.8B in its first-quarter financial results unveiled last month.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	All of this follows a move by Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav to reorganize the company into two operating divisions – Global Linear Networks and Studios & Streaming. He said that the move means it “can move quickly if we decide to change and make a determination on restructuring”. However, S&P downgraded the company to “junk status” on “weak credit metrics” and called such a separation “credit negative”.


	This is precisely what NBCUniversal owner Comcast did by splitting off its cable networks from the rest of the company into a standalone public company called Versant, which led to another round of layoffs.


	Earlier this month, Deadline revealed that Disney laid off several hundred employees globally across its film and television businesses.

	











	The reorganization of WBD's linear cable networks follows the move to hand oversight of the division to Channing Dungey, who is now Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Television Group and U.S. Networks, following the retirement of Kathleen Finch last year. Dungey moved quickly to promote Brett Paul and Howard Lee to new roles; Paul, who is President of Warner Bros. Television is also now COO for U.S. Networks, while Lee is Chief Creative Officer of U.S. Networks, in addition to his previous role overseeing TLC and Discovery Channel.


	The U.S. Networks leadership team also includes Susan Kolar as Chief Financial & Strategy Officer, reporting to WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels, and Karen Bronzo, who is Chief Global Marketing Officer for U.S. Networks & News.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Under Balboa Productions‘ first-look deal with Amazon MGM Studios, Sophia Stallone has launched development on Mindf*ck, a series adaptation of the popular psychological thriller book series by the late S.T. Abby.


	Stallone championed the project and will exec produce alongside Erin Simon, Matt Berenson, and D. Matt Geller for Balboa Productions, as well as Tonya Owens Houle. The search for a showrunner is underway. 


	A five-book series, Mindf*ck began as a self-published effort for Abby before growing into a phenomenon, with over 200 million reads, a substantial fanbase across BookTok and Goodreads, and a place on numerous “most addictive reads” lists.

	











	At the heart of the story is Lana Myers, a seductive, calculating serial killer with a morally-charged mission: avenging her traumatic past by systematically eliminating the men who assaulted her, destroyed her family, and walked away free. Lana's carefully constructed world begins to unravel when she falls for Logan Bennett, an FBI profiler investigating the very murders she's committing. Their connection is immediate, intense, and impossibly dangerous — a love story shaped by vengeance, secrets, and emotional reckoning.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Lana Myers wrecked me… in the best way,” Stallone told Deadline on the inspiration behind the adaptation. “Her rage is righteous, her love story with Logan is a ticking time bomb, and her vengeance? Unstoppable. I was a fan long before I became a producer, and now I'm fighting for Lana's story like it's my own. We're not watering it down. We're telling this story the way the author always intended—raw, fearless, and unforgettable. We owe that to the fans. And to S.T. Abby.”


	Abby was the pen name of Christie Marie Owens, an American author who also wrote under the names C.M. Owens and Kristy Cunning, producing works across various genres including romantic comedy, paranormal romance, and romantic suspense. She passed away in July 2021, aged 37.


	A producer, author, literary advocate and podcaster, Stallone co-hosts the podcast Unwaxed alongside her sister, Sistine. In addition to her producing and hosting work, she runs an online book club community, Favorite Book Club, where she shares reviews and connects with fellow readers, championing bold stories and empowering the voices behind them. Currently, Stallone is finishing her debut novel, a romantic comedy titled Ryder's Block.

	











	Founded in 2018, Balboa Productions is behind the hit Paramount+ series Tulsa King, which is currently shooting its third season, as well as projects like Sly, Samaritan, Lost on a Mountain in Maine, and the recent hit reality series Extracted on Fox, which was just had a second season ordered. The company is coming off of the success of its Amazon MGM action thriller A Working Man, starring Jason Statham, which opened #1 at the domestic box office in March and is closing in on a $100 million gross.


	Stallone and Balboa Productions are represented by IAG and Bob Lange at Kleinberg Lange Cuddy & Carlo, LLP. Berenson and Simon are repped by Eric Sherman.

Senior Film Reporter


	After directing a pair of M3GAN films, Gerard Johnstone has come aboard to helm the live-action Monster High movie, based on Mattel's doll line, for the company, as well as Universal Pictures and Akiva Goldsman's Weed Road.


	Plot details remain under wraps. Mattel first announced the project in June 2024. Robbie Brenner, President and Chief Content Officer of Mattel Studios, will produce alongside Goldsman. Overseeing the project are Arturo Thur de Koós for Mattel and Greg Lessans for Weed Road. Universal Pictures' Senior Vice President of Production Lexi Barta and Director of Production Development Jacqueline Garell are overseeing for the studio.

	











	First introduced via a line of dolls in 2010, Monster High centers around a fictional high school attended by the teenage children of famous monsters. These characters, such as Draculaura (daughter of Dracula), Frankie Stein (daughter of Frankenstein's monster), Clawdeen Wolf (daughter of the Werewolf) and Cleo de Nile (daughter of the Mummy), are designed to reflect the diverse and unique offspring of classic monster figures. Each brings their own personality, style, and background to the Monster High universe, creating a rich tapestry of monster heritage and high school drama.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Beyond the dolls, Monster High has thus far expanded into various forms of media, including an animated web series, TV specials, movies, and books. The franchise encourages its audience to embrace their unique qualities and differences, much like the characters do in their world.

	











	Johnstone previously directed Uni's breakout horror hit M3GAN, which grossed over $180 million worldwide, as well as M3GAN 2.0, the sequel set to open on June 27. He's otherwise best known the for cult-favorite haunted house comedy Housebound and the award-winning satirical series The Jaquie Brown Diaries, and is repped by CAA, Key Creatives, and Davis Law Group.


	Said Mattel's Brenner in a statement on the director hire, “Gerard's unique vision and genre-blending style make him the perfect fit for this film. This is exactly what we're building at Mattel Studios as we continue to work with top talent to tell fresh, unexpected stories from our rich portfolio of brands. Monster High is a fan-favorite franchise with endless storytelling potential, and we are thrilled to reimagine it in a monstrously exciting way with Gerard at the helm.”


	Added Goldsman, who is also a producer on Mattel Studios' Major Matt Mason starring Tom Hanks, “Monster High is delightfully personal to me — my daughters grew up loving the dolls and what they represent. Gerard's work is sharp, daring, and full of heart. He's exactly the director this film needs.”


	Currently, Mattel Studios has two live-action movies in the works: Masters of the Universe, scheduled for worldwide theatrical release on June 5, 2026, and Matchbox, which recently wrapped principal photography and is slated for release in Fall 2026.

It's finally time for the new season of “Love Island USA,” which will premiere on Tuesday, June 3. 

The hit show returns for its seventh season, with the initial cast being announced. However, there will be plenty of bombshells to join the group as the six weeks progress. 

And in the end, one couple will be crowned the winners, taking home the $100,000 grand prize. 

Former “Vanderpump Rules” star Ariana Madix is returning as the host of the hit show, and fan-favorites Cely and Callum Hole will serve as the social ambassadors.

Here's everything you need to know about “Love Island USA” Season 7. 

A post shared by Love Island USA (@loveislandusa)

“Love Island USA” will premiere at 9 pm. ET/6 p.m. PT and will be available exclusively on Peacock. 

UPDATE: Peacock revealed that the episode is slightly delayed on X, formerly known as Twitter. 

“WE GOT A TEXT! Tonight's episode will be slightly delayed. But it is worth the waitStay tuned! #LoveIslandUSA,” the streaming service wrote. 

A post shared by Love Island USA (@loveislandusa)

The hit show will drop new episodes every single day except Wednesdays. However, the first week will include an episode on Wednesday to kick things off.

Five men and five women will begin Season 7, entering the villa and beginning their journey to find love. 

Huda Mustafa, Olandria Carthen, Belle-A Walker, Yulissa Escobar , and Chelley Bissainthe will be the first five girls in the villa, along with Nicolas Vansteenberghe, Taylor Williams, Austin Shepard, Ace Green, and Jeremiah Brown. 

A post shared by Peacock (@peacock)

“Love Island USA” will allow fans to vote throughout the season, but to do so, they must download the official Love Island USA app. It's free, but fans will have to register to submit their votes. They can also view exclusive videos and take part in quizzes. 

A post shared by Love Island USA (@loveislandusa)

Season 6 winner Kordell Beckham went through quite the journey in the villa last season, but in the end, he and Serena Page found love and were named the winners! It was the definition of a slow-burn romance, but he stayed true to himself, and it all worked out. 

So, ahead of Season 7, Beckham shared some advice to the new cast in an exclusive interview with PEOPLE.  

“Just be comfortable with yourself, honestly. That's literally it. Just be you. Be the best you, you can be,” he said. “You don't have to put on the front for anybody. They'll love you for you. So, don't try to hide a few things, of what you think people may not like, because they might like it.”

“Don't get in your head, trying to create this image for the audience. Just be you,” he continued. 

While it can be stressful at first, knowing that there are cameras constantly on them, he continued to stress the importance of just being themselves.

And with that, he wants to remind every person that the bombshells entering the villa are just doing their jobs. 

“Hey, you're a bombshell. You're going to do what you got to do. Do what you have to do. And then, see where it takes you,” he explained. “I wasn't a bombshell, so I don't know how to give y'all a prep.”

For weeks, cast members from Hallmark's hit series “The Way Home” urged their fans on social media to vote for the time-travel drama to win the Audience Choice Award at the 2025 Canadian Screen Awards. 

Their efforts clearly paid off because the show took home the coveted prize on June 2, thrilling the show's fans and stars. The Canadian Academy of Cinema and Television has held the awards since 2013 to honor Canadian talent and productions. “The Way Home” is filmed in Toronto. 

A post shared by Canadian Academy (@thecdnacademy)

Winners of the Canadian Screen Awards are voted on by the Academy's 4,000 members. The Audience Award is the only honor voted on and determined by fans. Members of the cast who were there to accept the award included Chyler Leigh, Sadie Laflamme-Snow, Jefferson Brown, Samora Smallwood, Jordan Doww, Devin Cecchetto, and John Spencer Macpherson. 

Showrunner and series co-creator Alexandra Clarke shared a photo in her Instagram Stories of the cast and crew accepting the award and wrote, “Guys …we did it! YOU did it!!!!!!!!” 

LaFlamme-Snow shared multiple social media posts about the night, including one where she wrote, “thank you to everyone who voted for us! you are all apart of this family and we are so honoured that you chose to spend your time watching our story on your screens.”

Doww shared the video of the cast and crew accepting the award and wrote, “SOBBING i love this family so much!” 

Evan Williams, who couldn't attend the awards, posted a photo of those who were there and wrote, “Wowza Look at all these rock stars,” adding, “A massive thank you to all the devoted fans of the show who voted for us. Couldn't be prouder of our whole team. 🔆”

A post shared by Justin Nunez (@justinnunezstudio)

Following the show's win at the Canadian Screen Awards, Hallmark execs have another huge goal in mind for the series, now filming its fourth season: to win an Emmy Award. 

In late April, Hallmark Media hosted a “For Your Consideration (FYC)” event at the private Hollywood club and luxury hotel The Aster. Hallmark was one of many networks hosting screenings for Emmy voters, hoping they'll consider “The Way Home” as they nominate shows, casts, and crews for the 2025 Emmy Awards.

The primary cast, including Landry family matriarch Andie MacDowell, joined “The Way Home” showrunners Heather Conkie and Alexandra Clarke, as well as series co-creator and executive producer Marly Reed, for a screening of the show and panel discussion. 

Whether the screening and party swayed Emmy voters remains to be seen; nominees for the 2025 Emmys will be announced on July 15, per Entertainment Weekly.

Earlier this year, Ethel Cain announced the album Willoughby Tucker, I'll Always Love You and said that it would arrive in August. She's now confirmed that her Preacher's Daughter follow-up is out on Friday, August 8. The lead single, “Nettles,” is out now. Listen to it below.

Ethel Cain wrote, produced, and mixed “Nettles.” She also played banjo, synthesizers, electric, acoustic, and bass guitars, and piano, sang vocals, and handled a good deal of the engineering. She's joined on the track by banjo player and acoustic guitarist Dillon Hodges, drummer Bryan De Leon, electric guitarist Matthew Tomasi, fiddler Donny Carpenter, organist Steven Colyer, and pedal steel player Todd Beene.

In a statement about “Nettles” shared on social media, Cain wrote: “this was the very first song i ever wrote in the alabama house where i finally finished preacher's daughter. i didn't even realize what story i was writing yet but i think subconsciously, because i knew how preacher's daughter was going to end, i wanted to go back in time to a moment of sweetness. i hope you enjoy the greenery, i love this song with all my heart ♡ (and all 10 versions of it across the past 4 years).”

Is that Water From Your Eyes frontperson Rachel Brown making an allusion to “6 God” on the band's new single “Life Signs”? Really, they're mumbling “sick sky,” but the mondegreen reveals something about the song's associative, densely rhyming spoken verses––“Tick tick you're alive sunlit sick sky scraped by bright eyed short sight online.” The first single from the forthcoming album It's a Beautiful Place operates like language poetry, preserving the band's freneticism and oddity in doomscroll onomatopoeia.

Last week, I had the pleasure of seeing the self-described “dance-punk” outfit perform it as a quartet (Brown and Nate Amos added Al Nardo and Bailey Wollowitz of fantasy of a broken heart) on their third-annual rock cruise. A moshpit formed in seconds and soon tipped starboard. A violent duet of rhythm and lead guitars opens the track, one taunting and the other charging after it. The resultant clash strikes somewhere between Metallica and Title Fight, but Water From Your Eyes haven't forgone dynamism and experimentation in the quest for hardcore power; Brown's diaphanous chorus floats through the maelstrom like a valkyrie lifting soldiers from the battlefield. After five and a half albums, Water From Your Eyes are coming for blood.

							By 

	Brianna Titone



	I helped write, pass, and protect the nation's first law to regulate artificial intelligence. As part of Donald Trump's tax bill, Republicans in Washington are now trying to overturn our law in Colorado and preempt any other similar efforts around the country — as the need to regulate AI only grows.    


	The Biden administration formed the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (AISI) in 2023 to identify potential major risks AI could cause. These federal guidelines ushered tech companies to move toward embracing regulation. Understanding the pattern of inaction by Congress, in 2024, Colorado collaborated with lawmakers in more than 30 other states, attempting to pass a new uniform AI regulation. 


	In the final days of the 2024 Colorado's Legislative Session, I was scrambling to whip votes for what would become the first artificial intelligence regulation in the nation, SB24-205, led by state Senator Robert Rodriguez. We realized an increased use of artificial intelligence, often unseen by the consumer, in important aspects of daily life, like health care, finance, and criminal justice should be a significant concern due to its inherent potential for bias. 

	











	AI systems learn from wide datasets, and if these datasets reflect existing societal prejudices — whether in gender stereotypes, historical lending practices, or medical research — the AI will not only replicate but often magnify these biases, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes. This can result in unfair loan denials, misdiagnoses, wrongful arrests, or limited opportunities for just about anybody. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Republicans' “One Big Beautiful Bill” — their effort to extend and expand Trump's 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy — has a dangerous provision to prevent states from enacting any AI regulation of any kind for 10 years. The measure would preempt our state law in Colorado, and have the federal government solely handle regulating AI — which it won't do.

	That should have you very concerned because the enormous AI growth we've witnessed in just the last couple years will just get exponentially greater over the next decade.


	As the Chair of the Joint Technology Committee in Colorado's General Assembly, I know what will happen if Republicans enact such a provision into law. Big corporations and tech bros will get uber rich, and we'll become victims of their AI experiments. 


	It's not easy convincing colleagues to show interest in a wonky, nuanced topic like AI, especially with the legislative clock running out, but with carefully negotiated amendments and the support of the Colorado AFL-CIO, we mustered enough votes to become the first and only state to pass the new law. 


	But state lawmakers knew very well that we had to take action because the Feds are notorious for inaction. Colorado's bill and other legislative efforts happening in tandem were supposed to set up a uniform policy any state could adopt to avoid the dreaded “patchwork of legislative laws” in lieu of federal policy. 


	After our bill passed in 2024, we created a task force, prepared a report, had stakeholder meetings, and drafted legislation, specifically bill SB25-318, to improve compliance, accountability, and processes. We were intent on making a great law other states could model. When the second Trump administration gutted the Biden-initiated AISI guidelines, the tech industry was no longer interested in collaborating. The “safety first” approach was lost and the free-for-all attitude was embraced.


	On the third to last day of the 2025 session, we tried to push forward a bill to improve the AI law — but it became apparent that the tech industry was intent on derailing our effort.

	Led by the venture capitalists, or VCs, and their lobbyists, they created a panic among scapegoats in industries like health care and education and small businesses, to call for us to “do something about AI.”  By “doing something,” they meant extending the implementation of the current law an additional year so they would have more time for compliance. As a seasoned legislator, I immediately saw this as an obvious lobbying tactic to have more time to create a scheme to prevent the law from ever being enacted. 

	











	With my legislative colleagues shaken and convinced by the onslaught of the lobbying efforts, Senator Robert Rodriguez was unable to fend off the implementation deadline change, and he was forced to kill the bill. Unsatisfied, the tech industry was still searching for a way out of any regulation.


	The next day, a seemingly minor bill, SB25-322, was on the calendar for debate. It was basically a simple provision the Attorney General needed for a lawsuit. I got called into several meetings with legislative leaders to talk about how to quell the manufactured VC panic. They proposed I become the “hero” by running an amendment to SB25-322 to again attempt to push out implementation of our original law on AI regulations. 


	I am no hero to big corporations. I fight for the underdog, the worker, and everyday citizens who don't have billions of dollars to manipulate the legislative process. I said no to their proposal and offered a two month extension to give us time in 2026 to try another bill. That wasn't acceptable, so I went to war. I was not going to let anyone attach an amendment, and if they did, I'd kill the bill.


	The unwritten rule in the state House and the Senate is the midnight deadline. Every day stops at midnight. Nobody knows what actually happens if we don't end work a minute after 12 a.m. and nobody has ever attempted to find out. The penultimate day of the session embodies the expression, “If it weren't for the last minute, nothing would get done.” We finally got to SB25-322 at 10:40pm. They called for a vote to limit debate for one hour, which passed. 


	A representative quickly attached the amendment I swore to fight. If I filibustered for the hour, I still needed to fill up the remaining 20 minutes to kill the bill. I blathered for the whole hour and now it was 11:40pm. When time was up, they were successful in getting their amendment on the bill, and the bill passed. Most people don't know that the work of our legislative debate is not complete until we adopt the Committee of the Whole Report which we endearingly call, the COW. 


	The COW is intended for fixing mistakes. It has been often used nefariously. I don't take this lightly, but this was my final strategy for success. Using amendments I ran during my filibuster, I would say the bill actually didn't pass. In order to stop me, the Majority Leader moved for Rule 16 which calls the “question.” This means that anything and everything that was about to go down would be done without any debate. It would allow them to just do quick votes on all of it, and 15 minutes was sufficient time. I felt a moment of despair. My efforts would all be for naught if Rule 16 passed. Then, we voted, and it failed. I was now able to bring my amendments, run the clock to midnight, and kill the bill.

	Just seconds before the clock hit midnight, I was interrupted by the Majority Leader to call to adjourn the day's work. The bill was dead. I had saved the country's only AI law from certain demise. The Speaker was angry. There was a buzz of puzzlement and excitement. In the later days and weeks, those who paid attention recalled the events as legislative heroism.


	Do I believe that Congress will ever pass meaningful AI regulation? No. There is a lack of courage to stand up for what's right, especially when big money gets involved. But it can be done. I know, because I did it. Unfortunately, not all elected officials have the intestinal fortitude to filibuster their own party to do what's right. So next time there's an election, do your homework so you can distinguish between the true public servants and the self-serving politicians.

	As President Donald Trump and his administration continue their systematic attack on trans Americans, both activists and unaffiliated individuals are targeting the FBI's latest attempt to prosecute doctors giving trans youth gender-affirming care. On Monday, the FBI asked for tips on doctors or hospitals “who mutilate under the guise of gender-affirming care,” which refers to surgical intervention for trans youth. But the “criminals” the Trump administration is hunting may not even exist — every major American health organization is firm that surgical intervention does not happen for children under 12, and is incredibly rare for minors between 15 and 17.  Since this tip line seems most likely to target providers and programs helping trans youth with noninvasive therapies — even as the Trump administration threatens to remove funding — people are onrushing the line with incredibly demeaning and foul-mouthed comments, according to two sources familiar with the matter and a recording shared with Rolling Stone. 

	











	The Trump administration's return to the White House has been marked by the dogged targeting of transgender youth and their health care. In January, Trump issued an executive order calling gender affirming care the “chemical and surgical mutilation” of children and threatening to remove federal funding from hospitals that performed it. In April, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi — who served as one of the lawyers on Trump's first impeachment defense team — issued a memo stating the Justice Department's intention to use several existing  U.S. laws to investigate providers of trans health care, including those prohibiting female genital mutilation. So on Monday, the FBI asked anyone who had tips of doctors or practitioners performing gender affirming “surgical procedures” to report them directly to the FBI tip line. (It doesn't feel coincidental that this request was sent on the second day of Pride month, typically a celebration of the LGBTQ+ community.)

	“Help the FBI protect children,” the Trump FBI — fronted by the president's uber-loyalists Kash Patel and Dan Bongino — posted to X on Monday. “As the Attorney General has made clear, we will protect our children and hold accountable those who mutilate them under the guise of gender-affirming care. Report tips of any hospitals, clinics, or practitioners performing these surgical procedures on children at 1-800-CALL-FBI or tips.fbi.gov.” 


	These assessments of trans health care as “mutilation” go directly against the opinions of every major medical body in the U.S. — including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, and the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. According to reports from both the National Institute of Health and Harvard's School of Public Health, researchers could not find any evidence of children under 12 receiving any kind of surgical intervention. For minors 15 to 17 years old, almost all who underwent surgery had procedures focused on their chests — but at a lower rate than cisgender males. But in May, a 400-page report released by the Department of Health and Human Services recommended treatment plans entirely similar to conversion therapy.


	So it didn't take long for this social media post and the accompanying contact information to make its way into the group chats of numerous pro-LGBTQ+ allies and advocates. 


	The two sources say that various concerned citizens, activists, and other individuals immediately began making calls — including anonymous VoIP ones — to the 800 number, delivering profane tirades and insults. At times, pissed-off callers were frustrated they couldn't seem to leave a voicemail and were left chastising what appeared to be just a human operator for the bureau. 


	One caller tells this magazine that they called the hotline so that they could recommend that the second Trump administration “eat my entire asshole.”

	An audio file shared with Rolling Stone featured a gay former federal employee, who requested anonymity, simply screaming into the federal tip line: “Fuck off, Nazi dickheads!”


	The other source familiar with the matter says that “more than a dozen” of their friends and advocates they know in pro-LGBTQ+ political circles were actively crashing the FBI tip line with angry remarks or notes of protest denouncing the administration's targeting of trans Americans and demonization of trans health care.

	











	However cathartic any spamming of the FBI hotline may be for any number of trans rights supporters, some activists and legal experts warn that callers or pranksters should be incredibly careful about what they say on a recorded federal tip line — especially given the uniquely lawless administration that has shown an eager willingness to crack down on Trump's enemies when there's no evidence of any wrongdoing.


	“There are absolutely a lot of people who want to clog up the snitch line,” this person says. “My advice is: Don't make anything that can be construed as a threat. Just speak your mind, be short and sweet about it, hang up.”


	The FBI did not provide comment on this story.


	This isn't the first time this new Trump administration has been subjected to heavy bombardments of mean spam. In late February, top Trump adviser Elon Musk demanded that federal employees reply to “an email requesting to understand what they got done last week” or face a forced “resignation.” As Rolling Stone reported at the time, after copies of the email were leaked online, the government inbox was predictably flooded with pranks and what one Trump administration official described as “very rude” and foul-mouthed emails.


	As journalist Jael Holzman, who has covered the Republican Party's vigorous crackdown on trans people for this magazine, has warned, efforts to launch investigations of the parents of trans kids were incubated at the state level. In recent years, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton emerged as a high-profile proponent of wielding state power against these families. More recently, some of Paxton's team have filtered into the new Trump administration.


	“These decades of established research standards of care that have been empirically validated are now relegated to junk science, and the legitimate science is whatever they want to make up — but that's the Trump administration for you,” Douglas C. Haldeman, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist who's worked with people recovering from conversion therapy, told Rolling Stone in May.

	Of course, the attempts to clutter up the feds' anti-trans tip line will not stop the Trump administration's multipronged onslaught on trans Americans, health care providers, and others. But it's not nothing. Raquel Willis, co-founder of the Gender Liberation Movement, tells Rolling Stone that building a practice of defiance is an important part of making sure communities don't become complacent to Trump-era harassment attempts — especially those that seem to be attempts at control couched in safety language. 

	











	“Even though this FBI tip line and the discourse around it seem maybe innocuous to a lot of people, it does speak to the desire to criminalize bodily autonomy for young trans people and also criminalize private decisions that they're making with their parents and qualified physicians about their care,” Willis says. “It's very interesting that conservatives have taken on this crusade to infringe on private decisions when for so long they claimed they didn't want state intervention in everyday life. This is not actually about some deeper desire to protect anyone. It's just a desire to control people.”

A BIZARRE memo about the Roswell UFO crash could unlock secrets and expose the truth about the “flying saucer” mystery.

A prominent ufologist made the startling claim after aliens were rumored as being spotted dead among the wreckage.

The so-called Roswell Incident happened on July 2, 1947, in a remote desert area in New Mexico.

Conspiracy theories and mystery swirling the alleged crash have fascinated UFO watchers for nearly 80 years.

Back in 1947, the 509th Bomb Group - based in Roswell - released a press release claiming a UFO had crashed in the area, and the United States Army Air Forces were in possession of a “flying disk.""

However, confusion ensued after that release was later retracted, and replaced with a statement saying the object was in fact a high altitude weather balloon.

The news alert had initially been issued by 1st Lt. Walter Haut, the public information officer at the base.

Decades later, his daughter, Julie Shuster, was adamant that his original “flying disk” statement had been accurate.

But he had to keep everything ""secret.""

A similar view has been expressed by veteran researcher Kevin Randle, a prominent ufologist who is regarded as one of the top experts on the reported crash.

Randle has written multiple books about UFOs and the Roswell story.

He's adamant that he has “eliminated all possible terrestrial explanations.""

“What we can say with authority is that something fell at Roswell,” he said.

“We have eliminated all the terrestrial explanations.""

The expert, who served in the Air Force and National Guard, said the UFO case could be solved by delving into a historic memo.

The eerie memo can be seen in a black and white photograph sent out on the news wires at the time.

The grainy note appears to say the words “victims of the crash.” 

The memo itself can be seen in the old pic being held by Brigadier General Roger Ramey, who at the time of the crash was commanding officer of the 8th Air Force in Roswell.

Ramey is holding the piece of paper slightly turned away from the camera. But, fortunately, some words can now be read using technology.

“The Ramey memo could be the key to this whole thing,"" Randle said.

“Ramey was holding the memo in his hand when he was photographed with the debris in his office.

“And what's interesting is we know when the picture was transmitted over the wire, we know who took it and we can see Ramey is holding the document in his hand.

“So we pretty much have the provenance nailed down.

“There are words in the document when you blow it up, that you can read.

“Some people interpret the critical line as saying ‘victims of the wreck.'

“Well, ‘victims of the wreck' takes it out of the realm of a weather balloon - but it's kind of an interpretation of what you see.""

Randle has interviewed some 600 people over the past few decades in his search to establish the truth around the mysterious case.

He has concluded that the weather balloon story is nothing but a ""government hoax"" to fob off those intrigued by UFO sightings.

Randle said, “What they've said officially is that the Roswell crash was a weather balloon and [radar-type] target from this experiment being conducted in New Mexico.

""What I discovered is that while [the radar-type] targets were a part of the experiments conducted on the east coast, when they got to New Mexico, they didn't use those targets.

""That kind of points the finger at this being a government hoax to explain away the Roswell case.”

Julie Shuster, Walter Haut's daughter, told SBS News, a broadcaster based in Australia, that she had many conversations with the former Army PR man about the ""flying disk"" he wrote about in 1947.

She said before her death in 2015, “People began to talk about Roswell in the late '70s after several decades of keeping quiet.

""I would ask dad to tell me the whole story, and he told me the same thing he told everybody: ‘I put out the press release', and nothing else.""

It was not from this Earth, it was something manufactured off this Earth.

It later emerged that Haut had been sworn to secrecy by base commander and close personal friend, Colonel William Blanchard.

But, Haut was unhappy about keeping such a big secret, and prepared a signed affidavit to be opened after his death.

Originally from Chicago, Illinois, he died in Roswell in 2005.

“Basically dad said yes, he did see the bodies, yes he did see the craft and much more than that,” said Shuster. 

“At one point I asked him about the size, and he said the craft was about 25 feet in diameter.""

Thomas Carey, who co-authored a book with Shuster, Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the Government's Biggest Cover-Up, published in 2007, said his big secret ""all came out in his sealed statement after he died.""

Carey added, “The ship which he described was about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, more of an egg-shaped object, and he did see a number of bodies.

“He described them as being the size of children. 

""And when asked point blank if what he believed it was that he had seen, without hesitation he'd say, ‘It was not from this Earth, it was something manufactured off this Earth.'”

A retired cop claimed that he saw the remains of dead aliens being lifted with a crane and hauled away.

Former Deputy Sheriff Charles H Forgus of Howard County, Texas, recalled traveling to Roswell to pick up a prisoner with Sheriff Jess Slaughter.

Forgus claimed he saw four alien bodies with big eyes and brownish-colored skin being taken away by military personnel.

The UAlbany team utilized the UFODAP system to track and analyze unidentified anomalous phenomena during its California experiments.

ALBANY, N.Y. (June 4, 2025) — A team of physicists from the University at Albany has proposed scientifically rigorous methods for documenting and analyzing Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) building upon the work of numerous past and present researchers in the field.

The team tested their methods in the field for the first time and reported their findings as part of a special edition of the high-impact peer-reviewed journal Progress in Aerospace Sciences published on June 2.

UAP is the term used by government agencies like NASA to refer to “observations of events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena.”

Utilizing a diverse set of devices to capture different types of data on many channels, UAlbany authors Matthew Szydagis, Kevin Knuth and Cecilia Levy, along with Ben Kugielsky of UAPx, a non-profit scientific research organization, collected observable-light and infrared images during a field expedition in 2021 to Laguna Beach, California.

The team also used weather radar data and radiation detectors to create a robust framework for documenting and testing potentially anomalous phenomena that moves away from reliance on eyewitness testimony and similarly subjective methods.

“Following on the recent joint Congressional subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena, the study of UAP is slowly moving from the fringe to the mainstream of scientific study,” said Szydagis, lead author and an associate professor of physics at UAlbany. “As this process moves forward, it's critical that future study of UAPs follows a rigorous, repeatable method that can be tested and confirmed by other researchers. We aim to establish a roadmap for these efforts with this paper.”

Szydagis noted the combination of tools and data sets his team relied on during the study included the first use of National Weather Service public Doppler weather radar data to corroborate observations from other instruments, the introduction of coincidence timing between detectors to determine whether potential anomalies were simultaneously recorded by multiple instruments, and a radiation-detection tool known as the Cosmic Watch to determine whether anomalies observed on infrared cameras were accompanied by detectable ionizing radiation.

New AI-Assisted Image Analysis

To help analyze the data from the infrared cameras, Szydagis developed new software, Custom Target Analysis Protocol (C-TAP), which combines artificial intelligence with human verification to do a pixel-by-pixel analysis of successive camera frames to study differences and distinguish actual observations from digital noise in the camera images — similar to an approach used by physicists like him and Levy to look for direct evidence of dark matter.

The researchers coupled this data with robust trigonometric calculations to identify and exclude known objects in the night sky, such as the International Space Station.

Ultimately, the UAlbany research team succeeded in plausibly explaining all but one of the potential anomalies detected — demonstrating that their method is effective and completing important field-testing of the equipment and analysis software.

“While we did not find evidence indicating that UAP have anything to do with non-human intelligence, we still cannot fully explain our one remaining ambiguity, or potential anomaly, which was a collection of bright white dots within a dark spot seen in multiple videos,” Szydagis said.

Director and producer Caroline Cory of OMnium Media provided funding for all of the California field work to produce the documentary film “A Tear in the Sky” (2022).

A Comprehensive Review of UAP Studies

The special edition of Progress in Aerospace Sciences includes a comprehensive review of studies conducted on UAPs from 1933 to the present, including more than 20 historical government and privately funded projects as well as recent scientific research efforts in Ireland, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden and the United States.

That article, “The New Science of Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena (UAP),” aims to clarify the current and historical scientific narrative around UAP and highlight that UAP/UFOs are longstanding global phenomena that have been observed and recorded for well over 150 years, that UAP/UFOs have been observed and studied by astronomers, scientists, and engineers, and that there are currently several serious academic efforts in multiple countries working to collect hard scientific data on UAP using modern instrumentation.

Knuth is lead author of the article, which was co-written by Szydagis and more than 30 other researchers from around the world.

“Given the longstanding, global nature of the UAP/UFO question, the air safety and security implications of their presence, and the potentially profound importance of their nature, studying and understanding these phenomena is of great and urgent importance.” Knuth said.

The alien debate could be turning a corner, as scientists have just made quite the interesting discovery.

It turns out that us humans might not be the only ones calling the universe home after all, as boffins have just found another potentially habitable planet out among the stars.

Dubbed 'Kepler-725c', this planet might prove to be the breakthrough which extraterrestrial fans have been waiting for.

Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences found the 'Super-Earth' planet sitting around 2,400 lightyears away.

Advert

For those who don't know, Super-Earths are a class of planets which are bigger than Earth, yet lighter than the likes of Neptune and Uranus.

According to NASA, they can be made of gas, rock or a combination of both, while they are also usually between twice the size of Earth and up to 10 times its mass.

Despite the name suggesting it's a superior version of our world, it's simply a reference to its size.

The US space agency explains: ""The true nature of these planets remains shrouded in uncertainty because we have nothing like them in our own solar system – and yet, they are common among planets found so far in our galaxy.

Advert

""We don't yet know enough about these planets to tell at what point they might lose a rocky surface.

""But in the range of 3-10 times the mass of Earth, there might be a wide variety of planetary compositions, including water worlds, snowball planets, or planets that, like Neptune, are composed largely of dense gas.""

So, now we've gotten that out of the way, let's get onto what the experts in China have just found.

The boffins located Kepler-725c in a 'habitable zone', meaning that the planet is at a distance from a star where favourable conditions can take hold.

Essentially, it's not too hot or too cold for liquid water to exist on its surface, which is very intriguing - as we all know that H20 is a crucial ingredient when it comes to sustaining life.

Advert

Kepler-725c is also believed to have a rocky surface, just like Earth has - meaning theoretically, it could have an ocean and land.

As well as this, it orbits its host star in approximately 207.5 days...which isn't that far off how long it takes us to get around the Sun, but still, it's a shorter year than what we have.

This star which Kepler-725c orbits is only 1.6 billion years old, so it's significantly younger than the ball of fire which gives us heat and light, which is three billion years its senior.

This information all supports the idea that Keplier-725c could in fact be habitable - but don't get too excited, as nothing has been confirmed yet.

Advert

The authors of the study explain: ""A super-Earth located in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star suggests the possibility of carbon-based life similar to that on Earth.

""It is situated at a distance nearly equivalent to 160 million times the distance from the Earth to the Sun.

""Kepler-725c might equally be a volatile-dominated water world.""

To make things even more interesting, the research team made this discovering using a new technique, which is known as Transit Timing Variation (TTV).

TTV detects fluctuations in a planet's transit times, and the experts ended up spotting Kepler-725c because they picked up on the strange timing of another planet's orbit, which was likely caused by the gravity of the Super-Earth.

Advert

""This discovery demonstrates that the transit timing variation method enables the detection and accurate mass measurement of a super-Earth/mini-Neptune within a solar-like star's habitable zone,"" the researchers added.

You never know lads, there might be a load of aliens giving us a wave from Kepler-725c as we speak.

When a distorted guitar riff tore through the screen and MTV's animated logo crashed into view, Marie Hyon, co-founder of production company Psyop, felt her world shift. “It was loud, defiant, and unapologetically threw me into a new world of creative possibility,” she recalls.

Growing up as a young Korean immigrant in gritty, pre-gentrified Williamsburg, Brooklyn, MTV felt like salvation. “I found a strange sense of belonging,” Marie says. It gave her hope that creativity could transcend language, culture and isolation.

But the path wasn't easy. At nine, she arrived in Brooklyn from Seoul to find herself one of the only Asian kids in the neighbourhood. “We stood out, and not in a good way,” she says. “Bullying was constant.” While her brothers had Hapkido lessons from their father, she was denied that defence. “He said martial arts weren't for girls. That denial lit a quiet rebellion in me -- I vowed to never feel powerless again.” Still, the pain of being othered chipped away at her. “I started hiding my Korean identity, patching together a personality shaped by what others wanted me to be. Eventually, I didn't recognise myself.”

Art became her way back. At Parsons School of Design in  New York, a colour theory professor dropped the needle on Coltrane's 'A Love Supreme', and Marie felt something awaken. “It was like a sacred space. The music gave me permission to take risks, to listen to myself. I started to feel free.” With coffee, craft paper, a tackle box of art supplies, and Coltrane's improvisations echoing around her, Marie listened to her instincts and began to reclaim her voice. “Every bold mark was a piece of my becoming. I saw my past in the erased lines, but I also saw possibility.”

That confidence led to her first illustration job for The New York Times Book Review, and soon she was building a portfolio that bridged fine art and bold graphic storytelling. She taught herself digital tools on a Macintosh Quadra 650, landing design gigs at Nickelodeon and MTV, where she thrived in the promos department.

At MTV, she met Marco Spier, Eben Mears, and Todd Mueller -- her future Psyop co-founders. In 2000, they turned an East Village dive bar into a studio, even rigging a Flame suite in the bathroom. With support from their fifth co-founder, Kylie Matulick, Psyop grew by blending artistry and commerce with intent.

For over 25 years, Marie's work has been defined by emotional resonance. “I don't want to add noise, I want to make something that matters,” she says. “It's not just about the viewer. It's about what it means to the team, too.”

Refusing to be boxed in by any one medium, Marie also directs live-action alongside Psyop's animation expertise, including music videos for Converse (featuring Pharrell, Santigold, and Kid Cudi), Vampire Weekend, and Best Coast, as well as projects for brands. “The more I shared my vision, the more I rediscovered myself,” she says. “Breaking and rebuilding taught me strength and empathy.”

That empathy shaped 'Bottle Cap', a charming but dark short produced by Psyop, alongside Parley for the Oceans, to bring awareness to climate change. The film premiered at Annecy Film Festival in France and was introduced and endorsed by James Cameron. A feature-length adaptation is currently in development.





“I drew from my own memories -- my fears, hopes and longing,” says Marie. “No matter our differences, we all crave connection.”

Storytelling has become the home she once longed for. “It fosters community,” she reflects. “It's where we feel seen and heard.” Still, doubt sometimes lingers. “Imposter syndrome doesn't fully go away. But even the persona you build to survive can be a tool. It gives you the courage to say, ‘Here's my idea—and here's why it matters.'”

Her advice? “Trust your voice, even if it shakes. Speak boldly. You deserve to be heard.”Now, Marie embraces her complexity: Korean and New Yorker, tough and tender.

“I thought I had to choose,” she says. “But I can be all of it. There's power in that. When we share our stories, we create something bigger than ourselves. That's what drives me, and always will.”","{'href': 'https://lbbonline.com', 'title': 'Little Black Book | LBBOnline'}","other"

There is a certain pleasure in studying conspiracy theories. Much of the pleasure stems from the thought that in some people it is the imagination which works overtime, allowing them to indulge in fantasies we can only marvel at. Verily did Shakespeare aver centuries ago, 'Imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown.' Ah, the imagination! Where would we be without it? Where would be our poetry, our intense fascination for literature? Imagination ignites the sensuality which we often link with our feelings of romance, with the persons we desire. 

And imagination is once again the vehicle which leads the world to damnation. The imagination in Adolf Hitler was wild enough to make him draw the conclusion that all the ailments of his country, indeed of the world, had to do with the methods employed by the Jewish community in their everyday existence. And in that Hitlerite imagination lay the seeds of a conspiracy theory. But recall the devastation such imagination caused all across the globe. Six million Jews perished because the Fuhrer seriously considered a conspiracy theory in a way that upended every rule of morality in the world.

Now, not very long ago, it became public knowledge that former United States (US) President Joe Biden has not been in the very best of health. People upset at the news rallied around him, wishing him all the best. But now, as we have been informed, the old disturbing story of Joe Biden having died years ago has been taken up by President Donald Trump. In his Truth Social portal, the current holder of the White House has advanced the bizarre theory that Biden died in 2020 and that the man who served as President of the United States in 2021-2025 was actually a Biden clone. Now you might gasp, place your palm across your open mouth not because you accept Trump's prognosis of Biden's state of being but because you simply cannot imagine that it is a US President speaking so disparagingly of his predecessor.

So Biden, in the fervid imagination of such conspiracy theorists, died in 2020, the year in which he prevented Trump from coming by a second consecutive term in the White House. These conspirators have quite been unable to let us know if in November 2020 it was a Biden clone who was elected President or it was the real Biden who beat Trump at the vote but died soon afterward. Interesting, but did Vice President Kamala Harris know what had been happening? Or will these conspiracy theorists now come up with a Harris clone or tell people that Kamala Harris did not really know she had been the running mate of a clone politician?

Conspiracy theories have for decades focused on the 1969 moon landing by the astronauts of Apollo-11. For the purveyors of such theories, man never went to the moon but went through a simulated version of the lunar surface and yet propagated the lie that the moon had been conquered. Articles and even books have been published to persuade people into believing that no moon landing took place, that it was all a sham designed by policymakers in Washington. Add to that another bizarre conspiracy: a section of Muslims has for years disseminated the notion that Neil Armstrong was so moved by a spasm of religiosity as he stepped on the moon's surface that he became a follower of the Islamic faith. Armstrong did nothing of the kind, but conspiracy theorists have the delusion in them that prevents them from acknowledging their errors. 

In our part of the world, meaning South Asia, conspiracy theories have often provided a strange kind of entertainment for people. This writer was educated by an elderly relative in his village long years ago that Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had not been assassinated in August 1975 but had been spirited away to safety by the Indian government and that in good time he would reappear in Bangladesh! It was mind-boggling, especially because the story was coming from an individual who had been educated and had led a normal enough life with his spouse and children.

That takes us to the stories disseminated by conspiracy theorists over the years about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Conspiracy theorists have thrown up a couple of arguments about the end of the prominent Indian nationalist. One relates to the idea that Netaji did not die but was abducted by agents of the Soviet Union and kept in a Stalinist prison, where he breathed his last. Another theory, based on the fact that a monk uncannily resembling Netaji was spotted beside the remains of Jawaharlal Nehru in May 1964, was that the monk was certainly Netaji in his new avatar and that he swiftly made his way out of the hall. All efforts to trace this Netaji yielded no result.

In January 1966, when Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri succumbed to a cardiac arrest within hours of reaching a peace deal with Pakistan's President Ayub Khan in Tashkent, it was given out by conspiracy theorists --- the idea yet holds for a good number of people in India --- that the Indian leader's sudden death had been caused by an injection of poison in his food. The theory, if at all it was a credible theory, has never been proved. Likewise, following the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy in Dallas in November 1963, the abominable idea was spread that President Lyndon Johnson, who had succeeded Kennedy, had had a hand in the making of the tragedy. 

It was obscene, this idea of LBJ conspiring to kill his President. Nothing of course came of this theory. In this present day and age, nothing will come of the disturbing ideas being bandied around by JFK's nephew and Trump's Secretary for Health, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, on the 'ill-effects' of certain medicines provided to people, particularly children, in the United States. RFK Jr's ideas have repeatedly been dismissed as outlandish, part of the conspiracy he spots around him. The larger Kennedy clan has dismissed his theory, which is just as well.

One last point. Back in 1971, when the Bengali nation was engaged in an existential struggle for survival in the face of the brutality of the occupation Pakistan army, many were the people in erstwhile West Pakistan who could not contain their anger against the incarcerated Bangabandhu. They went epileptic with their condemnation of the Bengali leader, at one point throwing up the laughable idea that he and his family were actually followers of the Hindu faith masquerading as Muslims!

Not many years later did we as well as Pakistanis stumble on the discovery that while Bangabandhu's faith was without blemish, it was Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's background which raised questions. His mother had been a Hindu and accepted Islam when she married Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto, the father of Pakistan's future leader.

Palestinian children gather at a hot meal distribution point in Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip on June 4.EYAD BABA/AFP/Getty Images

Mark Kersten is an assistant professor in criminal justice at the University of the Fraser Valley and a senior consultant at the Wayamo Foundation.

Canadian authorities are conducting an investigation into war crimes and other potential atrocities committed in the Israel-Hamas war. First reported by journalist Ben Mussett, the news comes amidst mounting evidence of the intentional starvation of civilians in Gaza, the refusal of Hamas to return hostages, moves to build new (and illegal) settlements in the West Bank, and open calls among Israeli leaders to depopulate Gaza. The RCMP investigation marks the first time that Canada has dedicated tangible resources to investigating international crimes in the Palestinian territories and Israel.

Details are thin, but we know that the RCMP opened the investigation in early 2024, just months after the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas, and amidst Israel's continuing siege of Gaza. This “structural investigation,” as it is called, collects and preserves evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in a particular context, without necessarily linking that evidence to specific perpetrators. It can do this, for example, by reaching out to victims and survivors who have fled wars of atrocity to gather their testimony. It can also include collecting open-source evidence, such as videos or photographs.

States like Canada can use the evidence collected if an opportunity to do so arises, such as to support a prosecution of a perpetrator who enters onto their territory. Alternatively, they can share that evidence with other authorities – the prosecutors of allied states or bodies like the International Criminal Court (ICC). Canada is currently conducting a structural investigation into Ukraine and conducted one into the atrocities committed against the Yazidi people in northern Iraq. 

U.S.-backed Gaza aid group stops distribution, UN set to vote on ceasefire demand

So far, it is unclear what the focus and core purpose of the structural investigation into the Israel-Hamas war is. Does the investigation cover all of Israel and the Palestinian territories? Or is it emphasizing themes, such as use of starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza or settler violence in the West Bank – topics that Canadian leaders have been especially vocal about in recent weeks? 

When Canada opened its structural investigation into Ukraine, it did so with a great deal of publicity. Why did that not happen with the investigation into the Israel-Hamas war? Was it only acknowledged now because patience with the Netanyahu government is running thin?

Is the investigation's goal criminal accountability or something else? Over the last two decades, and with few exceptions, Canada stepped away from actively prosecuting alleged perpetrators of international crimes who arrived on Canadian soil. It preferred to deport them to their country of origin without any guarantee that they would subsequently be prosecuted. Could the investigation be aimed at ensuring Canada is not a “safe haven” for alleged war criminals? 

While structural investigations focus on contexts and not specific individuals, effective probes into international crimes should lead to prosecutions, especially in countries where alleged perpetrators reside or where they regularly visit.

In other Western states, such as Belgium and Britain, law enforcement agencies are actively considering or have already launched investigations into dual citizens who fought with the Israel Defense Forces and who allegedly committed war crimes. Would Canada do the same? 

A structural investigation might also examine whether any Canadian companies or persons have contributed to settler violence or the construction of Israeli settlements in the illegally occupied West Bank, which Canada views as a violation of the Geneva Conventions.

Even if Canada does not move to prosecute perpetrators who live in or enter the country, it is important to establish whether evidence collected by the RCMP can be shared with the ICC, which is doing its own investigation into the situation in the Palestinian territories.

Canada was a founding member of the court but has historically opposed the ICC's investigation into Gaza, going so far as to suggest that its funding for the world's only permanent international court with jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide was at risk of being pulled. Some of that opposition softened in recent months, but direct co-operation between the RCMP and ICC on this investigation could be a game changer, while also extending concrete support to the ICC as it faces unrelenting attacks from the Trump administration.

It is important to remember that states like Canada are under a legal obligation to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of war crimes and genocide, regardless of their nationality or where their crimes were committed. A structural investigation breathes life into that obligation.

More than anything, the opening of a structural investigation signals that Canada may finally be moving from talking about the need for accountability for atrocities committed in the Palestinian territories, to playing a part in delivering it.

Elon Musk on Wednesday ramped up his attacks against the massive tax-cut bill that President Donald Trump is pushing Congress to pass, claiming it will condemn America to ""debt slavery"" and urging lawmakers to ""KILL the BILL.""

""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman,"" Musk wrote as he decried the budget package at length on his social media site X. ""Bankrupting America is NOT ok!""

""A new spending bill should be drafted that doesn't massively grow the deficit and increase the debt ceiling by 5 TRILLION DOLLARS,"" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO suggested in another post.

Musk's fusillade began Tuesday, when he slammed what Trump has dubbed the ""big, beautiful bill"" as a ""disgusting abomination.""

Since then, Musk has fired off more than two dozen X posts or reposts that either explicitly criticize the bill or comment on related issues, like the size of America's debt.

The ongoing barrage comes days after Musk departed the Trump administration, where he had worked temporarily as the head of the president's government-shrinking group known as DOGE.

Musk, who has signaled he is refocusing on his electric-vehicle and rocket businesses, was prompted to speak out against the bill in part because it cuts an EV tax credit that helps Tesla, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News on Tuesday.

Musk had also discussed continuing to work for Trump as a ""special government employee"" past the 130-day legal limit for the role, but he was rebuffed by the White House, according to NBC, which confirmed earlier reporting by Axios.

There were two other points of conflict, NBC reported: The Trump administration had refused Musk's idea to have the Federal Aviation Administration run off his Starlink satellite system, and it had withdrawn Musk's preferred pick to become administrator of NASA.

Trump, who praised Musk during his send off at the White House last Friday, has not publicly weighed in on Musk's open hostility toward the bill.

But on Wednesday afternoon, Trump's account on his own social media site, Truth Social, reposted a screenshot of Musk thanking the president for letting him lead DOGE.

A researcher used an AI program that analyzed handwriting data which, paired with radiocarbon dating, pointed towards the ancient texts being even more ancient than we thought.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Dating ancient artifacts is very difficult. Experts have a number of techniques they can use to get close, but there are limitations that often can't be overcome without additional information. That said, sometimes you get lucky, like the researchers investigating the famous Dead Sea Scrolls did when they realized that the author wrote the dates of creation directly on several of the pages. 

However, not every scroll was labeled, and as a result, the undated Dead Sea Scrolls have been much harder for scientists to pin down. But when new technologies arise, things can change. 

According to a new study—in which scientists used AI modeling to study handwriting styles across ancient manuscripts with known dates—some of the undated Dead Sea Scrolls may be older than previously believed. Mladen Popovic (from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands) and his research team claim that their work not only re-dates some Dead Sea Scrolls, but could open a new way to place undated manuscripts on the timeline of ancient history. The team published their findings in the open-access journal PLOS One.

“It is very exciting to set a significant step in solving the dating problem of the Dead Sea Scrolls and also creating a new tool that could be used to study other partially dated manuscripts from history,” the authors wrote in a statement. “This would not have been possible without the collaboration between so many different scientific disciplines.” 

The process started with a bounty of ancient texts used to help build datasets. The team parsed through historic manuscripts from various sites in modern-day Israel and the West Bank and used radiocarbon dating to estimate the ages of the documents. The team then trained a machine-learning model to understand the handwriting styles of each document in direct relation to the historic date of the manuscript. 

The AI model—dubbed Enoch, after the prominent biblical figure—then merged the two datasets. The goal of the work is to be able to “objectively determine an approximate age range” of a manuscript based solely on the handwriting style on the document. 

During testing, the scholars said that Enoch's age estimates for the 135 Dead Sea Scrolls were “realistic” 79 percent of the time, and non-realistic 21 percent of the time (non-realistic here meaning significantly too old, significantly too young, or indecisive).

The Enoch model, paired with radiocarbon dating, estimates older ages for “many of the Dead Sea Scrolls” than traditional handwriting analysis methods. The authors said that more data and further research could help pinpoint the timelines. 

“With the Enoch tool we have opened a new door into the ancient world, like a time machine, that allows us to study the hands that wrote the Bible,” the authors wrote in the statement, “especially now that we have established, for the first time, that two biblical scroll fragments come from the time of their presumed authors.”

US President Donald Trump last week laid out one of the biggest challenges ever for NASA — to land the first humans on Mars.

But his detailed budget request for the fiscal year 2026 also proposed cancelling dozens of the space agency's missions, including projects to study Earth, Mars and Venus. And the next day, on 31 May, Trump pulled his nomination for NASA chief, the businessman and commercial astronaut Jared Isaacman.

All of this has left the space agency in turmoil, and the scientists who normally participate in NASA's missions split over whether they support the push for the red planet.

NASA has wanted to put people on Mars for decades, but both technological and budget limitations mean that likely would not happen until the 2040s under current plans. Trump wants to accelerate that timeline. On 30 May, the White House proposed spending some US$1 billion in 2026 on Mars plans, including research into new spacesuits and an astronaut landing system. “These investments will provide the technologies necessary for future Mars exploration and eventual crewed missions to Mars,” the NASA budget plan said.

If the space agency really does want to focus on sending humans to Mars, space-policy specialists say, it will need to massively ramp up its spending. A human mission to Mars would likely cost hundreds of billions of dollars spread over a number of years; the agency currently spends $25 billion a year on all of its programmes, and Trump has proposed cutting that to under $19 billion. “Right now, with the budgets that are proposed, we can't afford to send people to Mars,” says John Grunsfeld, an astrophysicist and former NASA astronaut who led the agency's science programmes from 2012 to 2016.

Trump's latest rhetoric on Mars echoes decisions he made during his first term as president, when, in 2017, he announced that NASA would send astronauts back to the Moon. In 2022, the agency tested a mega-rocket that is intended to achieve that objective, but that mission, Artemis I, was uncrewed. Many technical challenges remain before people can be put on the lunar surface — a goal currently slated for 2027. 

One challenge is achieving success with the giant Starship vehicle, built by the aerospace company SpaceX in Hawthorne, California. Once NASA's mega-rocket has propelled astronauts into lunar orbit, they will rendezvous with Starship, which will fly them to the Moon's surface. But Starship has yet to orbit Earth successfully, much less demonstrate the frequent launches and in-space refuellings needed for the Moon landing; its most recent test flight ended in an explosion on 27 May. 

Days after that blowup, Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of SpaceX who has advised Trump, said he still hoped to launch the first Starship to Mars next year. Some scientists have been put off the idea of landing humans on Mars by Musk's involvement. The technology entrepreneur has long talked of colonizing the red planet, but with little consideration of societal ethics or international norms. In recent months, he led the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the US government and slash its science funding, even as SpaceX is likely to compete for billions of dollars' worth of government contracts on the quest for Mars.

Others are more excited about the prospect of landing people on the red planet. NASA has overseen missions to Mars many times before, sending a series of robotic spacecraft, including the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers. Some researchers say that astronauts could explore more quickly and gain better insight into whether Mars has ever hosted extraterrestrial life. “If we definitively want to answer the question of whether Mars had life or has life today, I think we have to send humans,” says Tanya Harrison, a planetary scientist with the Outer Space Institute who is based in Ottawa, Canada.

But even those in favour caution that a journey to Mars would not only be costly — taking funding away from numerous other research programmes — it would also pose many physical risks. On the way to Mars, astronauts would face extreme isolation and higher doses of deadly space radiation over longer periods than they have ever been exposed to on the Moon or on space stations. If they successfully land on Mars, they would have to get out of their capsule without collapsing after the zero-gravity voyage; begin working in a frigid environment where the soil is full of toxic chemicals and there is almost no air to breathe; and deal with abrasive dust storms1. 

There are solutions, such as living inside an underground lava tube that was created by volcanic activity, which could offer protection against radiation and dust storms. But visiting Mars will be like visiting Antarctica — another hostile, perilous environment — with vastly greater risks, scientists say. “I want to disabuse people of the assumptions that they have that humans are going to be fine,” Erik Antonsen, a researcher in space physiology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said at conference on human space exploration on 28 May.

Matt Turner doesn't necessarily see himself as the No. 1 goalkeeper for the U.S. men's national team and goes into every training camp with the mindset that he has to fight for his job just like anyone else.

So with the Gold Cup beginning on June 14 and the World Cup almost exactly one year away, how does he see the pecking order of USMNT goalkeepers shaking out and what does that mean for him?

""That's a fully loaded question for me,"" Turner told reporters Wednesday. ""I don't see myself as the ‘No. 1 No. 1' all the time. I think that's my mindset going into every camp right now is that every inch, every opportunity needs to be fought for and every opportunity that I've had under this current staff I've earned by my performances within training and the opportunities that I've had this past season with Crystal Palace.

""I never think to myself, ‘Oh, I'm going to come in and I'm going to play, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that.' And I think anybody could attest to the work that I've put in to earn each opportunity that I get. I mean listen, there's lots of good goalkeepers in the pool right now. I think a lot of guys are performing well, especially some of the guys here in MLS, so it's nice to be around them, to train with them, and just keep pushing myself and pushing them to get better and hold the standards true to what we want to build on this national team.""

Turner, 30, was the Americans' starting goalkeeper at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and has been the top choice for the squad since, which included two disappointing performances at the Conacacaf Nations League Finals in March. The U.S. was first stunned by Panama, 1-0, and then by Canada, 2-1. 

Turner has not played much for club side Crystal Palace, which won the FA Cup last month. His last competitive match for the team was a 3-1 FA Cup win over Millwall on March 1; he didn't play in a league match this season.

USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino recently commented on Turner's lack of minutes as a backup, acknowledging that he needs to ""find the way to compete every week"" before the 2026 World Cup. If not, another goalkeeper could overtake him as the Americans' new No. 1.

""It's open in our mind,"" Pochettino told reporters last month regarding the starting goalkeeper position. ""It's open for another player maybe to challenge in between and maybe to try to give the possibility to play another player.""

Turner has an entire summer to prove himself. Pochettino initially called up Turner, along with Zack Steffen, Matt Freese and Patrick Schulte as part of a 27-player roster for two upcoming friendlies against Turkey (June 7) and Switzerland (June 10). Chris Brady recently replaced Schulte, who left camp with an oblique injury, and the Colorado Rapids announced Wednesday that Steffen suffered a knee injury and has returned to his club for further examination.

The USMNT opens Gold Cup group stage competition against Trinidad and Tobago on June 15, followed by Saudi Arabia on June 19 and Haiti on June 22.

Turner reflected on the Gold Cup in 2021, when the U.S. beat Mexico in the final to win the tournament. He believes those performances solidified his place on the roster ahead of the 2022 World Cup.

""I'm pretty sure that Gold Cup is essentially what launched me to get my move to Arsenal and now fighting my way through Europe and trying to make it work over there right now,"" Turner said. ""Since then, I've been through a lot. I've had two kids, I've moved to three different teams, so I've had a lot of change.""

Back then, Turner was playing for the New England Revolution and was named MLS Goalkeeper of the Year in 2021 before moving to Premier League side Arsenal. Since then, his club play has been inconsistent, with just 31 total appearances for the Gunners, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace. 

If he's to get more reps between now and next summer, could Turner potentially return to MLS? He's previously stated that his preference would be to stay in Europe.

""I think I'd always be open to coming back home,"" Turner said. ""But I've had a lot of positive talks with a lot of different clubs and think the important thing for me is finding the right situation for me to play in and to maximize what I feel is my potential as well. 

""It's not as cut and dry anymore in player movement in general. If you look around the European soccer world — especially with a lot of new financial rules and regulations in place — clubs have to do business and get creative with the way they do business in certain situations. So it's not always just, ‘I point my finger to this club, this is a good situation, I want to go here, let's make that happen.' [There are] other factors at play. You have to weigh the family side, you have to weigh the personal side, and obviously the playing side and what works from club to club as well.""

Turner said Wednesday he hopes he'll have news regarding his future this summer. But no matter what happens on that front, he has an opportunity to influence Pochettino's decision-making with quality performances at the Gold Cup.

Jack Grealish set to be left out of Man City's Club World Cup squad, raising doubts over his future; Grealish has two years left on City deal; if any options come up for a summer move they will be considered; due to his transfer fee and contract, a loan switch may become a possibility

Jack Grealish is expected to be left out of Manchester City's Club World Cup squad, Sky Sports News has learned.

City are yet to submit their final 35-player squad ahead of the tournament in the USA but, as it stands, the England international will not be part of next week's travelling party.

Grealish has two years left on his Man City contract and will fight for his place after struggling for game time this season.

If any options come up during the summer for a move, they will be considered.

Due to his transfer fee and contract, a loan move later in the summer may become a possibility.

City boss Pep Guardiola revealed last month that the club, Grealish and his representatives will look to work out a solution on his future this summer.

The 29-year-old has been linked with moves to other clubs in the Premier League and abroad.

Grealish joined City in the summer of 2021 from Aston Villa for £100m - a then British-record transfer deal - and played a key role in City securing the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup to complete a historic treble two years later.

But this season, Grealish started just seven league games and was an unused substitute in City's FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace.

Grealish was dropped for City's final match of the season, and after the 2-0 win at Fulham, an animated Guardiola accepted the winger could leave Man City this summer.

""It was selection,"" said the Spaniard. ""Of course Jack has to play. He's an unbelievable player that has to play football every three days.

""It didn't happen this season and last season either. He needs to do it, and that's with us, or another place. And that's a question for Jack, his agent, and the club. If he stays it will be fine and he fought like he fought from day one to make a contribution, but not today.""

Put to Guardiola that he is unhappy with Grealish, the Spaniard snapped back: ""Who said I'm not happy with Jack? Rico (Lewis) was not selected, (James) McAtee was exceptional against Aston Villa and Wolves. Why not ask me about McAtee?

""It's not personal. I have 24 players, I have to get rid of six players for the last game and five today because (Mateo) Kovacic got sent off.

""I'm the person who fought for Jack to come here, and the person who fought for him to stay here this season and the next season. I'm the one who said: 'I want Jack Grealish'. What happens in the future is a job for (directors of football) Txiki (Begiristain), Hugo (Viana) and the agents.""

Sky Sports News' chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:

""If Grealish is to leave, it would be a complicated deal. He is 29 and feels like he has a lot to offer at the highest level.

""But where would he go? Who can afford to pay £300,000 per week?

""We have seen other players move on loan like Jadon Sancho from Manchester United. We will have to wait, and it is one of the deals that could happen late in the window.

""For Jack, it could be a case of a very long summer and having to wait until Deadline Day on September 1. He is really focused and wants to play regularly.

""If it is at City, he will get his head down and fight, or he will go and play somewhere else. In the long term, he wants to be back in the England squad.""

While Grealish's future is in doubt, City are hoping to get players in before the Club World Cup ahead of their opening game on June 18 against Wydad Casablanca in Philadelphia.

AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders could be part of the tournament squad after City agreed a £46.3m (€55m) deal to sign the Netherlands international, who is set to sign a five-year deal at the Etihad.

But City have not made a bid for Wolves left-back Rayan Ait Nouri yet, despite wanting to sign the Algeria international before the mini-transfer window closes on Tuesday.

They want to beat the deadline so the 23-year-old can fly out with them to the United States for the Club World Cup.

There has been no verbal contact with Wolves, who want at least £50m for Ait Nouri.

Lyon playmaker Rayan Cherki is another key target, with City keen to strengthen at full-back and in the No 10 position this summer.

PARIS—Jagger Leach may have strong family ties to the University of Southern California. But this fall, the ITF's No. 6-ranked junior will chart his own path when heading up the coast to enroll at a long-time rival school.“My dad, uncle and grandfather, all obviously went to USC. They always told me that if I couldn't get into USC, I could go to Stanford,” he shared with Tennis Channel's Prakash Amritraj. “That was kind of the running joke, but I'm so excited to be a Stanford Cardinal.“Stanford is a very legendary place and an amazing school. I'm extremely excited to play for that team and they have a history of winning a lot of national championships.”

Amritraj caught up with Leach at Roland Garros after he advanced to the third round of the boys' singles event and picked up an opening doubles victory with Great Britain's Oliver Bonding. The son of three-time Grand Slam singles champion Lindsay Davenport and NCAA All-American Jon Leach—and nephew to doubles world No. 1 Rick Leach—the 17-year-old is soaking up every ounce of his Paris experience.“The first singles match that I played was a little bit tricky. My opponent had a more unorthodox style. Lefty, lots of spin, high balls, angles, some drop shots. It's obviously really fun to be playing here at Roland Garros and every second on these courts is a blessing. I had a great time out there,” Leach said.“I'm just trying to make the most of it and enjoy it.”

Both parents are in town to support Leach and their impact is undeniable. Take in a few minutes of his match play and ones finds a familiar-looking demeanor: calm, focused, all business. As the year has unfolded and miles racked up, Leach—the eldest of four—has been leaning more on coach Rodrigo Alvarez to navigate life away from home.“They're very influential obviously. They shaped my tennis and they're the ones that taught me how to play, but now that I'm starting to travel a lot more, it's tough for them to be on the road with me every week,” he shared.“Rodrigo's been amazing. He's been very insightful and helped me with my game a lot. We started working with each other at the start of the year so I'm super lucky to have him as well, too.”

Leach plans to mix in a handful of ITF World Tennis Tour (formerly Futures) tournaments with junior Wimbledon and US Open appearances before heading to Palo Alto. This week, a preview of college life has tested his discpline when it comes to food options being readily available.“They've got some croissants at the breakfast buffet and they're dangerous,” he laughed.“I'm trying to stay away from them, but they're a little naughty.”

The new claims come a month after Bailey accused DDG of physical abuse and won a temporary restraining order against the Twitch rapper.

DDG has countered Halle Bailey's domestic violence accusations with a request for a restraining order of his own, telling a judge that the 25-year-old singer and actress is abusive and has repeatedly threatened self-harm for emotional manipulation.


	The 27-year-old streamer and rapper DDG (Darryl Dwayne Granberry Jr.) made the allegations in a counter-petition filed Wednesday (June 4) against Bailey, who won a temporary domestic violence restraining order last month after claiming DDG had physically attacked her multiple times in the presence of their 18-month-old son, Halo.


	DDG denies abusing Bailey and says he's actually the one who needs protection. He claims Bailey has repeatedly punched and slapped him, stalked him by hiding Airtags in his cars, and threatened to take her own life during jealous outbursts when he attempted to end their relationship or “establish boundaries.”

	According to the counter-petition, Bailey has at various times threatened suicide with both a knife and a gun. DDG says Bailey has also used Halo as a tool of manipulation, threatening to get an abortion during the pregnancy and, now, blocking his access to the child.


	“In or about August 2023, during a particularly volatile argument, petitioner became enraged and threatened to end her life using my legally owned firearm. Without my consent, she took the weapon and left the house,” wrote DDG in a declaration attached to his court filing. “This incident was one of several in which petitioner's actions posed a serious threat to her own safety and the safety of our son by creating an environment of emotional distress and danger within the home.”


	DDG's counter-petition includes pages of text messages between the duo, including messages where Bailey writes, “IM GOONG TO KILL MYSWLF TONIGHT” [sic] and “I am simply not tough enough for this world. Please take halo so he doesn't have to see.”


	The DDG counter-petition seeks a stay-away order against Bailey and for the court to award him joint or shared custody of Halo, who is currently in Bailey's sole custody per the temporary restraining order.


	DDG is also asking to bar Bailey from taking Halo with her to Italy for two months to film a movie beginning this weekend. Bailey has sought court permission to bring Halo on the contractually mandated film shoot, but DDG's counter-petition says international travel is dangerous because Bailey poses a psychological risk to both herself and the child.


	“A parent who has threatened suicide repeatedly — who has armed herself with a firearm while in emotional crisis, who has driven with the child in a potentially suicidal state, and who continues to escalate when emotionally dysregulated — cannot be entrusted to care for a vulnerable infant abroad, without the safety net of California court supervision, welfare checks, mental health intervention or child protective services,” wrote DDG's attorney Larry Bakman in the court papers.


	Bailey's reps did not immediately return a request for comment on the allegations, though her attorney, Terry Levich Ross, said during a hearing in Los Angeles court on Wednesday that DDG's counterclaims are “not accurate.”


	During that hearing, Judge Latrice A.G. Byrdsong said she'll issue a decision soon as to whether Bailey can bring Halo when she departs for Italy on Saturday (June 7). A full hearing is set for June 24 on the duo's competing petitions for permanent restraining orders against each other.
