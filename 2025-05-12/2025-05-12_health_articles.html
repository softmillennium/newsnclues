                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As advances in early detection and treatment transform cancer into a chronic disease, City of Hope®, one of the largest and most advanced cancer research and treatment organizations in the U.S. with its National Medical Center named top 5 in the nation for cancer by U.S. News & World Report, opens its largest outpatient facility among its network of 38 U.S. locations. Hope Plaza brings together cancer experts across specialties in one place, making care easier and more convenient for patients and their families. A shift in patient demographics to younger adults and more cancer survivors living longer has created a need for City of Hope to offer both more outpatient care and supportive care." City of Hope treats more than 157,000 patients annually across its national cancer care system. Designed with patients in mind, Hope Plaza increases the number of services City of Hope can provide in an outpatient setting to meet today's cancer care needs. "City of Hope experts are on the forefront of personalized medicine based on an individual's genes, robotic and minimally invasive surgery, state-of-the-art interventional radiology that concentrates on disease and leaves healthy cells untouched, and supportive care that improves quality of life for our cancer survivors and their family members," Dr. Van den Brink said. City of Hope, with a 112-year legacy of treating life-threatening illness, is a national system of cancer care that has been a leading contributor to innovative cancer treatments, including therapies that jumpstart an individual's immune system, that target and kill tumors, and that engineer cells and genes to heal the body. City of Hope physicians have performed more than 16,000 robotic surgeries, nearly 20,000 bone marrow transplants and more than 1,600 CAR T cell therapies. City of Hope's discoveries and other developments in cancer care have ushered in less intense treatment regimens, leading to the need for more comprehensive outpatient centers. Hope Plaza allows for a personalized patient experience focused on improving health outcomes. Fully integrated, multidisciplinary cancer care: All programs - from prevention through survivorship - are available in one place, where the focus is on treating and curing cancer. Many patients can see all care team members in a single visit. Additionally, video conferencing in consultation rooms allows all members of a patient's support team to be virtually present during critical medical discussions, no matter where they are. Lifesaving clinical trials: City of Hope offers the most cancer-focused clinical trials in California, and Hope Plaza expands this capacity. Patients will have access to more than 735 innovative Phase 1-3 clinical trials offering promising new treatments long before they become the standard of care. These state-of-the-art tools enhance diagnostic accuracy, offering clearer, more detailed images that facilitate earlier detection, guide minimally invasive procedures and support highly personalized care plans tailored to each patient's unique needs. Integrative oncology and supportive care services: At Hope Plaza, supportive care is integrated into every aspect of the patient experience. By providing comprehensive support, City of Hope eases the challenges of cancer treatment, ensuring that patients feel cared for and empowered. More than $400 million was invested in the construction and equipping of Hope Plaza, which includes 110 infusion spaces, eight treatment rooms and 22 clinical research infusion spaces spread over eight floors and 350,000 square feet of interior space. Universal design enables all clinical spaces to be flexible so that City of Hope can introduce new programs and services quickly and easily to meet the needs of its patients and community.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As cases of long COVID — often defined as symptoms that weren't present before persisting for 3 or more months after the infection — became more prevalent and alarming, researchers began to zero in on the commonly reported cardiovascular symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations, among others. Long-COVID patients, much research has found, have significantly higher odds of developing cardiac complications than those without long COVID. Now, some researchers recommend that severe COVID, such as cases requiring hospitalization, be viewed as an independent cardiovascular risk factor, regardless of the patient's cardiac health history, and that aggressive measures be initiated. Others say there's not yet enough evidence to recognize severe COVID as an independent risk factor. Statistics about how widespread long COVID is vary, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimating in 2022 that more than 40% of US adults reported having COVID, and 1 in 5 were still reporting symptoms. At any one time, according to the National Institutes of Health, a million people are out of work due to long COVID, and as many as 23 million Americans may have long-COVID symptoms. They used proportional hazard models to evaluate COVID-19 for its association with long-term risks (> 1000 days) for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and as a coronary artery disease risk equivalent. The risk for MACEs was elevated in those with COVID-19 at all levels of severity (hazard ratio [HR], 2.09; P < .0005) and to a greater extent in those hospitalized for COVID-19 (HR, 3.85; P < .0005). “We only looked at people who were 50 and older, but it was over 200,000 subjects,” Hazen said. Having diabetes, for example, is a coronary artery disease risk equivalent, he said. Based on the research, “we are arguing that if you had severe COVID, we should be treating these patients as if they have coronary artery disease and really escalate their preventive care.” For these patients, he recommended a more aggressive lowering of cholesterol levels, such as aiming for a low-density lipoprotein level of below 70 or even lower and to be more aggressive with antiplatelet therapy, such as low-dose aspirin. “It looks like the degree of infection somehow ‘rewires' a person and makes them more proinflammatory long term,” Hazen said. “There is every reason to believe vaccines will attenuate this risk because they reduce the likelihood of serious infection.” Other research has produced similar links between severe COVID and cardiac issues. As the definition of long COVID varies, these researchers termed it as symptoms lasting for at least 4 weeks and occurring at least 2 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Kieran Quinn, MD, PhD, a clinician-scientist at Sinai Health System and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, does not agree that a history of severe COVID can be termed a coronary artery disease risk equivalent at this point. “I don't believe we have sufficient evidence to recognize is as an independent risk factor that is comparable to more conventional risk factors like smoking, diabetes, and hypertension,” he told Medscape Medical News. He does agree the cardiac implications are associated with severe and long COVID. The researchers noted that about 15% of adult Canadians with SARS-CoV-2 infection develop post-COVID condition or long COVID. Among the cardiovascular symptoms are fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations. Among the recommendations are to conduct routine tests such as baseline ECGs, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and blood glucose levels but against the routine use of other tests, such as cardiac MRIs, reserving it for those with symptoms suggestive of cardiac involvement. He cited his own study, asking if the risk of newly developing medical and mental health conditions are greater within a year of hospitalization for severe COVID vs influenza or sepsis. Hospitalization for COVID-19 vs influenza was associated with an increased 1-year risk for venous thromboembolic disease (adjusted HR, 1.77) but with no increased risk for selected ischemic and nonischemic cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disorders, neurological disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, or mental health conditions compared with influenza or sepsis cohorts. According to Quinn, it showed that “apart from an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism within 1 year, the burden of post-acute medical and mental health conditions among those who survived hospitalization for COVID-19 was comparable with other acute infectious illnesses, including the development of chronic cardiovascular conditions like heart failure.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chemotherapy is one of the most popular ways to treat breast cancer. Even though it has proven to be effective, it also has downsides, such as a higher risk of side effects, as it doesn't only attack the cancer cells but can also affect normal cells. Probiotics are among the emerging alternative supplements being studied for their potential benefit in cancer treatment. A new study published in the open-access journal Pharmacia explored the effects of multi-strain probiotics on chemotherapy-related side effects using Karnofsky performance score, complete blood count, and blood biochemistry. The findings show that probiotics with 7 strains have a potential effect in patients with breast cancer, especially in the improvement of common chemotherapy-related side effects such as fatigue and nausea. Alleviation of these symptom can be seen before and after the probiotic supplementation. Another potential effect of multi-strain probiotics is improving blood urea nitrogen levels. Significant improvement was observed in the ability to perform activities of daily living, which means patients can go about their lives more independently and reduce their reliance on others. This might also be related to the improvement of nausea and fatigue symptoms. In conclusion, multi-strain probiotics have been shown to have potential benefits in chemotherapy-related side effects for patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Further, larger study is needed to explore these effects and to confirm the benefits of multi-strain probiotics before they are used in clinical practice. Kirtishanti, A., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Boccia's appeal and rising popularity comes from its showcase as a Paralympic sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and abilities. An Osaka Metropolitan University team has developed an extended reality version of the game as a rehabilitation program, showing how the game that requires accuracy and strategy can aid motor and cognitive skills. Graduate School of Rehabilitation Science Associate Professor Masataka Kataoka's research group developed Boccia XR so that the program can be introduced even in environments with limited space. The researchers investigated changes in mood among participants over 65 before and after experiencing Boccia XR, traditional boccia, and treadmill walking, as well as lower limb muscle activity during exercise. There was no significant difference in lower limb muscle activity during any of the programs, though muscle activity of the rectus femoris, which helps extend the knee, increased during both types of boccia compared to the treadmill. Boccia XR could be effective as a rehabilitation exercise for older adults in terms of both physical and emotional effects, and since it does not require a large court, it is practical for indoor environments such as hospitals and nursing care facilities. Masataka Kataoka, Associate Professor, Graduate School of Rehabilitation Science, Osaka Metropolitan University The findings were published in PLOS One. Is Boccia XR an enjoyable and effective rehabilitation exercise for older adults?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trilobio, the Company building the fully automated robotic lab-in-a-box for biologists, today announced it has raised $8 million USD Seed investment. Trilobio was founded in 2021 to address the established data quality and reproducibility challenges limiting research efficiency; it is estimated that 77% of biologists cannot reproduce their own or other's research, despite latest advances in laboratory automation tools. Trilobio's co-founders, Roya Amini-Naieni and Maximilian Schommer, were named on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list for their contributions to advances in Manufacturing & Industry. To date, the Company has raised over $11 million, including support from Julian Capital, Juniper, Future Labs Capital, 1517 Fund, Alumni Ventures, Angel Squad, Sequel, Nucleus Capital, Gaingels and others, and has deployed its whole laboratory automation platform at leading biology labs across the United States. This investment will support the expansion of the Trilobio Platform's robotics capabilities and no-code software features, enabling a growing portfolio of purpose-built lab devices and protocols to be integrated into a single, fully automated platform. Leveraging continual advancement and expansion of the Platform, Trilobio is providing an accessible and scalable solution to transform genetic engineering, synthetic biology and life science research processes, enabling scientists at the cutting-edge to execute research reproducibly, rapidly, and accurately. Roya Amini-Naieni, CEO and Co-Founder at Trilobio, commented: "Today's research is more collaborative, innovative, and insightful than ever before, and yet has not reached its full potential because of our inability to reliably reproduce, share, and collectively improve experiments. Our mission at Trilobio is to redefine the relationship between scientists and the technologies that power their work every single day, enabling new scientific heights to be reached. It's time for true automation-connecting and fully automating all processes in the modern biology lab and making the dream of walk-away capabilities a reality." Roya Amini-Naieni, CEO and Co-Founder at Trilobio Each Trilobot houses up to eight different interchangeable lab device tools, effectively creating a self-contained lab in a single device, for example grippers, various pipette tools, and a tube cap/de-capper. The Trilobots, which automatically calibrate themselves and plasticware, can be instantly linked together and work collaboratively, enabling a fleet to be adjusted to individual research requirements and scale capacity instantly. A user's research protocol is entered into Trilobio OS just like writing a lab notebook entry, initiating the software engine to plan and execute all details without further action required and eliminating hours of coding and research design. Trilobio OS determines the optimal execution of the protocol which can be automatically adjusted for speed, cost, or accuracy. In total, the Trilobio Platform is purpose-built to ensure each step of the workflow is reproducible in any other Trilobio-enabled lab, without the need for hardware recalibration or rewrite of protocols. By providing a reliable and standardized approach, the technology streamlines research design and execution time down to minutes from days or even weeks. "Roya and Max are uniquely qualified to build the future of lab automation given their interdisciplinary expertise in biology and robotics. I've never seen another founding team with this skillset," said Andrew Sather, Partner at Initialized Capital. "Trilobio is a force-multiplier for the Bio Age, empowering scientists to improve our quality of life and move our species forward."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Refeyn, the company behind pioneering mass photometry technology, has announced the installation of the 500th system based on its novel single-particle bioanalytical technology - notably, within just seven years of its spin out from Oxford University in 2018. This key milestone is marked as a 'game changer' by the Ploug Group at the University of Copenhagen's Biotech Research & Innovation Centre, where their new TwoMP mass photometer and MassFluidix HC system are now installed to further studies of proteins involved in disease relevant pathways. The ever-increasing momentum for this unique technology, used in 30+ countries around the world, is also concurrently demonstrated by the scientific community with over 1,000 publications now citing mass photometry. In addition to academic labs like the Ploug Group, mass photometers are used by biopharma companies, CDMOs and CROs - for scientific discovery, drug development and manufacturing. The Ploug Group is currently using mass photometry to study intravascular lipid metabolism, already citing it in a new research article investigating the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a key enzyme for the lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in capillaries. "We anticipate that the acquisition of mass photometry in our laboratory is going to be a game changer in our studies on purified proteins involved in intravascular lipolysis," said Group Leader, Dr. Michael Ploug. "We've already shown by mass photometry that the LPL inhibitor ANGPTL3/8 is not an oligomeric complex composed of three ANGPTL3 protomers and one ANGPTL8 protomer as was reported previously, but is actually a trimeric complex composed of only two ANGPTL3 protomers and one ANGPTL8 protomer. This information is self-evidently important for future studies on the regulation of LPL activity in capillaries." Mass photometry now provides a valuable orthogonal tool to those already available to the group for its functional and structural protein studies, proving ideal for studying proteins in low concentrations where SEC-MALS is challenged. Since our proteins generally operate in the lower nanomolar range, we need to determine their oligomeric states at these low concentrations and we found that our studies using SEC-MALS often lead to misleading conclusions as it requires higher protein concentrations. We also chose the MassFluidix HC as an add-on to the TwoMP, as some of our biophysical analyses do need to be conducted at higher concentrations. We're also very much impressed by the software used to control the mass photometer and evaluate the data — it's very intuitive and easy to operate." With 1,000+ scientific citations highlighting the unique bioanalytical workflow capabilities of its mass photometry and macro mass photometry systems, Refeyn's technology—which enables the label-free characterization of single biomolecules and viral particles in solution in their native state—is proving invaluable for a wide variety of applications. In addition to protein analysis, other published application examples include characterization of bispecific antibody byproducts (including aggregates), lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), direct measurement of mRNA length, and also quantification of empty, partially filled and full adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector capsids.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthony Costello, professor of global health at University College London says, had the UK followed a suppression strategy, it might have prevented thousands of deaths. He asks why long term strategies of suppression continue to be under-recognised and calls for better governance of UK pandemic science advice. Yet while Greece, Germany, Norway, and Ireland took steps to follow these recommendations, the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) unanimously chose a response based on pandemic flu that ignored the different characteristics of coronavirus transmission. Nor did SAGE change its advice after reports of rapidly falling cases and infection rates in several East Asian countries that had focused on suppression. Instead, in March 2020, the government published its "contain, delay, research, mitigate" plan based on influenza that would allow the virus to spread to achieve "herd immunity." SAGE's unwavering decision to recommend a response based on influenza has continued to be defended by its co-chairs, Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser until 2023, notes Costello. Yet their defence is based on three arguably mistaken assumptions: that covid could not have been suppressed, that a huge second wave could follow even if it was, and that suppression required prolonged national lockdowns. He acknowledges that SAGE faced a difficult and fast changing situation in early 2020 but says its advice to government was "flawed" and "arose from systems failure." For instance, SAGE did not recommend rapid expansion of testing, form plans to mobilise community health workers as contact tracers at scale to hotspot areas and across district health protection teams, or advise on key financial and support measures for effective self-isolation, he writes. "Had the UK followed the same strategy and achieved the same excess cumulative death rate by March 2024 as South Korea, 69 instead of 344 deaths per 100,000, it might have prevented up to 180,000 UK deaths." The BMJ asked Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance why they had not recommended a suppression response, given WHO advice and emerging evidence early in the pandemic; about SAGE's lack of independent experts; why they were not more outspoken about health harming policies; and whether they stand by the recommendations they made not to focus on suppression, but had not received a response by the time of publication. Costello points out that, five years on, many of the people who developed the UK's flawed response are still in post; they have not changed their views on suppression, and little has been done to improve government pandemic advice committees or to introduce detailed governance rules for the UK's future pandemic response and resilience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research being presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Malaga, Spain (11-14 May) and published in the journal eClinicalMedicine finds that first generation weight-loss medications like liraglutide and exenatide appear to show anti-cancer benefits beyond weight loss. Our study found a similar incidence of obesity-related cancer among patients treated with first-generation glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) and with bariatric surgery over an average of 8 years follow-up, despite the relative advantage of surgery in maximizing weight loss. But accounting for this advantage revealed the direct effect of GLP-1RAs beyond weight-loss to be 41% more effective at preventing obesity-related cancer." Dr. Yael Wolff Sagy, co-lead author from Clalit Health Services, Tel-Aviv, Israel She adds: "We do not yet fully understand how GLP-1s work, but this study adds to the growing evidence showing that weight loss alone cannot completely account for the metabolic, anti-cancer, and many other benefits that these medications provide." GLP-1RA medications are best known for helping control type 2 diabetes and treat obesity. They mimic a hormone in the body, GLP-1, that lowers blood sugar levels and makes people feel fuller for longer. First generation GLP-1s and bariatric surgery are well established weight loss treatments, but their comparative effectiveness for the prevention of obesity-related cancers is not known. To find out more, researchers analysed electronic health record data for patients (aged 24 years or older) with obesity (BMI of 35 kg/m2 or higher) and type 2 diabetes (with no prior history of cancer), who were treated with first-generation GLP-1s (i.e., for a minimum of six monthly purchases of liraglutide, exenatide, or dulaglutide within 12 consecutive months) or with bariatric surgery between 2010 and 2018 from Clalit health services-which insures over half of the Israeli population (approximately 4.8 million patients). In total, 6,356 participants (61% females; average age 52 years; mean BMI 41.5 kg/m²) were matched 1:1 based on sex, age, BMI at the start of the study, time of treatment initiation, and smoking status. They were followed-up until December 2023 for a diagnosis of obesity-related cancer. Over a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 298 patients were diagnosed with obesity-related cancer. The analysis found that obesity-related cancer occurred in 150 of 3,178 surgery patients (5.76 cases per 1,000 person-years) and in 148 of 3,178 patients taking GLP-1s (5.64 cases per 1,000 person-years), despite the relative advantage of bariatric surgery in weight reduction, that is known to reduce cancer risk. "The protective effects of GLP1-RAs against obesity-related cancers likely arise from multiple mechanisms, including reducing inflammation," said co-lead author Professor Dror Dicker from Hasharon Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel. "Our study is unique in that the long-term follow-up allowed us to compare the effects of GLP1-RAs and surgery with potential long latency periods of cancer. New generation, highly potent GLP1-RAs with higher efficacy in weight reduction may convey an even greater advantage in reducing the risk of obesity-related cancers, but future research is needed to make sure that these drugs do not increase the risk for non–obesity-related cancers.
