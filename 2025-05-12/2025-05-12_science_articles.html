                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By demonstrating how these distinct drugs achieve the same result, a new study in animals by neuroscientists at The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT identifies a potential signature of unconsciousness that is readily measurable to improve anesthesiology care. When brain waves are in phase, meaning the peaks and valleys of the waves are aligned, local groups of neurons in the brain's cortex can share information to produce conscious cognitive functions such as attention, perception and reasoning, said Picower Professor Earl K. Miller, senior author of the new study in Cell Reports. The finding, led by graduate student Alexandra Bardon, not only adds to scientists' understanding of the dividing line between consciousness and unconsciousness, Miller said, but also could provide a common new measure for anesthesiologists who use a variety of different anesthetics to maintain patients on the proper side of that line during surgery. "If you look at the way phase is shifted in our recordings, you can barely tell which drug it was," said Miller, a faculty member in The Picower Institute and MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. Plus if unconsciousness has a universal signature, it could also reveal the mechanisms that generate consciousness." If more anesthetic drugs are also shown to affect phase in the same way, then anesthesiologists might be able to use brain wave phase alignment as a reliable marker of unconsciousness as they titrate doses of anesthetic drugs, Miller said, regardless of which particular mix of drugs they are using. That insight could aid efforts to build closed-loop systems that can aid anesthesiologists by constantly adjusting drug dose based on brain wave measurements of the patient's unconsciousness. Miller has been collaborating with study co-author Emery N. Brown, an anesthesiologist and Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Computational Neuroscience and Medical Engineering in The Picower Institute, on building such a system.In a recent clinical trial with colleagues in Japan, Brown demonstrated that monitoring brain wave power signals using EEG enabled an anesthesiologist to use much less sevoflurane during surgery with young children. Neuroscientists studying anesthesia have rarely paid attention to phase, but in the new study, Bardon, Brown and Miller's team made a point of it as they anesthetized two animals. Surprisingly, brain wave phase across hemispheres became more aligned, not less. But Miller notes that case is still a big shift from the conscious state, in which brain hemispheres are typically not aligned well, so the finding is a further indication that major changes of phase alignment, albeit in different ways at different distances, are a correlate of unconsciousness compared to wakefulness. Across the 20 or so millimeters between arrays in the upper (dorsolateral) and lower (ventrolateral) regions within a hemisphere, that would mean a roughly 180-degree shift in phase alignment which is a complete offset of the waves. Indeed in a 2022 study, Miller and Brown's labs showed that the anesthetic propofol induced a powerful low-frequency traveling wave that swept straight across the cortex, overwhelming higher-frequency straight and rotating waves. The new results raise many opportunities for follow-up studies, Miller said. Does propofol (another anesthetic) also produce this signature of changed phase alignment? What role do traveling waves play in the phenomenon? And given that sleep is also characterized by increased power in slow wave frequencies, but is definitely not the same state as anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, could phase alignment explain the difference? In addition to Bardon, Brown and Miller, the paper's other authors are Jesus Ballesteros, Scott Brincat, Jefferson Roy, Meredith Mahnke, and Yumiko Ishizawa.

PRODROME was a phase 3, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial evaluating whether ubrogepant 100 mg, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, dosed during the premonitory (prodromal) phase of migraine, prevented development of headache and resolved prodromal symptoms. Qualifying prodromal events were defined as attacks with symptoms in which the participant was confident headache would follow within 1–6 h. Of 1,087 screened participants, 477 formed the efficacy analysis population. Outcomes were collected across 48 h showing, for example, at 2 h post-dose, absence of photophobia in 19.5% and 12.5% of ubrogepant- and placebo-treated events, respectively (odds ratio (OR) = 1.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13–2.61)); at 3 h post-dose, absence of fatigue occurred in 27.3% and 16.8% (OR = 1.85 (95% CI = 1.17–2.92)) and absence of neck pain in 28.9% and 15.9% (OR = 2.04 (95% CI = 1.25–3.32)) of events; at 4 h post-dose, absence of phonophobia in 50.7% and 35.8% (OR = 1.97 (95% CI = 1.38–2.80)) of events; and at 24 h post-dose, absence of dizziness in 88.5% and 82.3% (OR = 1.82 (95% CI = 1.00–3.30)) of events. At 1 h and 6 h post-dose, respectively, absence of difficulty concentrating occurred in 8.7% and 2.1% (OR = 4.26 (95% CI = 1.17–15.54)) and absence of difficulty thinking occurred in 56.9% and 41.8% (OR = 2.05 (95% CI = 1.14–3.71)) of events. Treatment with ubrogepant during the prodromal phase may ameliorate common prodromal symptoms, with improvements possibly as early as 1 h post-dose. Migraine is a common, globally recognized1, neurological disorder characterized by recurrent disabling attacks involving headache and symptoms of brain dysfunction2. The attack has recognized phases: premonitory (prodrome), aura, headache and postdrome, which, although distinctive, can overlap3. The canonical manifestations of an attack—lateralized, throbbing headache with associated sensitivity to light (photophobia), sound (phonophobia) and head movement4—have received considerable attention for the last three decades as treatments aimed at the headache phase of the attack were developed5. The identification of the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)6,7 and the utility of CGRP blockers for both acute and preventive treatment of migraine5 offer the possibility of exploring migraine pathophysiology with new tools. Migraine symptoms that can occur in the premonitory phase (prodrome) fall broadly into three groups: first, higher center, such as cognitive impairment, manifests as difficulty concentrating or thinking—brain fog as it is often labeled by patients—and fatigue. Second, symptoms broadly reflect homeostatic dysfunction, such as food cravings or polyuria and, third, symptoms usually associated with the headache phase can occur in the premonitory phase, such as sensitivity to light (photophobia) or sound (phonophobia)8. Prodromal symptoms are highly predictive of impending headache9 and are generally considered to be common when enquired after in adults10,11 and children12,13. Functional brain imaging has identified activations in the central nervous system, such as the hypothalamic region14,15, in the premonitory phase. Mapping symptoms to imaging findings suggests central nervous system origins for the migraine attack16, with implications for understanding the pathophysiology and, importantly, where to target therapies. Therapeutics in migraine have advanced considerably over the last three decades3. It has been argued whether the origin of both the attack and the pain is peripheral or central17, and thus how best to target therapies. Moreover, previous studies of therapeutics in the acute treatment of the premonitory phase (prodrome) have focused on the potential for blocking the onset of headache18,19. The analysis of the prevention of headache in the PRODROME study has demonstrated that ubrogepant given in the prodromal phase prevented moderate or severe headache, when compared with placebo, for the following 48 h (ref. In the present study, we report the effect of ubrogepant, a small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonist21, on the prodromal symptoms commonly reported by the study participants, a prespecified additional endpoint of the PRODROME trial. In addition to the clinical benefit of resolving these symptoms, the findings may offer insights into the role of the central nervous system in the treatment of migraine. The work has been presented in preliminary form at the 75th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (Boston, MA, 22–27 April 2023)22. A total of 1,087 participants were screened, with 518 randomly assigned to double-blind crossover treatment (Fig. The safety and modified intention-to-treat (mITT) populations included 480 and 477 participants, respectively. Participants had a mean age of 42.3 years (Table 1). Most of the participants in the safety population were female (87.7%, n = 421 of 480), with most identifying as White (88.1%, n = 423 or 480) and non-Hispanic (92.7%, n = 445 or 480; Table 1). Of the 518 randomized participants, 84.6% (n = 438) completed the trial and 15.4% (n = 80) discontinued. Lack of treating two ‘qualifying prodrome events' within the 60-d double-blind treatment period was the most common reason for discontinuation (10.0%, n = 52 of 518). Additional information about PRODROME participants has been previously reported20. Purple boxes and arrows indicate the number and flow of qualifying prodrome events treated with ubrogepant. Gray boxes and arrows indicate the number and flow of qualifying prodrome events treated with placebo. The five most common prodromal symptoms identified at baseline (pre-dose) in the double-blind treatment period for placebo-treated (n = 449) and ubrogepant 100 mg-treated (n = 448) events were photophobia (60.8% and 60.9% of events, respectively), fatigue (50.3% and 50.7%), neck pain or stiffness (40.1% and 40.2%), phonophobia (36.1% and 35.9%) and dizziness (31.0% and 29.0%; Table 2). Although the cognitive impairment symptoms of difficulty concentrating (22.5% and 23.0%) and difficulty thinking (16.5% and 15.4%) were the eighth and eleventh most common prodromal symptoms at baseline before treatment, when considering them as one category ‘either difficulty concentrating or difficulty thinking or both' was reported in 33.0% of placebo-treated and 32.1% of ubrogepant-treated events, making it the fifth most common prodromal symptom (Table 2). Among ubrogepant- and placebo-treated events, respectively, 19.5% and 12.5% were associated with an absence of photophobia starting at hour 2 (OR = 1.72 (95% CI = 1.13–2.61)), 27.3% and 16.8% with an absence of fatigue starting at hour 3 (OR = 1.85 (95% CI = 1.17–2.92)), 28.9% and 15.9% with an absence of neck pain starting at hour 3 (OR = 2.04 (95% CI = 1.25–3.32)), 50.7% and 35.8% with an absence of phonophobia starting at hour 4 (OR = 1.97 (95% CI = 1.38–2.80)) and 88.5% and 82.3% with an absence of dizziness at 24 h post-dose (OR = 1.82 (95% CI = 1.00–3.30)) (Fig. An absence of cognitive symptoms was also observed: as early as 1 h post-dose for difficulty concentrating in 8.7% and 2.1% of ubrogepant- and placebo-treated events, respectively (OR = 4.26 (95% CI = 1.17–15.54)) and at 6 h for difficulty thinking in 56.9% and 41.8% (OR = 2.05 (95% CI = 1.14–3.71)) of events (Fig. The percentage of participants continuing to have prodromal symptoms at timepoints post-dose are shown. a–g, Participants who reported the prodromal symptoms at pre-dose: sensitivity to light (placebo, n = 273 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 273 of 448) (a); tired, sleepy or fatigue (placebo, n = 226 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 227 of 448) (b); neck pain or stiff neck (placebo, n = 180 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 180 of 448) (c); sensitivity to sound (placebo, n = 162 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 161 of 448) (d); dizziness, lightheaded, vertigo or imbalance (placebo, n = 139 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 130 of 448) (e); difficulty concentrating (placebo, n = 101 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 103 of 448) (f); and difficulty thinking (placebo, n = 74 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 69 of 448) (g). Analysis censoring data collected after rescue medication use for headache (if needed) yielded similar results (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. Rescue medication use within 24 h post-dose was 21.7% for ubrogepant-treated events compared with 39.4% for placebo-treated events (Supplementary Table 4). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported for 55 of 462 (12%) qualifying prodrome events treated with placebo and 77 of 456 (17%) events treated with ubrogepant 100 mg within 48 h of administration. As previously reported20, there were no adverse events (AEs) leading to study discontinuation and no serious AEs. The results suggest that ubrogepant, a gepant, CGRP receptor antagonist, administered in the premonitory (prodromal) phase of migraine, when headache is absent, may promote the resolution of common prodromal symptoms. Moreover, in this trial, 31.7–57.2% of premonitory symptoms were moderate to severe in intensity and associated with functional disability20,23. As premonitory symptoms can be disabling, their treatment alone is clinically relevant, beyond the consideration that treatment during the prodrome prevents headache onset and improves function over 24–48 h, as demonstrated in the primary analysis of the study20. Greater awareness of the clinical symptomatology of the prodromal phase, as well as the availability of effective treatment, offers a major opportunity to improve the treatment of acute migraine. It is interesting to examine the time course and magnitude of efficacy of ubrogepant for the different prodromal symptoms. The most common symptom, photophobia, which was present in approximately 61% of qualifying prodromal events, appeared to resolve after treatment with ubrogepant as early as 2 h post-dose, with a consistent effect across the first 8 h and an effect still evident at 48 h post-dose. Although being reported by only approximately 22% of participants, difficulty concentrating may also benefit from ubrogepant treatment, with resolution as early as 1 h post-dose and up to 6 h, and the trend continuing to 24 h post-dose. In contrast, ubrogepant appeared to have limited impact on the resolution of dizziness, which was present in approximately 30% of qualifying prodromal events, and these effects were observed primarily at the 24-h timepoint. Given the varied pathophysiology of the different symptoms, one would not expect ubrogepant to be equally effective or have a similar time course for all prodromal symptoms. Still, similar trends were observed overall for prodromal symptom resolution, which appeared to occur more frequently with ubrogepant than placebo. The symptoms of the premonitory (prodromal) phase of a migraine attack have been recognized for more than a century24. In a case series of 50 patients, 17 identified symptoms on the day before their headache25, whereas a larger series of 530 reported 160 patients identifying premonitory (prodromal) symptoms and speculated on a role of the hypothalamus in the pathophysiology26. Studies based on clinic populations in adults10,11,27 and children12,13 and on large cross-sectional material28 have consistently identified premonitory symptoms, such as fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. In patients who recognize these symptoms, they are highly predictive of impending headache9, although the reliability of prediction remains an issue29. Many of these common premonitory symptoms, such as photophobia, fatigue, phonophobia, cognitive impairment—difficulty concentrating or difficulty thinking, or both—and dizziness, may well originate in the brain. It has long been argued whether migraine is primarily a disease of the brain or of peripheral, specifically vascular, origin30. The new data firmly support a brain origin for migraine attacks. Both symptoms of the premonitory phase, such as photophobia and thirst or food cravings, and outcomes from functional imaging studies implicate brain regions in the earliest phase of a migraine attack31. As an example, laboratory studies implicating neuropeptide Y in the modulation of trigeminovascular nociceptive traffic32, and its localization in the hypothalamus33, or studies of ventral tegmental area reward mechanisms and their interaction with trigeminovascular nociception34 offer support to neuroimaging studies that demonstrate activation of these regions in the premonitory phase of an attack14,15,35. Photophobia, a symptom classically associated with the headache phase of migraine4, may also be reported in the premonitory (prodromal) phase and is indeed the most commonly reported symptom in the present study. Brain imaging has shown a signature in the visual cortex for premonitory phase photophobia36, demonstrating a central nervous system-associated biological change. Similarly, brainstem sites, such as the rostral ventromedial medulla, are implicated in trigeminovascular nociceptive modulation37 with variation over the cycling of migraine38. There remains considerable debate around the site of action of anti-migraine treatments. The triptans, serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists, were developed on the inchoate basis that they constricted dilated cranial blood vessels which were the cause of the pain39. Several findings, including dissociation of the timing of a vascular effect and the pain response40, and the neural effect of the drugs41, have led to the broad adoption of a view that they act primarily through a neural target42. Although sumatriptan can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid43, and the exclusively neurally acting ditans, 5-HT1F receptor agonists44 are both effective45 and have brain access46, migraine therapies are widely considered to act outside the brain. A positron emission tomography study of telcagepant showed low receptor occupancy after a less than optimal dose of 140 mg47,48, leaving unresolved the issue of whether there was potential for gepants to have effects in the brain. Although it may be argued that the effects of ubrogepant in the present study on photophobia and phonophobia or neck discomfort reflect a primary peripheral site of action with brain consequences, it is difficult to argue that position for cognitive dysfunction, leaving a brain site of action as a more attractive, overall hypothesis. Broadly, the findings of the clinical trial support imaging studies that have identified central nervous system sites as the locus of initiation of a migraine attack. The participants studied could identify prodromal symptoms that were reliably followed by headache as determined via a rigorous screening procedure20. Clinical experience suggests that it is not complex to point out these prodromal symptoms to patients and offer the possibility of the association, which patients can then recognize. Nevertheless, widespread adoption of this approach will require further real-world experience. Whether gepant intervention alters migraine aura or influences the postdrome49 was not rigorously explored in the present study and offers interesting avenues for insights and treatment opportunities in the future. The primary objective of the PRODROME trial was to evaluate the efficacy of ubrogepant on the occurrence of headache after administration during the prodrome phase of a migraine attack. The trial was not primarily designed to evaluate the impact of ubrogepant on resolution of prodromal symptoms; these endpoints were prospectively defined as additional endpoints in the protocol. These analyses were outside the hierarchical gatekeeping procedure to control for type-1 error and were therefore not controlled for multiple comparisons. Although our results suggest a consistent amelioration of common prodromal symptoms after ubrogepant compared with placebo, additional studies specifically designed to evaluate the effect of acute treatment on prodromal symptoms are warranted. Additional limitations resulting from the study design include participants being instructed to administer the study drug when they felt confident that a headache would follow within 1–6 h, and not at the onset, or first recognition, of prodromal symptoms. Furthermore, we did not analyze differences in symptom resolution between those who did and those who did not develop headache. Analyses censoring data collected after rescue medication use for headache (if needed) showed results similar to the uncensored data, suggesting that a difference in rescue medication use between ubrogepant and placebo treatment groups was probably not a confounding factor (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. Based on this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, ubrogepant 100 mg, when administered in the premonitory (prodromal) phase of migraine, before a headache has commenced, may treat symptoms such as photophobia, phonophobia and cognitive dysfunction. The clinical phenotype of the premonitory phase, its functional neuroimaging findings and the corroborating experimental neurobiology all point to a pathophysiology in the central nervous system. Reversing these symptoms with a gepant emphasizes the importance of the brain in migraine and offers the promethean possibility that targeting central nervous system mechanisms will be a fruitful path to new therapeutics in this common and disabling disorder. PRODROME (NCT04492020) was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial conducted from 21 August 2020 through 19 April 2022, at 75 research centers and headache clinics in the United States of America (Supplementary Table 5). After a 60-d screening period, participants with migraine, who could reliably identify migraine attacks with prodromal symptoms that were reliably followed by headache within 1–6 h at least 75% of the time, were randomized to sequence A or B in a 1:1 ratio and entered the double-blind treatment period, during which they were tasked to treat two qualifying prodrome events within a 60-d period (Supplementary Fig. A qualifying prodrome event was defined by the presence of prodromal symptoms that the participant was confident would be followed by a headache within 1–6 h. Headache should not be present at the time of a qualifying prodrome event and the participant should not have had a headache in the previous 48 h. Acute treatment should not have been used within 48 h before the qualifying prodrome event. Defining a qualifying prodrome event as 1–6 h before the expected headache onset was done to provide time for the acute treatment to take effect and aid in differentiating aura symptoms from prodromal symptoms. Participants in sequence A received placebo to treat the first qualifying prodrome event and ubrogepant 100 mg to treat the second qualifying event, whereas participants in sequence B received ubrogepant 100 mg to treat the first qualifying prodrome event and placebo to treat the second qualifying event. The two treatments had at least 7 d of washout in between. During the double-blind study period, after taking the study drug, rescue medication was permitted only after headache onset. For a mild headache, rescue medication was permitted 24 h after headache onset. For a headache of moderate or severe intensity, rescue medication was permitted at any time after headache onset. No rescue medication was permitted during the qualifying prodrome event if a headache had not yet occurred. Permitted rescue medications included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, triptans, ditans, ergots, analgesics or combination analgesics, opioids or antiemetics. During screening, participants identified and confirmed prodromal symptoms from a predetermined list of 30 symptoms. This list included common and uncommon prodromal symptoms, as well as the options ‘other' and ‘a feeling, not otherwise described or difficult to describe'. An automated interactive web response system was used to manage randomization, which occurred at visit 2. To maintain the blind, identical blister cards were dispensed at visit 2 and the visit after treatment of the first qualifying prodrome event (visit 3). Each blister card contained two tablets of either placebo or ubrogepant 50 mg. Participants in treatment sequence A received a card with placebo at visit 2 and ubrogepant 100 mg at visit 3, whereas participants in treatment sequence B received a card with ubrogepant 100 mg at visit 2 and placebo at visit 3. During the double-blind treatment period, each participant was instructed to take the study drug for each qualifying prodrome event as soon as they were confident that a headache would inevitably follow within 1–6 h. Eligible participants were adults (aged 18–75 years), female or male (based on self-report) with at least a 1-year history of migraine with or without aura consistent with a diagnosis according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edn4 and a history of two to eight migraine attacks per month with moderate-to-severe headache in each of the 3 months before screening. At the screening visit, participants were asked whether they could identify migraine attacks in which prodromal symptoms were present and likely to be followed by headache within 1–6 h at least 75% of the time. If participants answered in the affirmative, participants received an eDiary to record all their qualifying prodrome events during the 60-d screening period. To be eligible for randomization, participants were required to record 3–16 qualifying prodrome events during the 60-d screening period, with at least 75% followed by a headache, of any intensity, within 1–6 h. Exclusion criteria have been reported previously20. Briefly, exclusion criteria included: history of clinically important hematological, endocrine, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal or neurological disease that has not been stable for at least 1 year, history of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or neurological disease, confounding psychiatric conditions including dementia or epilepsy, difficulty distinguishing migraine from other tension type or other headache types, chronic migraine, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, painful cranial neuropathy, overuse of medication for migraine (opioids or barbiturates >2 d per month, triptans or ergots ≥10 d per month, simple analgesics ≥15 d per month) within the last 3 months or previous CGRP injectable use within the previous 3 months. The primary endpoint of the PRODROME trial was absence of moderate or severe intensity headache within 24 h post-dose. Prespecified additional endpoints (that is, exploratory endpoints) were the absence of the five most common prodromal symptoms, of any intensity (mild, moderate or severe), at each of the prespecified timepoints (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 h), regardless of the presence of headache. Additional post-hoc analyses were performed on cognitive impairment symptoms, difficulty thinking or difficulty concentrating, or both. After identifying a qualifying prodrome event in which the participant was confident that a headache would follow within 1–6 h, the participant entered their premonitory (prodrome) symptoms in the eDiary and reported the presence or absence of those prodromal symptoms (up to six patient-identified symptoms were preprogrammed into the eDiary for ease) at the prespecified timepoints. Entries could not be altered retrospectively. After treating the qualifying prodrome event with study medication and completing their initial eDiary entry, participants were required to report the absence or presence of a headache and prodromal symptoms at each timepoint post-dose. Safety assessments included the incidence of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, vital signs, physical examination and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Adverse events were collected from the time of informed consent until 30 d after the last dose. An adverse event was considered to be a TEAE if the adverse event began or worsened (increased in severity or became serious) on or after the date of the first dose of study drug. The safety population included all treated participants who took at least one administration of study drug. All efficacy analyses used the mITT population, defined as all randomized participants with one or more assessments of headache occurrence within 24 h after taking a double-blind study drug for one or more qualifying prodromal events during the double-blind treatment period. The mITT population is defined in the protocol and is equivalent to a full analysis set consistent with the International Council of Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines50. The safety population included all treated participants who took one or more administrations of study drug. Determination of sample size was previously reported; 480 participants in the mITT population were estimated to provide 95% power to determine a 16-point treatment difference in response rate for the primary endpoint, using a two-sided 5% significance level20. For each of the five most common prodromal symptoms, as well as difficulty concentrating and difficulty thinking, the absence of symptoms of any intensity at each timepoint was analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) in the observed binary response variable. ORs (95% CIs) were based on the GLMM with treatment group, treatment period and pre-dose baseline prodromal symptom intensity as categorical fixed effects. An unstructured covariance matrix was selected for the covariance matrix of the residual effects for the repeated measurements, corresponding to the two qualifying prodrome events, within a participant. Covariance structure of compound symmetry was used when the model did not converge. Similar analyses were performed by censoring data collected after rescue medication. All symptom efficacy analyses were done using SAS software, v.9·4 or newer (SAS Institute, Inc.). The Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board (IRB; that is, Advarra or University of Utah IRB) at each study site approved the study protocol, informed consent forms and recruitment materials before patient enrollment. The studies were conducted in accordance with the ICH guidelines, applicable regulations and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before screening.

Human attachment theory outlines three organized types: secure, insecure avoidant and insecure resistant, all considered adaptive responses to maternal care for offspring survival. In contrast, disorganized attachment is hypothesized to be maladaptive and therefore uncommon in wild mammals, though this remains untested. We assessed attachment types in 50 wild chimpanzees (ages 0–10 years) in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. Using 3,795 h of mother and offspring focal observations, we found no behaviours indicative of disorganized attachment. To explore organized attachment, we analysed a subset of 18 immature chimpanzees and their behavioural responses to 309 natural threatening events. Their responses showed organized attachment patterns: some sought maternal closeness (secure-like), while others displayed independence (insecure avoidant-like). Our study supports the hypothesis that organized attachment types are adaptive and have a long evolutionary history. Attachment is defined as an affectionate bond between an infant and primary caregiver, characterized by physical proximity and reactions to separation1,2. In humans, attachment is crucial for both the physical and psychological well-being of the offspring3. Attachment theory suggests that the caregiver, usually the mother, serves as a secure base, enabling exploration and providing a safe haven for the infant during distress4. In humans, offspring attachment to a primary caregiver is commonly examined using an experimental paradigm known as the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP)5,6. This is defined as confidence in the caregiver's availability and responsiveness, and is revealed by exposing the child to a temporary separation from their caregiver. Ainsworth and colleagues5 described three types of ‘organized' attachment, referring to attachment behaviours that are structured and consistent: (1) secure, (2) insecure resistant/ambivalent and (3) insecure avoidant (Fig. Organized attachment is hypothesized to represent strategies adapted to the caregiver's responsiveness, ensuring offspring survival and sustained development in diverse early social settings. Such strategies are thought to be formed to optimize social capacity in the relevant environment2,7. Secure attachment arises from confidence in the caregiver's availability, nurtured by their high responsiveness. On the other hand, insecure-avoidant offspring adjust their behaviour due to their caregiver's lack of responsiveness, leading to avoidance of contact during distress and developing a level of independence earlier than is typical for their age. Insecure-resistant offspring exhibit clingy behaviour, a response to the inconsistent responsiveness of their caregiver. Research shows that attachment types remain stable across development and influence social growth. Waters9 found consistent infant behaviour during the SSP between 12 and 18 months. Kerns, Tomich and Kim10 used questionnaires to reveal that children aged 7–13 years maintained stable perceptions of attachment figure availability (with no change in the secure score for parent–child attachment), though they relied less on them as they aged, seeking less comfort or play from caregivers when distressed or sick. The black boxes show human attachment types. 1), characterized by random or conflicting behaviours, stereotypies and fear of the caregiver typically, with offspring expressing distress without seeking comfort from their caregiver12,13. Disorganized attachment, linked to problematic parenting and higher rates of parental psychopathology, poses challenges for social integration14. The classification of disorganized attachment as adaptive2,15 or maladaptive16 remains debated. Indeed, Gazzillo and colleagues15 consider disorganized attachment as a child's adaptation to a traumatic, inconsistent environment, leading to contradictory behaviours such as avoiding approach and showing fear. Other researchers, in contrast, argue that disorganized attachment is maladaptive, lacking a coherent strategy and posing long-term developmental risks16,17. Understanding the evolutionary history of these behaviours could offer insights into child development, aiding therapeutic interventions and prevention strategies for emotional and psychological issues. Unlike all other apes, reproduction in humans is relatively cooperative and includes a range of support structures that theoretically could limit the impact of poor parent–offspring attachment18. As such, disorganized attachment could emerge as a maladaptive response to disorganized parenting, which could arise from a lack of clear selection pressures on parenting. In this case, disorganized attachment is unlikely to be observed in environments where natural selection should favour more adaptive attachment patterns that increase the chances of offspring survival. Therefore, as a first step towards evaluating the evolution of certain attachment types, a comparative approach is needed. However, researchers have explored the mother–offspring relationship in captive nonhuman primates. Such studies demonstrate strong attachment bonds between biological mothers and their infants20. Furthermore, studies with monkeys, including Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata)21, bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata)22, brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella)23 and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)24, have identified individual differences in mother–offspring attachment security. Additionally, Yano-Nashimoto and colleagues25 found that captive infant marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), which are raised in a multi-caregiver system, selectively avoided and emitted negative calls when handled by rejecting caregivers. This suggests attachment figures are chosen depending on the quality of care provided in this species. Studies of mother–offspring attachment types in wild primates, however, have not yet been conducted. Chimpanzees, one of our closest living relatives26, serve as an excellent model for studying mother–offspring attachment. Their exceptional social and cognitive abilities, coupled with an important dependence on mothers for at least the first decade of life27,28,29,30, make them extremely valuable for comparative research. This social dependency crucially contributes to the offspring's overall fitness31,32. Van Ijzendoorn et al.33 and Clay34 used the SSP with captive human-reared infant chimpanzees, revealing distinct attachment types with their favourite caregiver similar to those in human infants with their mothers. Responsive care (as opposed to standard care) correlated with less disorganized attachment and more advanced cognitive development. One-year-old captive chimpanzees with disorganized attachment had an increased likelihood of illness, heightened abnormal behaviours and reduced social interaction success over 20 years (ref. While insightful, findings from such studies potentially differ from those representing mother–offspring attachment in natural settings. Mothers not only provide nourishment, but also closeness, comfort and social learning opportunities35. While captive settings provide a more controlled environment, it is essential to acknowledge their limitations in representing attachment processes in a natural system where behaviours are largely adapted to socio-ecological conditions. Owing to predation, social competition and variable food availability, mother–offspring attachment under natural conditions should be shaped by selection processes. In our study of wild chimpanzees, we first hypothesized that disorganized attachment would be rare in these natural settings due to its potentially maladaptive nature in humans, with some evidence supporting this in captive apes34. Given that disorganized attachment may result, at least in part, from the maternal style the offspring is exposed to, low survival rates would limit the proliferation of such a behavioural phenotype into future generations. We predicted that immature chimpanzees would show few behaviours typically observed in individuals with disorganized attachment. Specifically, we predicted immature chimpanzees would show few aggressive behaviours towards their mother, rare or no abnormal or stereotypic behaviour and would look for comfort when expressing vocal distress. Second, we hypothesized that organized attachment types would be prevalent in wild chimpanzees. In humans, caregiver responsiveness is thought to directly shape the attachment type5,36,37, but this has not been tested in nonhuman animals. Nevertheless, general social characteristics such as gregariousness, grooming rates and number of bond partners vary among chimpanzee mothers38 and depend on the sex of the offspring39, which might impact maternal care. We compared attachment patterns with existing and well-defined attachment types observed in humans. We expected that if attachment types overlap with those of humans, wild immature chimpanzees would display different safety-seeking and comfort behaviours from mothers during threatening situations, reflecting secure, insecure-avoidant and insecure-resistant attachment types. Additionally, to assess the functional similarity of any attributed attachment types with those of humans, we determined how attachment security impacted mother–offspring proximity during social exploration8. We predicted that individuals who did not rely on their mother during exposure to a threat (insecure avoidant-like), would explore further away from her during social contexts, compared with those seeking comfort during threatening events (secure and insecure resistant-like). We also expected that individuals exhibiting overreaction during threatening situations (insecure resistant-like) would limit their exploration in social contexts, staying close to their mother compared to other individuals. The analyses performed to test each prediction are summarized in Fig. Therefore, the current research endeavoured to investigate the dynamics of mother–offspring attachment in wild western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), drawing parallels with attachment theory in humans. The behavioural data (ethogram in Supplementary Table 1) collected over 34 months (from 2016 to 2023) on 50 mother–offspring dyads (offspring's age between 0 and 10 years old) (Supplementary Table 2) provides a unique opportunity to explore the relevance of attachment theory in chimpanzees within their natural habitat. This approach also offers a fresh perspective by studying attachment types in wild primates. To investigate mother–offspring aggression (test A2) and test for disorganized attachment, we used the entire dataset (Supplementary Fig. For analyses related to organized attachment (test B) and part of the disorganized attachment assessment (test A1), we focused on data from 2021 to 2023, which included additional ethogram elements specifically designed to capture responses to directed and undirected threatening events (UTEs) (see ‘Threatening events' section) (Supplementary Fig. We collected 2,882 h of behavioural data on 50 immature chimpanzees (22 females and 28 males, aged 0 to 10years, mean observation time (M) = 58.06 h, range 28–107 ± 19.96 h (s.d.) per individual), totalling 3,795 h of observation. To investigate the existence of disorganized attachment in 30 immature chimpanzees (ages 0 to 10 years), we tested whether vocal distress from the offspring predicted a mother–offspring approach during naturally occurring events (Model 1), a sign of organized rather than disorganized attachment. We categorized these events as undirectly or directly threatening for the offspring UTEs and directed threatening events (DTEs)). Offspring showing vocal distress (whimpering or screaming) approached their mother (23% of 168 occasions) or were approached by her (42% of 168 occasions). We examined the credible intervals (CIs) for each individual to identify individuals not following the predictions of the model (Supplementary Fig. We found that vocal distress did not predict an approach for three individuals out of 30 (10%). By examining the behavioural reactions during other threatening events, we found that these three individuals approached their mother on several occurrences. The conditional R2 of this model was 0.284. We assessed the occurrence of aggressive behaviours between immature chimpanzees and their mother and other characteristic behaviours of disorganized attachment to investigate the existence of this attachment type. In over 3,795 h of focal data focusing on mother and offspring, the 50 studied offspring between 0 to 10 years old never showed aggression towards the mother. In contrast, we observed a total of 31 mild non-contact aggressions of 12 mothers towards their offspring during the observation period (27 arm waves, 2 hunches, 1 charge and 1 chase) and 15 contact aggressions of 11 mothers towards their offspring (6 push away, 6 hits and 3 pulls). Mother–offspring aggression rates are shown in Supplementary Fig. We did not observe any abnormal or stereotypic behaviours in any chimpanzee (for example, rocking, hair pulling, face grimacing or incomplete behaviour), nor attempts by the offspring to escape from their mother, except in instances where the mother displayed aggression towards the offspring over the 50 studied offspring. We investigated the behavioural reactions of 18 immature chimpanzees during UTEs and found differences across ages. The youngest chimpanzees (less than 2 years) predominantly whimpered, looked towards their mother and/or approached their mother during a UTE (model 2; Fig. However, with increasing age, this tendency decreased. The tendency to show no reaction increased with age and peaked at 50% of events around the weaning period (4–6 years old) before the likelihood of no reaction decreased again. After weaning (>6 years), however, the likelihood of climbing a tree or running away from the UTE increased. Bottom: individual variation in offspring behavioural reactions to UTEs. The violin plots show deviation from the expected value (0) for a given age while accounting for sex, party size and the presence of older siblings. Each dot depicts an individual chimpanzee. Positive or negative deviation from zero indicates that the individual shows a behaviour more or less than predicted, respectively. The sample size is n = 30 individuals across 550 independent events. Comparing the deviation estimates of each offspring's behaviour when reacting to the UTE with the expected behaviour for its age and other variables (for example, sex or presence of older siblings), we found that some behavioural reactions had higher individual variability than others (Fig. This suggests that interindividual variability in behavioural reactions during UTEs was primarily influenced by differences in the approach behaviour towards the mother. Given that we found strong individual differences in key attachment-related variables (Fig. 2b), we explored whether individuals displayed consistent behavioural patterns regardless of age and other social factors. Using the unsupervised Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method, we identified three clusters without predefined numbers. A supervised cluster analysis with three set clusters produced similar results, consistently grouping the same individuals (Fig. Each dot corresponds to an individual offspring. Top: dimension reduction (UMAP) and cluster analysis of the behavioural reactions of the offspring during UTEs testing the existence of distinct attachment types. NN, number of nearest neighbors. The axis of both plots represents a dimension reduction of the original data to two dimensions. The arrows represent the different dimensions (behavioural reactions) that have been reduced into two dimensions (top). Attachment type 1 corresponds to individuals not showing specific behaviour more often than expected for their age during UTEs; attachment type 2 corresponds to individuals not reacting during a threat or climbing, approaching another individual or running away without orienting towards the mother to seek safety more than expected for their age; and attachment type 3 corresponds to individuals approaching and looking towards their mother more than expected for their age. The sample size is n = 18 individuals. The principal component analysis (PCA) results indicated which behaviours drove each cluster (Table 2 and Fig. Adding component 2 explained 79% of the variance (eigenvalue of 0.43), driven by ‘approaching other individuals'. Including component 3 explained 90% (eigenvalue of 0.34). Each remaining component explained less than 5%. Attachment type 1 was attributed to individuals near the PCA centre, following model predictions. Attachment type 2 individuals relied less on their mothers than expected, while attachment type 3 individuals approached their mothers more than predicted for their age (Fig. To validate the attribution of attachment types to each individual based on their behavioural reactions during UTEs, we investigated whether there were differences in mother–offspring distances during social exploration across focal samples depending on attachment type. We modelled the mean distance between offspring and mother per focal day predicted by the attachment type and other control variables (for example, sex and age) (model 3), with the results presented in Table 3. Indeed, offspring with attachment type 2 engaged in social exploration further away from their mother than offspring with attachment type 1 (Fig. 4) Control variables produced no consistent difference in mother–offspring proximity (all 89% CI overlapped 0; Table 3). Only daily mean party size showed a notable trend, suggesting that larger social gatherings were associated with offspring engaging in social exploration further away from their mother. The star represents an 89% CI excluding zero, indicating a credible effect. The sample size is n = 18 individuals across 260 independent events. Finally, we investigated whether the offspring continued being distressed even after their mother had comforted them, to distinguish between secure and insecure-resistant attachment (Fig. In only 3 of 78 events did offspring continue or renew vocal distress within 30 s of experiencing a threat. During these three events, the mother did not approach or make physical contact with the offspring, nor did she react to further distress. We assessed comfort seeking (offspring approaches mother) and comfort giving (mother approaches or touches offspring), represented by the arrows, or self-comfort (no new behaviour sign of distress of the offspring within 30 s after the threatening event without approach from either mother or offspring, no arrow). Blue represents offspring stopping or not renewing vocal distress within 30 s after the threatening event and orange represents offspring continuing or renewing vocal distress within 30 s after the threatening event suggesting no immediate comforting. The sample size is n = 18 individuals across 78 independent events. Next, we analysed the variation in the duration spent by offspring exploring their environment in both social and non-social contexts per day in relation to attachment type. Our findings indicated that there was no discernible effect of attachment type on the duration spent by offspring exploring their environment in either social or non-social contexts (Supplementary Table 3). Finally, we investigated whether attachment types could predict the latency for offspring to resume exploration after experiencing a UTE or a threat during a play bout. There was no difference between attachment types 1 and 3 in latency time (Supplementary Table 4). The results of these additional analyses are explained in Supplementary Text 1. This differs from what has been observed in humans and captive chimpanzees33,34. Instead, the responses of immature, wild chimpanzees during threatening situations revealed organized attachment patterns comparable to the secure (attachment type 1) and insecure-avoidant (attachment type 2) attachments found in humans5. Offspring who rarely approached their mother during a UTE explored socially from a greater distance than those who sought maternal proximity. However, there was no strong support for a difference in mother–offspring proximity during social exploration between individuals with a secure-like attachment type and those with an insecure resistant-like attachment type (type 3). Additionally, there was no evidence of young chimpanzees continuing vocal distress after receiving comfort, indicating the absence of an insecure-resistant attachment axis. Finally, offspring did not exhibit aggressive, contradictory or abnormal behaviours typically associated with disorganized attachment. Our findings suggest that certain characteristics of organized attachment have a deep evolutionary history. Meanwhile, the lack of disorganized attachment features in wild chimpanzees lends support to the assertions that this phenotype is indeed maladaptive. The results revealed age-dependent responses to threats. As expected, offspring became more independent with age, relying less on their mother and acquiring skills to navigate and respond to potentially threatening situations, such as running away or climbing trees for self-protection (Fig. During weaning (at approximately 4 years old28), offspring were less likely to react to threatening events. We speculate that maternal availability may be limited following the birth of a new offspring, inhibiting approaches from both mother and weaned offspring before the latter has fully developed more independent strategies (for example, climbing up a tree or running away). Across animals, maternal reproductive strategies are finely balanced: mothers gain by reproducing with shorter inter-birth intervals but only if the older offspring survives40,41. Hence, when younger siblings are born, older siblings who show inappropriately low reactivity to threats may still be reaching suitable levels of independence. These findings support the notion that the weaning period, precipitating greater social and nutritional independence, plays a crucial role in ontogeny, being linked with the emergence of complex behaviours such as call combinations42, social grooming and tool use43. The 50 subjects in this study did not show behavioural patterns corresponding to the disorganized attachment type found in humans and in captive chimpanzees33. Children and other primates with disorganized attachment demonstrate aggressive behaviour towards their mother, caregiver and peers, and exhibit abnormal or conflicted, confused or apprehensive behaviour. The Taï chimpanzees observed here did not show any of these behaviours. Given that aggressive or abusive behaviours from mothers towards offspring are considered a common cause associated with disorganized attachment14, we looked at the aggression rate per hour from mothers to their offspring. Events, when the mother showed aggressive behaviours towards her offspring, were very rare (48 aggressions over 3,795 h of observation among 17 of 33 mothers). The mean rate of aggression per mother–offspring dyad was 0.008 per hour for non-contact aggression (maximum rate at 0.10 per hour; arm waving) and 0.003 for contact aggression per hour (maximum rate of 0.03 per hour; hitting). The low rate of contact aggression from mother to offspring in wild chimpanzees is also supported by other studies (Reddy and Sandel45: no contact aggression observed in 29 young males over 1,570 h and Sabbi et al.46: 85 aggressions observed towards 49 immature chimpanzees over at least 4,116 h (maximum 0.02 per hour)). As a comparison, female chimpanzees direct contact aggression towards other individuals 2.3 times more frequently than towards their offspring, and non-contact aggression 2.5 times more frequently towards other individuals than their offspring (extrapolated data from the dataset of Tkaczynski47). Altogether, this suggests that the disorganized attachment type is rare or absent in wild chimpanzees. If it is present at an early age, those infants probably do not survive. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis that the disorganized attachment type is not an adaptive survival strategy in the face of environmental constraints in a wild setting. In contrast, for orphaned chimpanzees in captive settings, behaviours indicative of disorganized attachment have been reported at relatively high rates33,34. Specifically, 41% of chimpanzees receiving responsive care and 72% of those under standard care from keepers exhibited disorganized attachment with the favourite human caregiver shown by sequential or simultaneous displays of contradictory behaviours or misdirected attachment behaviour. Compared with wild settings, captive settings provide an environment in which threats to survival are low, such as no exposure to predators nor out-group lethal aggression, health is managed and food is provisioned to reduce competition. However, psycho-social risk factors may be higher due to historical issues such as some zoo chimpanzees, that are now mothers, may have been rescued from isolated- or peer-housed living in medical facilities. As such, captive chimpanzee social scenarios may show parallels with those of modern human societies, where survival is less dependent on socio-ecological factors and high survival rates probably facilitate greater variation in psycho-social phenomena. Disorganized attachment can result from caregivers displaying frightening behaviours towards children12,49. Specifically, offspring who have experienced sustained/extreme aggressive or neglectful maternal care, are at substantially higher risk of developing extreme psychopathologies in adulthood50. In contrast, the maternal behaviour of chimpanzees observed in our study lacked evidence of the abusive behaviours observed in human contexts. In Taï chimpanzees, extreme rejecting or neglectful maternal behaviour is exceptionally rare. Only two instances of abandonment were observed across 85 cumulative observation years of three communities. In each case, and unusual in chimpanzees, the maternal grandmother was present (Wittig and Crockford, personal observations). In contrast, instances of inadequate maternal care in zoos leading to humans taking over offspring rearing occurred for 8 infants involving 19 mothers across less than 5 years51 and for 7 infants involving 23 mothers across 9 years52. Orphaned captive chimpanzees might develop disorganized attachment since, even with excellent care, they generally lack both a 24 h and permanent attachment figure to offer nurturing and protection and typical early social interactions with a primary caregiver of the same species. Both may explain the high percentage of disorganized chimpanzees in the studies of Van Ijzendoorn and colleagues33 and Clay34. It has been suggested that attachment and maternal nurturing propensity are transmitted across generations (in humans: Van Ijzendoorn and Bakermans-Kranenburg53; in mammals: Rilling and Young54), implying that individuals raised by nurturing mothers are likely to demonstrate nurturing care to their own offspring, as well as conversely. Animal welfare in captivity has become a welcome priority in recent years as understanding of the long-term impact of rearing conditions has improved55. Consequently, mothers born and raised in captivity or adopted from medical facilities a generation (20–30 years) ago might not have received adequate care as offspring, potentially leading to poor mothering skills with a higher likelihood of abandoning their own offspring or demonstrating reduced sensitivity to their needs56,57. We demonstrated that young wild chimpanzees show variation in their reliance on their mother during UTEs, even after controlling for their age. This finding, driven principally by approach behaviour towards mothers, implies that some individuals use their mothers more as a safe haven during a UTE than others. Therefore, like in humans, chimpanzee offspring could be considered to have different organized attachment types. Some individuals did not demonstrate age-appropriate reliance on their mother during UTEs (attachment type 2), fitting well the criteria for insecure-avoidant attachment or excessive reliance on the mother (attachment type 3), similar to the insecure-resistant attachment (Fig. Others showed age-appropriate reliance on their mother (attachment type 1) akin to the secure attachment (Fig. To better understand individual differences and the adaptability of organized attachment, it is now necessary to investigate maternal responsiveness and determine whether the developed attachment is related to the mother's responsiveness. An additional measure to distinguish between secure and insecure-resistant offspring's behavioural reactions examined whether offspring showing distress during exposure to a threat are comforted after seeking comfort from their mother. In humans, children with insecure-resistant attachment persist in displaying distress even when the mother attempts to provide comfort. In our sample, offspring rarely continued or renewed vocal distress after a threatening event (Fig. Rare instances where offspring continued to seek their mother were observed only when the mother did not offer comfort. This observation strongly suggests that in the wild, young chimpanzees are reliably comforted by their mothers if comfort is provided, challenging the notion of the existence of insecure-resistant attachment. The individuals initially considered as insecure resistant in our dataset could be secure offspring overreacting during UTEs (which is a subcategory of the secure attachment). This overreaction could be due to the offspring's temperament, particularly their susceptibility to distress and anxiety, rather than being solely attributed to maternal factors58,59. In 32 out of 78 observed instances, there was no approach between mother and offspring, yet the distress subsided regardless. This behaviour might imply the use of self-comforting mechanisms or growing emotional independence. Furthermore, 14 out of 18 individuals exhibited this behaviour at least once. Notably, these instances often occurred during play bouts, indicating that the initial threat was mild and soon over, thus not requiring further comfort. Furthermore, using the same focal data for analysis to determine the different attachment types (test B1) and incorporating new data from threat occurrences during play bouts, we examined (Supplementary Table 4) whether attachment types predicted the latency time for offspring to explore after a UTE or a threat during a play bout. This analysis revealed no strong differences, supporting the idea that attachment types 1 and 3 might demonstrate no functional difference. The findings presented in Table 3, which model the proximity between mother and offspring during social exploration unrelated to threatening events, support the notion of individual distinctions between offspring exhibiting attachment type 1 (secure-like) and attachment type 2 (insecure avoidant-like). Indeed, offspring with attachment type 2 explored further away from their mother in a social context than offspring with attachment type 1 (Fig. Insecure avoidant-like individuals did not rely on their mother during UTEs, exploring further away from her, consistent with the idea that they did not consider her as a safe base. There was no difference between offspring with attachment type 1 (secure-like) and attachment type 3 (insecure resistant-like), again corroborating the idea that those individuals might all show degrees of ‘secure' attachment. Contrary to our prediction that securely attached offspring (attachment type 1) would explore their environment further away from their mother than insecure-resistant offspring (attachment type 3), the results indicated that attachment type 1 offspring actually explored closer to their mother than attachment type 3 offspring, yet with no substantial differences (no effect at 89%). Overall, these results align with the findings of Van Ijzendoorn and colleagues33, who identified diverse organized attachment types (secure, insecure avoidant and insecure resistant) in captive chimpanzees that resembled those observed in humans. However notably, we did not yield evidence supporting the presence of insecure-resistant attachment in wild chimpanzees, possibly due to our comparatively smaller sample size, that is 18 versus 46 individuals. Given our small sample size for the assessment of chimpanzee attachment types, our sample may not have captured the full diversity of attachment in young chimpanzees. Nevertheless, we showed strong evidence for interindividual variability. Controlling for offspring age posed challenges due to the limited number of individuals, resulting in few subjects with identical ages. Nevertheless, we maintained confidence in the validity of our methodology by controlling for age differences, asserting that attachment types can still be assessed in older offspring within the range of 1.5–6 years. A strength of our approach was having repeated observations in natural situations across time, which probably increases the capacity to distinguish variation in attachment. This contrasts with the SSP in humans, which is typically conducted only once per child, out of their natural environment, in a safe place and notably only in certain cultures5,6. Additionally, mother-initiated approaches could limit direct comparability to human studies, where mothers are told to not react, but this is unavoidable in a naturalistic setting where mothers behave freely. Additionally, behaviour not only in threatening contexts but also in daily social life, such as mother–offspring distance, was predictable based on reactions to threatening events in wild immature chimpanzees, further highlighting parallels to organized attachment in humans. Future research is needed to explore how attachment type relates to social behaviour across the lifespan. Finally, one might question whether organized attachment in humans is comparable to that observed in chimpanzees. In humans, organized attachment is defined by a child's use of a consistent and coherent strategy to seek comfort and support from their primary caregiver when distressed60. Our findings suggest that wild immature chimpanzees exhibit behavioural strategies similar to those seen in human infants, such as approaching or avoiding their mother when facing potential threats, which is a situation analogous to the SSP experiments. This convergence in behavioural patterns, despite differences in the nature of the stimuli (experimental versus naturally occurring), suggests a shared foundation in attachment strategies between chimpanzees and human infants. Additionally, behaviour not only in threatening contexts but also in daily social life, such as mother–offspring distance, was predictable based on reactions to threatening events in wild immature chimpanzees, further highlighting parallels to organized attachment in humans. Future research is needed to explore how attachment type relates to social behaviour across the lifespan. By examining the hugely influential psychological concept of attachment theory within an evolutionary framework, we were able to identify distinct mother–offspring attachment types in young wild western chimpanzees, similar to the secure and insecure-avoidant types found in humans, but no evidence of disorganized attachment. While this does not rule out the occurrence of disorganized attachment in wild chimpanzees, it suggests that if it occurs, it does so at much lower rates than is found in humans or peer-raised captive chimpanzees. Thus, these findings support the hypothesis that disorganized attachment may not be adaptive for offspring survival. Future research should investigate the impact of attachment types on offspring fitness, and the relation between maternal care and attachment types in other mammals. Our findings provide a crucial step towards understanding how adaptive attachment strategies emerge across species, as well as the key role attachment may play in social evolution. Shared attachment strategies across species may indicate a common evolutionary heritage, underscoring the ancient origins of sociality in primates. However, the relatively high prevalence of disorganized attachment in both human and captive chimpanzee populations is consistent with the hypothesis that rearing environments contribute substantially to its manifestation and persistence in certain contexts. This contrast between the lack of disorganized attachment in the wild setting of our study and the relatively high prevalence of disorganized attachment in captive environments indicates a need for further research to understand the underlying causal factors (for example, genetic influence and parental state of mind)61. Further comparative research in natural environments is beneficial for understanding mother–offspring attachment dynamics, which are crucial for primate social development and for other long-lived mammals with protracted development. Observing these dynamics in natural settings reveals how ecological pressures and social contexts shape attachment behaviours, offering insights that controlled environments often overlook. Our study was purely observational and non-invasive. Observers followed the strict hygiene protocol of the Taï Chimpanzee Project, adopted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as the best practice guideline for wild ape studies62. Observers quarantined for 5 days before following the chimpanzees. In the forest, observers wore face masks and kept a minimum distance of 7 m between themselves and the chimpanzees, to avoid disease transmission from humans to chimpanzees and to avoid disturbing the natural behaviour of the observed individuals. and research assistants collected behavioural data on three wild Western chimpanzee (P. t. verus) communities (North, South and East groups), habituated to human observers and located in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire63. Behavioural focal sampling followed a standardized methodology, with two focal individuals observed daily for about 6 h each from approximately 6:30 to 12:30 and 12:30 to 18:30 (ref. Subgroup composition and changes in behaviour were also continuously noted. Reliability of the coded behaviours and individual identities was high across datasets between coders (Cohen's Kappa tests: ĸ = 0.72, 0.81, 0.70, 0.78, 0.80 and 0.64)65. Full ethogram details are available in the supporting information66,67 (Supplementary Table 1). To correspond with the SSP68, which involves a potential threat to the infant, we chose naturally occurring situations of undirected aggressions, or aggressions and threats not directed towards the offspring (excluding the presence of predators) for analysis (UTEs). Additionally, we included the following contexts of UTEs that typically alert the group: chimpanzee vocalizations outside of the group, alarm calls of other species and gunshots. 1), we added threats directed at the offspring that more regularly triggered vocal distress, including threats during play bouts and aggressions directed towards the offspring (DTEs). Behavioural reactions of both the mother and offspring were recorded during these potentially threatening situations (immediately, that is, within approximately 2 s). We performed the following analyses using R Studio (R version 4.2.2)70 and Spyder Python (version 3.9)71. We first tested the existence of disorganized attachment by assessing whether distress during a UTE or DTE predicted approach behaviour between mother and offspring (test A1) and analysing aggression rates between mother and offspring (test A2). We then tested the existence of distinct organized attachment types by analysing offspring reactions to UTEs (controlling for age and other variables; test B1a in Supplementary Fig. 1), applying dimension reduction and cluster analysis to detect patterns (test B1b in Supplementary Fig. Furthermore, we examined differences in the mean distance between mother and offspring during social exploration excluding threatening events (test B2) and evaluated the existence of insecure-resistant attachment by assessing the effectiveness of maternal comfort after a UTE or DTE (test B3). If wild immature chimpanzees have a disorganized attachment type, we predicted that vocal distress would not result in comfort seeking with their mother. We used all threatening events (UTEs and DTEs) and modelled whether the presence of offspring distress (whimpering and screaming) would cause offspring and mother to reduce their distance (seeking or offering comfort, respectively) using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a Bernoulli error distribution. The control variables are explained in Supplementary Text 1. Each UTE or DTE constituted a data point, totalling 567 observations across 30 individuals (ages 0–10 years). Disorganized attachment can be identified in situations where the offspring exhibits fear towards the caregiver. If an offspring consistently displays aggression towards their mother in a fearful context, it suggests a disorganized attachment, particularly if the mother exhibits aggressive behaviour at a higher rate than other mothers towards their offspring. Therefore, to identify whether some individuals presented disorganized attachment, we investigated how often there was aggression observed between mother and offspring. We counted the number of occurrences of both contact and non-contact aggressions between mother and offspring in 50 mother–offspring dyads (ages 0–10 years). Contact aggressions were described as hitting, pushing away, and pulling an individual. Non-contact aggressions were described as hunching, doing an arm wave, charging or chasing an individual (see ethogram in Supplementary Table 2). To investigate the existence of different types of attachment in immature chimpanzees, we explored the variability between individuals in behavioural reactions during threatening events. Given that our dataset contained individuals from 0 to 10 years old and that we expected immature wild chimpanzees to rely less on their mothers with age, we first ran a model (model 2) controlled for age and other variables. We then used dimension reduction approaches and cluster analysis to see whether within and between individual correlations in these behavioural responses existed. We expected offspring to react differently to a threat depending on age, with younger individuals relying more on their mothers. Therefore, to control for the variation of age across individuals, we used Bayesian models with a Bernoulli error distribution. Each UTE constituted a data point, totalling 550 observations across 30 individuals of data between 2016 and 2023 (ages 0–10 years), and the response variable was again a binary value of the occurrence of the behavioural reaction during an event. Individuals could show multiple reactions during the same UTE. We ran a separate Bayesian GLMM for each of the nine behaviours (approaching the mother, looking towards the mother, whimpering, screaming, running away from the threat, climbing up a tree, attacking, approaching another individual or not reacting). 2), we ran a similar model with all the behavioural reactions into a matrix (model 2). The control variables are explained in Supplementary Text 1. The random intercepts for individuals were extracted, representing deviations from the population-level intercept (average behavioural response), accounting for age and other fixed factors. This captured individual variability not explained by the fixed effects. Positive values meant that individuals showed the given behaviour more than expected for their age and other fixed effects, and less than expected for negative values. Owing to older offspring (>6 years old) exhibiting fewer mother-dependent behaviours such as approaching and looking towards the mother and displaying more independent behaviours such as climbing up a tree and running away from threats (Fig. 2), we excluded them from subsequent analyses. Young individuals (<1.5 years old) were omitted from further analysis, similar to the practice of excluding very young human infants in the SSP owing to their consistent proximity to their mother, which posed challenges in assessing variations in mother-directed behaviours. We investigated whether individuals exhibited consistent behavioural patterns regardless of their age and the other control variables. We used dimension reduction techniques (UMAP and PCA) and a spectral cluster analysis. We aimed to discern whether individuals aged between 1.5 and 6 years displayed distinct behavioural reactions across 309 UTEs and could be categorized into clusters. We applied these techniques to the deviation estimates extracted from model 2 on 18 individuals (ages 1.5–6 years). More details about these methods are described in Supplementary Text 1. To investigate whether attachment type predicted mother–offspring proximity during social exploration, we analysed the average distance between mothers and their youngest offspring during social play (excluding the mother as a partner). Attachment type was determined using dimension reduction techniques and cluster analysis previously explained (test B1). We applied a Bayesian GLMM with a Gaussian error distribution for this analysis. Each date of data collection per individual constituted a data point, totalling 260 observations across 18 individuals (ages 1.5–6 years). The mother–offspring distances were categorized and a value corresponding to the mean distance was attributed as follows: contact (value of 0), less than 1 m (value of 0.5), between 1 m and 5 m (value of 3), between 5 m and 10 m (value of 7.5) and more than 10 m (value of 15). The mean distance during social exploration per date per individual was calculated as the sum of every distance multiplied by the time spent at that distance divided by the total observation time of social exploration of that date (sum(value.distance × (duration.distance/duration.total.date))). We used attachment type in interaction with the age of the offspring in months as a test predictor, since we expected that the impact of attachment type on mother–offspring proximity during social exploration would differ across different stages of offspring development. Justifications for including the control variables are given in Supplementary Text 1. Additionally, we modelled the percentage of time spent by the offspring exploring their environment in non-social (model 4) and social contexts (model 5) with the attachment type (model explanation in Supplementary Text 1 and results in Supplementary Table 3). To disentangle secure and insecure-resistant attachments, we investigated whether offspring continued being distressed even after their mother had comforted them. We took all the UTEs and frightening events during play bouts that elicited offspring whimpering or screaming and plotted whether they continued or renewed vocal distress (whimpering or screaming) after the distance between mother and offspring was reduced between the moment of the threat and until 30 s after (Fig. There were 78 observations across 18 individuals (ages 1.5–6 years). Additionally, we performed a survival analysis (model 6) to investigate the existence of insecure-resistant attachment by looking at the latency time between a threatening event and exploratory behaviour (Supplementary Text 1 and Supplementary Table 4). On the basis of the human literature, we hypothesized that insecure-resistant offspring would take longer to explore their environment after a threat compared with secure and insecure-avoidant offspring. We ran all models in R 4.2.2 (ref. All continuous values were scaled to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. We tested for collinearity issues by quantifying variance inflation factors for our predictor variables using the function ‘vif' from the package ‘car'73. We ran 2,000 iterations (1,000 for ‘warm-up') on 12 chains. Sampling diagnostics (R-hat of 1 for all predictors) and trace plots confirmed chain convergence for all models. Effective sample sizes (all >3,800) confirmed no issues with autocorrelation of sampling for all models. All variance inflation factors were below 5 confirming non-collinearity between variables. All posterior predictive checks for each model were satisfactory (Supplementary Figs.

Nature Reviews Genetics (2025)Cite this article Metrics details Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder — which are the most common adult disorders requiring psychiatric care — contribute substantially to premature mortality and morbidity globally. Treatments for these disorders are suboptimal, there are no diagnostic pathologies or biomarkers and their pathophysiologies are poorly understood. Novel therapeutic and diagnostic approaches are thus badly needed. Given the high heritability of psychiatric disorders, psychiatry has potentially much to gain from the application of genomics to identify molecular risk mechanisms and to improve diagnosis. Recent large-scale, genome-wide association studies and sequencing studies, together with advances in functional genomics, have begun to illuminate the genetic architectures of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder and to identify potential biological mechanisms. Genomic findings also point to the aetiological relationships between different diagnoses and to the relationships between adult psychiatric disorders and childhood neurodevelopmental conditions.

They combine sets of variants within a gene to produce a single burden score that is then tested for association. Variants that are present in the population at frequencies of 1% or more. They include single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which can be assayed in parallel across the genome in genome-wide association studies. Variants for which the number of copies of a specific segment of DNA varies in the population. These structural differences between individuals may have arisen as a result of duplications, deletions or other changes. A fixed, false belief that is not amenable to change despite conflicting evidence. A mental state that involves low mood and decreased activity. An estimate of the average similarity of causal allelic effects on two traits. This usually refers to the genome-wide average, although it can be specified to be locus wide or chromosome wide. A high degree of genetic correlation is usually indicative of pleiotropy. A perception in the absence of an external stimulus that has a compelling sense of reality. A less severe form of mania that is not accompanied by marked functional impairments (for example, to occupation or personal relationships). Genes with near-complete depletion of protein-truncating variants in population studies, suggesting that there is strong direct selection against such variants. A mental state that involves elevated mood, which can be euphoric or irritable, and increased activity. Hallucinations or delusions that are not aligned with the person's current mood state. Describes the phenomenon whereby a variant or gene influences more than one phenotype. The terms ‘direct', ‘horizontal' and ‘biological' pleiotropy imply that the effects on the phenotypes are independent. The terms ‘mediated', ‘vertical' and ‘indirect' pleiotropy imply that the effects on one phenotype are mediated through the other; for example, alleles that influence smoking behaviour are likely to have pleiotropic effects on all traits for which smoking is a risk factor. Summarizes the estimated effect of many genetic variants on an individual's phenotype. It is typically calculated as a weighted sum of trait-associated alleles. Variants that are predicted to shorten the coding sequence of a gene and which may result in reduced expression of that gene and its protein owing to nonsense-mediated decay. They include nonsense, frameshift and essential splice site variants. Symptoms, particularly delusions and hallucinations, that involve difficulty in determining what is real from what is not. Variants in the coding sequence of a gene that are present in less than 1% of the population. They can be detected by genome-wide sequencing studies.

OpenAI is best known for ChatGPT — the free-to-use, large language model-based chatbot that became a household name after its debut in 2022. The firm, in San Francisco, California, has since released a string of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including ‘reasoning' models that use step-by-step ‘thought' processes to specialize in logical tasks. These tools have helped researchers to polish prose, write code, review the literature and even generate hypotheses. But, like other technology rivals, OpenAI has faced criticisms over the energy demands of its models and the way in which data are exploited for model training. And unlike some firms, OpenAI has almost exclusively released proprietary models that researchers can use, but can't build on. Now, he leads the development of the company's most advanced AI systems, which are designed to tackle complex tasks in science, mathematics and coding. Nature spoke to Pachocki about whether AI can generate original science, artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the firm's upcoming open-weight model. Today you can talk to a model, but it's only an assistant that needs constant guidance. I expect this will be the primary thing that changes. We already see that something like OpenAI's Deep Research [a tool that can synthesize reams of information] is capable of working unsupervised for 10 or 20 minutes and producing something useful. But the amount of compute that's going into solving these queries is tiny. If you have open research problems it is worth spending much more compute on that. I expect we will have AIs that actually are capable of novel research. We'll see a lot of progress, for example, on autonomous software engineering and the autonomous design of hardware components, and similar applications in other disciplines. The original ChatGPT releases involved an unsupervised pre-training stage, where the model just ingests a massive amount of data and builds a sort of ‘world model'. One way you can view this latest progress on reasoning models is that it really increases the emphasis on the reinforcement-learning phase, so that we're not only extracting something but also enabling the model to find its own way of thinking. One thing that we should be clear about is that the way the models work is different from how a human brain works.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's called a “Blood Cave,” what did you expect them to find? Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Guatemala's Cueva de Sangre, translated as “blood cave,” isn't just a clever name. But new research presented at the annual Society for American Archaeology meeting, titled “Black as Night, Dark as Death,” highlighted the significance of this discovery, beyond the initial brutality on display. “Human skeletal remains deposited in caves, cenotes, chultuns, and other natural and artificial subterranean chambers provide some of the best contexts to investigate ritual behavior among ancient Mesoamericans,” according to Michele Bleuze, bioarcheologist at California State University, Los Angeles. Deep within the Guatemalan cave—reached via a small opening with a passageway that drops toward a pool of water—only accessible during the dry season, Bleuze said the injuries enacted upon the more than 100 adult and juvenile human bone fragments show that the remains were part of a ritual to please a Maya rain god. “The emerging pattern that we're seeing is that there are body parts and not bodies,” Bleuze told Live Science. Getting from traumatic injury to rain god ritual, though, was more than just conjecture. “Right now, our focus is who are these people deposited here,” Bleuze said, “because they're treated completely differently than the majority of the population.” “It is not surprising,” Bleuze wrote, “that bioarcheologists encounter human remains that extend our understanding of the life and death of ancient Mesoamericans beyond what is provided in traditional mortuary contexts.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both the hoard at Sutton Hoo (found in 1939) and the Staffordshire Hoard (found in 2009) contained thousands of gold and silver metalworks from one Britain's most enigmatic peoples—the Anglo-Saxons, who ruled Britain from around 450 A.D. until the Normans came knocking in 1066—and offered unprecedented glimpses into their fascinating culture. Now, a new discovery by metal detectorists in southwest England adds to that incredible, blinged-out history. Toward the end of a long day of metal detecting on January 8, 2025, Gould and Phillips—as part of the local Ninth Region Metal Detecting Group—came across a gold band with inlaid garnets, which was later identified as an Anglo-Saxon ring. While continuing his search nearby, Phillips came across a stunning golden raven head with an inlaid eye of garnet. Odin's ravens, named Huginn and Muninn, serve the god by bringing him information from Midgard (a.k.a. In a video posted to YouTube, Phillips details the find, stating that the head is made of solid gold and weighs roughly two ounces. However, seeing as ravens are closely associated with Odin, that could be by design. “People say Woden gave up an eye for knowledge and all of that, I don't know if that has anything to do with it.” Phillips and Gould are part of a growing detectorist movement in the U.K.—spurred on by both increased interest during the pandemic and vast improvements in metal detector technology—and these detectors have made some truly stunning discoveries. In December of 2021, for example, a detectorist outside Melsonby, North Yorkshire discovered one of the largest Iron Age hoards in history, and earlier this year, a detectorist found a bunch of Roman silver coins in Barton Bendish, Norfolk. While the act of metal detecting brings about its own benefits—getting out into nature and getting some exercise being positive side effects—walking earth that possesses such vast amount of treasures across millennia can certainly be quite the motivator.

Nature Machine Intelligence (2025)Cite this article A preprint version of the article is available at arXiv. Drug development is a critical but notoriously resource- and time-consuming process. Traditional methods, such as high-throughput screening, rely on opportunistic trial and error and cannot ensure optimal precision design. To overcome these challenges, generative artificial intelligence methods have emerged to directly design molecules with desired properties. Here we develop a generative artificial intelligence method DiffSMol for drug discovery that generates 3D small binding molecules based on known ligand shapes. DiffSMol encapsulates ligand shape details within pretrained, expressive shape embeddings and generates binding molecules through a diffusion model. DiffSMol further modifies the generated 3D structures iteratively using shape guidance to better resemble ligand shapes, and protein pocket guidance to optimize binding affinities. We show that DiffSMol outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. When generating binding molecules resembling ligand shapes, DiffSMol with shape guidance achieves a success rate 61.4%, substantially outperforming the best baseline (11.2%), meanwhile producing molecules with de novo graph structures. DiffSMol with pocket guidance also outperforms the best baseline in binding affinities by 13.2%, and even by 17.7% when combined with shape guidance. Case studies for two critical drug targets demonstrate very favourable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of generated molecules, highlighting the potential of DiffSMol in developing promising drug candidates.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of social rank on drug-seeking behavior remain unclear. Here we found that dominant male rodents (based on the tube test) had denser mesocortical dopaminergic projections and were more resistant to methamphetamine (METH)-seeking, whereas subordinates had heightened dopaminergic function in the mesolimbic pathway and were more vulnerable to METH seeking. Optogenetic activation of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway promoted winning and suppressed METH seeking in subordinates, whereas lesions of the mesocortical pathway increased METH seeking in dominants. Elevation of social rank with forced win training in subordinates led to remodeling of the dopaminergic system and prevented METH-seeking behavior. In females, however, both ranks were susceptible to METH seeking, with mesocorticolimbic pathways comparable to those in subordinate males. These results provide a framework for understanding the neural basis of the impact of social status on drug-seeking.
