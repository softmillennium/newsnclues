Needham analyst John Todaro reiterated Coinbase Global with a Buy and lowered the price target from $330 to $270. Also Read: Robinhood Stock Falls After Analysts Cite Weak Crypto Volumes And Market Headwinds In Q2 Outlook Despite multiple attempts to anticipate trading weakness, transaction revenue still missed the analyst's below consensus estimate ($1.26 billion versus his $1.30 billion) as high-yielding Consumer volumes were in line, but take rates declined more than expected in both Consumer and Institutional. On a positive note, MTUs of 9.7 million exceeded expectations (consensus 9.2 million), showing strength in platform engagement even as spot trading volumes declined sequentially. In Brendler's recent initiation, expanding opportunities outside the core trading business represented a key component of his thesis, as these largely recurring revenue streams should boost the multiple. This quarter, the analyst saw trading weakness more than offset by strength in Subscription and Services Revenue as Stablecoins were even better than anticipated and Other beat due to growth in premium offerings (Prime). The biggest positive surprise versus Brendler's estimates was in Blockchain revenue, as despite a 35+ % decline in token prices, staking revenue only fell 8.5% sequentially versus the analyst's -20% estimate. The deal is perfectly timed as it cements Coinbase Global's leadership in the high-growth derivatives market and turbocharges its international exchange. Even better, Deribit's $1 trillion+ in trading volumes are all outside the U.S., and with domestic regulatory clarity coming soon, Brendler noted the synergies could be substantial. Combined with a lower-than-expected price tag of $2.9 billion, this is one of the most compelling acquisitions the analyst noted in a long time. Speculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500. Needham: Coinbase Global reported a narrow top-line Street miss but modestly beat analyst Todaro's estimates. Positive call-outs in the quarter were around USDC and the recently announced Deribit acquisition, which is expected to close by year-end 2025. The analyst noted the offering, which will be primarily geared for international markets, allows Coinbase Global to become a major player in derivatives and internationally. Additionally, Coinbase Global's international exchange launched 39 new perpetual contracts and expanded the asset collateral type to 8 assets from 3. Coinbase Global's volume mix has recently been more Bitcoin and Ethereum than alt-coins, suggesting a greater shift towards institutional volume than retail for the second quarter. This negatively affects revenues as Coinbase Global has a significantly higher take rate on retail than institutional. The good news is crypto asset prices recently inflected with Bitcoin rising back over $100k and a strong performance among alt-coins. Historically, crypto asset prices find a bottom before volumes do, which suggests that with prices already inflecting, volumes should start seeing a bottom in the next one to two months. COIN Price Action: Coinbase stock is up 5.74% to $210.76 at publication on Monday. Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On 22 May 2010, programmer and cryptocurrency enthusiast Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins in Florida, which was then the equivalent of around $41 dollars. This number is tiny when compared to the roughly two billion daily transactions made by credit card around the world but there are indications that suggest paying for a coffee using Ethereum could soon be as normal as paying with contactless. Outside of France, cryptocurrency is venturing beyond speculative trading and into everyday transactions. While organisations eagerly roll out trials of cryptocurrencies, the uptake by consumers remains uncertain. Sacha Briand, board member of Tisséo and deputy mayor of Toulouse, who is responsible for overseeing finance and public assets, tells National Technology News that cryptocurrency is used to make about 10 purchases through the app each week. As Toulouse is a university town with a large young population familiar with cryptocurrencies, Briand expects this number to rise in September when students return to study and purchase their annual season tickets. Toulouse is growing, recently overtaking Lyon to become France's third largest city, and Briand says Tisséo is modernising its payment systems to coincide with the opening of a third metro line in 2028. Tisséo spent around €50,000 in integration fees and said it earns no commission from the transactions. Lysi connects the customers paying in crypto, with Tisséo explaining that its agents do not handle crypto on a daily basis but are trained to deal with refund requests and the process is similar to that of traditional credit cards. “Honestly, with 18 per cent holding crypto, I would expect maybe two to three per cent to use it immediately for something like Tisséo's travel payments,” says Thomas Franklin, chief executive of crypto FinTech firm Swapped. Franklin added that the purchase of transport tickets is a good place to start using cryptocurrency. “Transit systems tokenise access to physical resources without transferring ownership,” she says. “Riders want quick transactions, operators need efficiency, and price points are predictable.” “Physical infrastructure involves coordination between multiple stakeholders—regulators, citizens, suppliers—who might not be crypto users,” she adds. Beyond the transport sector, countries are starting to slowly embrace crypto payments. The new model will enable Binance Pay users to pay for nearly every part of their Bhutan journey using supported cryptocurrencies, including airline tickets, tourist visas and Sustainable Development Fees (SDF), hotel bookings, tour guides, monument entry fees, and local shopping, which can all be settled through static and dynamic QR code payments. Papuna Lezhava, chief executive of crypto payments firm Keepz, sees this as a broader trend. “In Georgia, people can pay taxes and buy apartments with crypto,” he says. “We're seeing faster adoption in countries where regulation and infrastructure support it.” Due to fluctuations in exchange rates and the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, many users have seen crypto as an investment asset rather than a form of money which can be exchanged for goods and services, leaving cryptocurrencies languishing in digital wallets. “Most crypto users still see Bitcoin and Ethereum as investment vehicles,” says Franklin. However, stablecoins like USDC, pegged to fiat currencies, are changing the equation.” Franklin continues: “People will spend stablecoins or Layer-2 tokens way before they part with their Bitcoin. He says the holy grail is “invisible” conversion, which allows users can pay in cryptocurrency without manual calculations or delays. “Without middleware that handles real-time conversion and ledger entries, it becomes a reconciliation nightmare.” The volatility of cryptocurrencies is a huge concern for merchants and customers. “Many now offer real-time conversion from crypto to local currency,” says Lezhava. “That way, merchants get paid what they expect, and customers can use digital assets confidently.” Along with exchange rate fluctuations, merchants also have to navigate chargebacks, settlement times, and regulatory classification issues. “The UK has strong blockchain innovation, but regulatory bottlenecks slow down crypto adoption,” Franklin says. While the Bank of England explores a digital pound and UK FinTech firms urge customers to adopt innovations like Open Banking, there seems to be a lack of mass movement towards crypto payments in retail or public services. Franklin thinks that with Brexit-era caution and regulatory conservatism still looming, widespread adoption may be years away. “Some US cities are crypto havens, others treat it like radioactive waste,” Franklin says. “Recent headlines involving Donald Trump's meme coin might have boosted crypto visibility, but experts agree that it's not spurring serious payments adoption.” Franklin says parts of the UAE are leading because they treat crypto payments like an infrastructure play, not a PR stunt. “Crypto in physical spaces requires buy-in from people who don't even hold the token.” “We believe that cryptocurrencies are set to grow very rapidly, so this payment tool is proof of our desire to be in step with a city of innovation and development.” Cryptocurrency may have started as an alternative to traditional finance and investment vehicles, but it could be evolving into something more day-to-day. However, it seems that although there are use cases demonstrating how cryptocurrencies could be embedded into daily life, we are still a long way away from seeing this come to fruition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patel Real Estate Holdings (PREH) has launched a $100 million tokenization fund on the Chintai blockchain, aiming to give accredited investors access to institutional-grade real estate opportunities. The fund is part of a broader $750 million investment vehicle co-developed by PREH and several institutional firms, including Carlyle, DRA Advisors, Walton Street Capital, RPM and KKR. According to PREH, the tokenization structure helps alleviate many transparency and liquidity constraints investors typically face in private market placements. Since its inception, PREH has completed more than $500 million in real estate transactions. Chintai is a tokenization-focused layer-1 blockchain that also powers the R3 Sustainability Fund for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. Its native token, CHEX, is currently valued at $0.24, with a total market capitalization of $244 million, according to CoinMarketCap. "We chose Chintai because they offer a fully regulated, institutional-grade platform purpose-built for tokenizing real-world assets,” PREH's president, Tejas Patel, told Cointelegraph in a written statement, adding: Tokenizing real estate has long been seen as a way to modernize property investment, but until recently, real-world examples were rare. By early 2025, real estate tokenization had gained traction across North America and the United Arab Emirates, while efforts are underway in Europe to establish regulatory frameworks that support its growth. The growth of liquid secondary markets for fractional real estate could significantly strengthen that advantage. Efforts are also underway to tokenize commercial real estate, with Blocksquare and Vera Capital recently partnering to offer fractional ownership of more than $1 billion worth of properties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pectra, the biggest code change to Ethereum since the Merge in 2022, introduced key changes aimed at making staking easier for institutions, improving wallet accessibility, and boosting transaction efficiency. Developers have already begun planning for Fusaka, the network's next upgrade, and have thus far agreed to include an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) called "PeerDAS" that could help the network support larger "blobs" of transaction data. Blobs, introduced during the Dencun upgrade, are dedicated spaces for large chunks of data related to transactions. They are stored off-chain, which reduces congestion on the Ethereum blockchain and lowers gas fees. In theory, PeerDAS could reduce layer-2 transaction costs and benefit institutions operating validators on the Ethereum blockchain. “PeerDAS is super important since we want to help layer-2s scale,” said Parithosh Jayanti, a devops engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, to CoinDesk over Telegram. “PeerDAS allows us to bump the blob limit significantly." Fusaka is scheduled to go live at the end of 2025 and will eventually include a bundle of additional upgrades beyond PeerDAS. However, Ethereum developers are notorious for delaying their upgrades. Ethereum developers have been criticized over the past year for not implementing protocol changes quickly enough.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They ultimately decided against it due to concerns about the risk involved. The idea was simple: Put a massive chunk of their balance sheet into Bitcoin. But, despite some serious internal discussions, Coinbase chose not to take that risk. CEO Brian Armstrong admitted that there were times over the years when they seriously considered it. “There were definitely moments over the last 12 years where we thought, man, should we put 80% of our balance sheet into crypto — into Bitcoin specifically?” he told Bloomberg in a May 9 video call. Armstrong explained why Coinbase stepped back from the aggressive Bitcoin buy-in. “We made a conscious choice about risk,” he said. Coinbase also didn't want to find itself competing with its own customers. By not committing a significant chunk of its assets into Bitcoin, Coinbase preserved its role as a trusted intermediary rather than an investment competitor in the market. While Coinbase chose not to go all-in on Bitcoin, it still holds a considerable amount. The exchange owns 9,480 BTC, worth roughly $988 million at current prices. In fact, Coinbase continues to build its Bitcoin reserves. So while Coinbase isn't following the path laid out by Saylor, it's certainly not ignoring Bitcoin's potential. Coinbase's stock currently holds a Moderate Buy rating from 22 analysts. Of these, 11 analysts have given it a Buy rating, 10 analysts have rated it as Hold, and just one analyst has issued a Sell rating. This consensus shows that, despite some skepticism, a majority of analysts remain optimistic about Coinbase's future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking on eToro's “Conversations with Leaders” podcast on May 9, the Cardano co-founder proposed privacy-preserving stablecoins as a new frontier for the crypto industry. “Maybe people don't want to have a stablecoin where every time they buy something it's forever tracked by everyone everywhere,” Hoskinson said. While being privately issued tokens, stablecoin transactions can be tracked on the public blockchains where they are deployed, like Ethereum and Solana. Cardano also has stablecoins deployed on its blockchain with a total market size of $31.5 million. The proposal comes as privacy coins face an existential threat. Privacy has been a core crypto ideal for almost two decades, but that hasn't prevented privacy-enabling cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash from getting delisted and banned from exchanges due to concerns over them being used by criminals. The European Union is even set to ban exchanges and custodians from dealing in privacy cryptocurrencies from July 2027. Still, Hoskinson says there's a way to offer privacy without sacrificing compliance. For instance, the stablecoin could have selective disclosure to provide the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism funding provisions regulators want, he says. Privacy coin projects like Firo and Zcash have tried to modify their protocols to provide some form of selective disclosure. They've done so by creating “whitelisted addresses” for users that exchanges can verify for transactions while still allowing users to maintain shielded transaction capabilities. Regulators haven't been swayed by those moves, and in the absence of support by major exchanges, liquidity for those tokens has declined. With major markets like the US and Europe moving towards some form of regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, even in their current vanilla form, are under the microscope.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto whales are aggressively buying into five altcoins following the recent US-China trade deal, with notable spikes in accumulation across SEND, GOAT, MEW, WLD, and PLUME. Sendcoin surged 49% in 24 hours as whale holdings jumped over 35%, while GOAT saw a 197% weekly gain alongside a 12.48% increase in large-holder positions. The sharp rally comes amid strong interest from crypto whales, who have been steadily accumulating the token over recent days. This accumulation has pushed SEND's fully diluted valuation (FDV) close to $18 million, signaling growing confidence in coin. GOAT, once one of the most popular tokens in the Solana ecosystem, had been in a deep correction throughout 2025, dropping 58% year-to-date. However, sentiment is starting to shift as GOAT has surged nearly 197% over the past seven days, making it the second-best performing Solana token with a market cap above $200 million. Whale activity is also picking up, with large holders increasing their positions by 12.48% since May 9. Their total holdings rose from 116.18 million to 131.09 million GOAT tokens, suggesting renewed confidence in the project's potential as momentum returns. MEW has gained strong momentum over the past week, climbing 52% and pushing its market cap to $368 million. The rally comes amid a notable uptick in whale accumulation, with large holders increasing their MEW positions by 12.67% in just a few hours—rising from 2.47 billion to 2.8 billion tokens. Smart money activity is also heating up for the meme coin. Although overall accumulation slowed slightly in the last few hours, total holdings remain up, and one smart wallet alone bought approximately $378,000 worth of MEW in the past 24 hours—highlighting continued interest from informed investors. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's Worldcoin is back among the top-performing AI tokens, climbing 41% over the past week and reaching a market cap of $1.8 billion. The surge comes despite recent legal challenges, including a court ruling in Kenya that ordered the deletion of biometric data and a suspension of operations in Indonesia over regulatory violations. PLUME has emerged as one of the most talked-about RWA tokens in recent weeks, gaining 26% over the past 30 days. Its market cap is now nearing $400 million, reflecting growing interest in real-world asset narratives. Analysts predict it will be one of the most interesting crypto narratives for VCs in 2025 Q2. Whale accumulation has picked up sharply, with holdings jumping 42% in just 24 hours, from 970,000 to 1.38 million PLUME.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wall Street staged a solid comeback after a sharp decline in early April triggered by President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement. The S&P 500 has rallied more than 18% from the April 7 low, primarily driven by rising hopes of a U.S. trade deal with major partners. Solid corporate earnings from leading tech players have also led to renewed optimism in the stock market. Strong quarterly earnings reports from software giant Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) spread strong optimism not only in the tech sector but the entire market. The dual earnings outperformance underscores that strong demand for AI is helping both companies navigate tariff-driven economic uncertainty. However, Apple warned of a $900 million tariff headwind in the ongoing quarter, while Amazon also issued a cautious outlook due to uncertain consumer demand in the face of shifting tariff policies. Per the Zacks Earnings Trends report, second-quarter earnings estimates for the tech sector appear to have reversed course over the last two weeks, with estimates starting to go back up after steadily coming down earlier. Though the AI trade has cooled off significantly this year, its adoption will again provide a lift to tech stocks. Tech companies have poured billions into data centers and AI chips to support the growth of AI models (read: Why Big Tech ETFs Still Remain Great Bets). The rapid adoption of cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, machine learning, digital communication, blockchain and 5G technology will continue to fuel a rally. If these were not enough, the technology sector has a solid Zacks Sector Rank, being in the top 50%. After a massive decline this year, the sector has become attractively valued with a P/E of 20.89% compared with 18.33% for the broad market index.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Next Technology Holding (NXTT) took off for a second straight session Monday after the software services provider and bitcoin buyer reported its holdings of the cryptocurrency jumped. Next Technology reported in a regulatory filing last week that it held 5,833 bitcoin, 5,000 of which it bought since the end of last year. It said the value of its bitcoin portfolio as of March 31 was $481.7 million, while it paid $183.1 million to purchase them. The company noted that it sees its bitcoin investment "as long-term holdings" and expects to continue acquiring them. The news sent Next Technology shares soaring 661% on Friday, and another 47% Monday morning to $3.45. Today's move lifted the stock from negative to positive territory for 2025. Another firm seeing its shares fly higher because of bitcoin-related news is healthcare provider Kindly MD (KDLY), whose stock is soaring 380% Monday to $18.99 after it announced a merger with bitcoin-native holding company Nakamoto Holdings in order to start a bitcoin treasury strategy. Nakamoto was founded by David Bailey, a key cryptocurrency advisor to President Donald Trump. UPDATE—This story has been updated with the latest share price information. “David Bailey and Bitcoin-Native Holding Company Nakamoto Announce Merger with KindlyMD® to Establish Bitcoin Treasury.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital assets, especially stablecoin payments, are becoming essential tools for global trade and finance as businesses seek faster, more reliable alternatives to traditional banking rails amid geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Currency.com is positioning itself as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets, targeting underserved high-net-worth individuals with personalized services and aiming to build a comprehensive financial ecosystem driven by AI and future-proof technology. As global trade reels from ongoing disruptions, businesses and institutions are being forced to reimagine how value moves across borders. Advances that were formerly spear-tip, such as instant payments and tokenized assets, are no longer fringe innovations. Nowhere is this truer than with stablecoin payments. But will the reality of digital asset innovation ever be able to match its long-standing hype? “Innovation must solve a problem, not just be a whiz-bang technology,” Karen Webster, CEO of PYMNTS and an expert in payments innovation and the connected economy, said in a discussion with Konstantin Anissimov, newly appointed CEO at Currency.com. Webster's words set the tone for a conversation that veered beyond typical FinTech rhetoric and into the foundational strategies needed to make decentralized finance both scalable and secure. “There's been a big shift in terms of adoption of stablecoin payments that is being driven by uncertainty in geopolitics,” Anissimov said. “I am personally seeing a big increase of small to medium enterprises utilizing stablecoin payments because banking rails are harder and harder to use.” “If the payment gets there quicker, faster, in a more definitive way, then a lot of these businesses are limited less in their working capital requirements,” Anissimov said. The appeal of digital assets such as stablecoin payments is simple in theory. Traditional financial rails are slow, opaque and costly. By contrast, blockchain-based platforms offer real-time settlement, automated compliance checks and programmable financial logic — all within a single digital ecosystem. “Consumers don't want to know how the car is built,” she said. “They just want to drive it and have a great experience. “The pace at which blockchain technology is advancing is immense… it's one of those industries where the technology is advancing faster than the bad actors trying to break it,” he said. The danger is regulatory arbitrage, where companies pretend to be one thing but are really doing another. As traditional finance and global trade continue to face pressure from macroeconomic forces and technological disruption, the convergence around digital infrastructure may not just be inevitable. When economic certainty is hard to come by, digital asset platforms become less of a gamble and more of a foundation. “Without banks, none of this works,” he said. Webster agreed while also highlighting the inherent friction in expecting traditional banks — governed by regulators and built for resilience — to “move fast and break things.” The private sector [for high-net-worth clients] is more of a bolt-on.” This isn't just customer service; it's infrastructure-level differentiation. “The longer-term vision is actually to build a platform that's a whole ecosystem of products — banking, finance and investing,” he said. “I am a big proponent of no-code or low-code solutions for safety-critical applications,” Anissimov said. “If you can deliver products 50 times faster than your competitors, it doesn't matter how big they are.” This velocity will transform compliance, too, he said. “At some point, we'll be able to automate regulatory flows,” he said. “The moment a non-compliance happens, it gets identified. The goal is payments that just need biometric data, with no phones or cards required. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

The bitcoin price, now nudging its all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, has left stocks in the dust this year, with iPhone-maker Apple quietly confirming a crypto market game-changer. Now, as a Federal Reserve “nightmare” is coming true, those in the bitcoin and crypto industry are predicting a looming bitcoin price boom as positive catalysts collide. U.S. president Donald Trump has helped the bitcoin price and wider crypto market soar to ... More never-before-seen levels. “I truly understood bitcoin in 2011-2012 and in all these years, the bull case for it has never been stronger,” David Marcus, the former president of PayPal who led Facebook's efforts to create its own crypto-inspired currency, posted to X, telling people to, "buckle up.” “The [bitcoin price] surge reflects a convergence of macro liquidity trends and institutional adoption,” Rich Rines, former lead of Coinbase's money movement engineering and now a contributor with crypto project Core, said in emailed comments. The bitcoin price has surged toward its all-time highs this month as U.S. president Donald Trump ... More feeds a perfect storm of bullish developments. “We're seeing steady institutional inflows, signaling growing trust from traditional players. “While day-to-day prices can be noisy, the longer-term shift looks more structural. What's different this time is the market infrastructure supporting it—like regulated ETFs making it easier for institutions to get exposure, and custody services that help them hold bitcoin securely," Rines said.</p>
