                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Buzzy new EV startup Slate Auto has racked up more than 100,000 reservations for its customizable low-cost electric pickup truck, the company has confirmed to TechCrunch. “We are truly humbled by America's response to Slate's brand launch and the launch of our truck,” Slate's chief commercial officer Jeremy Snyder said in a statement to TechCrunch. Collecting 100,000 reservations so quickly is one sign of how much interest there has been in Slate since it revealed the truck, but it's no guarantee those reservations will translate to sales. Fisker filed for bankruptcy having sold just a few thousand Ocean SUVs despite once claiming more than 60,000 reservations. Lordstown Motors, meanwhile, was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for misleading investors about the number of “preorders” for its own electric pickup truck. (Lordstown Motors similarly filed for bankruptcy and ultimately settled with the SEC.) And it has big backers helping Slate try to reach that goal, including Jeff Bezos (through his family office, Bezos Expeditions), Guggenheim Partners CEO Mark Walter, and VC firm General Catalyst.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When a camera whips around from one point to another, most people expect the fast movement to result in a blurry smear. What they don't realize, however, is that our own eyes engage in a similar kind of rapid movement—called saccades—over 100,000 times a day. Unlike video cameras, our brain avoids the nauseating blur—but when things move in a particular way, they become invisible. As detailed in a study published May 8 in Nature Communications, researchers have revealed that the speed of an individual's saccades corresponds to the limit at which a moving object becomes too fast for them to see. That means people with faster eye movements can perceive faster-moving objects, with potential implications for activities requiring fast eye movements such as sports, video games, and even photography. Rolfs and his colleagues demonstrated that when a study participant saw visual stimuli moving with the same speed and pattern as their own saccade shifts, the stimuli became invisible. This suggests the brain filters out motion that mimics our own eye movements, which might be why our saccades don't cause visual blurs in the way that cameras do. More broadly, this suggests that physical movement—such as eye movement—limits our sensory system's perception of the world. It's only a matter of time until helicopter parents start timing their kids' saccades to decide whether they belong in little league or theater.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Perlmutter was removed from her post on Saturday, one day after the agency released a report that raised concerns about the legality in certain cases of using copyrighted materials to train artificial intelligence. It is unclear whether the men accurately identified themselves. There is an official with the name Brian Nieves currently employed as deputy chief of staff at the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, and a Paul Perkins is currently employed as an associate deputy attorney general at the Department of Justice, according to their LinkedIn profiles. It processes applications to copyright creative works and maintains a searchable database of existing registrations. The Department of Justice announced Monday that Blanche would be replacing Hayden, who had been in the job for nearly a decade. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Hayden's firing stemmed from “quite concerning things she had done at the Library of Congress in pursuit of DEI.” The Trump Administration has not commented so far on why Perlmutter was fired. Some lawmakers have speculated that her ouster is connected to the report on copyright and AI that her office had released. It is not customary for the US Copyright Office to release this type of document, according to copyright lawyer Aaron Moss. The report was highly anticipated in Silicon Valley, as a number of big tech companies are currently embroiled in dozens of court battles over the legality of their approach to training AI tools on copyrighted materials. In most of these cases, the AI companies are arguing that fair use doctrine makes it legal for them to train on copyrighted materials without permission. “Making commercial use of vast troves of copyrighted works to produce expressive content that competes with them in existing markets, especially where this is accomplished through illegal access, goes beyond established fair use boundaries,” it reads. Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said in a statement that using copyrighted material to generate content that competes with original works “is not fair use.” In your inbox: Get Plaintext—Steven Levy's long view on tech Federal judge allows DOGE to take over $500 million office building for free Summer Lab: Explore the future of tech with WIRED WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Various agencies closely monitored Kosmos 482's reentry, but its exact landing site remains unknown due to conflicting reports. Kosmos 482 performed an uncontrolled reentry on Saturday, May 10, plunging through Earth's atmosphere around 2:24 a.m. Roscosmos said that the Soviet-era spacecraft splashed down in the Indian Ocean west of Jakarta, Indonesia, around 350 miles (560 kilometers) west of Middle Andaman Island. ESA failed to spot the spacecraft over Germany for an expected pass that was supposed to take place at 3:32 a.m. ET, and therefore stated that the reentry had most likely already occurred. Without a confirmed time of reentry, it is hard to pinpoint where exactly the spacecraft may have ended up on Earth, or whether it burned up in the atmosphere. Keep in mind, this object was moving at roughly 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour), so even a one-second difference can shift the landing zone to a considerable degree. Kosmos 482 launched on March 31, 1972 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome spaceport in what is now Kazakhstan. The mission was an attempt by the Soviet space program to reach Venus, but it failed to reach enough velocity to enter a transfer trajectory toward the scorching hot planet. Since then, the spacecraft has been stuck in an elliptical orbit around Earth. Over time, however, atmospheric drag took its toll on Kosmos 482, eventually leading to its predicted plunge through Earth's atmosphere this past week. After failing to reach Venus, the spacecraft broke apart into four different pieces, with two of the smaller fragments reentering over Ashburton, New Zealand, two days after its launch. The spacecraft was also outfitted with a 27-square-foot (2.5-square-meter) parachute to slow it down during its descent toward the Venusian surface. Recent images of Kosmos 482 revealed what may be its parachute flapping around in orbit while attached to the spacecraft, but it is unlikely that it would have done its job during its descent toward Earth. With Saturday's reentry, the saga of Kosmos 482 finally came to an end, but questions remain about where the spacecraft ended up and what condition it may have landed in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matthew LaBrot, a Tesla employee who created the website Tesla Employees Against Elon Musk, was fired from the company two weeks ago. LaBrot claimed in a LinkedIn post that he was terminated for having created the site, and because he was part of a larger group of employees who publicly asked Elon Musk to resign from the company. Tesla has faced several crises this year—major recalls, declining sales, litigation, and a volatile stock price, to name a few. In Europe, the company's troubles are especially pronounced with a nearly 50 percent sales decline in Germany last month and France seeing a similar 59 percent drop in the same period. Not so, say the employees behind the letter, who signed off as “Tesla Employees for a New Chapter.” They argue that Tesla's troubles are not due to missteps in Model Y production, but rather to the public reputation of the company's polarizing CEO, Elon Musk. “Let's be clear: we are not the problem. Our engineering, service, and delivery teams are not the problem. It's worth noting that Tesla itself made a similar statement on its earnings call last month, conceding somewhat hilariously that “unwanted hostility towards our brand and our people had an impact [on sales] in certain markets.” This assessment jibes with expert analysis, much of which has blamed Tesla's struggling sales on its CEO's recent foray into right-wing politics. Last year, Musk donated at least $288 million to help elect Donald Trump and other republican candidates to office. And as a special advisor to President Trump, Musk has spent much of his 2025 at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), home to the administration's efforts to dramatically cut (and falsely boast about cutting) government spending. In early 2025, Musk's participation in politics sparked a grassroots protest movement called Tesla Takedown, which has rallied demonstrators at Tesla showrooms and charging stations around the country. Amid pressure from investors, Musk announced on Tesla's Q1 earnings call that he'd be stepping back from his work in Washington to spend more time at the company. In their open letter, Tesla Employees for a New Chapter called Musk's decision “tone-deaf” and “insulting.” “It implies that the hardships of the past six months stem from a lack of his attention, not from his actions. According to his LinkedIn, LaBrot worked in “Sales and Delivery Training” at Tesla and had been with the company for more than five years before his dismissal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In early May, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would split up the agency's main arm devoted to scientific research. This reorganization threatens the existence of a tiny but crucial program housed within this office: the Integrated Risk Information System Program, commonly referred to as IRIS. This program is responsible for providing independent research on the risks of chemicals, helping other offices within the agency set regulations for chemicals and compounds that could pose a danger to human health. The EPA's reorganization, experts say, will likely break up this crucial program—which has been targeted for decades by the chemical industry and right-wing interests. “The May 2 announcement is all part of a larger, comprehensive effort to restructure the entire agency,” EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou told WIRED in an email. “EPA is working expeditiously through the reorganization process and will provide additional information when it's available.” The program confers with other offices within the EPA to identify top chemicals of concern that merit further research and study. Unlike other offices in the EPA, the IRIS program has no regulatory responsibilities; rather, it exists solely to provide science on which to base potential new regulations. Experts say this insulates IRIS-produced assessments from outside pressures that could influence research done in other areas of the agency. “There's independence” in being in a centralized program like IRIS, says Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, also a former principal deputy assistant administrator of the Office of Research and Development and a former EPA science adviser. “They're not trying to evaluate risk for a specific purpose. Since its inception, IRIS has created a database of more than 570 chemicals and compounds with assessments of their potential human health effects. This body of research underpins not just federal policy, but helps guide state and international regulations as well. Yet IRIS has faced a significant uphill battle in recent years. For one, there's the sheer number of chemicals it has had to review with limited manpower. There are more than 80,000 chemicals that have been registered for use in the US, and chemical companies register hundreds more each year. Some of the chemicals IRIS is working to research have been substances of concern for years, while some have more recently drawn new scrutiny. Opposition from industry has also bogged down IRIS reviews. Chemical companies and lobbying groups have waged a long battle against the IRIS program, using various tactics—including introducing opposing research produced by paid consulting groups—to downplay the program's findings and delay assessments. In 2018, for instance, The Intercept reported that an environmental consulting company that counts chemical giants among its clients challenged an IRIS assessment of chloroprene, a chemical used in rubber production. The program was forced to use resources and staff time putting together an extensive response defending its analysis. President Donald Trump's first administration also tried to attack IRIS. A 2018 Senate appropriations bill suggested eliminating IRIS's independence by folding it into another program within the EPA. But with such a long track record of opposition—and with Trump's second administration ripping up entire agencies—it's perhaps unsurprising that IRIS is on the chopping block now. “IRIS assessments jeopardize access to critical chemistries, undercut national priorities, and harm American competitiveness,” Flanagin added. If IRIS is eliminated, experts say, EPA research on toxic chemicals will continue—but the work will likely be siloed to offices dealing with specific aspects of the environment. “If Office of Water wants to look at a chemical like arsenic, and the [Office of Air and Radiation] is also looking at arsenic, and Superfund is also looking at arsenic—they could come up with different numbers, and that could set up a vulnerability for the agency,” says Orme-Zavaleta. Research on chemicals will now also be loaded onto a reduced workforce of scientists working under an administration with new priorities. While significantly slashing the agency's budget, Zeldin has said he intends to put EPA staff to work clearing the backlog of new industrial chemicals and pesticides awaiting approval in the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. That office is now headed, once again, by Beck, the former ACC policy director, who helped rewrite rules making it more difficult to track the health consequences of certain forever chemicals during her first tenure at the EPA. “Your attack on Dr. Beck is insulting and unfounded,” Vaseliou, the EPA spokesperson, told WIRED. It's fascinating that the liberal media continues to mischaracterize Dr. Beck's time at ACC, fails to mention her time as a career civil servant (at both the state and federal level for over a decade) and fails to mention that she was a Science and Technology Policy Fellow with the American Association for the Advancement of Science for two years, a program that is typically considered to be highly competitive and highly regarded.” “As she has done her entire career, Dr. Beck remains committed to being led by the science, unlike Biden EPA appointees with major ethical issues that were beholden to radical stakeholder groups,” Vaseliou added. They're here for a four-year stint, and not much is going to happen other than rollbacks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the possibility of life beyond Earth has long captivated the public, there are already tiny organisms on our own planet that are as alien to us as anything we've imagined. These microbes are found in places once thought inhospitable to life, such as inside volcanoes, underneath the Earth's crust in the deep sea, or in the Arctic permafrost. Not only are they surviving in these harsh environments, they're doing so in ways that challenge basic principles of biology scientists thought were firmly established. Karen Lloyd, a microbial biogeochemist at the University of Southern California, has been studying these subsurface organisms for much of her life. In her new book, Intraterrestrials: Discovering the Strangest Life on Earth, she takes readers on a guided tour of her own work and that of others, exploring what makes these microbes tick. Gizmodo spoke to Lloyd about the discoveries scientists like her have made to date, the enduring mysteries about these earthly aliens, and why trying to understand them is so important. The following conversation may have been lightly edited for grammar and clarity. Ed Cara, Gizmodo: What led you down this research path in the first place? Karen Lloyd: I was really into chemistry as an undergraduate, and just the sort of mysteriousness of chemistry is honestly where I got my start. But then I was headed to chemistry grad school and it just felt too narrow. I just needed—I knew there was a way to do this science out in nature somewhere. Then just by happenstance, there was a lab that was looking at these microbes that were isolated from the deep sea. And I didn't know going into it that there was this world of deep life. Obviously, no one knows it until you're told. But when I found out it was there, I was like, ‘Okay, this is a place where I can use all these tools, these basic fundamental tools, to find out new discoveries about biology.' Gizmodo: What makes these life forms stranger than the life we're used to seeing and studying up top? Lloyd: One of the biggest things that immediately jumps out at you is that these things are on deep branches on the tree of life. I mean there are things that we never could have guessed—that life was as varied on Earth as we now know that it is. They're just so different evolutionarily from everything that we see with our eyes. Gizmodo: How are they reshaping some of the rules that we thought we had worked out about life? Lloyd: We've always known that there's such a thing as life without oxygen. But the idea that you can have an entire ecosystem that never needs oxygen and never needs the influence of plant matter, for instance; that can basically just exist solely on chemical reactions coming from inside the Earth—that's new. Gizmodo: It feels like this field has only barely begun. What are some of the biggest questions left to solve about their biology? I mean, a lot of what we know is inferred from these highly specialized techniques that we have to use to get at them. You can't just walk up to them like you can a tree and be like, ‘Okay, that's got roots. So we're still asking questions like, who all is there? What role do they play in the development of Earth's evolution over time? But what's the latest project or research that you're spearheading right now? Lloyd: Yeah, I just got back from New Zealand. That's where two tectonic plates are overlapping each other. And that process creates volcanoes, but it also creates this sort of like alchemic mixture that enables these subsurface communities to take hold. So we drove all over New Zealand, sampled a lot of land and worked with local folks. Gizmodo: What would you like our readers to most take away from reading your book? There's a whole world underneath our feet, for example. Not that there aren't mysteries in those other places too, but we are just tapping into this stuff. So I hope that people leave with a sense of hope and possibility at all the amazing things we have left to learn about life here.

The experiment could go a long way towards helping space travelers make their own nutritious, delicious ingredients. The revived organisms resumed their biological activities as if they hadn't been without oxygen and light for thousands of years. Researchers descended more than 35,700 feet (10,900 meters) below sea level to collect biological samples that revealed surprising diversity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“All these people came to him,” said Alex Lau, CEO of InventWood, “He's like, OK, this is amazing, but I'm a university professor. Now, the startup's first batches of Superwood will be produced starting this summer. “Right now, coming out of this first-of-a-kind commercial plant — so it's a smaller plant — we're focused on skin applications,” Lau said. InventWood's Superwood product starts with regular timber, which is mostly composed of two compounds, cellulose and lignin. “The cellulose nanocrystal is actually stronger than a carbon fiber,” Lau said. “We might densify the material by 4x and you might think, ‘Oh, it'll be four times strong, because it has four times the fiber.' But it's actually more like 10 times stronger because of all these extra bonds that get created,” Lau said. The result is a material that has 50% more tensile strength than steel with a strength-to-weight ratio that's 10 times better, the company said. With some polymer impregnated, it can be stabilized for outdoor use like siding, decking, or roofing. InventWood's first products will be facade materials for commercial and high-end residential buildings, Lau said. “You end up with something that looks like these richer, tropical hardwoods,” he added. “Imagine your I-beams look like this,” Lau said, holding up a sample of Superwood.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senator Tom Cotton's legislation seeks to "prevent advanced American chips from falling into the hands of adversaries like Communist China." When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas then introduced a legislative measure later in the week. The bill covers hardware that goes way beyond just AI processors, and would give the Commerce Secretary power to verify the location of hardware, and put mandatory location controls on commercial companies. To make matters even more complicated, geo-tracking features would be required for high-performance graphics cards as well. The bill covers a wide range of products classified as 3A090, 4A090, 4A003.z, and 3A001.z export control classification numbers (ECCNs), so advanced processors for AI, AI servers (including rack-scale solutions), HPC servers, and general-purpose electronics of strategic concern due to potential military utility or dual-use risk. It should be noted that many high-end graphics cards (such as Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 5090) are also classified as a 3A090 product, so it looks like such add-in-boards will also have to add geo-tracking capabilities. This condition would take effect six months after the legislation is enacted, which will make the lives of companies like AMD, Intel, and Nvidia harder, as adding a feature to already developed products is a tough task. Yet, exporters would be obliged to keep track of their products. Nvidia, as well as other exporters, would also be obligated to inform the Bureau of Industry and Security if there is evidence that a component has been redirected from its authorized destination. Additionally, any indications of tampering or manipulation must be reported. These reviews must evaluate the most current advancements in security technologies applicable to products under export control. Based on these assessments, the departments may determine whether new requirements should be imposed. If the assessment concludes that additional mechanisms are appropriate, the Commerce Department must finalize rules within two years requiring covered chips and systems to incorporate these secondary features. A detailed implementation roadmap must also be submitted to the relevant congressional committees. Finally, the legislation emphasizes confidentiality in all stages of developing and applying these new technical requirements. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. While the goal is to tighten security (which is why chip developers will be obliged to add location tracking to their products six months after the bill's enactment), the structure of the bill deliberately stretches out decision-making and compliance timelines to accommodate industry realities. The call for gradual adoption of future safeguards acknowledges the slow pace of chip development cycles, meaning that full compliance could take years depending on what mechanisms are eventually required. Meanwhile, annual export control reform recommendations may introduce further changes or exceptions over time, adding to the complexity. Anton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom's Hardware.

If you thought standard RTX 5090 GPUs were expensive, brace yourself for a variant that's literally draped in gold. Listings for the Asus' premier ROG Astral RTX 5090 Dhahab Edition have surfaced at a handful of Middle Eastern retailers, which are commanding upwards of $10,600 for the GPU, via VideoCardz. Asus took the wraps off this Middle-Eastern exclusive GPU in early February, notably without specifying any MSRPs. But let's be honest, which retailer adheres to MSRPs these days? Standing out as the flagship lineup, ROG Astral is a new GPU sub-brand that Asus introduced with the RTX 50 series. With a suite of added features such as the ability to monitor per-pin current to prevent connector meltdowns, Asus recommends a $3,099 MSRP for its Astral GPUs. It's pretty obvious the Dhahab Edition, which means Gold in Arabic, isn't going to be kind on your wallet. Across various regions, the ROG Astral RTX 5090 Dhahab Edition has been listed ranging from $6,700 to $10,600. It comes in a massive 3.8-slot design, with OC boost clock speeds of 2.61 GHz, though based on our testing, real-world frequencies will likely be higher. Considering there may only be a limited number of these GPUs manufactured, its future value will be tied to collector demand, making it a prize for the highest bidder in the coming years.

A new report claims that Nvidia has recently raised the official prices of nearly all of its products to combat the impact of tariffs and surging manufacturing costs on its business, with gaming graphics cards receiving a 5 to 10% hike while AI GPUs see up to a 15% increase. As reported by Digitimes Taiwan (translated), Nvidia is facing "multiple crises," including a $5.5 billion hit to its quarterly earnings over export restrictions on AI chips, including a ban on sales of its H20 chips to China. Digitimes reports that CEO Jensen Huang has been "shuttling back and forth" between the US and China to minimize the impact of tariffs, and that "in order to maintain stable profitability," Nvidia has reportedly recently raised official prices for almost all its products, allowing its partners to increase prices accordingly. As an example, Digitimes cites the RTX 5090, bought at premium prices upon release without hesitation, such that channel pricing "quickly doubled." The report notes that following the AI chip ban, RTX 5090 prices climbed further still, surging overnight from around NT$90,000 to NT$100,000, with other RTX 50 series cards also increasing by 5-10%. Digitimes notes Nvidia has also raised the price of its H200 and B200 chips, with server vendors increasing prices by up to 15% accordingly. According to the publication's supply chain sources, price hikes have been exacerbated by the shift of Blackwell chip production to TSMC's US plant, which has driven a significant rise in the price of production, materials, and logistics.

There is some hope that the measures could be temporary; however, following the news that the US and China have agreed on a trade deal that should cut tariffs by 115%, thanks to a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police and federal agencies have found a controversial new way to skirt the growing patchwork of laws that curb how they use facial recognition: an AI model that can track people using attributes like body size, gender, hair color and style, clothing, and accessories. It is also expanding federally: US attorneys at the Department of Justice began using Track for criminal investigations last August. “The whole vision behind Track in the first place,” says Veritone CEO Ryan Steelberg, was “if we're not allowed to track people's faces, how do we assist in trying to potentially identify criminals or malicious behavior or activity?” In addition to tracking individuals where facial recognition isn't legally allowed, Steelberg says, it allows for tracking when faces are obscured or not visible. They warned that it raises many of the same privacy concerns as facial recognition but also introduces new ones at a time when the Trump administration is pushing federal agencies to ramp up monitoring of protesters, immigrants, and students. Veritone gave us a demonstration of Track in which it analyzed people in footage from different environments, ranging from the January 6 riots to subway stations. The tool can then assemble timelines, tracking a person across different locations and video feeds. It can be accessed through Amazon and Microsoft cloud platforms. Track currently operates only on recorded video, but Steelberg claims the company is less than a year from being able to run it on live video feeds. Agencies using Track can add footage from police body cameras, drones, public videos on YouTube, or so-called citizen upload footage (from Ring cameras or cell phones, for example) in response to police requests. “We like to call this our Jason Bourne app,” Steelberg says. He expects the technology to come under scrutiny in court cases but says, “I hope we're exonerating people as much as we're helping police find the bad guys.” The public sector currently accounts for only 6% of Veritone's business (most of its clients are media and entertainment companies), but the company says that's its fastest-growing market, with clients in places including California, Washington, Colorado, New Jersey, and Illinois. That rapid expansion has started to cause alarm in certain quarters. Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, wrote in 2019 that artificial intelligence would someday expedite the tedious task of combing through surveillance footage, enabling automated analysis regardless of whether a crime has occurred. However, Stanley says, Track is the first product he's seen make broad tracking of particular people technologically feasible at scale. Trump appointee Darren Beattie requested records regarding a large list of high-profile names, organizations, and right-wing buzzwords for a “Twitter files”-style document dump about alleged conservative censorship. Chances of such abusive surveillance, Stanley says, are particularly high right now in the federal agencies where Veritone has customers. Veritone did not specify which groups within the Department of Homeland Security or other federal agencies use Track. The Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. Whereas facial recognition requires footage in which faces are clearly visible, Track doesn't have that limitation. Nathan Wessler, an attorney for the ACLU, says this means police might comb through videos they had no interest in before. “It creates a categorically new scale and nature of privacy invasion and potential for abuse that was literally not possible any time before in human history,” Wessler says. Track's expansion comes as laws limiting the use of facial recognition have spread, sparked by wrongful arrests in which officers have been overly confident in the judgments of algorithms. Numerous studies have shown that such algorithms are less accurate with nonwhite faces. Laws in Montana and Maine sharply limit when police can use it—it's not allowed in real time with live video—while San Francisco and Oakland, California have near-complete bans on facial recognition. Though such laws often reference “biometric data,” Wessler says this phrase is far from clearly defined. But certain attributes, such as body size, blur this distinction. Consider also, Wessler says, someone in winter who frequently wears the same boots, coat, and backpack. “The potential to track somebody over time based on how they're moving across a whole bunch of different saved video feeds is pretty equivalent to face recognition.” In other words, Track might provide a way of following someone that raises many of the same concerns as facial recognition, but isn't subject to laws restricting use of facial recognition because it does not technically involve biometric data. Steelberg said there are several ongoing cases that include video evidence from Track, but that he couldn't name the cases or comment further. What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before I was fully awake, still fog-headed and bleary-eyed after my alarm, I could already tell that something was wrong. “Congratulations, you've just scammed the wrong person,” read one message delivered to my personal Telegram account by an anonymous sender. Bewildered, I rifled through my messages, emails, and social media accounts. The situation quickly became clear: Somebody had gained access to my X account and used it to promote a fraudulent WIRED-branded crypto coin. On X, I discovered a barrage of colorful abuse directed at my account, including a variety of racial slurs lobbed by individuals with a limited grasp of world geography. “I'm surprised people don't come to your work and smash you up maggot,” one X user wrote. “You long nose, thin pussy lips lip having ass bitch,” another person called me. “I hope a car crashes n2 you,” said somebody else. Other users tried to report my supposed misconduct to my employer: “Your man out here stealing money,” one person wrote on X, tagging the main WIRED account. “im scraping extensive information on you, including your address, relatives, friends from UCL and more,” they said, referencing my alma mater. By 9 am, I was still taking refuge in bed, my laptop resting on outstretched legs. Commonly described as either rug pulls or pump-and-dumps, crypto investment scams of this sort take place all the time. This year alone, the X accounts of various public figures have been compromised in aid of crypto pump-and-dump schemes. Profiles belonging to a BBC journalist, politicians from the UK and Argentina, and a former vice president of the Philippines have all been used to promote fraudulent coins. Previously, accounts belonging to Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Kanye West have all been hijacked for similar crypto-flavored scams. I tweet infrequently—mostly links to my articles—and have fewer than 2,800 followers, making me somewhat of an unlikely target. But I was valuable to the scammer for the likelihood that I am considered a trusted authority in my capacity as a crypto reporter. X did not respond to a request for comment. Though crypto coins have been used in pump-and-dump schemes for years, these maneuvers have become easier to execute with the arrival of memecoin launchpads, which allow anybody to create a coin instantly, at no cost. “A lot of coins are used for pump-and-dumps on Pump.Fun. And when [bad actors] combine a pump-and-dump with the hack of an X account, it's potentially lucrative for them if executed correctly,” says Larratt. “We continue to invest in making the platform safe for users,” said Pump.Fun spokesperson Troy Gravitt in a statement to WIRED. “When we find allegations of fraud, such as hacked X accounts shilling token scams, we're able to delist those tokens from our front end to mitigate any threat they might pose to unsuspecting users.” Despite the prevalence of memecoin rug pulls, investors continue to pile into coins. “A lot of the appreciation of value in memecoins occurs very early in the process, soon after launch,” says Powers. “There's this chance you might get in at the right moment and make a killing … Timing is everything. I realized that my X account had been taken over on February 17, the day before the fraudulent WIRED coin was released. Have I Been Pwned, a service that lets people check whether their information has been exposed in data breaches and hacks, indicates that my X credentials had previously been distributed on a hacking forum, providing one possible explanation for my account having been compromised. Fatally, I had not put in place two-factor authentication, which meant that my password was all somebody needed to seize control of the account. Because the scammer had swapped out my recovery email, I had to go through a longer, more arduous recovery process with X, which meant that I did not immediately regain my account. By the following morning, it was already too late. An analysis of transaction data shows that the person or group who hacked my X account created the WIRED token at 1:20 am UTC that morning. When somebody creates a coin on Pump.Fun, they release 1 billion units into circulation and typically purchase some themselves at a nominal rate. “You can buy a certain amount of your own token. By 1:23 am, the scammer had begun to promote the coin on my X account; posts by other X users suggest they even appeared live on Spaces. “I spoke to the man behind $LIBRA … probably my most interesting piece yet. He goes into detail on the setup, process and extraction, and we even stated our own $WIRED coin to show how easy it is,” the scammer wrote in a post to my X account. In the minutes that followed, a blend of human traders and bots programmed to snatch up newly released coins began to invest. By 1:45 am, the WIRED coin had lost practically all of its value. “The amount of money they made was not a lot by comparison to other pump-and-dumps we've seen. But in 20 minutes, analysis shows they may have gained up to five times the amount they deposited,” says Larratt. On February 19 and 24, that wallet deposited a combined $110,000 worth of crypto with Binance, a centralized exchange typically used to convert crypto into regular currency. Though crypto exchanges are required in most jurisdictions to record the identities of account holders, as a matter of policy they do not disclose that information unless they receive a request from the authorities. In any case, criminals frequently use money mules or stolen identity documentation to open accounts with exchanges, Larratt previously told WIRED, which means that identifying the account owner is not the same as identifying the scammer. In the days after the WIRED memecoin rug pull, I continued to receive messages from people who believed that I had scammed them. “If you think I'm joking you have a fucking serious problem,” they wrote in one message, threatening to report me to WIRED management. To limit the likelihood that somebody might locate me, I signed up for a service that promised to cleanse any scraps of my personal data from the web. I also contacted my friends and family members, who had been threatened indirectly, and reported the harassment to my local police force. Within a week, after I had posted to my X account explaining what had happened, the abusive and threatening messages stopped. Meanwhile, people continue to pile into unpromising memecoins. On April 14, the anonymous Telegram user who had threatened me posted two screenshots to X advertising large profits they had supposedly made on recent memecoin trades. “We are so retarded,” they wrote, using the slur adopted by memecoin traders to celebrate the level of risk they take.
