                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ROME — Bianca Andreescu's run at the Italian Open tennis tournament came to an end Monday with a 7-5, 6-1 loss to Qinwen Zhang in the fourth round. Andreescu, from Mississauga, Ont., looked poised to continue her impressive run at the WTA 1000 clay-court event as she served for the win in the first set. But Zheng, the eighth seed from China, saved set point before completing her fourth break of the set, then closed out on serve. That momentum carried over as Zhang scored two more breaks in a dominant second set. Zhang overcame eight double-faults and a 47.1-per-cent accuracy on first serve to win in 93 minutes. Despite the loss, the tournament was a success for the 24-year-old Andreescu, who returned to action earlier this year after nearly six months off to focus on her health. Also Monday, the top-seeded women's doubles team of Ottawa's Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe of New Zealand advanced to the quarterfinals with a walkover against Peyton Stearns of the United States and Australia's Daria Kasatkina. Stearns and Kasatkina withdrew after Stearns posted a 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (4) win over Naomi Osaka in singles action earlier Monday. The win took two hours 41 minutes to complete. Dabrowski and Routliffe will next face the winner of Tuesday's match between sixth-seeded Russians Diana Shnaider and Mirra Andreeva versus Taiwan's Chan Hao-ching and Mexico's Giuliana Olmos. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 12, 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Karen Khachanov will take on a big challenge at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia on Tuesday when he faces third seed Carlos Alcaraz, the recent Monte-Carlo champion. Khachanov will try to overcome Alcaraz's 4-0 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. All of the Spaniard's victories have come in straight sets. Before Khachanov steps on court at the Foro Italico on Tuesday, see how well he passed another test. The ATP challenged the 28-year-old's knowledge of his own career in the latest edition of its 'Five To Win' series. Would the seven-time ATP Tour titlist risk his points to pass Stefanos Tsitsipas to become the clubhouse leader for the challenge?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Open winner and Philippines rising star did not know each other personally before the Italian Open, but one message on Instagram changed that. Looking for a way to team up with USA's tennis ace Coco Gauff? That is what the Philippines' rising star Alexandra Eala did to pin Gauff as her doubles partner at the Italian Open in Rome. “She slid in my DMs and asked me to play. 3 Gauff advanced to the final of that tournament while Eala fell to Poland's Iga Swiatek in the Round of 64. "We did not know each other at all, really," Gauff said. "Before in Madrid, I said ‘Hi' to her for the first time." While Gauff did not know Eala well, the Filipina player's impressive junior record in doubles spoke for itself and the USA star was eager to team up with her. “She's a killer in doubles — two junior slams, and probably future ones too,” Gauff said. The duo secured a two-set victory over Alexandra Panova and Fanny Stollar in the Round of 32 (6-3, 6-1) at the Italian Open and will next face a home pair, Tyra Grant and Lisa Pigato on Tuesday (13 May).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American tennis player Peyton Stearns earned a huge win on Monday at the Italian Open - but it came at a price as she became sick after the match. Stearns outlasted Naomi Osaka 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(4) in a two hour, 42-minute marathon of a contest in sunny Rome. 'I think in the tiebreak I was just trying not to throw up in the middle of the court,' she said afterwards in an on-court interview. Stearns then withdrew from her scheduled doubles match alongside Russian-Australian Daria Kasatkina, citing gastrointestinal illness. That illness seems to be an ongoing issue for the American, as she also referenced it in February. However, she appears to be in good spirits following her win on Monday, as she actually posted the video of her vomiting, along with a dog emoji and brick emoji. Monday's loss will be tough to swallow for Osaka, who led 4-2 in the tiebreak before ultimately dropping the match. Stearns, meanwhile, has now made a WTA 1000 quarterfinal for the second time. She will face either Danielle Collins or Elina Svitolina in her next match. 42, has wasted little time making her mark in tennis after winning a college national championship at Texas. Since turning pro in 2022, Stearns has compiled a 9-8 record at Grand Slams, including a career-best run to the US Open fourth round in 2023. Stearns made it to the third round of the French Open and US Open last year. Aside from beating four-time Grand Slam champ Osaka, Stearns also earned an impressive victory a round earlier when she took down world no.</p>

As of today, no tennis player has come back from it and won the French Open. Relative to players who have previously served drug suspensions, Sinner is uniquely well positioned to win a French Open title at some point in his post-suspension career. Sinner's only 23 years old and had a firm enough grasp on the No. All three of his Grand Slam titles to date have come on hard courts, but the big-hitting Italian's style works well on all surfaces, and he reached the French Open semifinals last year. Sharapova reached the quarterfinals in her lone subsequent French Open appearance, while neither Hingis nor Halep played Roland-Garros again post-suspension. Halep, who was suspended in 2023, won the French Open in 2018 while being coached by Darren Cahill, who currently coaches Sinner. He was heavily favored in that match but choked away a two-set lead against Argentinian compatriot Gaston Gaudio. Rafael Nadal then began his stretch of 14 French Open titles in 18 years in 2005, blocking Coria and most of the ATP Tour. Reigning French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz could become this generation's Nadal, but Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka still managed to sneak in Roland Garros titles during the King of Clay's reign, so Sinner certainly seems more likely than not to get one eventually. He may not have to wait long as the oddsmakers' second-favorite at the 2025 French Open behind Alcaraz, but there's actually a player with a higher likelihood than Sinner of becoming the first player to win Roland-Garros post-suspension this year. Iga Swiatek, who served a one-month suspension in November 2024 after a positive test for the banned substance trimetazidine, is the clear favorite on the women's side as she angles for a French Open four-peat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu's improving form has continued this week as she now takes on world No. Raducanu's career on the court has been beset by problems since becoming an overnight superstar in 2021 with a stunning US Open title win from nowhere. Numerous coaches have come and gone, while she has also been a victim of unwanted attention from a fan and has faced criticism for losing focus on the sport after becoming a big celebrity. Their connection is said to be purely platonic but there's no doubt they care for each other greatly, given what they have both said. Draper has said of Raducanu: "She has always been there for me and I have always been there for her. He added of her famous US Open triumph: "What Emma did was obviously incredibly inspiring. I've known her from a young age, and to see what she did was incredible. Obviously, we've watched the likes of Andy Murray winning a Grand Slam from Great Britain, but her winning, it was just really a fairy-tale run. “I definitely think as a competitor, it fuelled my fire. I really wanted to achieve what she'd done, winning a Grand Slam. It's a different physical challenge and all these types of things. [But] I learned a lot from watching Emma win, that run, and how amazing she was.” Following Draper's recent move into the world's top five, Raducanu returned the compliment, saying: “It's amazing to see what he's achieved and how much he's done. The tennis circuit was abuzz with rumours last year after Romeo Beckham was spotted at Wimbledon watching Raducanu, sparking speculation about their relationship following her recent split from her boyfriend. As Emma Raducanu glided to a straight-sets triumph over Elise Mertens in round two, the glare of the spotlight wasn't reserved solely for her. The 22 year old former Brentford footballer, whose passion for tennis is well-known – marked notably by his training stint with Andy Murray – unwittingly turned heads at the match. The Beckhams' fondness for Raducanu isn't hushed news; indeed, David Beckham was glimpsed alongside his mum, Sandra, ensconced in Wimbledon's prestigious Royal Box, as they cheered on the burgeoning tennis sensation. While Romeo's attendance could simply stem from admiration for Raducanu, it did stir up chatter and speculative buzz, especially after he posted an Instagram snap of Raducanu mid-game, adorned with heart emojis. But for Raducanu, Romeo's presence was taken in stride. She commented: "I mean, I think he's, yeah, he's really cool," recognising her esteem for the Beckham name and the influence David Beckham has had on British sport. The tennis star previously parted ways with Carlo Agostinelli, an aspiring footballer who briefly played for Tottenham Hotspur before joining Stanford University's team. Raducanu and Agostinelli's split came after the pair started dating around May 2023, appearing together at several events such as the Dior 2024 Cruise show in Mexico. They were last spotted together at Paris Fashion Week. The breakup seemed confirmed when Raducanu unfollowed her ex on social media ahead of Wimbledon. The young tennis star reportedly caused a stir at Wimbledon's All England Club last year by allegedly breaking a dress code that has been in place for 150 years. Despite a 2023 amendment allowing women to wear dark undershorts for menstrual concerns, the rules are still tight, reports Wales Online. White attire must not be off-white or cream, and only a trim of a single colour up to 10mm is allowed on necklines or sleeve cuffs. Yet, Raducanu reportedly turned heads by arriving in a pink outfit, leading to a member's complaint to the Mail: "It's so unfair. Raducanu isn't alone in causing a stir over dress code; Nick Kyrgios made waves in 2022 with his red Nike Jordan shoes and cap, although he switched to white gear later. Even Roger Federer faced criticism for sporting orange-soled shoes at the prestigious venue. Her historic victory shattered several records as she became the first ever qualifier to clinch a Grand Slam title and the first British woman to do so since Virginia Wade's Wimbledon success in 1977. At a tender age of 18, she was also the youngest Grand Slam champion since Maria Sharapova in 2004. Naturally, securing that title dramatically altered Raducanu's life, as she swiftly graced the cover of every newspaper and magazine, was crowned the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year and even received an MBE for her contributions to tennis. All of this means that, besides her career earnings which currently sit at just over £3 million, Raducanu is reported to have an impressive net worth. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, it is estimated to be around £10 million, with Forbes last year ranking her as the sixth highest-paid tennis player globally. The British sensation is teetering on the edge of an even more lucrative horizon, as insiders project that with a repeat of her 2021 triumphs, she might surpass an eye-watering £100 million in wealth. A prominent sports agent conveyed to MailOnline, "She can easily earn £100 million or more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff and Emma Raducanu share one important thing. They are both US Open champions and importantly they were both major winners as teenagers so it comes as no surprise that the pair have a lot of advice to give each other. Since then, Gauff has joined Raducanu as a US Open winner, when she won her first major in 2023. Fast forward to 2025, despite the pair having their crowning moments in New York that's about it when it comes to the similarities in their tennis journeys. Raducanu's US Open championship is her only title, with her time on tour since that being savaged by injuries with very little momentum being established. So much so that despite the two young stars have only met once on tour, a 2023 Australian Open clash which Gauff came out victorious. It was a game that Raducanu had an ample opportunity to win, with a 5-4 lead in the first set. However, she failed to see her out two set points and Gauff rallied to make a comeback, winning the tie break before winning the second set and match. Ahead of just their second match at the Rome Open, fourth seed Gauff was full of praise for an opponent she has barely played. “She's obviously a great player and the last time we played, it was a tough match,” the world No 3 told Tennis Channel. “It's going to be a different matchup on clay here, but I think she has the game to be a great clay-court player. “Obviously, a great player in general, but especially on clay. So it's going to be a tough match and I'm looking forward to it and hopefully I can come out with the win.” Raducanu returned the complaints, pointing out how good she is on clay. I think I'm playing pretty good tennis right now and she is going to be a great test,” the 22-year-old Brit told Sky Sports. I'm just going to keep focused but savour this one for now.” Should Raducanu play at her very best, her clean-hitting and pace from both sides of the court should make Gauff uncomfortable. However, even then Gauff is a very good defender and incredibly quick on this surface, something Raducanu may struggle to cope with. It would be a huge upset, should Raducanu eliminate Gauff.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Destanee Aiava or Victoria and Tristan Schoolkate or Western Australia have been awarded wildcards into the main draw of Roland Garros, recognising their promising performances over the past year and their potential to make their mark on the clay courts of Paris, writes Tennis Australia. Aiava, currently ranked world No.157, qualified for the 2024 US Open and Australian Open 2025 – two Grand Slam breakthroughs that showcased her growing confidence and composure on the big stage. I was not expecting it at all,” Aiava said on this week's episode of The Sit-Down podcast. “I literally had just lost my match last week; it was a really tight match and I was crying. And I was just like laying down, you know, wallowing in my sadness, and then I got a call from Sam [Stosur], and I was like, oh, why is she calling me? “There's always something good around the corner, I guess, in this sport.” At 24 years old and ranked No.129, Schoolkate has enjoyed a career-best 12 months. He captured his first ATP Challenger title at the 2024 Guangzhou International Challenger, defeating fellow Australian Adam Walton in a hard-fought final. Schoolkate later made headlines at Australian Open 2025 by taking the first set against No.1 Jannik Sinner, demonstrating his potential to challenge top-tier players. “Thank you to Tennis Australia for this incredible opportunity,” Schoolkate said. “My team and I have been putting in the work every day, always striving to reach new heights.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Up-and-coming Australian tennis players Destanee Aiava and Tristan Schoolkate have been awarded wildcard entries into the main draw of Roland-Garros. The pair are among eight wildcards awarded on each side of the singles draw through a reciprocal wildcard exchange with the French Tennis Federation, United States Tennis Association (USTA) and Tennis Australia. Rising stars Iva Jovic and Emilio Nava received wildcard entries from the USTA last week after winning the governing body's wildcard challenge.

Aiava, ranked world No.157 and Schoolkate, ranked world No.129, will now have the opportunity to make their mark on the clay courts of Paris after winning their respective first main draw matches at the Australian Open earlier this year. Schoolkate was also awarded a wildcard entry from Tennis Australia for his home slam. Aiava progressed through the qualifying rounds to contest the 2024 US Open and 2025 Australian Open, building a following around her vintage tennis outfits. Having played in qualifying at Roland-Garros last year after six years of not making the cut, Aiava will make her debut at the year's second grand slam tournament. I was not expecting it at all," Aiava told Tennis Australia's The Sit-Down podcast. "There's always something good around the corner, I guess, in this sport." At Melbourne Park, Schoolkate made headlines when he took the first set off reigning Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner before going down in four sets. He earlier toppled Japanese player Taro Daniel in the first round for a second career grand slam victory. Remarkably, his maiden win at the 2024 US Open was also against Daniel. "My team and I have been putting in the work every day, always striving to reach new heights," Schoolkate said in a statement. Aiava and Schoolkate's announcement as wildcards brings the Aussie singles contingent to 15. Eight men and five women will represent Australia, headlined by top-ranked national men's player Alex de Minaur and fresh Australian patriot Daria Kasatkina. Main draw action begins on Sunday, May 25 at Stade Roland Garros.</p>
