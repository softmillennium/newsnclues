                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By studying seismic waves, researchers have found a layer deep beneath the surface of Mars that could contain enough liquid water to flood the planet with an ocean thousands of feet deep.

Related: NASA rover discovers out-of-place 'Skull' on Mars, and scientists are baffled In the time between Mars' formation 4.1 billion years ago to about 3 billion years ago, the Red Planet is thought to have been extremely wet, with features like valley networks, delta formations, and layered sedimentary rocks suggesting sustained water flow. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. However, these methods of water loss have previously been shown to not entirely account for all the water that is estimated to have once flowed on the Red Planet, with a large volume of "missing" water going unaccounted for. This conundrum has long puzzled scientists, posing the question of whether there is still liquid water hidden on Mars that we have yet to find. Upon analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, which landed on Mars in 2018, researchers found that seismic waves within the planet's interior — caused by asteroid impacts and marsquakes in 2021 and 2022 — appeared to slow down between 3.4 and 5 miles [5.4 to 8 kilometers] below the surface. They suggest that this could be due to the presence of liquid water hidden within porous rocks, as seismic waves travel more slowly through liquid than they do through more solid materials. "This 'low-velocity layer' is most likely highly porous rock filled with liquid water, like a saturated sponge," Tkalčić and another study co-author Weijia Sun, a professor of geophysics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, explained in an essay for the Conversation about the new study. "Something like Earth's aquifers, where groundwater seeps into rock pores." "This also matches estimates of the 'missing' water on Mars from other studies." —NASA Mars satellite uncovers markings 'like paint dripping down a wall' on Martian surface —Life on Mars could survive — so long as you're one of these strange, hybrid lifeforms Previous studies have also found that large volumes of water may be stored beneath the Martian surface in ice form, and a study from 2024 suggested that liquid water could be stored within rocks between 7 to 13 miles (11.2 to 21 km) beneath the surface. The potential presence of liquid water on Mars is exciting to scientists, as liquid water is essential to life as we know it. While these potential reservoirs deep below the planet's surface could host some form of Martian life, we won't know if the liquid water even exists until we can drill deep into Mars and find it for ourselves. "Future missions with seismometers and drills are needed to confirm the presence of the water at these depths and gather more clues," Tkalčić said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Across 15 seasons of Supernatural, fans were blessed with the spooky escapades of the Winchester brothers, as they battled everything from grounded monsters to biblical entities along the way. Running for 22 episodes, Supernatural: The Anime premiered on February 9, 2011, and was produced by the legendary Japanese animation studio, Madhouse, which is behind iconic projects like Death Note, Perfect Blue, Black Lagoon, and countless others. Despite not featuring Sam or Dean, one Supernatural crossover with an unlikely series is so bizarre that it actually works really well for it. When it was produced by a Japanese animation studio, Supernatural: The Anime features an impressive Japanese dub with Yūya Uchida and Hiroki Touchi reprising their roles as Sam and Dean, the voices for the Japanese dub of the live-action series as well. For the English version, Jared Padalecki was able to return to voice Sam, but Jensen Ackles had scheduling conflicts and only returned for the final two episodes, the show's biggest unfortunate blemish, though Andrew Farrar did a solid job for the first 20 episodes. Determining what is canon or not is a much-discussed aspect of franchise fandoms, which raises questions about the standing of Supernatural: The Anime Series within the official story of Supernatural. The way it ties into the live-action series is pretty interesting, though, as Supernatural: The Anime covers the plot of Supernatural's first two seasons, while also featuring new storylines about Sam and Dean's childhoods and expanding a bit on some secondary characters. While it is a shame that The Winchesters ended early, and there haven't been any other spinoffs of Supernatural besides Supernatural: The Anime Series, it seems unlikely that The CW will be producing any new projects in the franchise. Sam and Dean Winchester use different secret codewords - or "hunter's lingo" - throughout Supernatural in order to keep their monster hunting covert. There are still plenty of directions the franchise could take if another network or streaming service was able to pick it up, including several unfinished storylines that would be awesome to explore in the 16th season of Supernatural. There is also still a massive fandom around Sam, Dean, Castiel, and Supernatural as a whole, and plenty of spinoff ideas the franchise could delve into if the timing is right. Created by Eric Kripke, Supernatural is a fantasy/drama series that premiered in 2005. The series follows the adventures of Dean and Sam Winchester - two men wronged by supernatural beings as children who now spend their days investigating and hunting demons, ghosts, and monsters across the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UFOs and debates about what's going on up in the sky are all the rage these days. We get new photos, videos and stories on a regular basis. It's a truly fascinating topic, and that now includes a new story that is absolutely wild. Dr. Gregory Rogers, a former NASA Chief Flight Surgeon and major in the Air Force, spoke with the Daily Mail about an incident from more than three decades ago. Rogers claims he was working at the NASA facility in Cape Canaveral in 1992 when an Air Force major offered to show him a video. A new UFO claim is going viral. Rogers claims the Air Force major, who he didn't previously know, showed him video footage of a flying saucer in the government's possession. "He sits down at the computer console. It takes several minutes, then all of a sudden up on the screen comes this closed circuit television [CCTV] feed," Rogers told the outlet. What was on the feed was a flying vehicle that, if true, the government has never acknowledged having. There was a little area on top which had a stick coming out of it. At the top of it were umbilical hoses, like if you were feeding gasses or electricity into it. The former NASA official claims there were several people in the footage, including men in lab coats and hazmat suits, according to the same report. "I hear and see these things that look like electromagnetic charges coming off this vehicle. But there's no devices from which they're emanating. Once it got up maybe 3 feet above the concrete surface, it rotated completely around, clockwise, one revolution, then it revolved counterclockwise, one revolution," he further explained. Rogers told the Daily Mail, "He said, ‘We got it from them.' And he was pointing his thumb up to the sky, which I interpreted as meaning from space." Now, it's important to note that there doesn't appear to be proof for Rogers' claims other than his word. Having said that, the government is always creating new technology the public doesn't know anything about. What the public knows about in terms of military technology and aircraft is often designed years ahead of anyone knowing. I can only imagine what kinds of drones and planes are currently being designed and tested. Does that mean Rogers' story is true? What do you think about Dr. Gregory Rogers' claims?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Your in-built excuses for the draft lottery tonight. The NBA Draft Lottery is on Monday night with Cooper Flagg being the biggest prize since, well ... okay, Victor Wembanyama two years ago — but still, Flagg is a big deal. Flagg might be the best U.S.-born prospect since LeBron James, garnering comparisons to Scottie Pippen, Jayson Tatum, and Grant Hill in terms of his length and all-around playing ability. So with stakes like this on the line it's only natural to assume that the entire lottery process is going to be rigged in order to ensure only a team the NBA wants to have Flagg will actually get him. Read our latest mock draft before the lottery here. We also ranked the best and worst landing spots for Flagg. Thankfully we're in luck, because there are solid conspiracies behind every single lottery team that could win on Monday night. So to save your Twitter fingers some time, we've got all your theories right here for you. The NBA needs to dispel it's “big market bias” narrative, and putting Flagg in Utah achieves just that. Also it coincides nicely with the owners of the Jazz (and now the Utah Mammoth) expanding their arena to make Salt Lake City a bigger sports destination. The Wizards have been lagging woefully behind in attendance for a large market and Flagg can change that. Flagg could be the missing piece to make this team actually good, and Charlotte has been robbed of the No. 1 pick multiple times in the past. Two big reasons here: The Saints are going to be in the toilet after Derek Carr stunningly retired, and this could easily be pre-payment on a deal to send Zion Williamson to a major market. We've seen this in the past. Remember when New Orleans was gifted Anthony Davis right after the Chris Paul trade? The phrase “too big to fail” applies here. Of course the NBA is going to find a way to route Flagg to Philly and make the Sixers a phenom again. The whole Paul George fiasco blew up in their faces, and it's unclear if Joel Embiid can stay healthy. This is a contingency plan so the team can build a future big three around Jared McCain, Tyrese Maxey and Cooper Flagg if needed. It is not okay to have a team be in the world's largest media market and struggle as much as the Nets do — especially when the Knicks have finally found their form. Is there anything more perfectly Brooklyn that a lanky basketball star from Maine? The hipsters are going to love him. It's a dicey time in world politics and the NBA needs to currie as much favor with the Canadian government as possible. This franchise was built off Vince Carter coming up from North Carolina, now we do it again with Flagg heading North from Duke. Flagg and Wemby is a marketing dream. The new Big Two in Texas. A Gen Z Duncan and Robinson. It would also take a lot of attention off the Mavericks so they can make a more quiet move to Las Vegas. Sending Damian Lillard to the Bucks did the NBA a major solid, even if it didn't work out. This is a payment on that trade, and gives Portland a major star to build around. A huge market team on the cusp of winning. Also a chance to make significant inroads with the Catholic market by making Pope Leo XIV happy that his team has a star.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ryan Coogler's latest film, Sinners, made history with a second-weekend box office tally only six percent lower than its opening weekend. Both audiences and critics adore this Southern Gothic vampire thriller, starring Michael B. Jordan as identical twins Smoke and Stack. Looking to open a juke joint for the community that raised them, they sign on their cousin Sammie (Miles Caton), a pastor's son and blues guitar virtuoso, and buy an old saw mill off a local landowner Hogwood (David Maldonado), who lies to the twins about his Klan membership, but Smoke and Stack learn this vital piece of information anyway, but from a different well of trouble: Remmick (Jack O'Connell), a vampire who comes knocking during the juke joint's opening night. Sinners is a horror movie, but it's also so much more—a moody, atmospheric fantasy and period piece in one, which plumbs the history of the blues, hoodoo, and the Jim Crow South. We begin to understand why when he visits his estranged wife, Annie (Wunmi Mosaku), at her little shop and abode in the woods. Outside, a fresh bottle of milk is set next to a tiny grave for the couple's baby daughter. As Smoke and Stack make their way through the Delta, culminating in the juke joint's grand opening, production designer Hannah Beachler's (Black Panther, Creed) exceptional structures, built from the ground up, define each location. At first glance, the spare, light church from whence the twins pluck Sammie couldn't be more different from Bo (Yao) and Grace Chow's (Li Jun Li) bustling grocery, but an aesthetic through line connects each of the locations for a historic, coherent sense of the Delta imbued with the fantastical. Beachler, who has worked with Coogler for twelve years on five of his films, has a shorthand with the director, but nevertheless, every project has its own challenges. We got to speak with Beachler about her historic references, visual guidelines, and working Easter eggs into the sets for Sinners. The settings are so integral to this story. How did you approach them as a whole? They were all built entirely from scratch on location, so that was an awesome feat. I assigned them colors of red, white, and blue. On the outside of Annie's, there's a haint blue. They each have their own personality, inspired by Dennis Gassner and Tim Burton's Big Fish, which is very much about these small silhouettes of buildings, leaning and exaggerated in form. It was really about wanting to put these structures on these big horizons so they could stand out, because nothing was big. We didn't have huge mansions outside of plantations, so the world was very small, and I wanted to keep it that way, but I wanted to exaggerate the shapes. Sometimes I put a piece of a set into another set, trying to draw a line between church, spirituality which is Annie and the haint blue, and then red, which is blood and the capitalism of the juke joint and the free spirit there, and how all of those live in juxtaposition to one another. The farmhouse also has a lot of juxtaposition. When I started doing my research and digging into the photography of Eudora Welty, I saw a photograph of a woman from a sharecropper family standing outside her house. And it struck me, there's a huge pile of cotton on her porch. When Sammie walked through his neighborhood on the plantation, you saw people with it on their porch. All of those things were really important in building what was a truth that feels like fantasy. How did you create the barn-turned-juke joint? I knew I wanted to make it two stories, to tell the story that people lived there at one point. Of course, the kerosene lanterns were practical lighting, and then we had that moment when they jacked the electricity. Autumn [Durald Arkapaw, the cinematographer] really used that as a point of reference for the lighting she put in there. I can be as bold and crazy as I want, and she turns it into a beautiful piece of art. We wanted to bring in the feeling that music is surrounding them. The big light Mary and Stack are in front of looks like a moon, and foreshadows what they become. And the juke joint is where everybody's world collides, so I brought a little bit of everything [from other sets] into the structure. Did the doubling for Smoke and Stack affect your process at all? Ryan always said, Don't let that dictate what you're doing. The twinning affected us just a little bit when we had to make sure backgrounds matched, but otherwise, we just went for it without worrying too much about that. When you're at the doors of the church and Sammie walks in, I wanted to see rafters, and I wanted them to disappear at a certain point. So we had Autumn's people out in Los Angeles measuring the height of the bottom of where our rafters sat, with where the IMAX would fall, and how far in we would lose that. So much of the key action takes place at night. What did that mean for your process? Concentrating on shapes and creating a mood in the background was fun. I've been in New Orleans for about 22 years. I knew a lot of the crew and had worked with a lot of them in my early career. We were able to use the sugarcane fields when they were low to plant an acre here or there of cotton, and the rest would be tilled in. That was one of the reasons we needed New Orleans; outside of it lay those big landscapes you're going to get in the Delta, the big sky, and that land forever. I knew that we could get that [landscape] in Louisiana more so than in any other place. What were the locations outside New Orleans like? We augmented and filled all of those buildings. Those grocery stores were from the ground up. Our set decorating department made labels for every can. There are a lot of little tells on the windows of the grocery stores as to what that world meant. I was so proud we were able to put catfish frying on 70mm IMAX—you don't see that every day. The town's main street had an incredible amount of detail. I hope people keep seeing things every time they watch it. It was still a studio, but it was Ryan's, and that made us free to stretch our own creativity. That's one of the great things about working with an auteur like Ryan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 35-year-old man diagnosed with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) claims that the mere thought of eating fruits, vegetables, eggs, or meat is enough to make him sick. Calling Thomas Sheridan a picky eater would be an understatement. Because of his bland diet, he needs to take protein and vitamin supplements, but only those with a taste profile that he can stomach. The unemployed man claims to have made attempts to diversify his diet, but they have all ended in failure. A couple of years ago, he was diagnosed with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), an eating disorder that prevents sufferers from eating certain foods, and despite several attempted treatments, his daily diet remains incredibly restricted. “There was one time when we started drinking and everyone used to talk about bacon sandwiches when they were roughed up,” Sheridan told SWNS. “I attempted to make an egg and sausage butty one day, and as soon as the egg touched my mouth, I vomited about 10 feet across the room.” At school, he was allowed to go home at lunchtime to eat toast because he couldn't stomach school lunches. As an adult, his aversion to certain foods has prevented him from leading a normal life and made it harder for him to work. Desperate to incorporate new foods into his daily diet, the 35-year-old man is now trying to raise $8,000 for hypnotherapy, but there are no guarantees that it will help cure his ARFID.</p>
