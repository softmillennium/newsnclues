                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal prosecutors will begin trying to prove Monday that Sean “Diddy” Combs turned his hip-hop conglomerate into a racketeering enterprise that forced women to satisfy his sexual desires for two decades.

(Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The public knew Sean “Diddy” Combs as a larger-than-life music and business mogul, but in private he used violence and threats to coerce women into drug-fueled sexual encounters that he recorded, a prosecutor said Monday in opening statements at Combs' sex trafficking trial. ”During this trial you are going to hear about 20 years of the defendant's crimes.” Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos, though, described the trial as a misguided overreach by prosecutors, saying that although her client could be violent, the state was trying to turn consenting sex between adults into a prostitution and sex trafficking case. “There has been a tremendous amount of noise around this case over the past year. Geragos conceded that Combs' violent outbursts, often fueled by alcohol, jealousy and drugs, might have warranted domestic violence charges, but not sex trafficking and racketeering counts. With the trial's first witness, Israel Florez, prosecutors went right to proof of violence by showing footage of Combs kicking and dragging the R&B singer Cassie, his longtime girlfriend, on the floor outside a Los Angeles hotel's elevators in March 2016. After CNN aired video of the attack last year, Combs apologized and said he was “disgusted” by his actions. Florez, who worked hotel security in 2016 but is now a Los Angeles police officer, said he knew who Combs was when he encountered him sitting by the hotel's elevators as he responded to a report of a woman in distress. Cassie left, and Florez said Combs called out while holding a stack of money with a $100 bill on top, telling him, “Don't tell nobody.” Florez said he considered it a bribe and told Combs, “I don't want your money. Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, was expected to testify later Monday or Tuesday. Since his September arrest, he's been held at a federal jail in Brooklyn. Lawyers for the three-time Grammy winner say prosecutors are wrongly trying to make a crime out of a party-loving lifestyle that may have been indulgent, but not illegal. Prosecutors say Combs coerced women into drugged-up group sexual encounters he called “freak offs,” “wild king nights” or “hotel nights,” then kept them in line by choking, hitting, kicking and dragging them, often by the hair. In her opening, Johnson said Cassie was far from the only woman Combs beat and sexually exploited. The prosecutor said Combs last year brutally beat another woman — identified only as Jane — when she confronted him about enduring years of freak offs in dark hotel rooms while he took other paramours on date nights and trips around the globe. The sex parties are central to Combs' sexual abuse, prosecutors say. Combs compelled women, including Cassie, to take drugs and engage in sexual activity with male escorts while he gratified himself and sometimes recorded them, Johnson said. Combs would beat Cassie over the smallest slights, such as leaving a freak off without his permission or taking too long in the bathroom, Johnson said. Combs threatened to ruin Cassie's singing career by publicly releasing videos of her sexually involved with male escorts, the prosecutor said. Combs sat expressionless as Johnson described what she said was a pattern of violence, sexual abuse and blackmail. Cassie sued Combs in 2023, and the lawsuit was settled within hours, but it touched off a law enforcement investigation and was followed by dozens of lawsuits making similar claims. Geragos also conceded that Combs is extremely jealous and “has a bad temper,” telling the jury that he sometimes got angry and lashed out when he drank alcohol or “did the wrong drugs.” But, she said, “Domestic violence is not sex trafficking.” The Associated Press doesn't generally identify people who say they are victims of sexual abuse unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has done. This story was updated to correct the spelling of Casandra Ventura's first name, which had been misspelled “Cassandra.” Associated Press writer Dave Collins in Hartford, Connecticut, contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump marched the US economy to the brink of a self-inflicted recession and a potential supply chain meltdown. But at the last moment, Trump decided to pull back. The dramatic drop in US-China tariffs is an undeniable positive compared to just a few days ago. The breakthrough has already set off an epic party on Wall Street and is raising hopes that a tariff-driven nightmare can be avoided. Yet economists say it's still too early to declare the US economy is out of danger altogether. Tariffs are still very high — much higher than at any point in decades. Damage to confidence and trade flows won't be undone overnight. Moreover, there is no playbook for what happens next. There is no precedent for how a modern economy responds after going through this many shocks in this short a time. “We are far from out of the woods,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former economic adviser to Republicans. Supply chain experts warned of imminent trouble, including empty store shelves. York added that Trump's economic team backtracking from the 145% tariff rates “shows the administration realizes what a disaster it would have been.” Even though Trump has repeatedly offered a dose of tough medicine in recent weeks, including questioning how many dolls kids need to own, he has been sensitive to the image of barren store shelves as well as financial market reaction to a deepening trade war, a senior administration official told CNN's Jeff Zeleny. “Both sides luckily decided to save Christmas,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, wrote in a report on Monday. Still, despite Trump's decision to slash tariffs on China to 30% for at least 90 days, import taxes remain sharply higher than at the start of the year. At that level, tariffs are set to add more than one percentage point to US inflation through this time next year and erase the same amount from gross domestic product (GDP), Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told CNN. As a result of the US-China trade war thaw, Zandi is cutting his recession forecast — but not dramatically. “Of course, the economy will be highly vulnerable to anything else that might go wrong.” Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, noted on X that it's true that US trade policy and the prospects for the economy are “much better today than they were yesterday.” But it's also true, Wolfers said, to say that the situation is “much worse today than on Inauguration Day.” After Trump spiked tariffs at his April 2 “Liberation Day” event, Wolfers warned the odds of a recession would reach 75% if all the tariffs kicked in and stayed in place. Now Wolfers tells CNN that the risk of a recession has fallen sharply but still remains a coin-flip at roughly 50/50. “There has been a wholly unnecessary supply chain disruption. It will take some time to work itself out,” Wolfers said in a phone interview. Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic now sees the US economy eking out slightly positive growth this year, up from her prior call for no growth at all. Nationwide still sees inflation accelerating to 3.4% this year, but that's an improvement from 4% before the US-China breakthrough. Asked if tariffs would go back to 145% if no deal is reached at the end of the 90 days, Trump said: “No, but they'd go substantially higher.” He added: “I think you will have a deal, however.” In other words, the US-China trade war is not over, even if it got dramatically less bad. And tariffs are not being suddenly removed from the president's tool chest. Sector-specific tariffs still loom, including potentially on lumber, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, copper, critical minerals and trucks. Just last week the Commerce Department set the stage for potential aerospace tariffs by launching a national security probe into imports of airplanes, jet engines and parts. “While the agreement prevented an economic decoupling, and that is significant, there are still too many details to be determined, especially those sector tariffs, to remove a recession risk from the table,” Brusuelas said. Deutsche Bank economists expressed relief on Monday about the easing trade war. “The global growth outlook is improving,” Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a report. “American trade policy has turned more conciliatory and there is now a better defined range of tariff outcomes. Of course, uncertainty had almost nowhere to go but down. And it remains to be seen exactly how businesses will respond to levels of uncertainty that Wolfers described as “paralyzingly high.” “It's absolutely a manufactured crisis,” said Holtz-Eakin, who served as an economic adviser to Sen. John McCain during the 2008 presidential campaign. “Today we have good news, but what would really be good news is if someone just took the button away from him.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

Sean ‘Diddy' Combs, right, turns around and looks at the audience during jury selection at Manhattan federal court, Monday, May 5, 2025, in New York. NEW YORK (AP) — The public knew Sean “Diddy” Combs as a larger-than-life cultural icon and business mogul, but behind the scenes, he was coercing women into drug-fueled sexual encounters and using violence to keep them in line, a federal prosecutor told a jury Monday during opening statements in Combs' sex trafficking trial. “This is Sean Combs,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Johnson told the Manhattan jury as she pointed at Combs, who leaned back in his chair. ”... During this trial you are going to hear about 20 years of the defendant's crimes. On the contrary, the trial of Combs is a misguided overreach by prosecutors, who are trying to turn consenting sex between adults into a prostitution and sex trafficking case, Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos said during her opening. “There has been a tremendous amount of noise around this case over the past year. Geragos conceded that Combs' violent outbursts, often fueled by alcohol and drugs, might have warranted domestic violence charges, but not the sex trafficking and racketeering counts he faces. She also told jurors they might think Combs' is a “jerk” and might not condone his “kinky sex,” but “he's not charged with being mean. Combs, wearing a white sweater, entered the packed courtroom shortly before 9 a.m., hugged his lawyers and gave a thumbs up to supporters seated behind him. Combs, 55, pleaded not guilty to a five-count indictment that could land him in prison for at least 15 years if he is convicted on all charges. Lawyers for the three-time Grammy winner say prosecutors are wrongly trying to make a crime out of a party-loving lifestyle that may have been indulgent, but not illegal. Prosecutors say Combs coerced women into drugged-up group sexual encounters he called “freak offs,” “wild king nights” or “hotel nights,” then kept them in line through violence. He is accused of choking, hitting, kicking and dragging women, often by the hair. Johnson told jurors about a night when Combs allegedly kidnapped an employee and threatened his one-time girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura and who is expected to be a key witness. Combs told Cassie that if she defied him again, he would release video of her having sex with a male escort — video that the prosecutor called “souvenirs of the most humiliating nights of her life,” Johnson said. The prosecutor said Combs last year brutally beat another woman — identified only as Jane — when she confronted him about enduring years of freak offs in dark hotel rooms while he took other paramours on date nights and trips around the globe. Their fight a year ago started when Jane slammed Combs' head down in a jealous rage, Geragos said, noting that she didn't want to justify Combs' violence but that the fight wasn't evidence of sex trafficking. The sex parties are central to Combs' sexual abuse, prosecutors say. Combs compelled women, including Cassie, to take drugs and engage in sexual activity with male escorts while he gratified himself and sometimes recorded them, Johnson said. Combs would beat Cassie over the smallest slights, such as leaving a “freak off” without his permission or taking too long in the bathroom, Johnson said. Combs threatened to ruin Cassie's singing career by releasing to the public videos of her engaging in sex with male escorts, the prosecutor said. “Her livelihood depended on keeping him happy,” Johnson said. Combs sat expressionless as he looked toward Johnson and the jury as the prosecutor described what she said was a pattern of violence, sexual abuse and blackmail. The lawsuit was settled within hours of its filing, but it touched off a law enforcement investigation and was followed by dozens of lawsuits from people making similar claims. She told jurors that Cassie demanded $30 million when she sued him, and another witness will acknowledge demanding $22 million in a breach of contract lawsuit. She said a security guard was given a brown paper bag full of $100,000 in cash while Combs' bodyguard and chief of staff stood by. Another witness expected to testify Monday was a security guard at the hotel where Combs assaulted Cassie. Geragos also conceded that Combs is extremely jealous and “has a bad temper,” telling the jury that he sometimes got angry and lashed out when he drank alcohol or “did the wrong drugs.” But, she said, “Domestic violence is not sex trafficking.” Jurors might also see recordings of the freak offs. The Associated Press doesn't generally identify people who say they are victims of sexual abuse unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has done. The trial is expected to last at least eight weeks. Associated Press writer Dave Collins in Hartford, Connecticut, contributed to this report.</p>

A U.S. appeals court will review the Trump administration's bid to avoid returning a 20-year-old Venezuelan asylum seeker who was deported to El Salvador earlier this year, keeping him in Salvadoran custody for now. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed last week to take up Trump's appeal – staying through May 15 a lower court's ruling that required the Trump administration to immediately return him to U.S. soil. The Trump administration will have through 9 a.m. Tuesday to respond. At issue is the case of Daniel Lozano-Camargo, a 20-year-old Venezuelan national previously referred to in court documents as "Cristian," who was deported to El Salvador in March in the Trump administration's early wave of Alien Enemies Act removals. More than 250 individuals deported from the U.S. to El Salvador arrive by plane to the country, including alleged members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, and members of the MS-13 gang, to be processed in the country's CECOT maximum security prison. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, ruled in April that his deportation violated an agreement the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) struck in 2024 with Lozano-Camargo and a group of young asylum seekers who had entered the U.S. as unaccompanied children. Under that agreement, DHS agreed not to deport the migrants in question until their requests for asylum could be fully adjudicated in U.S. court. Last month, Gallagher said Lozano-Camargo's deportation was a "breach of contract," since his asylum case had not yet been heard, and ordered the U.S. government to facilitate his release. A federal judge had ordered President Donald Trump's administration to facilitate the return of a migrant deported to El Salvador. She reiterated that decision in court last week, rejecting a new filing from the Justice Department that said it had determined Lozano-Camargo was eligible for removal under the law, citing his earlier arrest and conviction for cocaine possession in Houston this year. Justice Department officials claimed in earlier court documents that Lozano-Camargo was a member of a "violent terrorist gang" but have not linked him to Tren de Aragua. Portions of their most recent court filing have been redacted. A person holds up a sign referencing the Centre for Terrorism Confinement prison in El Salvador during a May Day demonstration against President Donald Trump and his immigration policies in Houston on May 1, 2025. Gallagher emphasized in court last week that her decision has nothing to do with the strength of his asylum request, and is based solely on due process protections. "I don't think that this is a case about whether or not Cristian is going to eventually get asylum," she told lawyers for the Trump administration. "Whether he ultimately receives asylum is not the issue. The issue is – and has always been – one of process."

More than a ton of cocaine worth $400 million was seized off the coast of Australia during a drug bust that ended with the arrests of five men on Friday, local authorities said. More than a ton of cocaine worth nearly $400 million was seized off the coast of Australia during a drug bust that ended with the arrests of five men on Friday, local authorities said. New South Wales (NSW) Police Force investigators obtained intelligence about a suspicious purchase of a boat with a large sum of cash in late April and began following the movements of the vessel and people involved, the NSW and Australian Federal Police (AFP) said in a joint news release. Both the NSW and AFP monitored their activities as they traveled north via Nelson Bay and Port Macquarie, according to the agencies. When the vessel came back to shore on Friday, marine authorities launched an interception. The approximately 1,110 blocks of cocaine weighed 1.039 tons and had an estimated potential street value of nearly $400 million, authorities said. Authorities discovered approximately 1,110 blocks of cocaine, weighing 1.039 tons, aboard the vessel. The cocaine had an estimated potential street value of nearly $400 million, according to authorities. Two men, aged 24 and 26, were arrested on board the vessel. Three others were arrested on shore when police spotted vehicles trying to leave the area. Two men, aged 24 and 26, were arrested on board the vessel. Three men – aged 28, 29 and 35 – were arrested on shore after investigators stopped two vehicles attempting to leave the area. "The bad news for them is the AFP will continue to work together with our partners to target organized crime syndicates who wrongly believe they can operate with impunity." The two men arrested on the boat were charged with supplying a prohibited drug in a large commercial quantity, while the three men arrested on shore were charged with taking part in supplying a prohibited drug in a large commercial quantity. All five face charges of participating in a criminal group. All five men appeared in court and were denied bail. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Back then, he was known only as Inmate No. Today, at 91 years old, he's ready to discuss his time on “The Rock.” Baker's story began on a cold and foggy morning in January 1957. He wore a standard-issue shirt and pants three sizes too big for his frame. “I was scared s***less,” he told the Washington Examiner. Born in Kentucky during the Great Depression, Baker spent most of his life in and out of federal prison for cashing bad checks. He got criminally good at escaping, so he was sent to the one place no one had escaped from to finish the final three years of his sentence. More than half a century later, Baker is back at Alcatraz. If there was a lesson to be learned at Alcatraz about the consequences of breaking the law, it was lost on Baker. Since then, the National Park Service has turned it into a museum. It's a huge driver of tourism and has kitschy jail-themed souvenirs that include everything from life-size replicas of jail cell keys to shot glasses with a prisoner at the bottom trying to get out. Boatloads of tourists ferry in every half hour, taking self-guided audio tours of the tiny prison cells and learning about the gangsters, murderers, and thieves who, like Baker, once called it home. The snack stand, which sells $6 PB&J sandwiches, has vegan options, such as tahini/chickpea hummus on a whole wheat wrap for $11.25. On board the 15-minute ride is usually a mix of international tourists, TikTokkers, armchair historians, and schoolchildren. “I thought there would be more people here,” Juan Flores told the Washington Examiner. Flores said they purchased tickets online after hearing President Donald Trump wanted to reopen the dilapidated prison. Most people who heard the news, such as Michael Seagman, a tourist from Canada, thought Trump was joking. In a post to Truth Social, Trump wrote, “For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering. When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. “That is why, today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders,” he wrote. The president's push to reopen Alcatraz didn't seem rooted in reality, Baker said. The cell blocks are now three tiers of faded yellow and green cells with peeling paint and rust on the bars. The toilets are mostly cracked and hollowed out, though some have bricks clogging them. None of the equipment works, and most structures are missing simple things such as walls or a roof. Then, there's the bird excrement, something visitors smell before they see. The island's rocky habitat and isolation from mainland predators make it bird heaven and poop hell for those stuck on it. Saying Alcatraz needs an upgrade is a gross understatement. California lawmakers, from both parties, have laughed off Trump's proposal. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), whose district includes Alcatraz, called the president's plan “not a serious one.” “Alcatraz closed as a federal penitentiary more than sixty years ago. It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction. The President's proposal is not a serious one,” she wrote on X. Alcatraz closed as a federal penitentiary more than sixty years ago. It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) said he was taking it “just as seriously as I'm taking the suggestion that he's gonna make Canada the 51st state,” while Rep. Jay Obernolte (R-CA) simply said, “Whatever.</p>

Columbia University student Josh Segal breaks down the moment when anti-Israel protesters stormed a library during finals week on ‘Fox News Live.' Arizona lawmakers have outlawed encampments on public university campuses as protests continue to erupt at schools across the United States. Kate Hobbs last week signed House Bill 2880, which bars people "from establishing or occupying an encampment on a university or community college campus." The law also requires school administrators to direct people who set up encampments to "immediately dismantle" them or vacate the campus. Those who set up encampments may be held liable for damages to campuses, and those who do not leave are subject to trespassing charges. Pro-Palestinian protesters gather on the lawn in front of Arizona State University's historic Old Main building in Tempe, Arizona, on April 26, 2024. Democratic Arizona State Rep. Alma Hernandez introduced the bill, saying in a statement when it passed the Education Committee in February that the legislation "is not about silencing anyone's right to protest." "You still have the right to protest peacefully, but encampments do not have a legal right to be on campus," Hernandez said at the time. Hernandez added that the idea behind the legislation stemmed from the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel when Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, killed 1,200 people and kidnapped hundreds of hostages from a music festival. Meanwhile, students at colleges and universities across the country have participated in large-scale, anti-Israel protests that have, at times, resulted in physical clashes between students and police. Law enforcement arrests a protester before disbanding the encampment at Northern Arizona University on April 30, 2024. "After October 7th, our universities faced significant challenges as they tried negotiating with individuals who made unrealistic demands and refused to remove their encampments," Hernandez said. As a student and a faculty member, I firmly believe in the importance of civil conversations and peaceful protests—these fundamental rights protected by the First Amendment. However, encampments have no legal standing on our campuses. "We must prioritize accountability and ensure that our public institutions remain focused on providing a safe and secure environment," she continued. "These institutions' primary obligation is to support teaching and learning for ALL students. Pro-Palestinian protesters gather on the lawn in front of Arizona State University's historic Old Main building in Tempe, Arizona, on April 26, 2024. Various Democratic lawmakers and activist organizations opposed Hernandez's bill, including CAIR-AZ and ACLU Arizona, which described the bill as an effort to "curb free speech at a time when we must firmly protect people's right to dissent." President Donald Trump has threatened to pull federal funding from schools over antisemitism concerns and deport students who participate in demonstrations expressing support for terrorist organizations. "To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you," the president said in a Jan. 30 fact sheet on the executive order. "I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before."

This book cover image released by Clarkson Potter shows “Salt & Straw: America's Most Iconic Ice Creams” by Tyler Malek and JJ Goode. This image released by Clarskon Potter shows a salted Malted Chocolate chip dough ice cream featured in “Salt & Straw: America's Most Iconic Ice Creams” by Tyler Malek and JJ Goode. NEW YORK (AP) — If you're intimidated by the idea of making ice cream at home, just think of it as making soup. That's advice from Tyler Malek of Salt & Straw, the innovative gourmet ice cream maker known for its ever-changing lick-able treats. “Making a pint of ice cream is very similar to making a pot of soup where if you have a good stock recipe — like chicken stock, vegetable stock — then you start just adding to it until it tastes good,” he says from his kitchen in Portland, Oregon. That ice cream base is also at the heart of Malek's latest cookbook, “ America's Most Iconic Ice Creams: A Salt & Straw Cookbook.” Just as another summer beckons, he and co-author JJ Goode teach the fundamentals, which then can be built on to make all kinds of delicious treats. That means learning the bases for gelato, custard, sorbet, coconut and ice cream. Only down the road can you confidently turn them into awesome flavors like Strawberry Honey Balsamic with Black Pepper, or Banana Parsnip Sherbet. “My dream, at its heart, is that someone can take this book and they just pore through it and have so much fun and then it ignites this Pandora's box of imagination,” Malek says. The cookbook focuses on 10 iconic flavors: vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, coffee, green tea, pistachio, cookie dough, salted caramel, cereal and rum raisin. “We wanted it to feel like you were imported into our R&D test kitchen and you could feel like you're writing recipes beside us and understanding why we're testing this and adding more salt or adding more sweetness,” he says. Take salted caramel, which most people think is salty and sweet. Once you get that flavor trinity, you start understanding that the combination of salty, sweet and bitter can completely open your eyes to different combinations. Since then, they've expanded to over 40 stores in seven states, becoming known for their refreshing and off-beat approach and rotating menu, with new flavors added every month. For Thanksgiving, they once offered Caramelized Turkey & Cranberry Sauce. Salt & Straw leans on xanthan gum, which Malek uses to combat “heat shock,” when ice cream melts and freezes again into bigger crystals. He also harnesses the power of acids, like citric, malic and tartaric, calling them “an ice cream maker's secret weapon.” “I think he is part scientist — maybe a mad scientist — and part artist,” says Clarkson Potter editor Francis Lam, who with Susan Roxborough helped craft the book. Lam first encountered Salt & Straw when he ate their prosciutto ice cream at an event in Portland. At another event, he had their sea urchin flavor and felt compelled to meet Malek. “He's one of these people who doesn't shut down an idea before he runs with it for a little bit,” Lam said. This book cover image released by Clarkson Potter shows “Salt & Straw: America's Most Iconic Ice Creams” by Tyler Malek and JJ Goode. Salt & Straw is part of an artisanal ice cream boom in recent years that includes companies like Van Leeuwen, Gelato Fiasco, Lick Honest Ice Creams, Morgenstern's and Wanderlust Creamery. Malek has leaned on partners for innovations; he and a doughnut maker in Florida, for instance, created a cream cheese ice cream with glazed brioche doughnut chunks and guava curd. If I weren't making ice cream, my dream job was always to be a travel writer,” says Malek. “I had no idea when we first started the company that ice cream is like the coolest medium to channel that through because it really is like writing a story through every single ice cream.” He learned that different regions of the country have their blind spots; when Salt & Straw opened in Los Angeles, few knew what rhubarb was. At the same time, he didn't know there were different types of avocados. Another tip borrowed from soup: As with soup bases, Malek says, home cooks should make big batches of different ice cream bases, separate them into containers and freeze them. “Then when you're ready to make ice cream, defrost it in your microwave real quick and blend in your strawberries that you got fresh from the farmer's market and make strawberry ice cream,” he says. “That's the trick: to make ice cream within a day or literally within hours of finding a really special ingredient.” Here's a recipe from the new cookbook “America's Most Iconic Ice Creams: A Salt & Straw Cookbook” by Tyler Malek and JJ Goode: Freeze until firm, at least 6 hours or for up to 3 months. ¼ teaspoon xanthan gum (yes, I'm easy to find!) In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, milk powder, and xanthan gum. In a medium pot, stir together the whole milk and corn syrup. Add the sugar mixture and immediately whisk vigorously until smooth. Add the cold cream and stir until fully combined. Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 6 hours, or for even better texture and flavor, 24 hours. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour and malt powder. Add the flour mixture to the stand mixer and mix on medium speed, scraping down the bowl once, until there are no more clumps of flour (specks of malt are just fine! Our cookie dough excludes eggs for some just-in-case food safety assurance, since as you've probably heard, consuming raw eggs carries a minor but real risk of salmonella. What you might not be aware of is that eating raw flour does, too. So if you're someone who avoids sunny-side-ups or carbonara, consider playing it extra safe and cooking the flour for this recipe: Spread it on a sheet pan and bake in a 350°F oven for 15 minutes. In a small saucepan, combine the malt powder and 1/4 cup cold water and whisk until most of the lumps are broken up. Add the corn syrup, cream, and butter and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture comes to a simmer. Whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and combined. Let cool to room temperature and then use immediately or store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The House GOP has released its plan to cut Medicaid spending, with the most significant changes affecting eligibility requirements and how states can finance Medicaid. However, some of the biggest sticking points were left out of the bill, including changes to per-capita caps on federal Medicaid payments to states. “Undoubtedly, Democrats will use this as an opportunity to engage in fear-mongering and misrepresent our bill as an attack on Medicaid,” House and Energy Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY) wrote in the Wall Street Journal. The Energy and Commerce Committee has been tasked with finding $880 billion in savings, with many of the cuts expected to come from Medicaid changes. This has worried some centrist Republicans, who sent a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) last week about their concerns over Medicaid cuts. The plan would institute work requirements for able-bodied people on Medicaid. Recipients between 19 and 64, with exceptions for pregnant women and those on disability, would be required to work 80 hours per month to receive benefits. Currently, there is no federal work requirement, though Georgia has a state mandate. Recipients must also verify their eligibility for Medicaid twice a year. They are currently required to verify only once a year. Critics have warned that this could pose a challenge for those who live far from Medicaid offices. The GOP's markup will freeze provider taxes, which are the nonfederal portion of Medicaid funding that states pull in from healthcare provider taxes. Even top Democrats, such as former President Barack Obama, have gone after states' reliance on provider taxes. States are only allowed to levy 6% of a provider's income, taxing both those on and off Medicaid. However, Republicans did not seek to peel back provider taxes already put in place. The federal government will also require states to verify citizenship or visa status for Medicaid recipients. States that fail to do so will be barred from receiving federal Medicaid dollars. The GOP is seeking to bar federal dollars from being used for gender-related treatment and surgeries. This was posed as a possibility for the federal government to cut spending, but some Republican members were wary of it. “In no uncertain terms, millions of Americans will lose their healthcare coverage,” Pallone said.</p>

(AP Photo/Andres Kudacki) PITTSBURGH (AP) — At Perry Traditional Academy, students took time out from classes on a recent Thursday to listen quietly in the school auditorium while a small group of their classmates questioned the four candidates running in Pittsburgh's upcoming mayoral primary. After the candidates left, they had a short oral civics test on elections, with prizes for correct answers. What's happening in Pittsburgh and surrounding Allegheny County is part of a national trend. Young people have consistently turned out to vote at lower rates than older Americans. Voters were also much older than nonvoters, on average, in the 2018 and 2022 midterm elections, according to Pew. Others, such as The Gem Project Inc., in Newark, New Jersey, have pushed for students to be able to register and cast ballots in local elections before they turn 18. Breanna Quist, 18, and one of the recent registrants in Newark, said the push was especially important to her because it allowed students to vote for an office, school board, that directly affects them. Nishani Ward, 16, said it was an inspiration when Newark lowered the voting age for local elections. “Doing this right now, I'm more likely to do it in the future and do it more routinely in the future,” she said. Even though the youth vote tends to bend left politically, this might be a good time to reconsider the minimum age because it's become less predictable, said Daniel Hart, a professor of psychology at Rutgers University who has studied lowering the voting age. Data from AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters in all 50 states, found that Democrat Kamala Harris had a slight edge over Republican Donald Trump among young voters, but young men swung to the right for Trump even if they didn't agree with him on all issues. During a workshop earlier this year, one student attendee asked why the candidates didn't come speak to them, Golman said: ”And we all thought, yes, why not, and worked to make it happen.” Makaila Nyambe, 17, asked each mayoral candidate about funding for schools, while fellow junior Deahmi Mobley questioned how they might establish a good relationship between law enforcement and teens. Trash, homelessness and public safety came up constantly, along with a disagreement over whether more school spending would improve academic performance. Infrastructure, road repairs and cuts to public transit also generated discussion. The students listened closely when all four candidates talked about neighborhood policing and building relationships -- and about the importance of young people at such a forum. “You are the future of Pittsburgh,” said another candidate, Thomas West, a business owner and former television news producer. Stalea Chapman, a 17-year-old senior, said afterward she was glad the candidates were taking the students seriously and reaching out to them because their futures are intertwined with politics and policies, especially now. “It is a lot of pressure being young and seeing what the economy is turning to and what's going on in the world,” she said. “It's frightening for young people because we want to be successful.” Associated Press Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed to this article.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? From image generation to writing, ranking the best — and worst — of AI. Staying on top of AI developments is a full-time job. I would know, because it's my full-time job. I subscribe to Anthropic's Pro mode for access to their latest model, Claude 3.7, in “extended thinking” mode; I have a complementary subscription to OpenAI's Enterprise mode so that I can test out their latest models, o3 and o4-mini-high (more later on OpenAI's absurd naming scheme! ), and make lots of images with OpenAI's new image generation model 4o, which is so good I have cancelled my subscription to my previous image generation tool Midjourney. I subscribe to Elon Musk's Grok 3, which has one of my favorite features of any AI, and I've tried using the Chinese AI agent platform Manus for shopping and scheduling. And while that exhausts my paid subscription budget, it doesn't include all the AIs I work with in some form. In just the month I spent writing this piece, Google massively upgraded its best AI offering, Gemini 2.5, and Meta released Llama 4, the biggest open source AI model yet. So what do you do if keeping up with AI developments is not your full-time job, but you still want to know which AI to use when in ways that genuinely improve your life, without wasting time on the models that can't? This article is a detailed, Consumer Reports-style dive into which AI is the best for a wide range of cases and how to actually use them, all based on my experience with real-world tasks. But first, the disclosures: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI, but our reporting remains editorially independent. Future Perfect is funded in part by the BEMC Foundation, whose major funder was also an early investor in Anthropic; they don't have any editorial input into our content either. My wife works at Google, though not in any area related to their AI offerings; for this reason, I usually don't cover Google, but in a piece like this, it'd be irresponsible to exclude it. The good thing is that this piece doesn't require you to trust me about my editorial independence; I show my work. I encourage you to compare their answers and decide for yourself if I picked the right one to recommend. For that reason, most artists can't stand it. Given that, is it defensible to use AI art at all? I think in a just world OpenAI would certainly compensate some artists — and in a just world, Congress would be moving to lay out the limits on artistic borrowing. At the same time, I am increasingly convinced that existing copyright law is a poor fit for this problem. That means no generative AI art in someone else's style for commercial purposes, but it's fine to play around with your family photos. OpenAI's new 4o image creation mode is the best AI out there for generating images, by a large margin. Midjourney is probably what you think of when you think of AI art: It produces mystical, haunting, visually beautiful stuff, and has some great tools for improving and editing your final results, like touching up someone's hair while leaving everything else in place. The big thing that 4o can do, which no model before could reliably pull off, is take a picture that didn't come out well and turn it into a beautiful work of art, all while still preserving the character of the original. For example, here's a still from a video of my wife and I singing “Happy Birthday” to our baby on her first birthday: So I asked ChatGPT to render it in the style of Norman Rockwell, a mid-century illustrator whose work I love, and got this: It's this capability that made 4o go viral recently in a way that no image generator before it had. You'll notice that it's a seemingly, uh, completely different family, with no real inspiration from the original at all! You can eventually get a better result than this out of Midjourney, but only by spending weeks becoming a pro at prompting with the platform's highly specific language and toolset. By contrast, ChatGPT was able to give me a far superior output on the first try in response to a simple request without specialized language. The difference between 4o and other image models is most notable with this kind of request, but it's better for almost everything else I use images for, too. The product you get out of the box is pretty good, and it's not hard to produce something much better. That, ideally, is what we should be getting out of our AI tools — something amazing that can be created with simple language by a nonexpert. But even there, you no longer need Midjourney — Gemini now has that capability for free. To get good images out of 4o, you'll first need to get around the filters which prohibit a wide range of images — like offensive or pornographic images — but which are often enforced against perfectly inoffensive content in a way that can feel random. To avoid sporadic scoldings from the content filter, don't ask for work in the style of a specific artist, but rather, something that is reminiscent of that artist, and then ask specifically for a “style transfer.” I'm sure that's not the only adequate workaround, but it's one that has proven reliable for me. But Studio Ghibli's style is much more than just cute, and with a little more prompting, you can get much better results. But here's what you get if you invite 4o to think first about what makes the picture Ghibli, where it might fit into a Studio Ghibli movie, and what tiny details such a movie would include: The differences are subtle but meaningful: Light is cast from a specific source, instead of a general sourceless brightness. A few years ago, one great oddity of language models was that they'd be much smarter if you simply told them, “give an intelligent answer.” This isn't nearly as true of language models anymore, but it remains profoundly true of AI art generation. The difference is more pronounced for more realistic art styles (like pencil illustration, photorealism, or oil paintings), which don't always look good and will often hit the uncanny valley if you don't know how to prompt the AI over it. Here's what I get with 4o if I upload a picture of me and my youngest daughter at the beach for the first time with just the words “please do a style transfer to an illustration reminiscent of Rockwell”: This is impressive for an AI, but it's not actually very good as a work of art, and it is almost totally lacking Norman Rockwell's magic. That's not surprising: More realistic art styles like Rockwell's often fall flat with 4o unless you're able to put in some work in getting the AI to draw them properly. If you are, here's the strategy I recommend: Don't just upload one picture, but a whole cluster of them, each in slightly different postures and moments. Upload good, clear pictures of each family member's face and tell the AI they've been included as a reference. I want an illustration that captures this moment in the style of a mid-century illustrator like Norman Rockwell — something sharp, detail-oriented, and personal with an eye for the magic of ordinary moments and the joys of ordinary lives. Before you generate the image, let's have a conversation about the essential elements of Rockwell's style, what he'd bring to this picture and how we can capture it. I'd love to talk about how to capture this moment in a Norman Rockwell-inspired illustration — it's such a perfect candidate for that style: a first encounter with something vast and wild (the ocean! Let's break down some essential elements of Rockwell's style, and how they could apply to this scene. After some back and forth, it produced this: But this is much better than the first draft we just looked at. You can also ask 4o to revise its drawings, but you can really only ask this once: After the first revision, in my experience, it starts making the drawings worse and worse, perhaps because the “context” it uses is now full of its own bad drafts. This is also the one place where Midjourney still shines — it has very good tools for editing one specific part of a picture while preserving the overall style, something 4o largely lacks. These simple prompting strategies work for almost whatever you're trying to do with the AI. Even if you're in a hurry, I highly recommend asking the AI “what would [artist] see in this image” before you ask for a rendition, and if you have the time, I recommend having a long back-and-forth about your vision. When Elon Musk's X.AI released Grok 3, it came with an incredible feature that I've been impatiently waiting for some other company to replicate: a button to scan someone's X profile and tell you all about them. Whenever someone replies to one of my tweets in a particularly memorable way (for good or for bad), I'll click the button to get a summary of their entire Twitter presence. Are they a “farmer from Nebraska” who mostly posts about why Ukraine is bad (that is, probably a bot)? So, of course, X.AI soon dramatically weakened it, presumably because people like me were using it constantly and making lots of computationally expensive queries. I believe it no longer uses the most advanced Grok model, and it definitely now only scans a few days of profile history. But there's a brilliant product opportunity if anyone's looking for one — give me back the good version of this feature! It's definitely a guilty pleasure, but it is one of the only cases where I was using AI constantly. I'm not an artist, so the ways that AIs are imperfect at art don't really bother me — it's still much better than I could do myself! But I am a fiction writer, so when it comes to fiction, I can't help seeing the limitations of AI. The most important one is how predictable AI creative writing tends to be. But they can't, as yet, deliver the real stuff of good fiction. AIs are fantastic if you want a silly bedtime story with your child as the protagonist (kids love this), or if you want a sounding board for ideas you can incorporate into your own work. They're also a friendly fiction reader, happy to offer feedback and analysis (perhaps with a little bit too much enthusiasm). Martin's A Game of Thrones (I picked this because, of course, the ultimate dream is an AI that can finish this otherwise doomed-to-be-unfinished series). Here's a side-by-side comparison of Martin and AIs attempting to imitate him. We should start back,” Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them. “If he says they are dead, that's proof enough for me.” Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather than sooner. Ser Waymar Royce, third son of some southern lordling, rode ahead as if on parade, oblivious or uncaring of the hairs prickling on Gared's neck. Young Will shivered beside him, not just from the frost, his eyes darting towards shadows that seemed too deep, too still. This ancient forest held its breath tonight, Gared knew, waiting for something far worse than raiders to break the unnatural hush. Harren drew his cloak tighter about his shoulders, watching the darkness between trees as though it might breathe, move, and claim him. But now Harren felt their arrogance dwindling like a candle guttering in wind, each snap of a branch sending icy tendrils down his spine. Behind them, quiet and watchful, Maester Rodrik whispered a prayer to gods long abandoned, his voice trembling with dread beneath the vast, indifferent sky. The wind howled through the jagged spires of the Frostfang Reaches, carrying a chill that bit deeper than any blade, and Ser Willem Cray felt its teeth in his bones. The night was too quiet, the kind of quiet that smothered sound and sharpened fear, and Willem's eyes darted to the shadowed pines below, where shapes might move—or might not. He was a knight of House Drayce, sworn to patrol the borderlands, but no oath could warm him against the dread that coiled in his gut. Beside him, young Tomm, barely a man, shivered in his cloak, his spear trembling as he whispered, “They're out there, ser, ain't they?” Willem said nothing, but his gaze fixed on the darkness, where a faint, unnatural glow pulsed once, then vanished. Whatever stalked the Reaches tonight was no mere brigand, and Willem Cray, for all his years of service, feared he would not live to name it. “We should turn back,” whispered Tommen, his breath forming crystals in the air that seemed to hang suspended longer than they should. Ser Gareth ignored him, scanning the treeline where the ancient sentinels stood like silent watchers, their branches heavy with snow that had fallen three days past and showed no sign of melting. “Three rangers missing, and Lord Commander Harlow will have answers.” You'll notice that not only are these all much worse than Martin's (and that's with Martin's work almost certainly in the training data! That's not to say they're all the same. In my experience trying to teach AIs to write well, I did end up feeling that Gemini was the quickest study (free tier) and that ChatGPT 4.5 had some special sauce (paid tier). ChatGPT 4.5 is the only AI whose fiction writing has made people say in surprise, “Wow, that's AI written?” Both of those models, to me, seemed more creative and more capable of executing on their ideas with prose that I enjoyed reading. Gestalt impressions don't make for a very satisfying consumer review, so I had another idea: an essay contest. I asked each of Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGPT 4.5, Grok, and Claude to write two short stories: one realistic fiction about a woman being nitpicked by her mother on her wedding day, and one “Game of Thrones but in space” sci-fi prologue. Just like with art, however, you can make AIs much better at writing through the power of prompting. Here's Gemini 2.5 pro, asked to write two-sentence flash fiction on a topic of its choosing, without any structured prompting: ​​The old librarian insisted the dusty tome had never been checked out, its borrower's card completely blank. Yet, tucked deep within its pages, nestled between chapters on forgotten constellations, lay a pressed four-leaf clover, still impossibly green. And here's Gemini 2.5 pro with a prompt encouraging structured thinking about how to write well: He finally decoded the faint signal from Proxima Centauri: the elegant string of prime numbers astronomers had sought for generations, proof they weren't alone. To my mind, the first of these is basically a waste of two sentences, while the second is adequate, fun flash fiction. In addition to running AIs through a blizzard of competence tests, I also spent some time simply chatting with them. Most AIs weren't great at this kind of casual conversation. Gemini 2.5 is too customer-service-agent, and I have yet to experience an interaction that feels like hanging out with a friend. If you invite Gemini to a role swap where you play the “assistant,” inviting it to steer the conversation, it'll do nothing but ask research questions. It's hard to define “fun to talk to,” since everyone has different standards for conversations, but I've had far more fascinating or thought-provoking interactions with Claude than any other model, and it's my go-to if I want to explore ideas rather than accomplish a particular task. Claude 3.5 is the AI I bug with my random life stuff: skincare questions, thoughts on an article I read, stuff like that. I find extended conversations with it thought-provoking and fascinating, and there have been a few thrilling moments in conversation with it where it felt like I was engaging with real intelligence. But OpenAI has very tight message limits on conversation unless you spring for the $200/month Pro plan, and 4.5 is grindingly slow, which gets in the way of this kind of casual conversational use. But 4.5 does provide a tantalizing hint that AIs will continue to get better as conversationalists as we improve them along other dimensions. It's not the best at everything, and there is certainly a lot to dislike about OpenAI's transparency and sometimes cavalier attitude toward safety. Or if you don't want to shell out any money, Gemini 2.5 Pro is very, very strong for most use cases — don't count Google out just because the AI you see on a Google search isn't that good. For the last several months, I've developed a slightly morbid habit: checking whether the AIs can take my job. I feed them the research notes that form the basis of a given Future Perfect newsletter, give them a few Future Perfect newsletters as an example, and ask them to do my job for me. It is always with some trepidation that I hit “enter.” After all, when the AIs can write the Future Perfect newsletter, why would Vox pay me to do it? Not bad, but bad enough that if I sent one of them over, my editor would notice I wasn't at my best — and that's with all of my research notes! A couple of the metaphors fall flat, some of the asides are confusing, and occasionally it throws in a reference that it doesn't explain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tufts University PhD student Rümeysa Öztürk spent 45 days in a detention center more than 1,500 miles from that home, accused by federal authorities of participating in pro-terrorist activities. The judge who ordered Öztürk's release emphasized the administration's failure to submit any evidence to support that accusation throughout her lengthy detention. Öztürk's case is one in a series of arrests targeting international students involved in pro-Palestinian activism that has sparked widespread concerns about free speech on university grounds. Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk arrives back home after spending six weeks at a Louisiana detention center It's been two months since Immigration and Customs Enforcement began targeting students and scholars in often dramatic arrests by masked officers, leaving the international community on edge about their most fundamental rights. On March 25, Öztürk, a 30-year-old Turkish national, was seized by masked federal agents near her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment close to the Tufts University campus, where she is a PhD student. On her way to an Iftar dinner at sunset, Öztürk was surrounded and restrained by six plainclothes officers. Öztürk was arrested a year after co-authoring a campus newspaper op-ed critical of Tufts' response to the Gaza war, which her attorneys argue made her a target of the administration's efforts to suppress pro-Palestinian speech in violation of her constitutional rights. At a three-hour hearing, US District Judge William K. Sessions III also heard from three other witnesses about Öztürk's community work and her asthma attacks, which her attorneys say were not adequately treated while she was in custody. The judge found Öztürk had raised “substantial claims” of due process and First Amendment violations, saying her “continued detention potentially chills the speech of millions.” As Trump's immigration crackdown continues, ethics questions are being raised over the use of masked federal agents Sessions emphasized that for weeks, the government failed to produce any evidence to support Öztürk's continued detention, except for the year-old op-ed. Moshen Mahdawi, a 34-year-old student and prominent activist at Columbia University, spent more than two weeks in detention before he was freed on bond on April 30. In pushing for Mahdawi's deportation, the Trump administration has argued that his activism undermines its foreign policy goals. The federal judge who ordered Mahdawi's release found that the Columbia student has presented a “substantial claim” that his arrest was an attempt to suppress dissenting speech. He moved to the US in 2014 and became a permanent resident. He was in an interview to finalize his US citizenship when federal authorities took him into custody on April 14, in what Mahdawi has described as “a setup.” He also vowed to maintain his activism, telling supporters, “Where (do) we go from this? Last week Mahdawi helped launch a $1 million fundraising campaign to bolster a legal safety net for immigrants in Vermont, where his legal case is continuing, the Associated Press reported. Legal filings in Khan Suri's case describe bleak detention conditions. His attorneys said he was being housed “in a crowded unit, sleeping on the floor” and was given no religious accommodations for Ramadan in March. Judge says Trump administration can't deport Georgetown University fellow The prolonged detention has also disrupted his academic career. Harvard Medical School researcher Kseniia Petrova, a Russian national, describes herself as a “nerdy 30-year-old scientist” who “only want(s) to be in the lab.” The Department of Homeland Security accuses her of lying to federal officials and deliberately trying to smuggle frog embryo samples into the US from Paris. In a statement this month, Petrova admitted that she failed to review US customs protocols but said she believed the embryos – “non-toxic, non-hazardous and non-infectious” – would not cause issues. She insists she “never provided false information to any government official” but rather that “some of my words were misunderstood and inaccurately reflected in the statement that the officer presented for my signature.” Petrova claims her requests to correct the statement were ignored. “I take full responsibility for not properly declaring the frog embryo samples,” Petrova said. “What I do not understand is why the American officials say I am a danger to the community and a flight risk.” Petrova's case appears to reflect the Trump administration's systematic approach of using minor offenses as a basis for deportation. “She has made herself crucial to pretty much every project that's going on in the lab. I don't know how we're gonna continue without her,” a principal research scientist at Harvard's Department of Systems Biology said of Petrova. Petrova's detention has drawn support from colleagues, who have sent her science books and letters of encouragement, with some visiting her in Louisiana. A court hearing in Vermont later this month could determine whether Petrova will be released – or deported to Russia, where she risks arrest for her opposition to the war in Ukraine, her attorney says. Born a Palestinian refugee in Syria, Columbia University graduate and US permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil emerged in early March as the face of the Trump administration's crackdown on campus activism by international students. Khalil, who played a prominent role in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia last summer, was arrested near his on-campus home – where he lived with his then-pregnant wife – on March 8 after being accused of engaging in activities in support of Hamas. Palestinian activist detained by ICE over Columbia University protests President Trump called Khalil's detention in March “the first arrest of many to come.” How the Palestinian activist's legal case plays out could have major implications for those detained after him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four months into his first term, Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) introduced a framework on Monday that addresses the “broken” state of America's border and brings illegal immigrants “out of the shadows,” known as “Securing the Border and Fueling Economic Prosperity.” “We don't have to choose between border security and immigration reform,” Gallego said in a statement. Americans deserve the right to feel safe and know their border is secure, but for decades, Congress has tried and failed to take action because politics got in the way. It's time to push forward and enact a plan that works.” It includes five pillars for any legislation on the two interrelated issues. Second, the asylum process should be addressed in a way that ends abuse of bogus claims and speeds up the yearslong court process while treating asylum-seekers with “dignity and respect,” Gallego's plan states. Legal immigration avenues should be expanded to grow the U.S. economy while still protecting American workers. “We must do right by these communities by giving them their shot at the American dream so they can prosper in the country that has provided so much to families like mine,” Gallego said. It's a fight that millions of immigrants in this country understand. Finally, other countries should do “their fair share” to resettle asylum-seekers and receive help from the U.S. to address drug cartels, economic problems, and instability. Last year, three senators proposed a bipartisan border bill, but Republicans refused to back it. Gallego, elected to the Senate last year in purple Arizona, is seen as a possible 2028 presidential contender for his appeal to working-class, independent, and Latino voters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Victory has a thousand fathers, as they say, but defeat is an orphan. And so it goes after the brief but bruising conflict between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan with both sides loudly talking up their successes while quietly down-playing losses. On India's frantic television news channels, minutes after a US-brokered ceasefire came into force, the headline “Pakistan Surrenders” was splashed across the screens. India's military action against Pakistan, sparked by the killing of tourists in India-administered Kashmir last month, sent a bold message to terrorists, India's defense minister, Rajnath Singh, said later. “In a few hours our jets silenced India's guns in a way that history will not soon forget,” Sharif said, while an effigy of his Indian counterpart burned outside. But this was an eruption of violence between two nuclear-armed neighbors in which both sides delivered and suffered heavy blows. As CNN earlier reported, two planes crashed in Indian states that border Pakistan around the time Pakistan claimed to have shot down the jets, and a French intelligence source told CNN that Pakistan had downed at least one Indian Rafale. But Indian officials are still refusing to acknowledge even a single aircraft loss. Meanwhile, India has released new satellite images showing serious damage to air strips and radar stations at what Indian defense officials say are multiple Pakistani military bases crippled by massive Indian airstrikes. There's even a struggle to take credit for what were clearly US-brokered negotiations that led to the ceasefire, announced almost out of the blue by US President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform. Amid a rapidly deteriorating security situation at the weekend, which threatened to spin out of control, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he and Vice President JD Vance called political and military leaders on both sides urging them to hold back. But Indian leaders are playing down any US role, saying the truce was worked out between India and Pakistan directly. The reason is likely to be driven by national pride, with Indian officials loathe to admit a truce was imposed on them, or even brokered, by the United States. India also has a long-standing policy of refusing to allow foreign mediation when it comes to the status of Muslim-majority Kashmir - a disputed region claimed by both India and Pakistan in its entirety - which has been at the center of the latest conflict with Pakistan and which India regards as a strictly internal matter. Nevertheless, perhaps buoyed by his quick ceasefire win, President Trump has offered to help the two countries find a lasting solution “after a thousand years” concerning Kashmir. And if you think the Indian and Pakistani claims of victory both ring a bit hollow now, just wait until the simmering Kashmir dispute, inevitably, boils over once again.</p>
