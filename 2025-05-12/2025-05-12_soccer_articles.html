                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alyssa Thompson scored a key goal for Angel City FC while abroad, Korbin Albert and Lindsey Heaps each scored over the weekend in their respective Premi√®re Ligue semifinal matches.The two U.S. midfielders will meet in the final on May 16 at Groupama Stadium in Lyon, site of the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Final. The Angel City forward is currently tied for fourth in goals in the NWSL with fellow USWNT player pool members Emma Sears and Ashley Hatch, among others. Press has played 15 games since returning last year from a knee injury that had kept her sidelined since she suffered an ACL tear in 2022. Thompson later scored in stoppage time (90+5) just before the final whistle blew. Midfielder Claire Hutton continues to show well for Kansas City Current (6-2-0, 18 points) who are back at the top of the NWSL. The Current beat Bay FC 4-1 on Sunday as Hutton contributed an assist to Brazilian Debinha's goal in the 33rd minute. Hutton recorded her second assist of 2025 in eight matches so far. The 19-year-old defender was fired up after her second USWNT cap and start in April. Paris Saint-Germain (16-2-4, 52 points) and Olympique Lyon (20-0-2, 62 points) advanced to the Premi√®re Ligue Final, in part, thanks to USWNT players Korbin Albert and Lindsey Heaps. Heaps scored the team's second goal just before halftime (45+2). Albert and PSG took down Paris FC 3-0 in the other semifinal. Albert scored on a nifty finish in second-half stoppage time (90+1) to cap the victory. She tallied a single goal last season and none in her first professional year. Both Albert and Dunn's club will face off against Heaps' Lyon in the final May 16 to decide the title. Naomi Girma and Catarina Macario celebrated the Women's Super League title last week, but in the season finale, they helped complete Chelsea's (19-0-3, 60 points) undefeated season, beating Liverpool 1-0. It looked like Chelsea was headed for a draw, which still would have kept Chelsea unbeaten on the season, but Aggie Beever-Jones scored the game-winner in stoppage time (90+1). In other WSL news, Emily Fox and Arsenal (15-4-3, 48 points) beat Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Manchester United (13-4-5, 44 points) 4-3 in the final regular season match for both clubs. Next, Arsenal will face Barcelona in the UEFA Women's Champions League Final May 24, while Manchester United will battle Chelsea in the FA Cup Final May 18.</p>

Ancelotti will leave the club following their final game in La Liga this season on May 25, when they host Real Sociedad, to take the Brazil job he has long been linked to. He officially starts with Brazil on May 26 and will be in charge for their World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Paraguay on June 7 and June 10, respectively, when the national team's final preparations for the 2026 World Cup will begin. He becomes the latest high-profile manager to leave the club game for a job in charge of a national team in time for the 2026 World Cup, a list that includes the U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino, England's Thomas Tuchel and Germany's Julian Nagelsmann. Ancelotti's hire definitely adds another layer of allure to next year's tournament, but is also a stark reminder of the task ahead for Brazil. The five-time World Cup winners have been somewhat directionless since their quarterfinal exit to Croatia at the 2022 World Cup, so much so that they won just two of their opening six games during the 2026 qualifying campaign and were eliminated in the quarterfinals of last year's Copa America. The new head coach will be tasked with correcting course and finally getting the best of a talented attacking group that is headlined by Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo, who have not excelled for the national team the way they have for Ancelotti's Real Madrid. As for Real Madrid, Ancelotti leaves a club that he has become synonymous with during two incredibly impressive spells, so much so that he said that "the honeymoon [period] with Madrid will be until the last day of my life," in a press conference on Saturday, the end clearly in sight. He won three of his five UEFA Champions League titles with Real Madrid, becoming the most successful manager in the competition's history, and also collected two La Liga trophies along the way. Though the France international has been a helpful addition, this season offered reminder after reminder that the squad was unbalanced and that improvements in several areas of the pitch are needed. Ancelotti returned to Madrid in 2021 to steady the ship, but a true period of transition awaits now that the Italian manager has confirmed his exit. One team essentially has their spot in the playoff final booked ‚Äì Sheffield United. United are targeting a return to the Premier League after finishing last place in last season's competition, sticking by manager Chris Wilder through it all with the hopes of bouncing back up to England's top flight. Things will likely be a bit more competitive on Tuesday in Sunderland, who host Coventry City while boasting a 2-1 advantage after the first leg. Wilson Isidor and Eliezer Mayenda scored to give Sunderland a slim lead as the team targets their first Premier League season since the 2016-17 season, when they finished last. The Black Cats have been on a dramatic journey since, immediately getting relegated to League One after another last place finish and spending four seasons in England's third division before returning to the Championship for the 2022-23 campaign. Each team targets a spot in the promotion playoff final on May 24 at London's Wembley Stadium, otherwise known as the sport's richest game. A spot in the Premier League, after all, comes with a prize pot of hundreds of millions ‚Äì Sheffield United pocketed around $145 million for participating in the top flight despite finishing last place, much more than the roughly $65 million they earned in the Championship this season as a "first year" relegated team. It nearly cements Barcelona as La Liga's champions, a feat few predicted for them at the start of the season. ü™Ω Savy King update: Angel City defender Savy King is responsive after collapsing during her team's 2-0 win over the Utah Royals on Friday. üîÆ Real Madrid's future: With Xabi Alonso's hire imminent, here's a look at the work Real Madrid will need to do in the transfer window and which players could benefit from the new manager's arrival. : Xabi Alonso might not be the only big name leaving Bayer Leverkusen this summer ‚Äì star midfielder Florian Wirtz is reportedly close to joining their domestic rivals, Bayern Munich. üìâ First to worst: The LA Galaxy are officially off to the worst start by a reigning MLS Cup champion with zero wins in their first 12 games, achieving that feat in spectacular form with a 7-0 loss to the New York Red Bulls on Saturday. ‚òÄÔ∏è Morning Footy (Weekdays 8-10 a.m.): Join Golazo Network as it helps fans get their day started on the right foot on the network's flagship morning show with highlights, interviews and the biggest soccer storylines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Flying Eagles edged past the reigning African champions in a dramatic penalty shootout, after a tense 120 minutes ended goalless at the Suez Canal Stadium in Ismailia. Goalkeeper Ebenezer Harcourt emerged as the hero, saving spot-kicks from Pierre Dorival and Mame Mor Faye, while Ousmane Konate's attempt rattled the crossbar. In addition to securing a spot at the global football showpiece in Chile, the seven-time African champions have also reached the AFCON U20 semi-finals, where they will face either South Africa or DR Congo. ‚ÄúWe don't want to pursue two things at the same time,‚Äù coach Aliyu Zubair had told the media. That's where all our attention is. ‚ÄúWe respect all opponents, including Senegal as defending champions. But Nigeria has been in that position before. This time, we are coming to be the ones to stop them and run our race into the semi-finals.‚Äù Their best performance to date remains a second-place finish, achieved in the 1989 and 2005 editions in Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands, respectively. Despite defeating the hosts in the previous round, Ladan Bosso's boys fell short against South Korea, losing 1-0 after extra time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlo Ancelotti has won two Champions League trophies since returning to Real Madrid in 2021 Carlo Ancelotti has agreed to take over as head coach of the Brazil national team. It is one of the most eye-catching appointments in international football history. "Ancelotti was the main choice because he has an unrivalled tradition of success, winning in five countries," said South American football expert Tim Vickery. Brazil's footballing dominance has fallen away in the last two decades. Despite lifting two Copa America titles in that time, in 2007 and 2019, their record at the World Cup - the ultimate measure of success - has been disappointing Belgium got the better of Brazil in a 2018 quarter-final, while 2022 trophy hopes were dashed by defeat to Croatia on penalties in the last eight. Managers have come and gone in recent years amid the clamour for a winning team. Tite, respected for bringing a sense of order and pride, stepped down as planned after Qatar 2022. Vickery said: "We were hearing last year that the senior players weren't sold on Dorival Junior, but there will be none of that with Carlo Ancelotti. Flamengo manager Jorge Jesus celebrates winning the Copa Libertadores in 2019 Only three non-Brazilians have ever led the side, and they coached just seven games in all. The sense had always been that only a Brazilian could truly understand what it means to play football there. This culture changed soon after Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus, who was linked in recent reports, external as another candidate for the Brazil job, took over in 2019 at Flamengo. His arrival initially came amid doubts that a pragmatic European system could bring success. His team won 43 of their 57 games before Jesus left in July 2020. Since then there has been a domestic shift and acceptance of foreign coaching in the country - and this is now translating to the international stage. "This is an important wall coming down," Vickery told BBC Sport. Ancelotti will be the first true European titan at the helm, with a decorated trophy cabinet that includes five Champions League titles and domestic trophy success in Italy, England, France, Spain and Germany. One of Ancelotti's greatest strengths lies in his ability to steady teams without drama. His famously calm demeanour, often typified by little more than a raised eyebrow in the heat of a big moment, has helped some of the world's most powerful dressing rooms find stability. "Ancelotti was the main choice because he has an unrivalled tradition of success," said Vickery. Although the 2024-25 season at Real Madrid has proved tricky, with his team losing to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final and being knocked out in the Champions League quarter-finals by Arsenal, past achievements count for a lot with Ancelotti. He cultivated an elite culture and mindset throughout his time in the Spanish capital. For evidence of this we need look no further than Real's stunning run to the 2022 Champions League title under Ancelotti. That Real team benefited from the coach's tactical expertise but also performed with exceptional emotional composure. I came from Brazil, pressure is normal for us - Joao Pedro Ancelotti's gift lies in having blended these identities throughout his career. His AC Milan teams of the early 2000s included such luminaries as Paolo Maldini, Andrea Pirlo and Kaka. They played a controlled, elegant brand of football that was defensively resilient yet could be breathtaking when going forward. He applied much the same approach during his second stint at Madrid, which began in June 2021. There was structure without suffocation, allowing Brazilian talents like Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo to express themselves while maintaining discipline. You could also see a return for Manchester United midfielder Casemiro to shore up their midfield - which has been one of the main positions of concern." Carlo Ancelotti has worked with Brazilians including Eder Militao, Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo, Casemiro and Endrick during his time at Real Madrid Vinicius, in particular, has seen his club career take off. Despite dazzling on domestic duty in Spain, though, his performances for Brazil have often been underwhelming and his record shows a modest six goals from 39 caps. Critics argue, external he struggles with the different tactical set-ups, but Ancelotti knows how to get the best out of him ‚Äì simplifying his role, boosting his confidence, and  providing freedom within a structured system. Make no mistake: appointing Ancelotti is a seismic move for Brazil, a statement that they are willing to change to regain their place at football's summit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlo Ancelotti's long-rumoured takeover of Brazil's national team was made official on Monday, leaving Real Madrid without a manager ahead of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. While Brazil's future is set with 13 months to go until the 2026 FIFA World Cup, what about Real Madrid? Who will manage the famed side during next month's FIFA Club World Cup and beyond? When murmurs of Ancelotti's desire to link up with Brazil started several months ago, a few names were thrown about in media reports as potential replacements. As time went on, however, one name stood out more than the rest: Xabi Alonso. The former Real Madrid, Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Spain midfielder has gone on to become a successful manager, leading Bayer Leverkusen to a historic treble last season. The club will also finish second in the Bundesliga this season, cementing Alonso's reputation as a manager that can compete every year, and his playing days at Real Madrid make him an ideal replacemment for Ancelotti. The 43-year-old is reportedly close to confirming a three-year contract with Los Blancos, with multiple reports on Monday indicating that the deal has already been agreed. According to those same reports, Alonso would take over the La Liga giants in time for the FIFA Club World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's the business end of the season for many of Europe's USMNT stars with trophies, qualification for UEFA competition and pride at stake in a high-pressure week of finals and fights to the end. We've been keeping track of all the U.S. emigres as they ply their trade across Europe's elite leagues and give national coach Mauricio Pochettino plenty to think about ahead of the USMNT's summer fixtures. Grab the popcorn because Christian Pulisic and Milan's season has reached peak box office. As they head into the final stretch of a tumultuous campaign, they are somehow still clinging onto hopes of Champions League qualification through their Serie A placing, and could also bag a major domestic trophy this midweek that would guarantee Europa League participation next term. And they did not falter on Friday, beating Bologna 3-1 at San Siro courtesy of a Santiago Gimenez brace and Pulisic's quick reactions to convert Joao Felix's blocked shot ‚Äî a come-from-behind win that will pep belief for the weeks to come. So now it's another match-up with the same opponents on Wednesday in the Coppa Italia final before Sunday's journey to Rome, where victory would put them level with Claudio Ranieri's men. It would be a remarkable comeback if Milan did it, but at the very least a win on Wednesday would also see this up-and-down season conclude with both domestic trophies in the cabinet. Perhaps they are not what clubs with Milan's ambitions covet most when compared to the money-spinning, profile-boosting Champions League, but they are something to savour at least for the fans. There does seem to be some much-needed momentum behind Pulisic & Co. In contrast, at Juventus, who are clinging onto fourth spot currently, Weston McKennie and Tim Weah find themselves on the other end of the traction train. The midfielder's movement was smart and he sent over the cross from which Randal Kolo Muani scored from on 51 minutes. It will be fascinating to see what Pulisic and McKennie can do during their respective team's dramatic run-ins. The Turin club face mid-table Udinese before a tricky final day trip to confront a Venezia team who might still be fighting for survival. But speaking of magical momentum, Malik Tillman and PSV's other USMNT boys have it aplenty with two games left in the league. On Sunday, they came from behind at Feyenoord to prevail 3-2 with a 99th-minute winner, and now sit just a solitary point behind Ajax with two games remaining. For their part, Ajax have won just twice in the same period and now appear to have the jitters at being hunted down ‚Äî on Sunday, they lost 3-0 at home to 13th-placed NEC Nijmegen. PSV called on Tillman, who had a strong game against Feyenoord, and Richy Ledezma, with the latter forced off through injury on 26 minutes to be replaced by compatriot Sergino Dest. Antonee Robinson was not in Fulham's squad for their 3-1 home defeat against Everton on Saturday because of sickness. But his absence was keenly felt against Everton, with the 1-3 defeat a setback for Fulham's hopes of qualifying for some form of European football next season. ‚ÄúI would say Antonee Robinson from Fulham,‚Äù he said. Name: Chris Richards Club: Crystal Palace Position: Defender Appearances (all competitions): 29 Richards and his team-mates will head to Wembley for this weekend's FA Cup final on a high after beating Tottenham 2-0 on Sunday. That solid Palace back three, of which Richards is a key part, were robust against the Europa League finalists and bagged their first win at Tottenham's new stadium to provide some much-needed momentum ahead of the weekend. Name: John Tolkin Club: Holstein Kiel Position: Defender Appearances: 10 Holstein Kiel's 2-1 home defeat by Freiburg ensured their demotion from the German top flight along with bottom club Bochum. It was Tolkin's eighth start for Kiel and he has contributed two assists. Name: Haji Wright Club: Coventry City Position: Striker Appearances: 30 Wright didn't manage to get on the scoresheet as Coventry lost the first leg of their Championship play-off semi-final to Sunderland 2-1 on Friday. So, if you've been paying attention, you'll already know there are some massive games coming up featuring USMNT players this week. Then on Saturday, it's all eyes on Richards in the FA Cup final as Crystal Palace search for their first major domestic honour against Manchester City. Those of you who are hooked on Serie A and whether Juventus can ward off Milan's challenge and hold onto fourth can see McKennie and Weah in action against Udinese on Sunday (9am, Paramount+). Don't forget that Real Betis are still in the thick of their own fight to qualify for Europe again in La Liga, where Johnny Cardoso came on as a sub in Sunday's 1-1 draw with Osasuna. On Thursday, they go up against Rayo Vallecano (1pm, ESPN +). He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xabi Alonso is set to replace Carlo Ancelotti as Real Madrid boss, according to Sky in Germany; outgoing Bayern Leverkusen boss Alonso is expected to take over as Real boss ahead of the Club World Cup;  Ancelotti is to take charge of the Brazil national team from May 26 Xabi Alonso will become the new Real Madrid head coach ahead of the Club World Cup, according to Sky in Germany. Alonso announced his Bayer Leverkusen exit on Friday after a successful two-and-a-half years at the German club, having won a league and cup double last season and falling just short of a remarkable unbeaten treble with defeat to Atalanta in the Europa League final. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The 43-year-old won nearly everything as a player at Real Madrid and is set to try to win more silverware as a manager at the Bernabeu. Sky in Germany understands that Leverkusen have agreed to release him a year early from his contract, initially due to run until the summer of 2026, which would allow the ex-Liverpool midfielder to join Real Madrid for free. Alonso's first game in charge of the Spanish giants is set to be on June 18 for Real's Club World Cup opener against Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal in Miami. "I know we shouldn't jump the gun, but everybody in football knows. "Alonso, on Friday, announced he'd be leaving Bayer Leverkusen. "Sky Germany this afternoon reported they think he will definitely be the Real Madrid manager - and also he will be in place for the Club World Cup next month. "Their first game is on June 18 against Al Hilal in Miami, so he's somebody else who's not really going to be getting much of a summer holiday, but then Real Madrid don't come calling very often. "He'll have his work cut out because, make no mistake, Carlo Ancelotti is a very tough act to follow. "We've seen how good Barcelona have been under Hansi Flick this season, so he needs to really hit the ground running because you don't get much time at Real Madrid. The 65-year-old will become the nation's first permanent foreign head coach, and will be in charge for Brazil's World Cup qualifiers against Paraguay and Ecuador next month. This will be Ancelotti's first international role, but he will take over Brazil as one of the most decorated managers in club football and the only coach to win each of Europe's top-five leagues. Since his return for his second spell in the Spanish capital in 2021, Ancelotti has led Real Madrid to a pair of LaLiga and Champions League doubles, but following Sunday's El Clasico defeat to Barcelona is all-but certain to miss out on any silverware in his final season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazil's soccer confederation said on Monday it has a deal with Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti eyeing the 2026 World Cup. The 65-year-old Ancelotti, who will be Brazil's first full-time foreign coach in a century, is still under contract with Madrid. "Bringing Carlo Ancelotti to coach Brazil is more than a strategic movement. Together, we will write new glorious chapters of Brazilian soccer." Rodrigues said Ancelotti will take charge of Brazil's next two fixtures in South American World Cup qualifiying, with his debut at Ecuador on June 5th and five days later in front of home fans against Paraguay in Sao Paulo. Ancelotti's contract with Madrid ends next year but is expected to be terminated early. He will replace Dorival J√∫nior, who held the job for 14 months and was fired in March after a 4-1 defeat at Argentina. The top six teams will secure direct spots in next year's tournament. Bayer Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso, who'll be leaving the German club after this season, has been linked with the imminent opening at Madrid. Alonso, a former Madrid player, led Leverkusen to an unprecedented league and cup double last season after taking over the team when it was in the Bundesliga's relegation zone in October 2022.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up for email newsletters CAIRO (AP) ‚Äî Spanish coach Jos√© Riveiro was released Monday by South African soccer club Orlando Pirates amid reports he will go to Egypt and join Al Ahly ahead of the Club World Cup in the United States. Al Ahly plays Lionel Messi's Inter Miami in the opening game of the monthlong FIFA tournament on June 14. ‚ÄúI want to express my sincere appreciation to Orlando Pirates for allowing me the opportunity to leave before the end of my contract,‚Äù Riveiro said in a statement on the club's website. Al Ahly, the African champion in four of the past five seasons, has been without a full-time coach since Marcel Koller left last month after elimination in the CAF Champions League semifinals by Mamelodi Sundowns. ‚ÄúJose approached us a few weeks ago with a request to be released from his contract ahead of schedule, having signed with a new club,‚Äù club chairman Irvin Khoza said in a statement on Pirates' website. Riveiro spent nearly three years at Orlando Pirates and previously coached in Finland. Al Ahly has not announced talks with the 47-year-old Spaniard which have been reported in Egyptian media. Al Ahly qualified for the inaugural 32-team Club World Cup by winning the African title in 2021, then again in 2023 and 2024. After playing Inter Miami at the Miami Dolphins' stadium, Al Ahly has two more Group A games at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, against Palmeiras and Porto.</p>

Perez, for that matter, understands that the momentum of this new cycle begins with the way it is introduced, and there's no better platform than a high-profile competition where Madrid are expected to perform. Alonso will be expected to make tactical and selection decisions in a competitive environment almost immediately.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xabi Alonso will reportedly take over as Real Madrid's manager for the upcoming Club World Cup. This tournament is vital for Florentino P√©rez and his board, given its prestige and the potential ‚Ç¨150 million prize. This pushes Real Madrid to place their future in Alonso's hands, foregoing an interim appointment like Solari. Real Madrid feels it's senseless to hire a coach only to leave him at home planning for next season while a less experienced Solari takes charge in such a vital tournament. The relentless schedule also compels Real Madrid to make this decision, resembling a mid-season change. Ancelotti leaves and Xabi arrives, without any transition. He will also inherit a squad that likely won't be entirely his. First, the disappointment of not winning any major titles this season. Second, a squad full of injured key players. Fourth, players aware their future at the club is uncertain. Fifth, limited preparation time, with most players joining their national teams before the World Cup. Whether this change begins in June or waits until the 2025/26 season remains to be seen. Xabi's situation parallels that of Carlo Ancelotti, who will take charge of the Brazilian national team just a week after leaving Real Madrid. Like Alonso, Ancelotti isn't joining an easy role. He takes over the world's most demanding team, Brazil, which always demands victory and dreams of winning their sixth World Cup in 2026. A rival club president in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup took the spotlight and downplayed Lionel Messi's influence at Inter Miami. With only a month left for the beginning of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, Sergio Ramos has suffered a major setback at Monterrey. With Real Madrid and FC Barcelona set to clash in El Cl√°sico, head coach Carlo Ancelotti took the opportunity to take a light jab at Bar√ßa over their absence from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. Cristiano Ronaldo's absence in Al Nassr's squad list against Al Okhdood in the Saudi Pro League raised concern about his fitness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid have decided that Xabi Alonso will coach the team during the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup, moving away from the initial plan of appointing an interim coach for that tournament. That's according to a report from MARCA, which also indicates that Alonso will work hard to implement his coaching philosophy and new ideas in the weeks leading to the World Cup. It would seem reasonable to expect some growing pains during Alonso's first few games as the coach, especially when he will have a depleted roster to work with. Alonso's system and coaching style is very different from Ancelotti's, so while the Club World Cup could seem like a fairly manageable tournament for Los Blancos, the Spanish coach will have to work really hard if he wants his team to perform at a high level. The FIFA Club World Cup kicks off on June 14th, with Alonso expected to take over his new role on June 1st. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Something went wrong.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City will take a blue kit to the Club World Cup, rebutting claims earlier this year that they would not wear the colours of their home shirt. City are known around the world for their sky blue shirts, yet reports indicated that Pep Guardiola and his side would instead wear different colours at the Club World Cup. Ahead of the release of their new home kit on Tuesday, the club have now confirmed that it will be worn in the summer tournament before its use next season in all competitions. While it is unclear which other shirts will be used at the Club World Cup, confirmation that City will have a blue shirt for at least some of the games should ease concerns sparked by the earlier controversial rumours. Taking influence from an iconic Oasis album and designed with help by Noel Gallagher, use of the kit that wasn't predominantly blue for a home game at the Etihad did not go down well with many. This is the first time in five years that a City home kit has not been worn to lift the Premier League title. City can still lift more silverware this season if they beat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup, but if Palace are the designated home team it is unlikely that the Blues will wear their blue shirts. For the trip to Selhurst Park earlier this season, they wore the yellow-and-black kit inspired by their third-division play-off triumph in 1999. City are in their third FA Cup Final in a row and are looking to put a disappointing season behind them by winning another FA Cup. That would also give them momentum for the Premier League as they look to clinch a top-five finish in their final two matches.

Xabi Alonso

Jos√© Luis Art√∫s

Periodista

It appears there will be no interim coach for Real Madrid during the FIFA Club World Cup, which will be held in the United States from June 14 to July 13.

In recent days, amid growing speculation about the likely departure of Carlo Ancelotti, reports suggested that Santiago Solari would take charge of the team for the tournament, beating out fellow candidate Ra√∫l Gonz√°lez Blanco. 

However, new information has emerged indicating that Xabi Alonso, who recently bid farewell to Bayer Leverkusen, will instead assume the role.

Xabi Alonso

According to the Spanish newspaper Marca, ‚Äúthe decision for Alonso to lead the team in the U.S. tournament was made last week during a conversation in which the club gave the coach virtually no choice. ‚ÄòIt all starts with the Club World Cup,' they told him.‚Äù 

Real Madrid reportedly believes it makes little sense to hire a new manager only to leave him sidelined while someone like Solari‚Äîwith a minimal track record‚Äîtakes charge of such a high-profile competition.

Journalist Siro L√≥pez echoed this sentiment on Tiempo de Juego (Cadena COPE), stating: ‚ÄúOn Friday, I was told there was a potential issue related to tax residency that might delay his official start until July 1. It had to do with the length of stay in Germany and related tax declarations. But today‚Äîeither yesterday afternoon or this morning‚ÄîI was informed that Xabi has, in principle, accepted Madrid's request and that the current plan is for Xabi Alonso to manage Real Madrid at the Club World Cup.‚Äù
