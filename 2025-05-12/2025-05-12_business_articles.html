A customer uses an Apple iPhone 16 in an Apple Inc. store.

Apple Inc. is planning to use artificial intelligence technology to address a frequent source of customer frustration: the iPhone's battery life. 

The company is planning an AI-powered battery management mode for iOS 19, an iPhone software update due in September, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The enhancement will analyze how a person uses their device and make adjustments to conserve energy, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the service hasn't been announced.</p>

The House tax committee's draft bill to renew President Donald Trump's tax cuts calls for increasing the state and local tax deduction to $30,000 for couples, but limits the write-off to households earning $400,000 or less, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Individuals earning up to $200,000 could claim $15,000 in SALT deductions under the proposal, the person said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Perplexity AI is in late-stage talks to raise $500 million at a $14 billion valuation, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to CNBC on Monday. The funding is on the lower end of Perplexity's planned raise, which CNBC reported in March. During those early-stage talks, Perplexity was looking to raise between $500 million and $1 billion in funding at an $18 billion post-money valuation, per a source familiar. The artificial intelligence search engine company competes against the likes of Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Perplexity has just under $100 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR, the source told CNBC in March. Perplexity has been in the middle of the generative AI boom that began in late 2022 with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, and it is betting big on its upcoming AI agent web browser, called Comet. But Perplexity faces increasing competition in the AI search market. In March, Anthropic launched its web search product, allowing its chatbot Claude to display real-time search results to a subset of users. Last fall, OpenAI launched a search feature within ChatGPT, its viral chatbot, that positioned it to better compete with Perplexity, as well as leading search engines such as Google and Microsoft's Bing. Google has released AI Overviews within its search product as well, though it sparked controversy over high-profile errors soon after its release. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Monday that he talked to Apple CEO Tim Cook after the U.S. and China agreed to suspend most tariffs for 90 days. Wall Street and Apple investors cheered the pause on Chinese tariffs. Apple stock was up 6% in trading on Monday, versus 3% for the Nasdaq. "I spoke to Tim Cook this morning, and he's going to, I think, even up his numbers," Trump said in the Oval Office. "$500 billion, he's going to be building a lot of plants in the United States for Apple. Any cooling of a U.S.-China trade war is expected to boost Apple, which does the majority of its device production in the country, and also counts the region as its third-largest by sales. Still, it is not clear how much Monday's announcement immediately helped Apple. In April, most of Apple's important products, such as smartphones and computers, received exemptions on some of the highest 145% tariffs, but there are still 30% tariffs on Chinese imports even after Sunday's deal. Apple still faces 10% tariffs in some of its secondary production locations, such as India and Vietnam. The Trump administration wants Apple to bring device production, including iPhone manufacturing, to the U.S., a move that many experts believe would be unlikely and expensive. Earlier this month, Cook told investors about the company's tariff strategy on an earnings call. He said Apple is currently sourcing American-bound products from production locations in Vietnam and India, but did not want to speculate beyond June, calling the situation "difficult to predict."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chegg said on Monday it would lay off about 22% of its workforce, or 248 employees, to cut costs and streamline its operations as students increasingly turn to AI-powered tools such as ChatGPT over traditional education technology platforms. The company, an online education firm that offers textbook rentals, homework help and tutoring, has been grappling with a decline in web traffic for months and warned that the trend would likely worsen before improving. Google's expansion of AI Overviews is keeping web traffic confined within its search ecosystem while gradually shifting searches to its Gemini AI platform, Chegg said, adding that other AI companies including OpenAI and Anthropic were courting academics with free access to subscriptions. As part of the restructuring announced on Monday, Chegg will also shut its U.S. and Canada offices by the end of the year and aim to reduce its marketing, product development efforts and general and administrative expenses. Chegg expects cost savings of between $45 and $55 million in 2025 and $100 to $110 million in 2026 due to the restructuring. It also reported first-quarter results on Monday, saying subscribers declined 31% in the period to 3.2 million. Revenue declined 30% to $121 million, as its subscription services revenue fell by nearly a third to $108 million. In February, Chegg sued Google saying Google's internet search engine was eroding demand for original content and undermining publishers' ability to compete with its artificial intelligence-generated overviews, thereby causing a drop in visitors and subscribers. Chegg had 1,271 employees as of December 31. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bitcoin mining company backed by President Donald Trump's sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., is set to go public on the Nasdaq through an all-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. Shares of Gryphon were up more than 300% Monday. Existing stockholders of American Bitcoin, including the president's two eldest sons, will own about 98% of the new entity. "Every single sophisticated country is using their excess power to mine bitcoin," Trump previously told CNBC. This self-driving car technology stock could pop by more than 400%, say three analysts Bernstein tech analyst's best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks 'alpha' opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside He distanced himself from any direct involvement with his father's administration but made clear his belief that the U.S. must maintain a competitive edge in the crypto sector. We better win the crypto race," he said. On the campaign trail, the president repeatedly promised to support U.S.-based bitcoin miners, including telling executives at a closed-door event in Mar-a-Lago that he wants all future bitcoin should be minted on American soil. The administration's latest executive orders loosen environmental restrictions and encourage more fossil fuel development â a boon for oilfield miners, even as critics warn it could come at a steep climate cost. Bitcoin is trading at around $104,000, roughly flat over the past 24 hours. American Bitcoin is being carved out of energy infrastructure platform Hut 8's broader energy and artificial intelligence infrastructure platform, a move designed to separate its mining operations and unlock new capital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Monday that China "agreed to open up" after the two countries announced they would temporarily slash most of the tariffs on each other's goods. Trump offered few details about that development, but said it was "maybe the most important thing" to come out of the high-level trade talks between the two superpowers in Geneva, Switzerland, over the weekend. Trump indicated that those purported commitments have not been cemented yet. "We have to get it papered," he said at the White House before signing an executive order on U.S. drug prices. "But they've agreed to open up China." Trump's remarks came hours after U.S. and Chinese officials said they struck an agreement to pause most tariffs and other trade barriers for 90 days. Beijing said it will lower tariffs on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. Trump said Monday morning that tariffs on China would not go back to 145%, even if a longer-term deal cannot be reached once the 90-day pause expires. "But they would go up substantially," Trump added. The U.S. is also maintaining 20% tariffs that were previously imposed over allegations about China's role in bringing fentanyl to America. The U.S. said it will additionally retain tariffs that were in place for specific Chinese products, including steel and aluminum, before early April. The duties that Trump slapped on China in April effectively established a trade embargo with one of America's largest suppliers of goods. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's remarks. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ask any financial advisor if now is a good time to buy stocks, and you'll likely get the same two words for an answer: It depends. You'll then get a couple of questions: What's your risk tolerance? But if you possess the magical combination of having time on your side and the ability to shrug off volatility, history shows it's virtually always a good time to buy. This dynamic was in full force on Monday as major US indexes soared more than 3% after the US and China agreed to substantial tariff cuts for 90 days. This is the fourth installment of BI's six-part series on making major life decisions in periods of immense policy-driven change. If you have a longer-term time horizon, history is on your side, according to Jeff Schulze, the head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments. The forward one-year return is even stronger when a recession hasn't materialized, averaging 14% over time. Still, every market cycle is different, and there are reasons to be concerned that a potential bear market this time around could be more severe. For one, valuations on the S&P 500 have recently been at some of their highest levels in history. The Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, which looks at current stock prices compared to a rolling 10-year average of earnings, is still at about 33. This has led top strategists like David Kostin of Goldman Sachs and Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley to warn of lackluster returns for the S&P 500 in the decade ahead. Trump's 10% baseline tariffs are also seen potentially raising consumer prices while slowing economic growth â a 1970s-style stagflation scenario that investors are increasingly worried about. On an overall basis, however, stocks seemingly always recover and have delivered strong returns over multi-decade periods. But there's no way to time the bottom perfectly. One way to mitigate this risk is by dollar-cost averaging. That's a fancy way of saying buying into the market at set intervals â perhaps every Friday, for example, or on the first of every month. So, if you had $10,000, you could buy in $500 at a time over the course of 20 weeks or months. Whichever way you decide to approach entering the market, your returns are likely to be good over the long run, if history is an accurate guide. Warren Buffett once said you should be OK with losing 50% or more of your money â on paper, at least â when you invest in stocks. In other words, you should have the stomach to withstand short-term volatility because you're in it for the long haul anyway. If you're disciplined enough to ignore any pain that comes along and can keep your eye on the prize far off on the horizon, then yes, now is a good time to buy.</p>

CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz disclosed last month that he'd giftedBloomberg Terminal over $1 billion worth of his company's stock to undisclosed recipients, sharply reducing his influence over the company in an unusual move for a tech founder.

The disposition is the latest in a series of transactions that have slashed his voting power in CrowdStrike to 2.5% from 31% in 2022, according to the company's latest proxy statement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk said on Sunday that President Donald Trump's new "gold card" immigration program is already being tested. "We're doing a quiet trial to make sure the system works properly," he said in an X post. "Once it is fully tested, it will be rolled out to the public with an announcement by the President." Trump's gold card program is intended to replace the EB-5 immigrant investor visa, which has allowed foreign nationals to apply for US residency by investing a minimum of $1.05 million â or $800,000 in rural and high-unemployment areas â in a commercial enterprise that creates American jobs. Trump's version significantly raises the price of admission: $5 million upfront, no job creation requirement, and faster access to work and residency privileges. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who helped craft the program, said the current EB-5 system is "full of nonsense, make-believe, and fraud," and said the new plan would attract only "world-class global citizens." Critics have raised concerns about transparency, favoritism, and national security â especially after Trump said he wouldn't rule out selling gold cards to Russian oligarchs, insisting some are "very nice people." Lutnick pushed back, saying there would be a vetting process to ensure only acceptable applicants are approved. Programs offering residency or citizenship in exchange for investment aren't new. Countries like the United Arab Emirates and several Caribbean nations offer so-called "citizenship by investment" options, but Trump's proposal has reignited a debate over whether US immigration policy should cater to the ultrawealthy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reports that President Donald Trump's administration is expected to receive a luxury jet as a gift from the Qatari royal family have drawn questions and criticism from legal experts. The gift from Qatar, a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, would be used as the new Air Force One, multiple outlets reported on Sunday, citing anonymous sources. Trump appeared to confirm the reports in a Truth Social post on Sunday night. Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar's media attachÃ© to the US, told BI in a statement that the transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One was "currently under consideration." Boeing didn't respond to a request for comment from BI. Jessica Levinson, a law professor who's the director of the Public Service Institute at Loyola Law School, said that in addition to the foreign emoluments clause, federal statutes, such as the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act and anti-bribery laws, might come into play. "Outside of the legal context, it is fair to ask whether the acceptance of this gift could give rise to an apparent conflict of interest or corruption," she told BI. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told BI in a statement that any gift from a foreign government was "always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws." "Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that the acceptance of a gift of this size from a foreign government is unprecedented in our nation's history," Levinson added. "Hence we do not have any direct historical analogues for this situation." When asked about the legal mechanisms for addressing a violation of the foreign emoluments clause, Painter pointed to Congress. "Investigation and possible impeachment is one remedy, but that's up to Congress," Painter said. The reports drew criticism online from some leading US Democrats and at least one far-right activist with close ties to Trump. "Nothing says 'America First' like Air Force One, brought to you by Qatar. It's not just bribery, it's premium foreign influence with extra legroom," Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, wrote on Facebook. "Trump must seek Congress' consent to take this $300 million gift from Qatar. The Constitution is perfectly clear: no present 'of any kind whatever' from a foreign state without Congressional permission. And I say that as someone who would take a bullet for Trump," Loomer wrote on X. Trump has been putting pressure on Boeing to deliver the next Air Force One, which is behind schedule and over budget. Boeing was first tapped in 2015 to deliver the two new presidential planes. The delivery was initially set for 2024 and then delayed until 2027 or 2028. Last week, a US Air Force official said Boeing could deliver the new Air Force One jets by 2027, while Trump is still in office.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Search engine optimization is the art and science of crafting websites and other online content so they show up prominently when people Google something. While SEO has long been a cornerstone of digital marketing strategy, a new paradigm is rapidly threatening to take its place: "answer engine optimization." There's been an explosion of AEO startups and tools in recent months, all promising to help online businesses show up when chatbots and AI models answer user questions. "There must have been 30 AEO product launches in the last few months, all trying to do what SEO did 20 years ago," said David Slater, a chief marketing officer who's worked at Mozilla, Salesforce, and other tech companies. He wrote an excellent blog recently about this new trend. Where traditional SEO focused on optimizing for static keyword-driven queries, AEO centers on influencing how AI chatbots respond to user questions, he said. With tools like ChatGPT increasingly integrating real-time web search and surfacing clickable links, chat interfaces now function like hybrid search engines. The result is a fast feedback loop that makes influencing LLM outputs not just possible but also essential for online businesses. Smith shared an example: Instead of optimizing a webpage for "project management software," AEO pages might answer dozens or even hundreds of variations, such as, "What's the best project management tool for remote teams?" When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, its responses were generated from outdated training data with no live web access. But over the past year, LLMs have started using retrieval-augmented generation and other techniques that help them incorporate more real-time information. They often perform a live online search, for instance, and then summarize results in real time. This makes AEO both faster to influence and more dynamic than its SEO predecessor, Smith wrote. There's been some interest in AEO for about a year or so. But in early 2025, OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI services began surfacing prominent links and citations in answers a lot more. Now AEO startups are raising venture capital, some online businesses are seeing conversion spikes from AI traffic, and there's been a Cambrian explosion of AEO analytics, tracking, and content tools. Check out this list of AEO startups and tools, identified by Smith from Graphite Growth. There are a few established players in here, too, including HubSpot. There's already a race to determine how these AI chatbots spit out results and recommendations so that website owners can hack their way to better online distribution in the new era of generative AI and large language models. He said that AI search results from tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity are unpredictable. They can change even when you ask the same question multiple times. For example, Kaufman and his colleagues asked ChatGPT this question 100 times: "What's the best support ticketing software?" Zendesk showed up in 94% of answers, while other companies, including Freshworks and Zoho, appeared less often and in different positions. "Strategically," Kaufman wrote, "this means brands need to rethink how they optimize for discovery, focusing less on traditional SEO tactics and more on comprehensive, authoritative content that AI systems recognize as valuable."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>College finance clubs have become a gateway to Wall Street careers, and the process for joining can be as cutthroat as the industry itself. Outside the iconic Butler Library, known for its Neoclassical columns, mobs of students were clamoring to get to informational booths set up by the college's finance and business clubs. "There were lines and lines of kids queued up at these club booths," Cancel, now 20, recalled in an interview with Business Insider. Weeks later, heading to his first admissions interview with one of these clubs, the stakes felt palpable. Cancel recalled reading the Excel sheet with timeslots for a lengthy list of applicants as he waited for his name to be called. He brought plenty of rÃ©sumÃ© copies and dressed in business formal, "down to the shoes," because he'd heard that assessment metrics included attire. See more stories from BI's Path to Wall Street series here, including what it's really like to work for a hedge fund and data showing where the average banker went to school and how much she makes. Some run full-fledged investment funds, while others are Greek fraternities that recruit students majoring in business, finance, marketing, or accounting. Their perks have created a race for membership, and the admissions process to join a club can be as cutthroat as the industry itself. This is the latest in a series of stories exploring careers in finance, how they are changing, and how these shifts are affecting young people. The clubs help Wall Street employers by creating a clear pipeline of job candidates, and firms have been known to cater to them as a result. While it's unclear exactly when these clubs became must-haves for a Wall Street job, the people who spoke with BI tended to agree that the situation reflected a race among employers to recruit talent earlier and earlier. A Wharton sophomore said he knew of high school students who'd started preparing to get into clubs as soon as they were accepted to college â before they'd even arrived on campus. I was just having fun," but that's not the case anymore, he said, adding: "You've gotten into these places and it's like, all right, now work on building a DCF" â a valuation method. To be sure, the club scene has long been exclusive. From the "eating clubs" at Princeton to the average sorority, organizations will choose members based on social interactions, pedigree, and background. What makes the financial and business clubs different is that they are less about making friends or exploring new interests and more about your rÃ©sumÃ©. Club leaders from three schools told BI that their organizations accepted less than 10% of their freshman applicants, who numbered 150 to 300 in recent years. Members get exclusive exposure to the industry, including training and tips from upperclassmen who have already gone through Wall Street's rigorous internship application process. Some clubs give their members real money to manage â whether a percentage of the university's endowment or capital from members and alumni. Firm recruiters often interact with student clubs, granting members special access to meetings and events. One student club leader said he landed an investment banking internship because members of his club were invited to visit the firm's headquarters. "I have so many opportunities to network internally and have specific rÃ©sumÃ© drop links that these recruiters give to the club specifically, that are only open to members," he told BI about his campus club experience. "You want to be part of the rÃ©sumÃ© book." A private equity worker, meanwhile, said the "No. 1 thing" she looked for when she was a recruiting captain of an investment bank was whether students from her alma mater had been members of "the two most prestigious investment clubs on campus." Competition to get into campus clubs has gotten so intense that Georgetown's McDonough School of Business barred first-semester freshmen from joining them in 2023. Some students have balked at the rule, saying it puts them behind in recruiting for Wall Street internships, which students must apply for halfway through their sophomore year. While the pressure these young people face may feel exaggerated, there are plenty of signs that the stakes are all too real. Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs have disclosed record levels of applicants to their internship programs. And Wall Street's earlier-than-ever recruiting schedule compelled Steve Sibley, a professor at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business, to move an introductory corporate finance class he runs from the fall of students' sophomore year to the spring of their freshman year. The end result has been a club culture that often mimics the industry itself, including a cutthroat selection process. Some clubs conduct three to five rounds of interviews, students told BI, which can involve a rÃ©sumÃ© review (yes, your high school rÃ©sumÃ©), a social assessment, and multiple technical rounds in which you'll be grilled on real-world finance questions. "Of course it sucks when you have to reject people," the club leader said. Most of the students BI spoke with echoed that low acceptance rates were extreme and sometimes ridiculous. They also said it's this way for a reason, including the difficulty of managing and teaching hundreds of other students. "We only have so much bandwidth as people running the club," a Wharton junior said. "The impact is lower if you're dealing with 300." Also, for better or worse, being a sought-after club brings a level of prestige and bragging rights for those who manage to get in. "You want to be in the club where so many people want to get in," the club leader said. As a freshman at Georgetown University in the fall of 2022, Jonathan Rothschild refused to apply to finance clubs his first semester, he said, once he learned about the rigorous interview processes and acceptance rates of under 10%. "I don't think that's how we should be treating people freshman year." That choice led him to Georgetown Collegiate Investors during his second semester, a student-owned investment fund that lets any student participate in its training program and later become a "junior analyst" on the team if they pass a basic knowledge test. The fund has more than $150,000 in assets under management, money raised from current and former student members. Rothschild, now a junior and co-CEO of GCI, argues that the selective of these clubs favors people who have been exposed to finance early in life. "If you're only accepting 5% of the people, you're getting the people who already know what they're doing," he said, adding: "I'm not saying take everyone, but you could take 25% of people at Georgetown and be fine."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rivian's first-ever concept experience takes its luxurious boho vibe to another level. That theme is on display in the store's design and also embedded in new offerings like "adventure drives," which I got to try out for myself. The program allows customers to sign up quarterly for small group drives to local day trip spots like the Met Cloisters or Storm King Art Center. The space will also continue to offer standard demo drives. Rivian's director of regional marketing, Sara Webster Wylie, told BI that the concept experience is designed to broaden the brand's reach. While Rivian scores highly in customer satisfaction among its current owners, it's still in the process of gaining wider recognition as an EV maker. A Rivian spokesperson told BI that the Brooklyn space typically draws visitors who are already familiar with the brand. Similar to its Brooklyn showroom, Rivian is also trying to embed the local community into its concept experience. The space had a "soft" open on May 2, and it hosted a series of events the weekend after. I went to its first launch event on Friday, which included breakfast, a sustainable activity, and an adventure ride to The Met Cloisters. Keep reading to see what it was like. Rivian's Brooklyn showroom had similar design aspects, like ambient lighting, wood accents, and greenery. However, the concept space felt like a more refined version. The Brooklyn showroom had a more neighborhood, small-town feel, while this space felt a bit more expansive and showy. Apollo Bagels is currently one of the hot bagel spots in New York City. Rivian also had coffee, orange juice, Boxed Water, and a small assortment of pastries that looked delicious. Rivian said that it expanded food and beverage service for visitors, including coffee from local purveyor Don Carvajal, and tea from Harney & Sons. There were camping stations and accessories strategically placed throughout the store. Rivian had a sound immersion room with a video display on the wall that showed different city landscapes and other scenes. Visitors can drink coffee or tea, explore displays, step into a sound immersion room, and discover new experiences through the adventure ride. "Ultimately, we want to inspire a sense of adventure in anyone who visits," Wylie said. As someone who pays for meditation classes in the city, it was nice to experience a similar experience at no cost. Similar to Rivian's Brooklyn location, which had a lot of kid-friendly characteristics, the concept experience had kids' books and interactive activities, like listening to sounds and touching the material of the cars. Rivian's Brooklyn showroom featured plenty of text and wall displays explaining EV ownership, but the concept space seemed to take the educational aspect a step further. It had simplified graphics to engage an audience that may be less familiar with EV ownership. Rivian stationed a waste design studio called Are You Mad at the space. The studio showed attendees how plastic is turned into other materials and had a table for making keychains. It felt like a genuine â and successful â effort to connect with the local community. This photo shows an interactive experience that allowed visitors to vote for their favorite color with cork balls. It was one of several creative interactive elements placed throughout the store. The display allowed users to choose preselected choices, including Arcadia National Park, Montauk, the Outer Banks, or their own pick. It's not necessarily easy to go on a roughly hourlong drive with people you just met, but the employees were down-to-earth and easy to get along with. It was my first time spending extended time in a car in months, and it felt like I was on a road trip. They also have a minimalist aesthetic, and materials like vegan leather add to the soft and earthy vibe. I get carsick from time to time, and I did feel a bit nauseous on the way back. I admired Rivian's ability to curate a space that highlighted aspects of city living and connected with the local community and lifestyle while also offering a break from some of the parts of it that can feel overwhelming. I thought the "adventure drives" offering was also a clever move. While standard demo drives can be cool to experience, most people aren't likely to sign up for one unless they're actively shopping for a car, especially if the brand isn't widely popular. By offering an opportunity to explore outside the streets of New York, customers may be more incentivized to experience the brand for a longer duration and get a real taste of ownership. Taking an SUV to a more secluded area definitely captured that sense of escape â and the rain added to the feeling of adventure.</p>
