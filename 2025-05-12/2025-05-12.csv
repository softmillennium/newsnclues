            Ding Xueliang spent his early teenage years in China as a fervent believer and practitioner of Chairman Mao Zedong's revolutionary ideals — but he never imagined those memories would one day be stirred by a sitting US president.
    


            In 1966, at just 13 years old, the son of poor farmers became one of Mao's Red Guards. He joined millions of young people across China to participate in the Cultural Revolution, a decade-long upheaval set off by an aging Mao to reassert his absolute control over the ruling Communist Party – with the stated goal of preserving communist ideology.
    


            Nearly six decades later, Ding is a distinguished scholar of Chinese politics based in Hong Kong, with a PhD from Harvard and a career teaching about the catastrophic movement he embraced.
    


            But in recent months, he has begun to see uncanny echoes of Mao's Cultural Revolution in an unexpected place: Donald Trump's America.
    


            To be clear, there are profound, incomparable differences between the deadly violence and chaos unleashed by a dictator in a one-party state, and an elected president's divisive attempts to expand executive power within a mature democracy.
    


            “It's not identical,” Ding said. “But there are certainly parallels.”
    


            As Trump upends the very institutions, alliances, and free trade order that have underpinned America's global dominance since World War II, some in China are reminded of their own former leader — one who wielded revolutionary zeal to tear down the old world more than half a century ago.
    


            In articles and social media posts, Chinese scholars and commentators have drawn comparisons between Trump and Mao. Some referenced the Cultural Revolution – at times obliquely to avoid censorship; others highlighted Trump's apparent appetite for chaos, and the rising signs of authoritarianism and personality cult within his administration.
    


            Since returning to the White House, Trump has disrupted the federal bureaucracy – dismantling agencies, purging officials and slashing civil service jobs. He has waged a war on ideology that conservatives deem “woke” and attacked elite universities – including Ding's alma mater Harvard – for “liberal indoctrination,” threatening to cut their federal funding. He's also pledged to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US and “put American workers first.”
    


            And in the US president, Ding noticed what he said were striking similarities with the late Chinese chairman whom he once worshiped as a young Red Guard: despite their vast differences, they both share a deep contempt for intellectual elites, a strong mistrust of the bureaucratic apparatus, and a populist appeal aimed at farmers and blue-collar workers.
    


            During the Cultural Revolution, Mao's Red Guards declared war against the “Four Olds” – old customs, old culture, old habits and old ideas – to erase remnants of China's pre-communist past. (It led to the widespread destruction of some of the country's most valuable historical and cultural artifacts.)
    


            That campaign stemmed from Mao's long-held belief in “first destroy, then establish” – the idea that old systems, ideologies, or institutions must be demolished before new ones can be erected in their place.
    


            Coming from an impoverished family, Ding eagerly took part in public humiliation rallies against teachers, intellectuals, government officials and others labeled as enemies of Mao's vision.
    


            “I was especially enthusiastic about the Cultural Revolution because I was born into a family of three generations of poor farmers — one of the ‘five red categories.' At the time, I felt the Cultural Revolution was extremely important for us, it was wonderful,” he said.
    


            But as China learned over a harrowing decade, it's far easier to tear things down than to rebuild them. Mao's violent mass movement shut down schools, paralyzed the government, shattered the economy, destroyed religious and cultural relics – turmoil that only subsided after the leader's death in 1976. Historians estimate somewhere between 500,000 and two million people lost their lives.
    


            Now, some Chinese are looking at that tumultuous chapter of their own history to make sense of the change Trump is unleashing in America.
    


            Among Mao's most ardent admirers, there's a sense of pride that the US president appears to be borrowing from the revolutionary playbook of their esteemed supreme leader. One blogger likened Trump's February tweet — “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law” — to Mao's iconic slogan: “To rebel is justified.”
    


            “Trump is adept at imitating Chairman Mao. Trump is China's true opponent,” the blogger concluded.
    


            Other Mao fans cheered Trump for cozying up to Vladimir Putin's Russia while snubbing Ukraine and Europe, said Wu Qiang, an independent analyst in Beijing who is studying Chinese perceptions of Trump.
    


            Ever since his first term, Trump has earned the nickname “Chuan Jianguo,” or “Trump, the nation builder” among Chinese nationalists — a mocking suggestion that he is making China stronger by undermining America.
    


            For some Chinese liberals, however, Trump's sweeping expansion of executive power and attacks on press freedom, academic independence and the rule of law in the first 100 days of his second term have sparked disbelief, frustration and disappointment.
    


            On Chinese social media, users voiced their disillusionment in the comment sections of US Embassy accounts, lamenting that America no longer resembles the ideal they once believed in.
    


            “I always thought the US was a beacon to the world, standing for justice and fairness. But its recent actions have been completely disillusioning … Many Chinese people's faith in America has been shattered!” said a comment on the US Embassy's WeChat account.
    


            Others made oblique references to Mao.
    


            Underneath the embassy's post celebrating Trump's first 100 days in office, a Chinese user wrote: “Sailing the seas depends on the helmsman.” That's the title of a revolutionary song eulogizing Mao, which became the popular anthem of the Cultural Revolution.
    


            Another wrote: “The American people also have their own sun,” complete with a smirking dog emoji. Mao was extolled as the “red sun of China” at the height of his personality cult during the mass movement.
    


            For years, Chinese liberals have quietly warned of a creeping return to the Cultural Revolution under Xi Jinping, the most powerful leader since Mao. A devoted student of the “Great Helmsman,” Xi has steered China closer to strongman rule and curtailed individual freedoms in ways critics say are reminiscent of that era.
    


            And so, it was all the more striking for some Chinese liberals to witness an authoritarian turn seemingly unfolding in Washington, which under former President Joe Biden had framed the US competition with China as “democracy versus authoritarianism.”
    


            Less than a month into Trump's second term, Zhang Qianfan, a constitutional law professor in Beijing, was already alarmed by the emergence of what he called an “American-style Cultural Revolution.”
    


            “The Cultural Revolution was essentially a power struggle,” he said.
    


            Mao was insecure about his authority, eroded by three years of famine caused by his disastrous “Great Leap Forward” industrialization campaign; he was also suspicious of the establishment built by himself, claiming that “representatives of the bourgeoisie” had sneaked into the party, the government, the army and the cultural spheres.
    


            Similarly, Trump believes the “deep state” is out to get him. And like Mao, he turned to loyalists outside the establishment to reshape the system and bend it to his will, Zhang said.
    


            “Mao unleashed the Red Guards to ‘smash' the police, prosecutors, and courts, so that loyal revolutionaries could seize control of state machinery,” he said. “Trump brought Elon Musk and six young Silicon Valley executives into the White House under the banner of eliminating corruption, waste, and inefficiency — akin to the ‘Cultural Revolution Leadership Group' entering the party's central leadership.”
    


            Zhang was equally unsettled by the growing signs of a personality cult in Washington.
    


            Last month, when he saw a social media photo of a gold pin in the shape of Trump's profile worn on the chest of Brendan Carr, chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission, he initially thought it was fake news or a parody.
    


            In China, such a badge carries heavy political symbolism. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao's badges were worn ubiquitously by Red Guards and others as a public display of loyalty to the chairman and devotion to the revolution.
    


            “During Trump's presidential inauguration speech, Republican lawmakers all stood up and applauded with such fervor that it rivaled North Korea. These are deeply troubling signs,” Zhang said. “People are seeing all kinds of sycophancy in the US that would have once been unimaginable.”
    


            Trump has even publicly flirted with the idea of seeking an unconstitutional third term, saying he was “not joking” and claiming that “a lot of people want me to do it.”
    


            Mao ruled China until his death. Xi is serving a third term after abolishing presidential term limits in 2018 in a move praised by Trump.
    


            “He's now president for life, president for life. And he's great,” Trump said at the time in closed-door remarks obtained by CNN. “And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday.”
    


            All the parallels aside, the first 100 days of Trump's second term are radically different from Mao's Cultural Revolution, which devastated China, saw millions of people persecuted and resulted in more than 1.7 million deaths, according to the party's own count.
    


            Unlike Mao, Trump did not mobilize youths across America to form a nationwide, self-organized political movement. “The January 6 attack on the US Capitol was somewhat similar, but it didn't take off – it did not become a national rebellion in the US,” said Ding, the former Red Guard.
    


            To Ding, the two leaders also differ dramatically in their global ambitions.
    


            “Whereas Mao's Cultural Revolution had a grand goal for China to replace the Soviet Union and become the sole guiding force for the global proletarian revolution, Trump's movement lacks such an ambitious, internationalist vision,” he said. “Instead, Trump has utterly damaged America's image, credibility, and influence within the global camp of liberal democracies.”
    


            In many ways, Trump is reshaping the global order. He has disrupted the transatlantic alliance – a cornerstone of Western security for decades – and pushed Asian allies to pay more for US protection. He also narrowed the focus of his global tariff war squarely on China, effectively cutting off trade between the world's largest economies – until both sides announced a 90-day reduction in tariffs on Monday.
    


            Wu, the political analyst in Beijing, believes Trump has a substantial base of support in China – larger than many might expect.
    


            “The enthusiasm for Trump — from intellectuals and elites to ordinary people — reflects a deeper dissatisfaction with China's current political system,” he said.
    


            For many Maoists, Trump has sparked their renewed yearning for a political movement that can bring China closer to what they see as the social equality and ideological purity of the Mao era, Wu noted.
    


            Some in the business community believe Trump's radical approach can finally push China to enact the painful reforms it needs. To Wu, their support of Trump signals a symbolic gesture: a longing for change.
    


            “What they share is a desire to see a Trump-like movement, or even a Cultural Revolution-style political shakeup, take place in China — a way to break from the status quo,” he said.
    


            Zhang, the law professor in Beijing, said similarly, Trump's reelection reflected widespread political discontent in the US.
    


            “In this context, America's ‘Cultural Revolution' can be seen as a desperate response to the failure of democracy,” he said.
    


            But Zhang believes there's no need to be overly pessimistic.
    


            After Mao's final decade of turmoil and destruction, China moved away from the fervor of ideological and class struggles to focus on economic growth. It opened up to the world and embraced the global order that the US helped create, and the rest is history.
    


            “After all, every country makes mistakes — what matters is whether it can correct them in time,” Zhang said.
    


            “Right now in the United States, the breakdown and the repair of its social contract are locked in a race. If America can mend that contract before Trump and his MAGA movement inflict lasting damage…then there is still hope. The ‘beacon of democracy' can shine again.”

A boxing tournament bringing together fighters from Russia and the Sahel region of Africa was held in Niger on Friday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the victory in World War II. 

Organized by the NGO ‘Niger–Russia Together Hand in Hand', the Russia–Sahel alliance tournament took place at the boxing center in Niamey's City Stadium. It featured fighters from Russia, Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. The event was conducted under amateur boxing regulations, meaning three rounds of three minutes each for each bout. 

“This is the first ever visit of Russian boxers to the Republic of Niger,” the press service of the Russian Boxing Federation reported on Sunday. 

A total of six bouts were held during the tournament involving 12 fighters across three weight categories. Russian boxer Pavel Zhigulsky emerged victorious in the 67 kg category. The 75 kg category saw Burkina Faso's Pardevan Mohamed and Niger's Abdul Baki Amadou prevail. In the 82 kg weight division, Mali's Traore Abubakar defeated Houssaini Hassan from Niger by technical knockout in the second round, while Burkina Faso's Sandvidi Abdul Aziz also scored a victory in the same division.  

The event organizers highlighted that the competition served not only as a sporting showcase, but also as a tribute to those who perished in the struggle against fascism. They described the event as an example of the power of sport to foster international solidarity and deepen cooperation between Russia and its African partners. 

Regional interest in commemorative events tied to Russia's Victory Day continues to grow. African leaders attended the Victory Day military parade in Moscow on May 9: Burkina Faso's interim president, Ibrahim Traore, Guinea-Bissau President Umaro Sissoco Embalo, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, President of the Republic of the Congo Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, and Ethiopian President Taye Atske Selassie. 

‘Immortal Regiment' memorial marches – honoring the memory of WWII veterans – took place in various African nations in the days leading up to Russia's Victory Day events.

India's aviation authority has announced that 32 airports in northern and north-western regions of the country have reopened. The facilities had been closed due to airspace restrictions amid heightened tensions with Pakistan.

The airports, including those in Srinagar, Chandigarh, and Amritsar, are once again available for civil aircraft operations, the authority said in a statement.

The airport closures began on May 9 after the launch of India's ‘Operation Sindoor', which involved airstrikes on suspected terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Twenty-four airports were initially shut down on Friday, with the number increasing to 32 the following day.

The decision to reopen the airports was made after New Delhi and Islamabad continued to uphold a ceasefire agreed on May 10. There have been no hostilities between the Indian and Pakistani militaries on Monday, the Indian Army said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Voice from China: This is why Moscow and Beijing stand together, now more than ever","https://www.rt.com/news/617396-russia-china-leader-agreement/","Mon, 12 May 2025 08:47:00 GMT","

By Liu Jun, Executive Director of the Center for Russian Studies, East China Normal University, professor, Guancha media contributor, and Yang Shuping, PhD candidate at Moscow State University, young researcher at the Center for Russian Studies, East China Normal University

On May 9, 2025, Moscow held a grand military parade on Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in the Great Patriotic War.

Approximately 27 foreign heads of state attended the Red Square parade, highlighting Russia's influence on the international stage and signaling a break from Western diplomatic isolation. It also reinforced Russia's ties with friendly nations. However, the parade was not merely a response to Western sanctions and containment. More importantly, it served as a powerful historical symbol and collective memory – a tribute to the immense sacrifices made for the victory in the global anti-fascist war, and a solemn reaffirmation of that great triumph and enduring honor.

At President Putin's invitation, President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Russia from May 7 to 10 and attended the Victory Day events. President Xi Jinping's visit to Russia signals a shared commitment by China and Russia to promote an accurate understanding of World War II history, defend the post-war international order centered on the United Nations, and uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. At the bilateral level, the two countries will continue to deepen their partnership through high-level exchanges, using the stability of their relationship to offset global uncertainty and advancing strategic coordination to safeguard international fairness and justice.

Eighty years ago, China and the Soviet Union fought side by side in the World Anti-Fascist War (World War II), forging a deep friendship through shared sacrifice. At this year's military parade, President Putin praised the Chinese people's significant contributions to the victory. In a signed article in Rossiyskaya Gazeta, President Xi Jinping also emphasized the decisive roles played by both countries.

Today, Western countries manipulate ideology through historical nihilism, double standards, and discursive reconstruction, deliberately downplaying, distorting, or even rewriting the historical contributions of China and the Soviet Union in World War II. By reshaping the narrative, they seek to undermine the foundations of the post-war international order and perpetuate their global dominance. Against this backdrop, the renewed call by the Chinese and Russian leaders to “jointly uphold a correct view of WWII history” serves as a powerful rebuke to historical revisionism and falsification. It reflects a shared strategic resolve to break the West's monopoly on historical discourse and to defend international justice and collective memory. This is not only a shared responsibility to safeguard historical truth, but also a deep convergence between China and Russia in promoting the democratization of international relations, building a fair and equitable global order, and opposing unilateral hegemony.

On May 8, China and Russia signed a series of cooperation documents, including two major joint statements. The first focuses on further deepening the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era; the second is a joint statement on global strategic stability. In addition, the two heads of state witnessed the exchange of multiple cooperation agreements in areas such as education, investment, culture, and science and technology. These documents not only ensure the continuity and stability of bilateral ties at the strategic level, but also reflect the steady deepening of practical cooperation across key sectors.

The 'Joint Statement on Further Deepening the China-Russia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Coordination for the New Era' not only reaffirms the two countries' firm commitment to safeguarding the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law, but also elevates the promotion of a correct view of World War II history to a strategic element of institutionalized bilateral cooperation. Key measures include jointly organizing commemorative events, conducting research and exhibitions on the crimes of Nazi Germany and Japanese militarism, locating the remains of fallen soldiers, restoring memorial sites, and deepening cooperation on WWII historical memory in education, archives, media, and youth exchanges.

The 'Joint Statement on Maintaining Global Strategic Stability' reaffirms the two countries' consistent stance on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, safeguarding the international arms control and disarmament system, and more. It also systematically establishes a comprehensive dialogue and cooperation framework that includes nuclear security, strategic deterrence balance, and governance of militarization of emerging technologies. Notably, this statement marks the first time that biological security, chemical weapons control, and military ethics in artificial intelligence have been included in the global strategic stability agenda, signaling a significant breakthrough for China and Russia in shaping a new international security paradigm for the future.

At the bilateral cooperation level, President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin witnessed the exchange of 28 cooperation documents between China and Russia, covering areas such as trade, biosafety, investment protection, digital economy, scientific facilities, quarantine, media, film, and youth exchanges. This broad agenda strengthens traditional sectors like energy and trade, while strategically positioning both countries in emerging fields like digital economy and scientific innovation, and deepening people-to-people ties through cultural, educational, and youth cooperation.

Amid unprecedented global changes, the trajectory of China-Russia relations continues to attract international attention. Some speculate about a formal alliance or potential rifts due to diverging interests. In response, China and Russia have demonstrated through deepening cooperation that they are building a new type of major-country relationship based on “highest mutual trust, coordination, and strategic value.” As President Xi has emphasized, their relationship is driven by clear historical logic, strong internal momentum, and shared civilizational heritage, not aimed at or influenced by any third party.

History is not only a repository of memories of the past, but also serves as the foundational basis for contemporary international relations, shaping value identities and acting as the spiritual pillar for a fair and just international order. The outcomes of World War II crystallized into the cornerstone of multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, establishing the fundamental principles that govern modern international relations. These principles, derived from the collective sacrifices of the war, have provided a framework for diplomacy, conflict resolution, and global cooperation. As the world faces new challenges, the importance of these historical lessons becomes increasingly evident – reminding us that the stability of the global order rests on our ability to respect shared values, adhere to international norms, and safeguard the multilateral system. In this context, the victory in WWII is not just a historical event, but an enduring legacy that continues to shape global governance and the international system.

As the renowned Russian historian Vasily Klyuchevsky once said, “Those who refuse to learn from history will ultimately pay a heavy price for their ignorance and arrogance.” China also has a saying: “Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.” The significance of history lies in guiding us forward. Upholding the achievements of WWII and safeguarding the international system centered on the United Nations is a shared responsibility and mission for both China and Russia.

MOSCOW, May 12. /TASS/. Moscow will soon respond to what Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called an ""inadequate"" move by Warsaw to shut down the Russian Consulate General in Krakow.

""Warsaw deliberately seeks to ruin the relations, by acting against its citizens. An appropriate response to these inadequate steps will follow soon,"" the diplomat told TASS.

Earlier on Monday, Polish Foreign Minster Radoslaw Sikorski decided to shut down the Russian Consulate General in Krakow. The decision followed what Sikorski called a sabotage attack on the Marywilska 44 shopping center, allegedly directed by Russian special services, he explained in a post on X.

MOSCOW, May 12. /TASS/. Russia calls on Ukraine to restart direct talks in Istanbul; India and Pakistan exchange accusations of provocation after reaching a ceasefire deal; and NATO launches a major military drill along Russia's border. These stories have topped Monday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer for Ukraine to resume direct talks in Istanbul on May 15 ""without any preconditions"" was the main result of the four-day events dedicated to the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in the Great Patriotic War, Vedomosti notes.

Putin made the statement the same day as Ukraine and its European allies - France, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom - called for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire starting on May 12. Otherwise, they said, Russia will have to face more sanctions. EU countries seem to still believe that Ukraine is capable of defending its positions on the battlefield, which is why they continue to provide military support to Kiev, Pavel Timofeev, head of the Sector of Regional Problems and Conflicts at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, noted.

Russia has never refused to hold talks, nor has it ever put forward preconditions, Nikolay Silayev, senior researcher with the Center of Caucasian Studies at Moscow State Institute of International Relations, emphasized. As for the agenda of potential talks, the parties need to build upon the draft agreement that was reached in the previous round of Istanbul talks, only recognizing Russia's new border, he said. Silayev points out that Putin's statement was important for US President Donald Trump who is unprepared to engage in a confrontation with Russia at a scale that was maintained by his predecessor but on the other hand, he is also unwilling to abandon Ukraine, which is seen as a foreign policy asset by the US and the West in general.

The main challenge lies in the position of Ukraine and European countries who insist that a ceasefire must come first, Valdai International Discussion Club expert Andrey Kortunov observed. According to him, ""such a plan does not suit Russia because there is no guarantee that Ukraine will abide by a ceasefire."" The analyst expects several rounds of mediation diplomacy to take place in the next three days in order to bring the positions of Russia and Ukraine closer together.

Putin has made another grandmaster move. The offer of an immediate launch of talks in Istanbul without preconditions is pulling the rug from under the Kiev regime and its sponsors, Diplomatic Academy Vice Principal Oleg Karpovich told Izvestia. Moscow realizes that a ceasefire is only possible in a situation where Kiev agrees to engage in a serious dialogue that would take Russia's demands into account. Perhaps, the pressure that the Zelensky regime is facing from Trump will eventually accelerate things forward, the expert concluded.

 

India and Pakistan reached a ceasefire agreement on May 10, after four days of hostilities. The news was first announced by US President Donald Trump on the Truth Social platform. The authorities of the opposing countries confirmed it a bit later; however, they continued to exchange accusations of military provocation, Vedomosti writes.

US media outlets reported, citing Indian government sources, that New Delhi and Islamabad had agreed a ceasefire in direct consultations, without enlisting Trump as a mediator. Meanwhile, White House sources pointed to the important role that US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio had played in the agreements reached by India and Pakistan.

Although Pakistan sought mediation from China, Beijing was unable to take on this role due to its tense relations with New Delhi, Vasily Kashin, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies, observed. This is why it's even convenient for Beijing that the Americans acted as intermediaries, the analyst said. According to him, despite close economic ties with Islamabad, China does not have a controlling stake in Pakistan's foreign and internal policy.

Both India and Pakistan are interested in de-escalating violence, so they are trying to backtrack now, Boris Volkhonsky, associate professor at Moscow State University's Institute of Asian and African Studies, pointed out. In his opinion, the authorities in both countries have reached their political goals, demonstrating their resolve to protect national interests to their voters. ""That said, a further escalation will serve no one. Neither India nor Pakistan wants to cross red lines by using regular forces on each other's territory,"" the expert elaborated.

Volkhonsky believes that Trump decided to interfere in the India-Pakistan conflict in order to demonstrate some diplomatic success to his fellow citizens amid failures in resolving the Russia-Ukraine crisis. ""The Indians and the Pakistanis were already prepared for de-escalation, so the US president took the opportunity to step in, passing it off as the result of clever diplomacy,"" the expert noted.

 

Major military drills are kicking off in Finland on May 12, which involve Sweden and the United Kingdom. About 7,000 troops will take part in the operation. The drills, set to last until May 31, are aimed at practicing indirect fire, as well as the use of attack helicopters and drones in the north, Izvestia reports.

NATO is currently trying to master the skills and knowledge gained in Ukraine, military expert Vadim Kozyulin said. ""They have come to understand that the unmanned aerial vehicles the alliance has in service are already outdated,"" he explained. ""Military technology is developing rapidly in the course of Russia's special military operation. It's safe to say that Ukraine has turned into a kind of testing ground for advanced equipment and weapons, primarily UAVs. Now, NATO must be considering forming drone forces, which is what Kiev is already doing,"" Kozyulin added.

Finland has joined NATO just recently, but in fact, it has always been the bloc's ally, repeatedly hosting joint drills with the North Atlantic Alliance. According to the expert, the current exercise is nothing new, it's just that its magnitude is larger, and this is exactly what makes it a threat to Russia. ""We need to show an adequate response. For the time being, we will simply watch what they do, taking it into account. NATO keeps saying that it will only implement defense scenarios, but the drills it holds also practice actions suitable for aggressive operations,"" the analyst stressed.

For years, Sweden and Finland maintained neutrality, preserving good-neighborly relations first with the Soviet Union and then with Russia, which benefited them both economically and politically, Sergey Ordzhonikidze, former United Nations undersecretary, pointed out. ""However, they have now taken an overtly anti-Russian position, giving in to the influence of the British and other major Western European nations. In particular, they joined NATO.

What did they get in return? Nothing but the need to obey the bloc's military and political leadership. This doesn't strengthen their security but undermines it. Russia has never posed a threat to these countries. On the contrary, it always supported their neutrality,"" the expert noted. In the meantime, it must be remembered that any hostile action against a country such as Russia will not remain without serious consequences, Ordzhonikidze concluded.

 

Declining oil prices and freight rates have contributed to a rise in Russian oil exports. In April, oil shipments through ports rose to 448,000 metric tons per day, recovering to the level recorded in December 2024, when the US introduced sweeping sanctions. Given a stable demand for oil in Asia and a decrease in transportation fees, the current export level is expected to continue into May, Kommersant writes.

Alexey Politov, senior analyst at the Price Index Center, says that India, China and Turkey remain the key markets of oil exports as demand for Russian oil brands remains stable there due to attractive prices.

Lyudmila Rokotyanskaya, stock market expert at BCS World of Investment, believes that April's export growth stemmed from a decline in global oil prices, accompanied by a speedy recovery of production by OPEC+ countries. If the group continues to gradually restore production to the previous levels, additional conditions may be created for a rise in Russian exports, she noted. The expert also pointed to recovering supplies to China, which were partially interrupted by the sanctions that the US introduced in January.

Politov adds that market participants expect the level of exports will either remain the same or slightly grow in May.

Igor Yushkov, a specialist at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, warns that there are currently no reasons for the growth of oil prices, given geopolitical tensions and trade wars. The OPEC+ group's decision to increase output by 411,000 barrels per day in June will have an additional effect on the market as it is three times as much as the initial plan, he stressed.

Meanwhile, restrictions on the fleet carrying Russian oil may be expanded. According to Bloomberg, the EU's 17th package of sanctions, which is currently in the works, may target up to 150 tankers suspected of circumventing the oil price cap. Rokotyanskaya notes that the main risk is that the US will support the EU, introducing similar restrictions.

 

Bitcoin's price has approached the $105,000 level for the first time since January. The digital currency's value rose by over 9% in less than a week due to soft rhetoric from the US Federal Reserve and a trade agreement between Washington and London. The capitalization of other major cryptocurrencies increased by 8-36% during the same period. Experts interviewed by Kommersant expect the bull campaign to continue amid hopes for an easing of frictions between the United States and its trading partners.

Another wave of growth in the leading cryptocurrency's price stems from the outcome of the Federal Reserve's May 7 meeting, which maintained the key rate at the 4.25-4.5 range. According to BitRiver financial analyst Vladislav Antonov, market participants paid special attention to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks about the influence that the Trump administration's tariff policy could have on inflation processes. As a result, investors started to predict a potential decline in interest rates in the second quarter of 2025. ""Cheaper money always increases demand for risky assets,"" Roman Kaufman, CEO and founder of Alpha7291, pointed out.

An improving geopolitical situation gave an additional boost to the process. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with the UK. ""The general tone of the ‘tariff wars' has significantly softened. On May 11, Trump announced that the US and China reached an agreement to fully reload relations following a meeting in Switzerland, where numerous issues had been discussed and agreements had been achieved on most of them,"" Neomarkets Chief Analyst Oleg Kalmanovich noted. Consequently, investor appetite for risks, as well as demand for digital currencies, increased across the world.

Bitcoin price stabilizing above the $100,000 level has paved the way for continued growth and new all-time highs. Antonov expects the price to reach the $114,000-119,000 threshold in the near future. In the coming week, investors will focus on US inflation data, set to be released on May 13, and on Trump's rhetoric. ""If the negotiation process continues and new trade agreements are reached, it will be only a matter of time when bitcoin will hit new records,"" Kalmanovich said.

US senator says Republicans must choose whether to back working Americans or rich corporate executives

Josh Hawley, the influential US senator from Missouri, has warned that his Republican party is suffering from an “identity crisis” over whether it stands for working Americans or rich corporate executives, signaling a worsening split among Donald Trump's congressional troops over the president's plans for deep Medicaid cuts.

In an opinion piece in the New York Times published on Monday, Hawley warned his fellow Republicans it would be “politically suicidal” to concede to huge cuts in the federal program that provides health insurance to more than 70 million low-income Americans. He derided what he called the “Wall Street wing” of his own party that he said favoured corporate giveaways at the price of “slashing health insurance for the working poor”.

Hawley's pointed attack on his Republican colleagues highlights the intensifying clash within his party over how to deliver Trump's desire to extend his 2017 tax cuts. To pay for the extension, the House energy and commerce committee has been charged with finding $880bn in federal spending cuts over a decade – much of which is likely to come from Medicaid.

Late on Sunday, the committee released its latest iteration of its proposals. The plan would strip almost 9 million low-income Americans of their health insurance mainly by trimming Medicaid, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

The latest draft proposals would also require millions of low-income Americans who earn above the federal poverty level to contribute co-payments for medical services.

The plans for Medicaid cuts would require approval from both the House and the narrowly divided Senate. Hawley is one of a few Republican senators, including Susan Collins from Maine, who are putting up staunch resistance.

In his Times op-ed, Hawley expresses his opposition to deep Medicaid cuts in existential terms. He suggests that the Republican party under Trump is facing a blunt choice – does it represent the majority of working Americans? Or, using a term referring to the top executives at companies, will it become a permanent minority party “speaking only for the C-suite”?

Hawley's strongly worded intervention carries the weight of a devoted Trump loyalist who has backed some of the most controversial aspects of the US president's Make America Great Again (Maga) movement. He was a leading figure in efforts within the Senate to block the certification of Joe Biden's victory over Trump in the 2020 election. And he notoriously presented a clenched fist to the Trump supporters outside the Capitol building on 6 January 2021 before they attacked Congress that day.

Hawley was later captured on video running from the mob through the hallway of the building, prompting a deluge of derisive memes.

His claims in his opinion piece to be a champion of working Americans should carry caveats. He has opposed raising the minimum wage in Missouri and has enthusiastically backed efforts to undermine public-sector trade unions.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Head of US Department of Health told parents to ‘do their own research' when deciding to vaccinate their children

Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, has intimated that parents are to blame for their children's autism, and that they are responsible for researching every aspect of their children's lives that could affect their development.

“We have to recognize we are doing this to our children, and we need to put an end to it,” Kennedy said at his first press conference as health secretary.

In a recent interview with Dr Phil McGraw, Kennedy told parents to “do their own research” when it comes to vaccinating their kids, stating that scientists were still trying to understand whether the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes severe side-effects like brain swelling (they know; it doesn't).

“You research the baby stroller, you research the foods that they're getting, and you need to research the medicines that they're taking as well,” he said.

These statements appear to blame parents for vaccinating their kids and causing autism, a developmental and neurological condition that is overwhelmingly genetic, said Jessica Calarco, professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and author of Holding It Together: How Women Became America's Safety Net.

“That's very much what he's implying and how it's going to be read,” Calarco said.

It's a message that reminded Shannon Des Roches Rosa of the early days after her son's diagnosis. In 2003, she subscribed to the then novel theory that vaccines could be linked to autism – to the point that she stopped vaccinating her children.

She saw a doctor who specialized in treating autistic children, and he “had us doing all this pseudoscience and supplements and not vaccinating our kids”, Rosa said.

“People were thinking we were having an autism epidemic when we weren't. It was diagnosis and recognition,” she said.

As study after study came out showing no link between vaccines and autism, Rosa began getting her kids regular shots once again.

“There is no association between vaccines and autism. As much as any science can be settled, that is settled,” said Rosa, a senior editor of Thinking Person's Guide to Autism – and by relitigating this point, Kennedy “is causing incredible harm”, she said.

“I don't think parents blame themselves automatically. I think they blame themselves when they hear from people who stoke their fears about autism, like RFK Jr.”

Parents, especially mothers, have long been blamed for their children's autism diagnoses. In the 1940s, psychologists believed the condition was caused by “refrigerator mothers”, or moms who were too “cold” to their children.

“There was a huge culture of blame and shame toward mothers,” Calarco said.

That's one of the reasons the debunked vaccination explanation for autism has been so appealing and persistent, she said. “Despite the clear evidence against it, it alleviates that blame.”

In his efforts to link vaccines to autism, Kennedy also opens the door for legal action against vaccine makers, Calarco said.

“If they can point to the vaccine, it means that they can legally hold someone else liable, and thereby sue to get financial support for the often high costs of supporting their children in a society that doesn't have a strong social safety net.”

That lack of a social safety net is one reason why Kennedy has been popular among some parents of autistic children.

after newsletter promotion

For instance, families of disabled children were nearly twice as likely to face financial hardship than families of children without disabilities, according to a new study.

“We put so much burden on families, and particularly on mothers, to navigate their children's diagnoses, to navigate the supports that their children need,” Calarco said. “In that kind of system, it's easy to want any kind of support and attention, even if that means accepting misinformation.”

Blaming mothers has persisted through the decades in part because “mothers are overwhelmingly the ones who make healthcare decisions for their families”, Calarco said. “If you're telling parents or telling society that someone should be doing this work of keeping kids safe, what you're really saying is women should be doing this work, especially mothers.”

This message also reinforces ideals of intensive mothering, especially stay-at-home mothering, Calarco said. “RFK Jr is weaponizing the supermom myth – the false idea that moms are the only ones who can keep kids safe from harm.”

Rosa pushed back on Kennedy's recommendation that parents do research on vaccines.

“I shouldn't have to be doing that. That's what researchers do, and researchers have already settled this question. I cannot tell you how distressing it is to have seen all these years of research go into autism and vaccine causation that could have been used to research better quality of life for my son,” she said.

Some parents, believing they are responsible for the diagnosis and for finding relief, also try unproven and dangerous “treatments” for autism. Chelation, for instance, is a process used to reverse heavy-metal poisoning that can cause heart attacks and deaths if not overseen carefully. A five-year-old child died in a hyperbaric chamber in January while undergoing “oxygen therapy”. And other parents have given their children enemas with industrial bleach on the advice of discredited pseudoscientists.

“It's not enough to let people know that vaccines don't cause autism. We also have to affirm that autism is not something to fear,” Rosa has written.

“If they got affirming and neutral information about autism from the start, if our society wasn't so fearful of autism from the start – obviously every kind of disability is different, but it would just be like, ‘Oh, my kid needs glasses,'” she said.

“Disability is a natural part of human variation, even though it's so badly stigmatized, so what we need to work on is developing better supports for people like my son,” Rosa continued.

Health leaders such as Kennedy “need to focus on helping people live good lives, instead of trying to prevent them from existing”, she said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Two dozen fasting students also press university system to divest from weapon manufacturers in list of demands

About two dozen California State University students began a hunger strike last week to protest against starvation in Gaza due to Israel's aid blockade, marking the latest act of political protest on college campuses.

The strikers – students from San Jose State, Sacramento State, San Francisco State and CSU Long Beach – began their fast on 5 May

“We, the students of San Francisco, Sacramento, Long Beach, and San Jose State Universities, are beginning a united hunger strike in solidarity with the two million Palestinians at risk of starvation in Gaza,” Students for Justice in Palestine wrote in a press release. They are also pushing the university system to divest from weapons manufacturers, among other stated goals.

The hunger strikes come as Israel's aid blockade in Gaza passes its second month, and is facing mounting international criticism for the millions of Palestinians pushed toward famine, as well as Israel's finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich's, recent assertion that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed.”

Max Flynt, a hunger striker and undergraduate student at San Francisco State University, cited the aid blockade as a decisive factor for organizing the strike. Flynt sets up daily on the campus quad with other organizers and strikers under a “Hunger Strike for Gaza” canopy. Organizers hold educational workshops and strikers have their vitals taken every few hours, but do not stay overnight.

“Many of the forms of protests that were used last year, specifically the encampments, have become effectively illegal in the United States,” Flynt said. “If we were to put up a tent today, the police would be called on us almost immediately.”

Jaime Jackson, a professor at Sacramento State and member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine who studies non-violent protest, pointed out the hunger strike's symbolic ties with the realities in Gaza.

“The bombing, the killing, the massive violations of human rights have been an ongoing issue throughout,” Jackson said. “But the recent, really big thing has been the blocking of humanitarian aid and the ongoing starvation of people in Gaza.”

The crackdown on college protesters from the police to policy level, began during the Biden administration last year and has only increased under Trump. International students with vocal support for Palestinians have been especially targeted.

“We know that the Trump administration is doing this because they're scared of the student movement, they're scared of what they saw last year, and they're scared that it will come back again,” Flynt said.

The divestment demands from Flynt and other protesters include the California State University system's adoption of San Francisco State University's Human Rights IPS Screening, the severance of study abroad programs with Israeli universities, and divestment from companies producing military, weapons and surveillance technology.

“We're aware of where they are sending our money, and we don't want to be used to any of these war efforts, genocide through these companies,” said Amal Dawud, and undergraduate and organizer at Sacramento State University.

Two schools in the California State University system, Sacramento State University and San Francisco State University, began some form of divestment last year after meeting with student protesters. San Francisco State University confirmed the offloading of assets in Lockheed Martin, Leonardo and Palantir, while some questions remain surrounding the mechanics of Sacramento State's divestment.

Questions linger surrounding the mechanics and concrete implications of divestment. A recently killed congressional bill would have expanded penalties for boycotting and divestment.

Marcus Bode, an undergraduate and hunger striker at California State, Long Beach, cited his university's partnership with Boeing, a major supplier to the Israel Defense Forces, as something that would disappear under divestment. Bode can consume water, powder electrolytes and sports fluid under the conditions of the strike, and said that he is already feeling the physical effects of the strike, including aching joints, muscle cramps and lightheadedness.

“We don't see those increases in tuition and fees, those hikes and prices, being returned as a benefit to the student. It isn't being reinvested into our campus and into our student body,” Bode said. “It's instead being used to fund war and genocide abroad.”

Bode and his fellow hunger strikers face an uphill battle with the university system.

Amy Bentley-Smith, CSU's director of media relations, said the system and its campuses would not alter investment policies but honor the right to protest. “We will continue to uphold the values of free inquiry, peaceful protest and academic freedom,” Smith said to the Guardian in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The first white South Africans granted refugee status under a program initiated by US President Donald Trump on Sunday boarded a plane to leave from the nation's main international airport in Johannesburg.

A line of white citizens with airport trolleys full of luggage, much of it wrapped in theft-proof cellophane, waited to have their passports stamped, a reporter saw, before they entered the departure lounge for their charter flight.

“One of the conditions of the permit was to ensure that they were vetted in case one of them has a criminal issue pending,” South African Department of Transport spokesperson Collen Msibi said, adding that 49 passengers had been cleared.

Journalists were not granted access to those headed to the US.

Msibi said they were due to fly to Dulles Airport just outside Washington and then on to Texas. They had boarded the plane, but not yet left as of 8:30pm.

Trump's offer of asylum to white South Africans, especially Afrikaners — the group with the longest history among white settlers in South Africa and who make up the bulk of whites — has been divisive in both nations.

In the US, it comes as the Trump administration has blocked mostly non-white refugee admissions from the rest of the world. In South Africa, it coincides with heightened racial tensions over land and jobs that have dogged domestic politics since the end of white minority rule.

Despite a wider freeze on refugees, Trump called on the US to prioritize resettling Afrikaners, descendants of mostly Dutch early settlers, saying they were “victims of unjust racial discrimination.”

The granting of refugee status to white South Africans — who have remained by far the most privileged race since apartheid ended 30 years ago — has been met with a mixture of alarm and ridicule by South African authorities, who say the Trump administration has waded into a domestic political issue that it does not understand.

Three decades since Nelson Mandela ushered democracy into South Africa, the white minority that ruled it has managed to retain most of the wealth that was amassed under colonialism and apartheid.

Whites still own three-quarters of private land and about 20 times the wealth of the black majority, according to the Review of Political Economy, an international academic journal.

Whites are also the race least affected by joblessness.

Yet the claim that minority white South Africans face discrimination from the black majority has been repeated so often in online chatrooms that is has become orthodoxy for the far-right, and has been echoed by Trump's white South African-born ally Elon Musk.

Thousands of overseas Filipino workers have already cast their ballots in the race dominated by a bitter feud between President Ferdinand Marcos Jr and his impeached vice president, Sara Duterte.

Liberal democracies in the Asia-Pacific region must become more resilient, individually and collectively, and carefully consider how to reset their relationships with Washington, to navigate the new cold war between the US and China, an international relations expert said yesterday.

Robin Niblett, a distinguished fellow at Chatham House in London and a senior adviser to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, made the remarks at a forum in Taipei hosted by the Taiwan-based Center for Asia-Pacific Resilience and Innovation.

In his opening keynote at the event, which was themed “Building Resilience on Shaky Ground in the Asia Pacific,” Niblett said the world is witnessing a new cold war emerge between the US, the world's biggest consumer market, and China, the world's biggest exporter.

While Washington believes China has grown to its position “on the back of America,” and is determined not to help anymore, Beijing believes the US wants to prevent its rise and to contain it economically, he said.

Their dispute is not only a geopolitical contest, but also a competition in military, technology and ideology.

“If China wants to be economically secured as the world's largest exporter, it wants to break out of the first island chain,” he said, adding that Beijing has been investing heavily in its navy, making efforts to control the South China Sea, and pursuing nuclear capabilities to match those of the US and Russia.

Technology is critical to economic growth and central to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) “military-civil fusion,” which uses technology to bolster its military capabilities, he said.

It is also an ideological war between a top-down centralized government and a bottom-up democratic government, he said, adding that the CCP is afraid the US would undermine its leadership by spreading democracy.

“The US-China contest really became a cold war because of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine” — as it forced China to pick sides, and it chose Moscow, Niblett said.

That raised a sense of insecurity in the Asia-Pacific region, especially among US allies, as they are not only facing China, but also with Russia, he said.

At the end of the US president Joe Biden's administration, there was a “knitting together” of the US' allies, with the G7 acting as a steering committee for coordinating the US' Atlantic and Pacific allies against China and Russia, he said.

That created opportunities for other countries, playing one side off the other, he added.

However, with US President Donald Trump's return to power, the new cold war has entered a new chapter, with a range of new risks, Niblett said.

The fundamental difference between Biden and the current president is that Trump does not believe in alliances, he said.

Trump views allies as countries to take advantage of, because he believes they rely on the US consumer market and the US military for security, but the US needs to “negotiate with its rivals,” he said.

Beijing has been accelerating its “gray zone” operations, including military exercises around Taiwan and naval activities in the region, since Trump's return, he said.

Meanwhile, nations in the Asia-Pacific region fear that Trump's “me first” policies could deeply damage economies that have long relied on access to global markets, he added.

In such a challenging moment, liberal democracies in the region, including Taiwan, should “become more resilient individually,” as bilateral treaty arrangements with the US remain vital, but might no longer be relied upon in the short term, Niblett said.

Asia-Pacific democracies must increase defense spending and be innovative in their defense strategies, enhance hybrid resilience against “gray zone” warfare, and bolster their energy and economic resilience, he said.

They also need to “become more resilient collectively,” strengthen regional economic integration, such as with ASEAN, open up markets among themselves and retain relationships with the EU, he said.

“Taiwan's future lies with the other liberal democracies that rely on America for their security,” he said, adding that “looking for deeper economic or business relationships with the G7 or countries such as Australia, would be absolutely vital for Taiwan's future.”

Liberal democracies in the Asia-Pacific region must also “be very thoughtful about how to reset relationships with the US,” he said.

A challenge for them is how to make sure the US sees them as good allies, when Washington wakes up again and realizes its need for alliances, he said.

The government would provide full scholarships for international students to further their studies for two years in Taiwan, so those who want to pursue a master's degree can consider applying for the program, he said.
The fields included are science, technology, engineering, mathematics, semiconductors and finance, Yeh added.
The program, called “Intense 2+2,” would also assist international students who completed the two years of further studies in

Tsai arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport on Friday night, but did not speak to reporters before departing.
Tsai wrote on social media later that the purpose of the trip was to reaffirm the commitment of Taiwanese to working with democratic allies to promote regional security and stability, upholding freedom and democracy, and defending their homeland.
She also expressed hope that through joint efforts, Taiwan and Europe would continue to be partners building up economic resilience on the global stage.

""If the Russians are using this level of specialists in urban combat, they are probably facing some difficulties,"" Ivan Petrychak, spokesperson for the 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade, said.

Previously, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk accused the Russian intelligence services of orchestrating a May 2024 arson attack on the Marywilska shopping centre in Warsaw.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova spread a claim that the footage of a train carriage with French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz showed a ""bag and spoon"" for drugs.

The story was subsequently picked up by Russian propagandists, who claimed that the European leaders used drugs during their trip.

The three European leaders, as well as Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, visited Kyiv on May 10 to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky and reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.

Zelensky and the European partners also endorsed an unconditional ceasefire with Russia starting on May 12, a proposal Moscow ignored.

The United States has approved the transfer of 125 long-range artillery rockets and 100 Patriot air defense missiles from Germany to Ukraine, the New York Times (NYT) reported on May 10. 

The American-made weapons cannot be exported, even by a country that owns them, without approval from the U.S. government. 

A U.S. congressional official on May 9 announced that Washington had given the green light for Germany to transfer the weapons to Kyiv, the NYT reported. The shipment includes 125 long-range artillery rockets and 100 Patriot air defense missiles. 

The Patriot air defense system is widely recognized for its high-precision detection, tracking, and interception of aircraft, cruise, and ballistic missiles. Ukraine reportedly has only eight Patriot systems, two of which are currently not in service. An additional Patriot system is on its way to Ukraine from Israel as part of a previously arranged commitment, the NYT reported on May 4.

Kyiv faces a shortage of ammunition for its Patriots, though details about its missile stocks have not been disclosed for security purposes. President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly urged the U.S. and international partners to provide additional Patriot systems and missiles as Russian attacks against Ukrainian cities intensify. 

Production of Patriot missiles is expensive and complex, meaning the shortage is a worldwide issue. 

At least two Patriot missiles are needed to intercept a ballistic missile, Ukrainian aviation expert Kostiantyn Kryvolap told the Kyiv Independent on May 6. Russia has escalated its ballistic missile attacks against Ukraine, making April the deadliest month for Ukrainian civilians since September 2024. 

Germany has provided Kyiv with air defense support, including Patriot missiles and IRIS-T systems, in previous military aid packages. Newly elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz arrived in Kyiv on May 10, along with other European leaders, to reaffirm Germany and Europe's support for Ukraine and commitment to securing a ceasefire deal.

The leaders of the United Kingdon, France, Germany, and Poland will visit Kyiv on May 10 to demonstrate their support for Ukraine, the leaders announced in a joint statement May 9. 

The planned visit comes the day after Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow, an annual event the Kremlin uses to showcase its military might and justify the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin invited a number of world leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, to attend this year's celebrations. 

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk are set to arrive in Kyiv early on May 10 to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to a statement from the U.K. government.

The historic visit marks the first time the leaders of all four countries have traveled to Ukraine together and Merz's first visit to Ukraine as Germany's chancellor. 

The visit also comes the day after U.S. President Donald Trump demanded a ""30-day unconditional ceasefire"" between Russia and Ukraine. Reuters reported on May 9 that the U.S. and European allies are currently finalizing their proposal for a full 30-day truce. 

The U.S. embassy in Kyiv on May 9 warned that ""a potentially significant air attack"" could occur in the coming days — amid Russia's so-called ceasefire. 

""We, the leaders of France, Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom will stand in Kyiv in solidarity with Ukraine against Russia's barbaric and illegal full-scale invasion,"" the joint statement reads.

""We reiterate our backing for President Trump's calls for a peace deal and call on Russia to stop obstructing efforts to secure an enduring peace. Alongside the U.S., we call on Russia to agree to a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire to create the space for talks on a just and lasting peace.""

Since March, Ukraine has agreed to accept a complete ceasefire as soon as Russia agrees to the same terms. Russia has rejected these conditions repeatedly, insisting it will not begin a full ceasefire until Ukraine makes extreme concessions, including halting all military aid. 

Instead, Putin has proposed a series of partial and temporary truces, which Russia has then proceeded to break. Ahead of Victory Day, Putin unilaterally declared a temporary ceasefire from May 8-11. Nonetheless, attacks against Ukrainian civilians and front-line assaults have continued. 

""We are ready to support peace talks as soon as possible, to discuss technical implementation of the ceasefire, and prepare for a full peace deal,"" the joint statement said.

""We are clear the bloodshed must end, Russia must stop its illegal invasion, and Ukraine must be able to prosper as a safe, secure, and sovereign nation within its internationally recognized borders for generations to come.""

The four leaders will visit Kyiv's Independence Square to pay their respects to Ukraine's fallen soldiers and casualties of the full-scale war, according to the announcement. They will also host a virtual meeting alongside Zelensky briefing allies on the work of a future coalition that will monitor peace in Ukraine. 

The ""air, land, maritime, and regeneration force"" will help bolster Ukraine's military following an eventual peace deal and will ""strenghten confidence in any future peace,"" the statement read.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","U.S., China agree to pause most tariffs after trade talks","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-and-china-to-drastically-slash-tariffs-after-trade-war-talks/","Mon, 12 May 2025 08:44:37 GMT","

The United States and China announced Monday they were massively rolling back tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days, after trade talks in Geneva over the weekend. 

The United States and China said they have agreed a deal to slash reciprocal tariffs as Washington and Beijing seek to end a trade war that has disrupted the global economy and set financial markets on edge.

Reuters

The breakthrough follows months of ratcheting up economic tensions between the world's two largest economies, since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office and launched an all-out trade war against almost all of Washington's partners and rivals. 

In a rare joint statement, the two governments said U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced from 145 per cent to 30, while China would cut its levies on U.S. imports from 125 per cent to 10. The reductions will take place by May 14 and last “for an initial period of 90 days.” 

“After taking the aforementioned actions, the parties will establish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations,” the joint statement said, adding this dialogue would be led by Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. 

Speaking in Geneva, Mr. Bessent said “we both have an interest in balanced trade, the U.S. will continue moving toward that.”

“We have a very good mechanism to avoid unfortunate escalations happening again,” Mr. Bessent said, adding the “consensus from both delegations is that neither side wanted a decoupling.” 

Both economies have begun to feel the strain of reduced exports and severely higher prices as a result of reciprocal tariffs, and concerns over disruption to the bilateral relationship have contributed to chaos in the U.S. stock and treasury markets.

Facing growing criticism, Mr. Trump last month said he was open to a trade deal, which he said could happen “pretty quickly,” promising not to “play hardball” during negotiations with China.

“They're gonna do very well, and I think they're going to be happy, and we're gonna live together very happily and ideally work together,” he said.

Monday's announcement is the second major rollback of tariffs championed by Mr. Trump, emblematic of an economic policy that has caused turmoil in the markets. 

On April 2, Mr. Trump announced a raft of “Liberation Day” tariffs against almost every country in the world, with levies apparently decided based on a calculation derived from a target's trade deficit with the U.S., though countries with a trade surplus and even uninhabited territories were not spared. 

After markets plummeted and a global recession loomed, Mr. Trump backtracked, announcing a 90-day pause, which is still in effect. He has since been negotiating individual trade deals with many countries, with the most comprehensive struck last week with Britain. 

Speaking to reporters Friday, Mr. Trump dismissed criticism of his approach. 

“I think the tariffs are going to be the greatest thing we've ever done as a country,” he said. “It's going to make our country rich again.”

Nissan Motor will cut more than 10,000 jobs globally, bringing the number of layoffs, including those previously announced, to about 20,000 or 15 per cent of its work force, Japan's public broadcaster NHK reported on Monday.

Japan's third-biggest automaker is striving to make its business leaner and more resilient after weak sales in China and its biggest market the United States.

Nissan declined to comment on the report.

It is set to announce on Tuesday results for the business year that ended in March. It warned last month it would likely book a record 700 billion yen to 750 billion yen ($4.74-billion-$5.08-billion) net loss in that year due to impairment charges.

The car maker missed out on the growing popularity of hybrid models in the United States and failed to capitalize on an early lead in electric vehicles there.

It has also suffered in China, the world's biggest auto market, where it plans to launch some 10 new vehicles in the coming years to try to halt a slide in sales.

CEO Ivan Espinosa, who took over from Makoto Uchida as chief executive last month, is restructuring Nissan's operations and has previously said the company was considering extra measures.

Nissan, which had more than 133,000 staff as of March last year, announced plans last November to cut 9,000 jobs and reduce global capacity by 20 per cent.

It has also said it would close a plant in Thailand by June and shut two more plants that it has not identified.

On Friday, it said it had decided to give up a plan to build a $1.1-billion factory, for which it was set to receive government subsidies, for EV batteries on Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu.

Its weak performance forced it to cut its profit outlook four times for the financial year that just ended.

Ayami Sato signs a baseball for a young fan on the field at Christie Pits after making her debut as the first woman to play professional baseball in Canada for the Toronto Maple Leafs IBL team, on May 11.Sarah Espedido/The Globe and Mail

Leafs nation rose across Toronto on Sunday, first at the baseball park and later at the hockey rink. 

The 106th season of the Intercounty Baseball League (IBL) commenced with a historic moment as Ayami Sato, a six-time Women's Baseball World Cup champion with Japan, pitched for the Toronto Maple Leafs Baseball Club. 

Sato struck out one batter and did not allow anyone on base in the first two innings of the Maple Leafs' 6-5 loss to the visiting Kitchener Panthers. For many of the 2,000 spectators at Christie Pits Park, the score was secondary at best. 

“Ayami, Ayami, Ayami,” the crowd chanted as the three-time MVP ran on to the field. 

Sato, widely regarded as the best female pitcher in the world, joined the Maple Leafs with the club saying she is the first woman to play professional baseball in Canada.

“This is a really important moment,” said Winse Lam, a Canadian girls' baseball coach who was at the game to watch history happen alongside her family. 

“We've been waiting for something like this to happen in Canada, and Sato is a trailblazer doing it. I hope it sets sparks for girls to continue playing.” 

Toronto finished seventh in the standings last season and is eyeing a top-three finish this year. Across the winter, the team recruited young names who are hopeful to prove themselves and sharpen their skills by working with a pitcher like Sato. 

Though this was not the start the team had hoped for, “There are many positives to take from today,” head coach Rob Butler said. 

“Ayami was just incredible and showed why she's here today,” he added. 

The pitcher herself found something else incredible: the young girls in the crowd.

“I was looking at the future of female baseball,” Sato told The Globe, holding back tears.

The Toronto-based club is the only IBL team that does not charge fans for tickets, a quality the co-owners are very proud to hold, they said. 

“It's a very important and affordable option for family time,” said Xingci, who was out for her first baseball game in a very long time. “It's made for the community to enjoy.”

Her partner, Chi, – neither wanted to use their last names – referenced Sato's signing to being as monumental as when Toronto FC signed Italian soccer star, Sebastian Giovinco in 2015. He went on to become one of the most beloved athletes in the city.

Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow and councillor Dianne Saxe were in attendance. Saxe, addressing the crowd, said the event was “not a moment of history, but a movement.”

Scattered across the steep hill surrounding the baseball field were multiple local girls teams from across the region who made the trip down to Toronto to welcome the Japanese pitcher to town.

From the moment they laid out their snacks and mats on the grass, the hundreds of girls chanted loudly for Sato and the Leafs. 

“We primarily play against all-male opponents, and being able to come out here and be part of history is inspiring, not only for me and the girls, but also for my son,” said Tara Barratt, one of the coaches with the under-11 girls' York Cardinals. 

After the game, the group of young players met with Sato for autographs on the field. 

“Ayami, you're so inspiring,” one said. 

“Konnichiwa,” another followed.

“Thank you for being here,” a group of girls giggled out. 

The timing was perfect for Sato's debut in the city, as Mother's Day celebrations also took place. A group of young men had printed photos of their mothers on the back of their Leafs jerseys, and picnic mats had young girls and mothers eating hotdogs and ice cream across.

The team announcer asked the crowd to get up and give a big round of applause to “all of the great moms out there,” before the first pitch of the game.

“It's a big day for us mothers, daughters, and grandmothers. It's extremely suitable for the outing today.” highlighted Lam.

Sato and the Leafs will travel to the Athletic Kulture Stadium in Barrie to face the Barrie Baycats on Thursday, May 15, as they look to grab their first of the season.

The Kurdish militant group said it was ""close to completing its historic mission"" after decades of conflict with Turkey. The group's long-jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan had called for a permanent ceasefire.

The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has said the Kurdish militant group plans to cease operations soon, news agencies close to the organization reported on Monday.

The announcement comes after four decades of armed conflict with the Turkish government over autonomy for ethnic Kurds in the country.

""The 12th PKK Congress has decided to dissolve the PKK's organizational structure and end its method of armed struggle,"" read a statement from the group carried by pro-Kurdish news agency ANF.

Their most recent summit has ""brought the Kurdish issue to the point of resolution through democratic politics, thus completing its historical mission,"" they added.

After holding its congress last week, it appeared that the group was responding to a call by PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan to lay down their arms. Ocalan has been imprisoned on an island near Istanbul since 1999.

Over the weekend, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had hinted the decision was close at hand,  saying ""we are advancing with firm steps on the path to the goal of a terror-free Turkey.""

Kurds are an ethnic group of at least 30 million people who were split between Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran when Western allies redrew borders following the end of World War I.

The PKK was founded in 1978 with the stated goal of achieving an independent Kurdish state. However, in the 1990s they changed course, seeking only autonomy within Turkey.

Armed clashes with Turkish security over the decades, as well as attacks on civilians, led to the group being labeled a terrorist organization by Ankara, as well as the United States and the European Union. 

In turn, the Turkish government has been accused of destroying Kurdish villages and towns and forcing displacement of civilians in an effort to root out the group.

Washington and Beijing struck an optimistic tone following two-day trade negotiations with China in Geneva. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent promised a briefing on the outcome on Monday.

Washington has wrapped a weekend of trade talks with China in Geneva, Switzerland with optimism, with both US and Chinese officials citing ""progress.""

US President Donald Trump's top economic and trade advisors have taken to the airwaves to announce that everything is going according to plan and the president's unorthodox approach to trade negotiations is working.

Top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett told Fox News: ""It looks like the Chinese are very, very eager to play ball and to re-normalize things.""

The US negotiating team was led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Beijing was represented by Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and his advisors.

Speaking after the Sunday negotiating session, Treasury Secretary Bessent noted ""a great deal of productivity."" 

""I'm happy to report that we've made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks,"" he said.

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said: ""It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought.""

A statement issued by Bessent and Greer on Sunday lacked details, which the US team says will be provided at an official briefing on Monday morning.

Later on Sunday, Chinese Vice Premier He also expressed optimism at the talks, reporting ""important progress.""

Speaking to reporters in Geneva, He said the atmosphere of the talks had been candid, in-depth, and substantive. The two countries are due to announce more details in a joint statement on Monday, he added, echoing Bessent's promise.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Sunday said the talks were designed to ""de-escalate"" tensions between the world's two largest economies.

The talks come after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on China — which Beijing responded to with 125% tariff on US goods — amid a global onslaught designed to reset perceived US trade imbalances around the world.

Fittingly, Geneva is also home to the World Trade Organization (WTO), where numerous countries and even the European Union have filed complaints against Trump's approach, arguing his tariffs violate WTO rules.

Trump himself said that ""great progress"" had been made so far, claiming ""many things discussed, much agreed to.""

Commerce Secretary Lutnick said he was ""optimistic,"" without offering details.

Earlier this week, Washington and London announced a trade deal that was praised as a ""breakthrough"" by Trump and ""historic"" by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, though no final deal has actually been signed, rather a commitment to get one done.

Huddled together on a dirt bank outside a building site on the edge of the Panama Canal, the men shout fervidly about Donald Trump.

The majority of Panamanians have reacted with revulsion to Mr Trump's pledge to “take back” the key waterway – with thousands having marched and burned effigies of the US president in protest.

But this gaggle of out-of-work construction workers are not excoriating Mr Trump – they are passionately cheering him on.

“May Trump come, take the canal in his pocket and remove all those people from its administration. They are thieves,” one worker, who asked to remain anonymous, bellows, his arms flailing.

Amid rising frustration with José Raúl Mulino, Panama's president, is an emerging belief that the canal benefits just a few “elites”, resulting in some Panamanians to call for Mr Trump's intervention.

In his first 100 days, Mr Trump has turned the 51-mile waterway which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans into a political hot rod, claiming it is under Chinese control.

Although the Panamanian government has repeatedly denied any Chinese influence, a Hong Kong-based firm, CK Hutchison Holdings, does manage two ports adjacent to the canal, which some analysts have suggested raises competitive and security concerns for the US. Panama was one of the first countries to recognise Taiwan as part of China.

The Trump administration has pressured the firm to sell those interests to a US consortium that includes BlackRock Inc.

In December, a spokesman for China insisted the country “will as always respect Panama's sovereignty” with regards to the waterway.

Only Panamanians are entitled to work on the canal and it is run by the Panama Canal Authority – but some workers have cited concern with Mr Mulino and what they claim is Chinese influence.

Work is currently under way on the canal's fourth bridge after a Chinese consortium won a $1.4 billion contract to build it, with local workmen claiming they have been shafted in favour of foreigners.

“We are Panamanians and we want to work here but we are unemployed, but the Chinese, they are working. The Panamanians are humiliated,” another worker, who did not want to be named, said.

Marvin Moreno, a welder who is currently working on the construction of the fourth bridge, is among the cohort of Panamanian workers egging Mr Trump on to seize the canal.

“Right now [Trump] is the best option because the president we have is putting Panamanians practically against a wall. He is practically acting as a dictator,” he told The Telegraph during his lunch break.

Mr Moreno, 42, said Mr Trump has “his good things and bad things”. He said the Panamanian government was “attacking our sovereignty”, not Mr Trump.

Since taking office, Mr Trump has criticised former president Jimmy Carter for “foolishly” returning the canal, which was constructed by the US in the early 1900s, to Panama. Two treaties signed in 1977 ceded the canal back to the Central American country – with the canal turned over on Dec 31, 1999.

The US is the canal's biggest user, with some 40 per cent of all US container traffic crossing it each year.

Amid claims America is being “ripped off” by the canal, Mr Trump had dispatched Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, and Pete Hegseth, his defence secretary, to Panama – with the latter delivering a press conference from the side of the canal, the US flag next to him, telling the world: “We will take back the Panama Canal from China's influence.”

Both visits paid dividends. Following Mr Rubio's visit in February, Mr Mulino said he had made an “important” decision to pull out of China's Belt and Road Initiative, the country's massive investment project.

But the biggest wins for Mr Trump were those ironed out in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the two countries during Mr Hegseth's visit in April.

The deal agrees to give US military vessels free passage of the canal, something critics say violates the neutrality treaty, and, crucially, it allows US troops to return to three areas on Panamanian soil for joint military training.

“It is an invasion... I said camouflaged invasion, because that's how I view it,” Ricardo Lombana, the leader of Panama's opposition, told The Telegraph.

“This is our country, and you're giving a designated area to a foreign government or to foreign military,” he said, adding that the concessions are likely illegal and are being challenged in court.

Javier Martínez-Acha, Panama's foreign affairs minister, has insisted the deal “does not imply a surrender of sovereignty, nor does it violate the national constitution, nor the neutrality treaty”.

Days after The Telegraph spoke to Mr Lombana, Mr Trump said he wanted more. Writing on his Truth Social platform, he demanded both US military and commercial ships be given free passage through the Panama and Suez canals – claiming they would “not exist” without the US.

One person taken aback by Mr Trump's allegations about the canal was Jorge Quijano, the former administrator of the Panama Canal Authority.

When he hosted Mike Pence and Mr Rubio during Mr Trump's first term, both men, he said, praised the canal and how the Panamanians were operating it – and made no mention of Chinese influence.

“The way he negotiates is like a magician, he has his hand here, but he's doing something else over here… I think his intention was always having military forces here,” he told The Telegraph.

Mr Quijano fears that the canal by nature is “indefensible” and the only way to protect it is to “keep it neutral”.

While some workers are supportive of Mr Trump, other Panamanians are so vehemently opposed they are willing to lay down their lives to stop him.

Sebastian King, special adviser for the union of marine engineers, can still remember the moment US troops tied his hands behind his back and held a rifle to his head during the US invasion of Panama in 1989.

Mr King accepted that China may have a “soft fist influence” in countries in Latin America, but blamed the US for allowing China to win infrastructure projects by not putting in competitive bids for infrastructure projects.

“The people who think Trump is the answer to our problems are mistaken,” he said.

Roughly 500,000 Palestinians are experiencing “catastrophic” hunger levels, the latest food insecurity report finds.

The Gaza Strip is at a “critical risk” of famine, with the entire population projected to face crisis levels of hunger as a result of Israel's total humanitarian aid blockade, UN-backed food researchers have found in their latest assessment.

As of mid-May, the entire population of Gaza is facing a hunger crisis, researchers with the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) determined in a report released Monday. 

“Goods indispensable for people's survival are either depleted or expected to run out in the coming weeks,” the report says. “Immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, starvation and acute malnutrition, and a descent into Famine.”

The report was released as Israel's total aid blockade on Gaza has entered its third month, with Israel blocking all goods — food, medicine, water, and other essential supplies — from entering Gaza, creating a humanitarian catastrophe in which Palestinians face death at every turn. UN officials have said that Israel is weaponizing aid, using it as a way to subjugate and control the Palestinian population, seemingly in service of their extermination and ethnic cleansing campaign.

According to the IPC report, over a fifth of the population, or nearly 500,000 Palestinians, are facing catastrophic levels of hunger — meaning that they are facing “starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels.” 

A quarter of the population is in a food “emergency,” meaning that they are facing major food shortages and potential mortality due to food insecurity, while the remaining population is experiencing a food crisis and are unable to meet basic needs.

A projected 71,000 children in Gaza are in dire need of treatment for acute malnutrition, the report says, while the vast majority of children in Gaza are facing “extreme food deprivation.”

Though food insecurity issues eased slightly amid the short ceasefire earlier this year, those gains have been erased by Israel's renewed blockade and attacks, IPC researchers found. UN agencies have run out of food stocks entirely, while prices for commercial goods have skyrocketed. The cost of flour, for instance, has risen by 3,000 percent since February, according to the UN.

The number of Palestinians in crisis level hunger indicates that “hunger-related death is rapidly increasing, with a risk of >100 dying per day,” wrote international law expert Tom Dannenbaum on social media. “And merely avoiding death does not mean escaping torturous suffering.”

As Dannenbaum and other experts have pointed out, official famine determinations by international experts rely on extremely high thresholds and “are retrospective determinations of massive failure,” Dannenbaum said. “By definition, they arrive too late.”

“The risk of famine does not arrive suddenly. It unfolds in places where access to food is blocked, where health systems are decimated, and where children are left without the bare minimum to survive,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell in a statement. “Hunger and acute malnutrition are a daily reality for children across the Gaza Strip.”

“19 months into the war. According to IPC, half a million people in Gaza face starvation. More than two weeks ago, [UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)] and [World Food Programme] ran out of food,” UNRWA said. “The only thing entering Gaza now is bombs.”

The bill text is a section of the budget reconciliation package that the GOP hopes to complete as soon as Memorial Day.

House Republicans late Sunday unveiled legislation that analysts said would rip Medicaid coverage from millions of low-income Americans — including children and people with disabilities — to help fund tax breaks that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

The bill text released by the House Energy and Commerce Committee is a section of the sprawling budget reconciliation package that Republicans are hoping to complete as soon as Memorial Day.

The legislation includes major changes to Medicaid that, if enacted, would kick millions from the program, including work requirements for some enrollees and new payment mandates for adults living above 100% of the federal poverty level — which, for a single individual, is $15,650 in annual income for 2025.

A snap analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the healthcare section of the new Republican bill would cut spending by at least $715 billion over the next decade and leave at least 8.6 million more people without insurance.

“Many of the Medicaid proposals from House Republicans are technical and wonky, and will be difficult for the public to absorb,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF. “What won't be difficult to absorb: CBO's estimate that the changes will increase the number of people without health insurance by at least 8.6 million.”

With the stated goal of combating fraud, the GOP bill would implement a slew of new reporting and screening requirements to check Medicaid recipients' eligibility — changes that analysts said would ensnare many in procedural red tape, resulting in large-scale loss of coverage.

The measure's work requirement mandates at least 80 hours of work, community service, or related activities per month. Most Medicaid recipients already work, and previous work requirements at the state level have resulted in disaster.

The legislation also alters “cost-sharing requirements for certain expansion individuals under the Medicaid program.” In plain terms, the bill would force certain Medicaid recipients to pay more for coverage, whether through premiums or other fees.

“If you make $20,000, a state might slap $1,000 of fees onto your Medicaid,” Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, wrote in an analysis of the bill. “True sicko shit.”

“My heart aches for the people whose lives will be ruined if this becomes law,” Kogan added. “So it's our job to stop it.”

Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement Sunday that “this bill confirms what we've been saying all along: Trump and Republicans have been lying when they claim they aren't going to cut Medicaid and take away people's healthcare.”

“Let's be clear, Republican leadership released this bill under cover of night because they don't want people to know their true intentions,” said Pallone. “In no uncertain terms, millions of Americans will lose their healthcare coverage, hospitals will close, seniors will not be able to access the care they need, and premiums will rise for millions of people if this bill passes.”

“Taking healthcare away from children and moms, seniors in nursing homes, and people with disabilities to give tax breaks to people who don't need them is shameful,” he added. “Democrats have defeated Republican efforts to cut healthcare before, and we can do it again.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","DOJ Voting Rights Unit Shifts Focus From Ballot Access to Investigating “Fraud”","https://truthout.org/articles/doj-voting-rights-unit-shifts-focus-from-ballot-access-to-investigating-fraud/","Mon, 12 May 2025 16:11:37 GMT","

Voter fraud is incredibly rare, despite the president repeatedly claiming otherwise.

The Department of Justice's (DOJ) voting rights unit is switching its focus from protecting voters' ability to cast ballots to investigating so-called voter fraud and fair election practices — buzzwords frequently used by President Donald Trump to push election denial.

“The mission of the Voting Rights Section of the DOJ Civil Rights Division is to ensure free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion,” the unit's new mission statement reads.

Traditionally, the division has been tasked with guaranteeing that voters' rights aren't violated — that redistricting hasn't disenfranchised voters, for example, or that people are not unduly denied access to ballots. However, those points appear to be missing from the new mission statement, according to reporting from The Associated Press.

The change is troubling to voting rights experts, who note that the shift could lead to an influx of baseless and politically charged accusations of voter fraud.

“The Civil Rights Division has always worked to make sure Americans have access to the polls and that their votes matter. The division's job is not to promote the politically expedient fiction that voting fraud is widespread,” said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department litigator who previously served in the Civil Rights Division. 

In addition to changing its philosophy, department officials appointed by Trump are removing managers working within voting rights offices. Remaining staffers are being directed to drop all cases relating to the section's work.

Trump has frequently peddled the debunked claim that he lost the 2020 election to President Joe Biden because of voter fraud — and has continued pushing that claim throughout his third term. Just days after the DOJ made changes to the voting rights unit, Trump demanded on Truth Social that the sentence of an election denier be reduced.

In his post, Trump discussed former Colorado elections clerk Tina Peters, who is currently in prison for breaching voter systems in her jurisdiction, allowing unauthorized people to enter the Mesa County election office to access sensitive data, which was also shared online. 

During her sentencing last fall, Colorado District Judge Matthew Barrett expressed frustration with Peters, noting that she didn't show any sign of remorse. 

“I'm convinced you'd do it all over again if you could,” Barrett said. “You are a privileged person. You are as privileged as they come. You used that for power and fame.”

Last week, Trump demanded that Peters be freed, citing false and partisan talking points.

Trump claimed in a Truth Social post that Peters, for example, had “worked to expose and document Democrat Election Fraud” in the state of Colorado, when no such fraud has been uncovered. He also called the situation a “Communist persecution by the Radical Left Democrats to cover up their Election crimes and misdeeds in 2020,” an accusation that has no basis in reality. 

Trump further indicated that he would direct “the Department of Justice to take all necessary action” to end her sentencing, which he falsely claimed was a politically motivated move by Democrats in the state — providing more evidence that the administration's goal to address supposed voter fraud is, in fact, political.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

President Donald Trump on May 11 said the United States is receiving a plane from Qatar that will be used as the new Air Force One.

Trump told reporters at an unrelated press conference on Monday that Boeing is taking longer than expected to produce new planes for the government, including an aircraft that will become the new Air Force One. Qatari officials learned of the situation and offered to help, he said.

Trump called the offer “a very nice gesture,” adding later, “I could be a stupid person and say, ‘we don't want a free plane.'”

“But the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made,” they added.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said before Trump's post that “any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws.”

Some Democrats raised concerns about the possible gift.

The clause states, “No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia—President Donald Trump will visit the Middle East from May 13 to May 16, with scheduled stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The trip marks his first major foreign trip of his second term, following a recent visit to the Vatican for Pope Francis's funeral two weeks ago.

Trump is expected to announce a series of major investment deals aimed at attracting Gulf money into key U.S. sectors such as defense, technology, and artificial intelligence (AI). His meetings will also focus on pressing regional issues, including the war between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group and ongoing nuclear talks with Iran.

Trump's first destination is Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is expected to welcome him with a lavish ceremony, similar to the one he received during his first term. That reception was quite different from the cold greeting President Joe Biden received in 2022, when bin Salman merely offered a fist bump.

As in his first term, Trump chose the Middle East for his first major foreign trip, but unlike eight years ago, Israel is not on the agenda this time.

Saudi Arabia recently pledged to invest $600 billion over the next four years. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates has committed to a $1.4 trillion investment framework in the United States over the next decade, targeting AI and semiconductor infrastructure, the energy sector, and manufacturing.

The president's first major foreign trip “symbolizes the value he places on the Gulf allies,” according to Joel Rubin, Middle East expert and former State Department official under President Barack Obama.

“That symbolism means a lot in terms of how he's trying to position the United States in the world and to have that relationship be firm,” he told The Epoch Times.

During the trip, Trump will focus on advancing his economic agenda by pursuing major investment commitments from Gulf nations, Rubin said.

The president is also expected to focus on major arms deals, including a potential arms package for Saudi Arabia worth more than $100 billion as well as significant weapons sales to Qatar.

The president is also expected to attend the Saudi–U.S. Investment Forum on May 13, which will bring together top U.S. and Saudi business leaders to explore new investment opportunities.

“Trade and investment deals will be announced that will burnish the president's image as a negotiator,” Alterman said during a news conference previewing the trip. “I'd expect some of the deals to involve areas such as AI and cryptocurrency.”

“The Defense Department is getting a gift, free of charge, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform.

A White House official told The Epoch Times on May 11 that Qatar had offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense, but said the gift will not be presented or accepted this week while Trump is in Qatar.

The Qatari government said the transfer was still “under consideration.”

A major focus will be pushing Saudi Arabia to formally join the Abraham Accords, an agreement that established diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab neighbors in late 2020. The Abraham Accords were a significant foreign policy achievement of Trump's first presidency.

However, the Saudi crown prince has publicly stated that normalization with Israel is contingent on concrete progress toward establishing a Palestinian state—a condition that Israel's current government firmly rejects.

As a result, expectations for a breakthrough on this front remain low.

“Normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel is becoming distant,” Rubin said. “Further distant from where it was in the past.”

Gulf nations are growing increasingly concerned about tensions between Iran and Israel, fearing that a broader regional conflict could jeopardize their economic stability.

“They are fearful that military action with Iran is likely to put them in the splash zone,” Alterman said.

They also believe that it is the right moment for Washington to strike a deal with Iran, given the Islamic regime's current vulnerability and severe economic problems.

“To a remarkable degree, the Gulf states are much more supportive of U.S.–Iran talks now than they were in 2015,” Alterman said, noting that Arab countries have greater confidence in Trump's ability to resolve this issue than previous U.S. presidents.

The United States held a fourth round of talks with Iran in Oman on May 11.

Trump earlier said that the United States has not yet decided whether Iran could enrich uranium domestically under the new deal being negotiated.

“We have not made that decision yet,” Trump told reporters on May 9. “We will.”

However, Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sayyid Abbas Araghchi said the next day that Tehran will never back down from its “nuclear rights” despite U.S. pressure.

Trump also recently floated the idea of changing the name of the Gulf of Persia to the Gulf of Arabia.

In January, he called on Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down their oil prices. In recent weeks, Brent crude prices dropped by more than $10 per barrel, falling to a little more than $60—a decline largely driven by Saudi Arabia's push for a larger-than-expected output increase in May, delivering Trump an important win before his visit.

In a Jan. 23 speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said, “If the price came down, the Russia–Ukraine war would end immediately.”

The Islamic kingdom is currently sitting on an estimated $2.5 trillion of mineral reserves and is actively seeking investors to unlock this potential.

During his trip, Trump may deepen ties with Saudi Arabia in critical mineral mining and exploration.

This is a growing strategic priority for the Trump administration, as evidenced by initiatives in the Congo and Ukraine, Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the CSIS, said during the news briefing.

“For the United States, where mineral processing remains the most critical choke point and China controls 60 to 90 percent of capacity, a deeper U.S.–Saudi partnership presents a strategic opportunity to expand processing capacity, reduce dependence on China, and bolster long-term supply chain security,” she said.

Saudi Arabia has been aggressively expanding its mining sector as part of its Vision 2030 program, which aims to diversify its economy away from oil dependence.

Just last week, the Saudi Cabinet announced that the kingdom is considering a formal agreement with the United States focused on mining and mineral cooperation.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

This week, U.S. President Donald Trump is set to visit three key American partners in the Middle East: Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It is not yet clear what he hopes to achieve. He may be seeking to secure arms deals and investments in the United States. He might hope to personally enrich himself through Gulf investments in Trump properties, investment funds, and cryptocurrencies. But many hope—and others worry—that he has larger ambitions. In particular, it seems possible that his trip is mostly about Iran, a country with which his administration has been conducting negotiations relating to its nuclear program. Because of the erratic nature of Trump's administration and internal disagreement among his key advisers, however, his trip could just as easily set the stage for war with Iran as it could for signing a nuclear agreement.

Leaders in the Arab states of the Gulf had hoped for Trump's reelection. They had done well during Trump's first term and had little love for U.S. President Joe Biden. (The same was true of most ordinary people in their countries, who blamed Biden for enabling Israel's destruction of Gaza.) Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, would never forgive Biden for calling Saudi Arabia a “pariah” because of its assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. MBS maintained close relationships with Trump and his associates during the Biden years, and he strung Biden along with the prospect that Saudi Arabia might normalize relations with Israel, which, before October 7, 2023, was the single overriding goal of an administration that was otherwise disengaged from the Middle East.

But 100 days into the second Trump administration, those leaders are perplexed and concerned. Trump's Middle East policies look similar to Biden's, which is surprising considering how radically the new administration has moved to transform the federal government and alter core U.S. alliances. Trump's policies toward war-torn Gaza and Yemen, for example, are essentially more brutal and less restrained versions of those Biden had pursued.

But perhaps that shouldn't be so surprising. After replacing Trump in 2021, Biden had continued virtually all of Trump's Middle East policies, focusing on extending Trump's Abraham Accords (a set of normalization agreements between Israel and a number of Arab states) while not returning to the Iran nuclear agreement from which Trump had withdrawn, declining to pursue Israeli-Palestinian peace, and neglecting to prioritize human rights.

Where the two presidents do differ is in style and predictability. Biden and his team were reliable and familiar, whereas the region's leaders know that Trump can change his mind without warning. They worry that Trump's tariffs could trigger a global recession that would hurt oil sales and shipping that transits the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. They fear that Trump's termination of foreign assistance could destabilize its recipients, such as Jordan. His outlandish statements about Gaza have unsettled them. And above all they don't know whether he is paving the way to real diplomacy with Iran or just checking boxes on the path to war.

The decision to visit all three leading Arab Gulf powers and not just Saudi Arabia seems designed to prevent a schism. In 2017, Trump visited Saudi Arabia, and after he returned, posted a message on Twitter in support of isolating Qatar—giving a green light for Saudi Arabia, along with Bahrain, Egypt, and the UAE, to start blockading Qatar as punishment for its support of Islamist groups. That blockade divided the Gulf Cooperation Council and fueled proxy warfare and political competition across the region. It also interfered with the Trump administration's efforts to exert maximum pressure on Iran through draconian sanctions because it forced Qatar to become more dependent on Iran for trade and access to the world. The Qatar blockade ended as soon as Biden took office, as the region's leaders sought to align with the new president's priorities, this time to the benefit of the entire region.

The run-up to Trump's visit, the first foreign trip of his second term, has largely focused on economics. Trump hopes to sign a $100 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia and encourage Gulf investments in the U.S. economy. The Saudis, at least, are eager to be seen as economic partners; after Trump was elected, MBS floated a $600 billion Saudi investment in the United States. In reality, any Saudi commitment would be mostly for show, as the kingdom is struggling with lower oil prices and domestic economic demands, and rarely delivers on such promises. Trump may also have his personal interests in mind. According to The New York Times, Trump's family businesses have made millions from deals with firms tied to the Saudi, Qatari, and Emirati governments.

Trump might also use the trip to try to persuade the Gulf states to keep oil prices down. During the Biden years, Saudi Arabia proved uninterested in using its oil policies to help out the United States. Indeed, Riyadh, along with the rest of OPEC+, infuriated the White House by slashing production, which kept gasoline prices high, to Biden's political detriment, and increased Russia's oil revenue while the United States was sanctioning Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine. But low oil prices are dangerous for Riyadh, which needs them above a certain level to sustain its budget and ambitious development plans.



Trump's visit will cover regional politics, too, though his aims on that front are much less clear. Arab governments are unsure whether the United States will ask them to prepare for war or peace with Iran. Such uncertainty is unusual. Part of the problem is that the administration, which is understaffed and dysfunctional, has been speaking with multiple voices. The fact that Trump removed Michael Waltz from his position as national security adviser on the eve of the visit is emblematic. Waltz had been coordinating closely with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on plans for military action against Iran and pushing an aggressive military approach to the Houthis in Yemen. Gulf leaders have been left to wonder whether Waltz's demotion represents a change in U.S. policy or is merely a symptom of the administration's chaos.

The most critical issue, of course, is Iran. When Trump visited Saudi Arabia in 2017, Saudi and Emirati leaders were keen to discard Obama-era diplomacy and embrace a more confrontational approach to the Islamic Republic. But their attitudes have since changed. In 2019, Iranian proxies attacked a Saudi oil refinery, temporarily reducing the world's oil supply by six percent. By choosing not to respond with U.S. military force, the Trump administration shocked Gulf leaders, whose security strategy had long rested on American guarantees. The United States also disappointed Gulf leaders with a limited response to an attack by the Houthis, a militia backed by Iran, on Abu Dhabi in 2022. The incidents reminded Gulf states that they would be Iran's first target in a regional war and that they would be largely on their own. Whereas Israel appears eager for the United States to attack Iran, the Gulf states are emerging as an antiwar caucus.

For the last few years, Riyadh has engaged in a quiet Chinese-brokered rapprochement with Iran, resuming diplomacy and trying to prevent regional escalation. Gulf leaders are delighted by Iran's setbacks at the hands of Israel—especially the destruction of Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militant-group-turned-political-party in Lebanon—and would shed no tears were its regime to collapse. But they are less inclined than Israel to think that their interests would be served by taking the war to Tehran. If Trump gets into a war with Iran, the Gulf states will want compensation for going along, likely demanding serious strategic assurances—such as a formal defense treaty, as was floated to the Saudis by the Biden administration—arms sales, and other side payments in exchange for publicly supporting the new American approach.

Trump, for all his bellicose rhetoric and military escalations, has always been deeply skeptical of getting into another major Middle Eastern war. He has discarded most of the Iran hawks from his first administration and empowered an envoy with a mandate to negotiate a new nuclear deal with Tehran. Because such agreements take painstaking work and a lot of patience, the Trump administration is unlikely to pull one off. Some Trump administration officials have advocated for a total end to Iranian uranium enrichment, a position that would virtually guarantee that the talks collapse. If negotiations fail, it could pave the way toward a conflict that Trump claims to not want. But Trump has thus far stuck with diplomacy, even over Israeli objections. A new Iran deal would go a long way toward stabilizing the region and reducing the risk of war.

Trump considers the Abraham Accords one of the greatest diplomatic accomplishments of his first term. No doubt he would love announcing Saudi Arabia's accession to that process during his visit—especially to claim that he achieved what Biden could not. Were it not for the war in Gaza, MBS would probably have agreed to normalize with Israel as a honeymoon present for Trump.

But the grim daily toll of Israel's assault on Gaza makes normalization a tough sell. Although Arab leaders don't care about Palestinians, their people do. Arab governments, obsessed with the possibility of a new round of uprisings, closely monitor the political mood of their people. The carnage in Gaza has had a devastating effect on Arab perceptions of Israel and the United States and has undoubtedly raised MBS's asking price for a deal. He would probably require a formal U.S. security guarantee, arms sales, and progress toward a Palestinian state to sign a normalization agreement with Israel—if he even still wants one. But U.S. assurances might not be enough, given that Trump has cast doubt on the United States' commitment to its allies and partners.

Arab leaders worry about Israel's (and Trump's) endgame for Gaza and the West Bank. In February, Trump suggested “temporarily” expelling the more than two million Palestinians who live in Gaza and resettling them elsewhere (probably Egypt and Jordan) so that he could turn the territory into “the Riviera of the Middle East.” His plan horrified and frightened most Arab leaders, not just on humanitarian grounds but because a large influx of Gazans would destabilize any Arab countries that took them in. Qatar worries it could become the scapegoat for failed negotiations between Israel and Hamas, as Netanyahu shifts the blame for his policy failures. The UAE worries that Washington will task it with funding the reconstruction of Gaza. And all Arab governments worry that the unending war will radicalize their own populations.

Netanyahu has threatened to obliterate Gaza and its inhabitants if a cease-fire deal hasn't been reached by May 15—coinciding with Trump's Gulf visit. By meeting with Trump on the eve of an Israeli campaign, Arab governments risk looking like collaborators in the destruction of Gaza. But they also hope to influence a president who often seems swayed by the last person he talks to.

Arab leaders are also worried about Israel's expanding incursions into Syria. Israel has captured a large buffer zone in southwestern Syria and has bombed hundreds of sites in the country since December, when Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad was ousted by a consortium of rebel groups. Most Arab states, even those deeply suspicious of Islamists, have leaned toward supporting the new government in hopes of stabilizing a country shattered by 13 years of civil war. Many Arab governments have delivered financial support to the new regime, and Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, will attend the upcoming Arab summit meeting. Arab leaders want to know whether Washington prefers a Syria that is stable and unified under a regime led by former jihadists, or is violent and divided.

There's a good chance that Trump will accomplish little on his visit, aside from inking a few arms deals. But he should aim to do something grand. He should seize the chance to lay out his clear intention to secure a nuclear and political agreement with Iran. Such a deal would take advantage of Tehran's temporary setbacks and embed Iran within a new vision of regional order. A deal would align well with the regional mood by lowering the risk of an Israeli war with Iran; normalizing Iranian relations with the Gulf; and restraining Iranian allies across the region, including Hezbollah, the Houthis, and nascent Assadist insurgents in Syria. If Trump lands an agreement that covers more than just Iran's nuclear program, he can claim that he achieved a better deal than did U.S. President Barack Obama.

But Trump's restraint toward Iran has been paired with full support for Israel's military campaigns. His administration seems to accept Israel's ambition to remake the regional order by military force. And if Israel's price for assenting to a nuclear deal with Iran (as opposed to unilaterally attacking the Islamic Republic's nuclear facilities) is U.S. permission to complete the destruction of Gaza and, perhaps, to annex the West Bank, then the stabilizing effects of any agreement with Iran would prove short-lived. A new agreement with Iran should instead be anchored in a reconfigured regional order, which would have to include at a minimum a durable cease-fire in Gaza, a significant influx of humanitarian assistance to the territory, and a plausible path toward a Palestinian state.

That is difficult to envision, given the personnel, policy processes, and preferences of this administration. Trump seems to want a regional order based on force and transactionalism rather than legitimacy or partnership. He has radically undermined American soft power and the nonmilitary U.S. presence in the region by eroding the federal government's ability to carry out policy, closing American borders, slashing foreign assistance, and shuttering institutions of public diplomacy. Support for Israel's depopulation and annexation of Gaza will only inflame public opinion in the Middle East in ways that an Iran nuclear deal will not assuage. If Trump truly wants to break the endless cycle of U.S. policy failure in the Middle East, then this Gulf visit would be the right time to start.

At the beginning of this year, many were hailing a triumphant American economy buoyed by the prospect of tax cuts, deregulation, cheap energy, and massive investments in artificial intelligence. In January, the World Economic Forum in Davos celebrated the unleashing of the “animal spirit” in the U.S. economy. U.S. companies' stock valuations—in particular digital firms—seemed as though they could not get any higher. In panel discussions, roundtables, and closed-door meetings, analysts exalted the virtues of the United States as an investment destination and excoriated Europe as overregulated, uncompetitive, and incapable of innovating. Questions about the overheating of the American economy were brushed aside as impertinent. Concerns about the combined impact of potential tariff hikes and deportations on inflation were met with skepticism.

Almost four months later, the contrast could not be more stark. The Trump administration's chaotic trade policy, the retaliation it has provoked, and the uncertainty generated by the U.S. president and his advisers' contradictory statements are taking a toll on the U.S. economy. Markets and businesses overestimated the solidity of the administration's economic plans. Even worse, Trump's attacks on the rule of law and the judiciary, universities, law firms, and scientific institutions are undermining the foundations of what makes the United States so attractive for investment and gives it such great weight on the world stage. Neighbors and allies, threatened with territorial demands or with questions related to their defense partnerships, have lost trust in Washington.

This is a moment of reckoning for Europe. For over 80 years, Europe and the United States have benefited from the world's largest and deepest economic and trade relationship, the most sophisticated military alliance, and the closest interpersonal exchanges. Together, the two blocs have built a rules-based international system that has provided global stability and progress. It hasn't always been easy. There have been trade frictions and sharp divisions, particularly with respect to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the U.S. desire to disengage from Europe as part of a greater strategic shift toward Asia, particularly China, that began during the Obama administration.

But the events of this year mark a turning point in the transatlantic relationship; the Trump administration does not want Europe to succeed. It will try to weaken the continent through a mix of external coercion and predatory policies: claiming it needs to control Greenland for its national security, seeking rapprochement with Russia at the expense of Ukrainian and European security, weakening NATO's deterrence, and arm-twisting on trade. And it will embolden anti-European forces within the EU. Officials across European capitals have received this message loud and clear.

The era of the post–World War II Euro-American alliance is over. Placating the United States will not work. If Europe doesn't want to become a vassal of Washington or part of Russia's newly dreamed-up sphere of influence, it must take its future into its own hands. The continent needs a clear strategy, collective action, and determination.

Europe has what it takes: talented people, wealth, a solid social safety net, productive power, and a growing pro-European sentiment among its citizens—a must for these countries to further integrate. But given the task ahead, it would be foolish to think that progress will be easy or linear. Major steps toward greater European integration, including building the single market or introducing the euro, have required time and political leadership, which are both in short supply today. And integration that has originated as a response to crises, such as the 2008 financial meltdown or the COVID-19 pandemic, took place only after all other options had been explored, leaving Europe economically weakened and politically exhausted.

Facing the deterioration of a long-standing transatlantic partnership and a continued war on its eastern front, Europe is at a critical moment. But the continent's economic strength and political will to build a more capable common defense and foster growth are firm. And the steps that EU countries are already undertaking show their intent to survive the rift in transatlantic relations and come out stronger.

As the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine approached in February of this year, U.S. Vice President JD Vance told attendants of the Munich Security Conference that the threat to Europe was not Russia, China, or any other external actor. It was a threat from within Europe itself. What Vance worried most about, in his words, was “the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values—values shared with the United States.” Europe is at risk, in the vice president's view, because it is unable to talk about democratic values and to live them. Vance promised that although free speech in Europe was “in retreat,” under Trump's leadership the United States would “fight to defend” Europeans' rights to offer their views “in the public square.” That same day, Vance met with the leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which Germany's domestic intelligence agency designated as an extremist organization this month (although the agency has temporarily suspended the official label in response to legal challenges). The vice president's meeting that day with Olaf Scholz, then Germany's chancellor, was canceled; one former U.S. official was quoted as saying, “We don't need to see him, he won't be chancellor long.”

Vance's performance in Munich was part of the “shock and awe” strategy that has characterized the second Trump administration's foreign policy to date, with cascading events that confuse partners and render a response difficult. Two days before the vice president's Munich speech, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had declared at a NATO council in Brussels that two of Ukraine's central objectives for ending the war—restoring Ukrainian territory to its pre-2014 borders and joining NATO—were not realistic. Then, after a surprise phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Washington announced that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine would start immediately; that neither Ukraine nor Europe would be at the table, at least in the initial stages; and that Europe would have to provide in writing the contribution it was ready to make toward a peace settlement.

At a dinner in Munich that week with members of the U.S. Congress, the mood was so somber among European participants that a U.S. representative quickly offered that Trump “would not be the Neville Chamberlain of Ukraine,” referring to the British prime minister known for appeasing Hitler by brokering the Munich Agreement of 1938, which ceded the German-speaking Czechoslovak region of Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. But as one eastern European minister at the dinner put it, the Russians were looking to get through negotiation what they couldn't obtain on the battlefield: limiting the sovereignty of Ukraine to decide its future.

Despite the fact that Europeans' worst fears seemed to be materializing, the 2025 Munich conference had a great virtue: Europeans understood once and for all that securing their own future requires taking decisive steps to build credible European deterrence. As a result, the weeks since have been filled with frantic efforts at both the EU level and in European capitals to massively increase the bloc's defense spending, address critical shortfalls in its military capability, promote a more competitive defense industrial base, and build a true European defense market.



At the EU level, officials' primary focus has been on unlocking financing to the tune of up to 800 billion euros ($900 billion) for security and defense, as well as building an EU-wide market for military equipment. In less than two months, the EU's existing fiscal rules have been relaxed to allow member states to deviate from the recommended net expenditures by up to 1.5 percent annually to boost defense spending. In addition, the EU will borrow up to 150 billion euros to support member states' joint procurement of defense equipment made in the bloc and to explore contracts with partners the EU has bilateral defense agreements with, such as Japan, Norway, and South Korea, or with which the bloc could negotiate future agreements, such as Turkey or the United Kingdom. The United States is not on the list. Ukraine's defense industry will also be more integrated into the EU's technological and industrial defense base, and the single European market, granting Kyiv treatment very similar to that of a member state. In June, the European Commission will present a new defense omnibus package that lays out plans to further integrate defense equipment markets. EU officials are also working to mobilize private capital and the firepower of the European Investment Bank, which could prove useful in financing new entrants to this growing market.

On the eve of his party's electoral victory in February, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz declared that his priority would be “to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA.” He followed by securing passage of a constitutional amendment that will allow Germany to take on an unprecedented level of debt to invest in defense, infrastructure, and climate initiatives. Any defense spending that amounts to more than one percent of Germany's GDP will no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing. The Bundestag has also approved a special fund worth 500 billion euros over the next 12 years to back investment in infrastructure and climate resilience. For a country so historically averse to government debt, the speed and scope of these decisions demonstrate how deeply German officials believe that the change in Europe's relationship with the United States is epochal.

Germany is not alone in the EU in its increased investment in defense. Sweden has pledged to increase defense spending from 2.4 percent to 3.5 percent of its GDP by 2030. Finland is planning to reach 3.0 percent within four years. Spain will accelerate spending to 2.0 percent in 2025, from 1.3 percent. France, for its part, has signaled a willingness to discuss expanding its nuclear umbrella beyond its own borders. The list goes on.

Europeans also plan to support the implementation of a potential peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. While waiting for negotiations to progress, much of which will depend on Trump, Europeans can begin the much-needed conversation about an inconvenient reality: the EU needs to rethink the institutional arrangements that make up its security architecture—to ensure it that is not subject to the risks posed by a U.S.-dominated NATO.

Although it will take time, the long march toward an autonomous European defense and security has started. In the words of the French founding father of the EU, Jean Monnet, “Anything is possible in exceptional moments, as long as you're ready, as long as you have a clear project at the moment when everything is confused.”

The European economy has been underestimated. But this is of the continent's own making. It is well known that European integration tends to advance only when the bloc is in crisis. In April 2024, the EU commissioned the former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta to produce a diagnostic on the state of play of the EU single market and propose measures to deepen it. The same year, the bloc tasked Mario Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank, with presenting proposals to improve European competitiveness. Both reports documented shortcomings in capital markets, energy, and technology, all of them backbones of European economic prowess and security. The somewhat dramatic tone of both reports and the discussion that followed was meant to mobilize European capitals to act. Instead, it generated pessimism within Europe and, even worse, was read outside Europe as a signal of the continent's decline. It became fashionable to belittle the European economy.

But with the turmoil caused by the Trump administration's erratic announcements and the growing risk of recession, it may be a good time to look beyond the headlines. For example, comparisons between the United States' and the EU's economic performance tend to be distorted by the strength of the dollar. When measured in purchasing power parity, however, the gap in output growth between the two parties is smaller.

Europe also offers stability and predictability—highly precious features in today's volatile global environment. At the macroeconomic level, inflation has slowed down, and borrowing costs are falling. Deficits and public debt are also lower in Europe than in other large economies, allowing for important margins for maneuvering in the event of an economic downturn.



Since the beginning of 2025, the EU has been hard at work on balancing its focus on decarbonization, competitiveness, and economic security. The first concrete outcome of this effort, unveiled in January, is the “competitiveness compass,” a five-year plan that outlines specific actions for the EU to take to close its innovation gap, facilitate access to clean and affordable energy, and reduce excessive dependence on imports through partnerships and trade agreements. In late February, the European Commission in Brussels adopted an omnibus package that simplified rules on sustainability and investment, bringing an estimated six billion euros' worth of relief from red tape to the bloc's small and medium-sized enterprises. Given the Trump administration's antipathy toward climate-focused policy, it's a good moment to invest in green technologies in Europe.

Europe certainly faces economic headwinds, but its problems should not be exaggerated. The EU's plans for growth and investment are clear. Now, it must focus on unity and speed of implementation. Despite the economic chaos wreaked by the Trump administration's unilateral imposition of tariffs on trading partners, first unleashed on April 2, the European Union has sizable leverage on trade. Sixty-two percent of EU trade occurs among member states in the single market, and another 13 percent with European countries that are nonmembers. The bloc can reduce its exposure to unilateral U.S. tariffs by facilitating intra-EU trade through a deepening of the single market and finding new opportunities for trade in other markets. In fact, BNP Paribas's chief economist, Isabelle Mateos y Lago, has calculated that a one percent decrease in exports to the United States would require only a 0.12 percent increase in intra-EU trade.

As for new markets, the EU has made progress on a number of fronts in just the last three months, including a new deal with Mercosur, the trading bloc comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay; renewed bilateral agreements with Mexico and Switzerland; and negotiations with India, the Philippines, and Thailand. As the United States isolates itself from the world economy, Europe is doubling down on creating new opportunities and building new bridges.

As the geopolitical outlook has darkened and countries around the world have begun attempting to “de-risk” their economies, the digital euro is gathering traction. This is partly due to a recent executive order by the Trump administration that promotes the development and growth of dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide, which will strengthen the dominance of international payments systems. As part of this wave, China has doubled down on efforts to develop the digital yuan. Countries in BRICS, the club of major non-Western economies of which China is a part, have also worked to link their central bank digital initiatives on a common platform.

In a recent speech, the former European Central Bank economist Philip Lane indicated that Europeans' reliance on foreign payment providers—65 percent of card payments made within the euro area are processed by international card brands such as Visa and Mastercard—and on mobile app payments, which are dominated by non-EU tech firms, is a source of vulnerability to the EU. Since being unveiled in 2021, the digital euro initiative is now gathering steam. After a thorough evaluation of costs and benefits, preparations for its launch are expected to start by the end of 2025.

As work advances for designing the next EU budget, which will cover the years 2028 to 2033, there are growing calls in Europe for it to expand to cover European public goods in the broad sense; the continent's defense and security, for example, includes areas such as energy and infrastructure. Strengthening these areas, however, will require a significant increase in spending not only at national levels, which is already taking shape, but also in the form of collective investments at the EU level. Investing together would help to better coordinate defense spending and foster economies of scale.

At the most recent informal meeting of the European Council in February 2025, EU leaders reviewed possible paths toward achieving these goals. They included expanding the EU budget; launching a new round of joint borrowing akin to that which it undertook for NextGenerationEU, the stimulus package that helped the EU cope with the COVID-19 economic downturn; or repurposing the European Stability Mechanism, a budget vehicle created in 2012 to provide access to finance for EU member states in financial difficulty after the eurozone crisis, with a maximum lending capacity of 500 billion euros. At a time when U.S. investors are looking for more stable markets, it would make sense for the EU to issue a new round of joint borrowing among member states that in addition to attracting capital would have the benefit of internationalizing the euro.

The Trump administration's antagonism toward the traditional transatlantic alliance could be the most consequential trigger of further European integration since the groundwork for the EU was laid in 1948. Europe's commitment to the transatlantic alliance thus far is not a symbol of weakness or of the continent's inability to summon the political energy to become more autonomous. In fact, European countries have already undertaken important efforts across the board to enhance their individual and EU-based defense and economic capabilities. The union would like to preserve relations with its longtime ally and to continue building on productive partnerships with the United States across sectors. But wary of Washington's unpredictability and antagonistic behavior—and conscious of the opportunities that reality is creating—the EU is preparing to take its future into its own hands.

It would be dangerous to overlook the damage being done by the Trump administration to the U.S. capacity to project power. Countries around the world, particularly in Asia, are carefully watching how the United States plays its hand in Europe. They should recognize the risk in overestimating Washington's stability and underestimating Europe's capacity. If member states muster enough will to act on the plans and ambitions they have laid out so far, the EU will be able to preserve its unique model of pooled sovereignty and advance a more secure, prosperous, and democratic future for its citizens—a good thing for Europe and also its international partners.

            Over the weekend, an international university student facing deportation by the Trump administration was allowed to return to her home in the US while her case continues to play out in court, marking a victory for one of the many cases involving students who could be removed from the country after participating in pro-Palestinian activism.
    


            Tufts University PhD student Rümeysa Öztürk spent 45 days in a detention center more than 1,500 miles from that home, accused by federal authorities of participating in pro-terrorist activities. The judge who ordered Öztürk's release emphasized the administration's failure to submit any evidence to support that accusation throughout her lengthy detention.
    


            Öztürk's case is one in a series of arrests targeting international students involved in pro-Palestinian activism that has sparked widespread concerns about free speech on university grounds.
    


Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk arrives back home after spending six weeks at a Louisiana detention center



            It's been two months since Immigration and Customs Enforcement began targeting students and scholars in often dramatic arrests by masked officers, leaving the international community on edge about their most fundamental rights. 



            Here's where Öztürk's and four other prominent cases stand.
    


            On March 25, Öztürk, a 30-year-old Turkish national, was seized by masked federal agents near her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment close to the Tufts University campus, where she is a PhD student.
    


            On her way to an Iftar dinner at sunset, Öztürk was surrounded and restrained by six plainclothes officers. Video shows her shriek in fear when an officer in a hooded sweatshirt and hat grabbed her by the wrists. The officers did not show their badges until after she was restrained, the video shows.
    


            Öztürk was arrested a year after co-authoring a campus newspaper op-ed critical of Tufts' response to the Gaza war, which her attorneys argue made her a target of the administration's efforts to suppress pro-Palestinian speech in violation of her constitutional rights.
    


            Transported across multiple states before finally being detained in Louisiana, Öztürk endured more frequent and more severe asthma attacks while in custody, she testified in court Friday.
    


            At a three-hour hearing, US District Judge William K. Sessions III also heard from three other witnesses about Öztürk's community work and her asthma attacks, which her attorneys say were not adequately treated while she was in custody.
    


            The judge found Öztürk had raised “substantial claims” of due process and First Amendment violations, saying her “continued detention potentially chills the speech of millions.”
    


As Trump's immigration crackdown continues, ethics questions are being raised over the use of masked federal agents



            Sessions emphasized that for weeks, the government failed to produce any evidence to support Öztürk's continued detention, except for the year-old op-ed. “That is literally the case,” the judge said. “There is no evidence here as to the motivation absent the consideration of the op-ed.”
    


            Now back in Massachusetts, Öztürk remains hopeful as she resumes her studies while continuing her legal fight.
    


            “America is the greatest democracy in the world, and I believe in those values that we share. I have faith in the American system of justice,” Öztürk said at a news conference at the airport.
    


            The decision to release Öztürk came on the same day that a federal court rejected the Trump administration's attempt to re-arrest another international student who was detained last month.
    


            Moshen Mahdawi, a 34-year-old student and prominent activist at Columbia University, spent more than two weeks in detention before he was freed on bond on April 30.
    


            In pushing for Mahdawi's deportation, the Trump administration has argued that his activism undermines its foreign policy goals. The federal judge who ordered Mahdawi's release found that the Columbia student has presented a “substantial claim” that his arrest was an attempt to suppress dissenting speech.
    


            Mahdawi is Palestinian, born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank. He moved to the US in 2014 and became a permanent resident.
    


            He was in an interview to finalize his US citizenship when federal authorities took him into custody on April 14, in what Mahdawi has described as “a setup.”
    


            Mahdawi credited his legal team's swift action – and good timing – for limiting his time in detention. Federal authorities tried to put him on a plane to Louisiana, similar to Öztürk, but they “just missed the airplane … by nine minutes,” he told a crowd of supporters after his release last month.

            He also vowed to maintain his activism, telling supporters, “Where (do) we go from this? We have to mobilize. We have to organize.”
    


            Last week Mahdawi helped launch a $1 million fundraising campaign to bolster a legal safety net for immigrants in Vermont, where his legal case is continuing, the Associated Press reported.
    


            Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national and Georgetown University doctoral fellow specializing in peacebuilding in the Middle East, has been in federal detention for nearly two months after his J-1 visa was abruptly revoked.
    


            According to his legal team, immigration officers arrived at his home on March 17 wearing black masks and “brandishing weapons,” in what one of his attorneys called “every family's worst nightmare.”
    


            About two days after the arrest, the Department of Homeland Security accused Khan Suri of “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,” and having “close connections to a known or suspected terrorist.” As in Mahdawi's and similar cases, the Trump administration cited a perceived threat to the nation's foreign policy goals as the reason for his visa being revoked.
    


            Khan Suri's attorneys argue the accusations stem from the public support his Palestinian wife, who is a US citizen, has expressed for Gaza during the war with Israel. His father-in-law is a former adviser to Hamas leadership, but Khan Suri's legal team rejects the administration's accusation that this constitutes a “close tie to a known and suspected terrorist.”
    


            Legal filings in Khan Suri's case describe bleak detention conditions. His attorneys said he was being housed “in a crowded unit, sleeping on the floor” and was given no religious accommodations for Ramadan in March.

            The prolonged detention has also disrupted his academic career. Khan Suri's scholarship, research and teaching position at Georgetown have all been “indefinitely suspended,” according to his bond motion, though the university has indicated he could resume his position if his visa is restored.
    


            On Wednesday, a federal judge will consider Khan Suri's request to be released on bond during a hearing in Virginia.
    


            Harvard Medical School researcher Kseniia Petrova, a Russian national, describes herself as a “nerdy 30-year-old scientist” who “only want(s) to be in the lab.” The Department of Homeland Security accuses her of lying to federal officials and deliberately trying to smuggle frog embryo samples into the US from Paris.
    


            She's been in an ICE detention center in Louisiana for nearly three months.
    


            In a statement this month, Petrova admitted that she failed to review US customs protocols but said she believed the embryos – “non-toxic, non-hazardous and non-infectious” – would not cause issues.
    


            She insists she “never provided false information to any government official” but rather that “some of my words were misunderstood and inaccurately reflected in the statement that the officer presented for my signature.” Petrova claims her requests to correct the statement were ignored.
    


            “I take full responsibility for not properly declaring the frog embryo samples,” Petrova said. “What I do not understand is why the American officials say I am a danger to the community and a flight risk.”
    


            DHS defended Petrova's detention in a statement last month that mocks sympathetic media coverage of those targeted in the administration's immigration efforts. The statement says messages were found on Petrova's phone that “revealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them.”
    


            Petrova's case appears to reflect the Trump administration's systematic approach of using minor offenses as a basis for deportation. The targeting of a highly skilled scientific research also highlights what critics say the US stands to lose in Trump's crackdown.
    


Harvard researcher detained in February for failing to declare frog embryo samples says she didn't lie to government



            “She has made herself crucial to pretty much every project that's going on in the lab. I don't know how we're gonna continue without her,” a principal research scientist at Harvard's Department of Systems Biology said of Petrova.
    


            Petrova's detention has drawn support from colleagues, who have sent her science books and letters of encouragement, with some visiting her in Louisiana.
    


            A court hearing in Vermont later this month could determine whether Petrova will be released – or deported to Russia, where she risks arrest for her opposition to the war in Ukraine, her attorney says.
    


            Born a Palestinian refugee in Syria, Columbia University graduate and US permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil emerged in early March as the face of the Trump administration's crackdown on campus activism by international students.
    


            Khalil, who played a prominent role in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia last summer, was arrested near his on-campus home – where he lived with his then-pregnant wife – on March 8 after being accused of engaging in activities in support of Hamas.
    


            Khalil, 30, is being held in an ICE detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, more than 1,000 miles from his family. Last month he was denied permission to attend the birth of first child in person, according to emails reviewed by CNN.
    


            An immigration judge in Louisiana ruled in April that Khalil is subject to removal from the US, but his attorneys are appealing that and challenging his detention in a separate federal case in New Jersey that argues he is being targeted for constitutionally protected free speech.
    


Who is Mahmoud Khalil? Palestinian activist detained by ICE over Columbia University protests



            Last week a judge in the New Jersey case asked the Trump administration to give examples of previous instances when the government deported people deemed to be a threat to US foreign policy.
    


President Trump called Khalil's detention in March “the first arrest of many to come.” How the Palestinian activist's legal case plays out could have major implications for those detained after him.

Live Updates


            • Trade war breakthrough: The US and China agreed to drastically roll back tariffs on each other's goods for an initial 90 days, de-escalating a punishing trade war and buoying global markets. By Wednesday, the US will temporarily lower its overall tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will cut its levies on American imports from 125% to 10%.
    


• Lowering drug prices: President Donald Trump signed an executive order that his administration says will crack down on “unreasonable and discriminatory practices” by foreign countries that suppress drug prices abroad. It's unclear whether Americans will see lower prices and what authority the US has to direct drug pricing in other countries.
    


            • Middle East trip: Trump will visit three wealthy Gulf Arab nations this week, hoping to deepen economic ties. Here's what to watch for.
    


• Qatari jet: Trump's trip comes as his administration is expected to accept a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family to use as Air Force One, raising legal and ethical questions. The White House said today that the legal details on accepting the Boeing 747-8 are “still being worked out,” while Trump defended the plan, saying he would be a “stupid person” if he turned down a free jet.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday that his country “would appreciate” President Donald Trump attending potential peace talks with Russia in Istanbul.
    


            Zelensky said he supported Trump's call for direct talks between himself and Vladimir Putin, reiterating his readiness to meet the Russian president in Turkey on Thursday.
    


                    “And of course, all of us in Ukraine would appreciate it if President Trump could be there with us at this meeting in (Turkey). This is the right idea. We can change a lot,” Zelensky said in a post on X.
                





            Trump said earlier Monday that “I think you may have a good result out of the Thursday meeting in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine.”
    


            “I was thinking about actually flying over there,” he added. “There's a possibility of it, I guess.”
    


            Trump, who is headed to the Middle East for the first major international trip of his second term, continued that he would go to Istanbul “if I thought it would be helpful.”
    


Some background: Putin suggested direct talks in Turkey in response to an ultimatum by Ukraine's European allies, who said Saturday that Russia should accept a 30-day ceasefire proposal or face “massive” sanctions. Putin ignored the ultimatum and instead called for talks.
    


            Ukraine's allies initially said no talks can take place before a ceasefire — but after Trump urged Zelensky to agree to the talks, the Ukrainian leader said he is ready to meet Putin.
    


            The Kremlin has not said whether Putin or any other Russian official would travel to Turkey to meet Zelensky.
    


            Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee blasted President Donald Trump's plan to accept a jet from the Qatari royal family to be used as Air Force One and announced that they would force a vote on the Senate floor condemning it.
    


            “The Constitution is clear: elected officials, like the president, cannot accept large gifts from foreign governments without consent from Congress,” Sens. Chris Coons, Chris Murphy, Cory Booker and Brian Schatz said in a statement.
    


            “Air Force One is more than just a plane — it's a symbol of the presidency and of the United States itself. Any president who accepts this kind of gift, valued at $400 million, from a foreign government creates a clear conflict of interest, raises serious national security questions, invites foreign influence, and undermines public trust in our government. No one — not even the president — is above the law,” they continued.
    


            “This week, we will ask the Senate to vote to reiterate a basic principle: no one should use public service for personal gain through foreign gifts.”
    


Some context: A Qatari official said the plane is technically being gifted from the Qatari Ministry of Defense to the Pentagon, describing it more as a government-to-government transaction instead of a personal one.
    


            The White House has been looking for an off-ramp from its trade war with China — even a temporary one — and the president told his aides that he was eager to strike a deal before departing on his Middle East trip, a senior administration official said.
    


            While Trump has repeatedly offered a dose of tough medicine in recent weeks, lecturing Americans about a need to rein in their shopping habits of certain goods produced in China, he has been sensitive to the image of empty store shelves in the US and to the financial markets reacting to a deepening trade war, the official said.
    


            The official on Monday dismissed the notion that the escalating tariffs with China had been a miscalculation by the administration, but conceded that Trump wanted to “find a win” to avoid having a nasty trade war hanging over him this week as he seeks to rally more US investment from Gulf Arab states.
    


            The China announcement is only the latest example of how Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has emerged as the most critical player in the ongoing tariff negotiations inside the White House. That hardly means Peter Navarro — the White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing who is more supportive of tariffs — is out of the picture, given his unceasing loyalty to Trump. But the senior administration official said Trump views Bessent as the leading voice.
    


            The House GOP's unveiling of President Donald Trump's “one big, beautiful bill” is far from complete. But so far, House centrists feel like they have emerged the big winners.
    


            The House does not return to Washington until Tuesday, but privately, House centrists are feeling upbeat about the party's plans to largely sidestep the most severe Medicaid restructuring that some feared could cost them the majority.
    


            That's left some GOP hardliners fuming, including Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who took to X to tear apart the early details of the plan and declare: “I sure hope House & Senate leadership are coming up with a backup plan.” And behind the scenes, Roy is not the only Republican who is skeptical that the planned Medicaid revamp will get to the conference's goal of $880 billion in cuts.
    


            The backlash from the GOP's right flank is emerging ahead of a critical week of policymaking for House Speaker Mike Johnson and his Republican conference. Several key committees will hold votes to advance their own slices of Trump's domestic policy package — followed by a critical vote by the fiscally hawkish House Budget Committee. A full floor vote could follow as soon as next week.
    


            The Trump administration is terminating a form of humanitarian relief for Afghan nationals residing in the United States — a move that stands to impact around 11,700 people.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security announced Monday that it's ending Temporary Protected Status — which applies to people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict or natural disasters — for Afghanistan.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cited “notable improvements” in the situation in Afghanistan and national security to justify ending the relief, according to a notice in the Federal Register.
    


                    “This administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent,” Noem said in a statement. “We've reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation. Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent them from returning to their home country.”
                





            It's the latest in a series of moves to end Temporary Protected Status for certain countries that Trump officials argue has been extended too long. Attempts to terminate relief have been challenged in court. Both Republican and Democratic administrations have designated the protections.
    


            Families of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza may meet with President Donald Trump when he visits Qatar this week, two people familiar with the planning told CNN.
    


            The plans are in the works and not yet finalized.
    


            Officials hope Monday's release of Israeli American Edan Alexander — in a deal struck between the US and Hamas — will pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to come to an agreement with Hamas for the remaining 58 hostages, only 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.
    


            “It's an opening, not a one-off,” said one of the sources, who works with the families. “It puts enormous pressure on the prime minister.”
    


            CNN previously reported that Trump had invited the Alexander family to Doha, but their travel depends on Edan's condition.
    


            Trump had already planned to stop in Doha on his tour of the Middle East this week. Qatar, along with Egypt, has been a key mediator in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks of the past 19 months.
    


            America's shoe industry wants the White House to “finish the job” on lowering tariffs.
    


            “We're encouraged by President Trump and his administration's progress in the U.S.-China trade negotiations,” Matt Priest, the CEO of trade group Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, said in a statement Monday. “But we're not across the finish line yet.”
    


            The group represents Nike, Under Armour and other leading shoe companies.
    


            Shoes are highly exposed to tariffs because 99% of all footwear sold in the United States is manufactured overseas. The industry has warned that tariffs could wipe out hundreds of businesses, kill tens of thousands of jobs and raise prices for consumers.
    


            “Some shoes still face duties approaching 100%, and that's unacceptable,” Priest said. “Our industry needs relief — and so do (US) families.”
    


            If the United States and China are at an impasse following the 90-day pause, the tariffs on Chinese imports aren't expected to snap back to 145%, President Donald Trump said Monday.
    


            “No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said.
    


            “At 145%, you're really decoupling, because nobody's going to buy; but [the duties] got very high because of additional tariffs that were applied because of fentanyl and other things,” he said when asked if the US tariffs would return to 145%. “But no. But they'd go substantially higher.”
    


            “I think you will have a deal, however,” Trump said.
    


            Ahead of his trip to the Middle East this week, President Donald Trump said today he hoped more hostages held by Hamas will be released.
    


            His remarks came after Hamas announced it would be releasing Edan Alexander, the last known living American hostage who was kidnapped during the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel while serving in the military.
    


            “We hope that we're going to have other hostages released, too,” Trump told reporters from the White House. He said he believes about 20 living hostages, not counting Alexander, are still being held by Hamas.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order that he said promises to crack down on “unreasonable and discriminatory practices” by foreign countries that suppress drug prices abroad.
    


            Trump signed the order during an event in the White House's Roosevelt Room, where he was joined by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, among others.
    


            “This is the most powerful executive order on pharmacy pricing and health care ever in the history of our nation,” Oz said.
    


            It's unclear whether Americans will see lower prices and what authority the US government has to direct drug pricing in other countries.
    


Some context: The action goes far beyond Trump's implementation of a “Most Favored Nation” policy in his first term, which was quickly blocked by federal courts for procedural reasons before being rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in 2021.
    


            The initiative will likely face stiff opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which successfully halted the first iteration.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday defended the US government's plan to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family, describing it as a “contribution” and saying the US can't turn down a free jet.
    


            CNN reported Sunday that the Boeing 747-8 jet would be retrofitted to be used as Air Force One. The plan raised substantial ethical and legal questions about foreign influence over the US government because of the plane's massive value. Acceptance of the plane would also raise significant security concerns.
    


            Trump said the relatively younger Qatari jet was needed to replace an aging Air Force One.
    


            “I think it's a great gesture from Qatar. I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person say, ‘No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane.' But it was, I thought it was a great gesture.”
    


            Trump said the plane will “go directly” to his presidential library after he leaves office.
    


            “I wouldn't be using it,” he added.
    


            President Donald Trump said today he may travel to Istanbul for potential peace talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.
    


            “I think you may have a good result out of the Thursday meeting in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine,” Trump during an event about drug prices at the White House.
    


            “I was thinking about actually flying over there,” he added. “There's a possibility of it, I guess.”
    


            Trump is traveling to the Middle East later today. He continued that he would go “if I thought it would be helpful.”
    


            Trump took to Truth Social over the weekend to urge Zelensky to “immediately” accept the Putin's offer to hold peace talks in Turkey, something not seen since the early weeks of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday said he may “very well relieve” sanctions on Syria as part of an effort to give the country a “fresh start.”
    


            Trump's comments on sanctions came as he prepares to head to the Middle East today. He was trumpeting his relationships with various world leaders during a press availability this morning.
    


            “We're going to have to make a decision on the sanctions, which we may very well relieve,” Trump said. “We may take them off of Syria because we want to give them a fresh start.”
    


            He said “the way we have them sanctioned, it doesn't really give them much of a start.” He added that: “We want to see we can help them out.”
    


            Syria's economy has long been crippled by western sanctions. According to the World Bank, the country's economy shrank by more than half between 2010 and 2020.

            President Donald Trump said Monday he called House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to urge them to use tariffs and his new drug prices pharmaceutical order to lower the cost of the huge GOP tax bill.
    


            Doing so, he added, would pay for what he calls the “Golden Dome” — his vision for a defense missile system over the U.S. akin to the Iron Dome in Israel.
    


                    “I said when you score, you're going to have to score two things: You're going to have to, No. 1, score that hundreds of billions of dollars of tariff money is coming in. But even bigger than that, you're going to have to score that your cost for Medicaid and Medicare and just basically pharmaceuticals and drugs is going down at a level that nobody has ever seen before,” Trump said during a news conference at the White House.
                





            “It'll pay for the Golden Dome,” he added. “See, that'll easily pay for the Golden Dome, and we'll have a lot of money left over. We need the Golden Dome.”
    


            Trump signed an executive order Monday morning that aims to crack down on “unreasonable and discriminatory practices” by foreign countries that suppress drug prices abroad.
    


Some context: Earlier this year, Trump proposed a sweeping missile defense initiative aimed at protecting the US from incoming attacks — calling it the “Golden Dome.” CNN previously reported it would likely cost billions of dollars to construct and maintain.
    


            Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system selectively protects populated areas from short-range threats in a country the size of New Jersey; Trump wants a space-based missile defense system capable of defending the entire United States from advanced ballistic and hypersonic missiles.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday told a somewhat meandering story about a friend who he said was able to obtain weight-loss medication at a much lower price in the UK as an example of the disparities between drug prices in the US and overseas.
    


            “Highly neurotic, brilliant businessman — seriously overweight,” Trump described his friend, whom he didn't name. “And he takes the fat-shot drug.”
    


            Trump said his friend recently called him from London, where he was able to obtain a drug that helps with weight loss for $88, instead of the $1,300 he would have paid in New York.
    


            Trump said he recently relayed this story to a representative from a pharmaceutical company but didn't say which one or when this conversation took place.
    


            The remarks came before Trump signed an executive order that he said will aim to slash drug prices.



            President Donald Trump said today that he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping “maybe” at the end of this week, after the US and China reached a trade agreement over the weekend.
    


            The deal would temporarily reduce the two countries' tariffs on each other for an initial 90 days, de-escalating a punishing trade war and buoying global markets.
    


            “I'll speak to President Xi maybe at the end of the week,” Trump said during a news conference in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. “We have some other things we're doing,” he added.
    


            “They were very happy to be able to do something with us and the relationship is very, very good,” the president continued.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday said he threatened to end trading relationships with India and Pakistan as an impetus to get both countries to accept a ceasefire over the weekend.
    


            “I said, ‘C'mon, we're going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let's stop it. Let's stop it. If you stop it, we'll do a trade. If you don't stop it, we're not going to do any trade,'” the president said at the White House on Monday.
    


            “And all of a sudden they said, ‘I think we're going to stop,'” the president added. Trump said the countries came to the decision “for a lot of reasons, but trade is a big one.”
    


            The president said the United States will “do a lot of trade” with both countries. Negotiations with India are ongoing and negotiations with Pakistan will start soon.
    


            Trump said he believed a nuclear war might have been averted.
    


            CNN previously reported the ceasefire may not lead to a lasting peace as it does not address the fundamental grievances fueling the decades-long dispute over the status of Muslim-majority Kashmir, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan.
    


President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order Monday morning that promises to crack down on “unreasonable practices” by foreign countries that suppress drug prices abroad, a White House official said.
    


            It will apply to a wide range of drugs and to prices in the commercial market, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, and will most likely spark fierce legal battles.
    


            If prices do not come down quickly, the administration will look at various policy levers that can be used to force prices down, the official told reporters Monday. The mandate also calls for the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower prices across all markets. If no progress is made, the agency will implement a rule to impose the “Most Favored Nation” cost for the drug, which would be the lowest price available among peer countries.
    


            The trade war de-escalation with China represents a big win for the US economy and the American consumer, Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council of the United States, told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Monday.
    


            Hassett said Trump had scored major concessions from China and the United Kingdom in their respective recent frameworks for trade negotiations, announced over the past few days, particularly by opening up the UK market to American beef and potentially paring back some of the barriers China had put in place on American companies looking to do business there.
    


            “We described the non-tariff barriers and tariffs that disadvantaged American workers, and folks are coming to the table and and it's really stunning how quickly they're moving and how dramatic the changes are,” Hassett said. “I think it's really a very historic fresh start in the relationship between the US and China.”
    


            The biggest win for the US economy from this weekend's stunning agreement with China is likely the drastic reduction of the sky-high tariffs the US had placed on Chinese goods that had all but stopped trade between the two countries. That risked supply chain shocks, higher prices and some shortages. Although Hassett hinted at future agreements that could open up foreign markets more to US goods and services, it's not clear yet what shape those will take and whether Chinese and British consumers will want those American goods.
    


            Significant damage has already been done by the enormous tariffs put in place between the US and China over the past few months, economists and logistics experts say. Shipments of Chinese goods to the United States fell off a cliff in recent weeks. But Hassett suggested the agreement reached over the weekend should prevent further issues with supply from China.
    


            “A lot of that is cleared up now — the potential for supply disruptions from China,” Hassett said. “All of that stuff is cleared up by this really historic negotiation.”
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that the legal details on accepting a Boeing 747-8 jet to replace Air Force One as a gift from the Qatari royal family, are “still being worked out,” but that “any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law.”
    


            “The Qatari government has graciously offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense,” Leavitt said in an interview with Fox News on Monday.
    


                    “The legal details of that are still being worked out, but of course, any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law, and we commit ourselves to the utmost transparency, and we will continue to do that,” the press secretary added.
                





            When pressed if she believed this “gift” would require something in return, Leavitt was quick to respond, saying “absolutely not, because they know President Trump, and they know he only works with the interests of the American public in mind.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Sunday night that the Defense Department plans to accept the luxury jet as a “GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE,” on social media.
    


            CNN reported earlier on Sunday that the Trump administration was set to accept the plane from the Qatari royal family that will be retrofitted and used as Air Force One during the president's second term, according to two people familiar with the agreement.
    


            US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday morning characterized the trade war de-escalation that he helped negotiate this weekend with his Chinese counterparts as tough but respectful.
    


            “We were firm, and we moved forward,” Bessent told CNBC from Geneva. “We tried to identify shared interest. We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that.”
    


            Bessent noted that America was negotiating from a position of strength because China needs the United States to buy its products more than the US relies on China for its goods exports. China's economy is on the ropes, amid a housing crisis and an emerging debt crisis. Consumer spending has fallen, as has factory output. This is a bad time for China to be dealing with a crippling trade war.
    


                    “I had seen what's going on in the Chinese economy. We can see what's going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country. Historically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.”
                





            But, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war. US consumer sentiment fell off a cliff in recent months as inflation-weary Americans grew anxious about the prospect of rising prices and shortages. Shipments to the US from China were all but halted, rattling corporate America. And investors had braced for a recession, as economists said the US economy could get hit particularly hard by the trade war.
    


            The detente, though welcome by Wall Street, consumers and businesses, represents a remarkable shift for a Trump administration that only days ago had said the trade standoff with China was necessary to restore America's lost manufacturing prowess. Trump had said last week that zero trade with China put America in a stronger position, because that meant it was no longer “losing money” to the Chinese.
    


            Bessent said the deal didn't represent a major policy shift, however.
    


            “This is just a pause,” he said. “The April 2 tariff level for China was 34%, so we have moved that down from 34% to 10%.”
    


            President Donald Trump took to social media this morning to preview an executive order aimed at lowering drug costs that he is expected to sign later today.
    


                    “DRUG PRICES TO BE CUT BY 59%, PLUS! Gasoline, Energy, Groceries, and all other costs, DOWN. NO INFLATION!!! LOVE, DJT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





            The president announced yesterday that he plans to resurrect a controversial policy from his first term that aims to reduce drug costs by basing payments for certain medicines on their prices in other countries.
    


His prior rule, called “Most Favored Nation,” was finalized in late 2020 but blocked by federal courts and rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in 2021, as reported by CNN.
    


            Analysts welcomed the announcement that the United States and China will slash tariffs on each other's goods for a 90-day period on Monday, but warned against overoptimism on the trade spat between the world's two largest economies.
    


            “This is a substantial de-escalation,” said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at consultancy Capital Economics, chiming with others. But he noted that US tariffs on China remain much higher than on most other major economies and that America “still appears” to be trying to rally other countries to introduce restrictions of their own on trade with China.
    


                    “In these circumstances, there is no guarantee that the 90-day truce will give way to a lasting ceasefire,” he wrote in a note.
                





            Economists at Commerzbank, a big German bank, also pointed out that, compared with the situation before President Donald Trump returned to the White House, tariffs applied by the US and China to each other will still be significantly higher.
    


            Neil Wilson, a strategist at investment platform Saxo, also argued Monday that, despite comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the US does not want to economically “decouple” from China, “the US is absolutely trying to decouple.”
    


            That separation could take the form of a dramatic fall in trade between the two nations.
    


            The US and China have agreed to massively roll back tariffs on each other's goods for an initial 90-day period, de-escalating a global trade war.
    


            The announcement comes after a weekend of marathon trade negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland by officials from the world's two largest economies.
    


Major breakthrough: The substantial, if temporary, agreement was unexpected. Just last week, Bessent sought to manage expectations by suggesting that his goal for the talks was “de-escalation” of tension and not “a big trade deal,” as the US and China had been at a virtual stalemate since President Donald Trump imposed his tariff policy.
    


            The speed of the talks' progress seemed to surprise even US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer:
    


                    “It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,” he said Sunday.
                





            Trade Representative Li Chenggang had hinted at the tariff cuts when pressed by a reporter on Sunday for more detail about today's announcement:
    


                    “As regards the timing for the release of the joint statement, as we say back in China, if the dishes are delicious, then timing is not a matter. So I think no matter when this statement is released, it's going to be … big news, good news for the world,” he said.
                





            Beijing's upbeat and positive tone stands in stark contrast to its previous statements about the trade conflict with the US. For weeks, Chinese officials had struck a defiant tone, demanding the US remove all tariffs on China before agreeing to come to the negotiation table.
    


Brief relief: There had been a tit-for-tat escalation between the US and China since April, when Trump tacked 34% reciprocal tariffs on Chinese goods and upped that rate to 145% days later. China retaliated with 125% on US goods.
    


            Economists have said 50% is the make-or-break threshold for the return of somewhat normal business between the US and China.
    


Scramble to secure deals: White House officials have made clear they view the China talks as an entirely different endeavor than broader efforts to seal trade agreements with dozens of other nations. Those negotiations are on the clock after Trump's decision to pause the April 2 “reciprocal” tariff rates for 90 days.
    


            The deal Trump announced with the UK last week has maintained a 10% tariff rate but had some carve-outs for British cars, planes, steel, aluminum and beef.
    


            The trade war has already affected the US and Chinese economies.
    


            America's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, showed its first quarterly contraction since early 2022, as importers raced to bring in goods before punishing tariff rates kicked in.
    


            As for China, its exports to the US fell sharply last month, impacting the country's enormous manufacturing industry.
    


            Chinese factory activity contracted at its fastest pace in 16 months in April, adding urgency to Beijing's efforts to roll out fresh economic stimulus.
    


            On Friday, US port officials told CNN that not a single cargo vessel had left China with goods for the two major West Coast ports over the past 12 hours. That hasn't happened since the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reiterated that the US does not want to economically decouple from China, but seeks more “balance” in trade.
    


            “The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled, and what have occurred with these very high tariffs…was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade,” he said at a Monday press conference in Geneva.
    


            Last week, Bessent told Fox News: “We don't want to decouple; what we want is fair trade.”
    


            Global investors are cheering a thaw in the trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump's massive tariffs, which have roiled financial markets, disrupted supply chains and stoked recession fears.
    


            Stock markets around the world rose Monday after the United States and China agreed to drastically roll back tariffs on each other's goods for an initial 90-day period.
    


            Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 3.4% late afternoon local time.
    


            In Europe, Germany's DAX index and France's CAC were 1.2% and 1% up respectively early in the trading session. London's FTSE index rose 0.3%.
    


            US futures were also up. The Dow was set to open 2.1% higher, while futures in the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq were trading 2.7% and 3.6% higher respectively.
    


            The US dollar strengthened early Monday following the breakthrough in trade talks. The ICE dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of major currencies, rose 1.3% to $102.
    


            Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, was trading 2.8% higher.
    


            “This is buying time for a more comprehensive deal – allows for time for the process and ‘mechanism' in the words of Treasury Secretary Bessent to take place,” Neil Wilson, a strategist at investment platform Saxo Markets, wrote in a note Monday.
    


                    “But he also stressed that strategic rebalancing of the global economy is still underway, although ‘neither side want a decoupling,' which is the sort of commentary the market is going to lap up. But it is not true – the US is absolutely trying to decouple.”
                





            The United States and China have agreed to drastically roll back tariffs on each other's goods for an initial 90-day period, according to a joint statement from the two countries released Monday.
    


            The announcement comes after a weekend of marathon trade negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland by officials from the world's two largest economies.
    


            The tariff revisions will be imposed by May 14. US President Donald Trump's 20% fentanyl-related levies on China, imposed in February and March, will stay. However, each side has agreed to lower “reciprocal” tariffs on the other by 115 percentage points for 90 days.
    


            That effectively means the US will temporarily lower its overall tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will cut its levies on American imports from 125% to 10%, according to the joint statement.
    


            The two sides also agreed to establish “a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations,” led by Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, according to the statement.
    


                    “These discussions may be conducted alternately in China and the United States, or a third country upon agreement of the Parties. As required, the two sides may conduct working-level consultations on relevant economic and trade issues,” it read.
                





            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke separately with his British counterpart and Germany's Chancellor late on Sunday, reaffirming that the US position on Russia's war in Ukraine remains “an immediate ceasefire.”
    


                    “The Secretary reaffirmed the US position on the Russia-Ukraine war: our top priority remains bringing an end to the fighting and an immediate ceasefire,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a readout of Rubio's call with Lammy.
                





            In a separate call, Rubio and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz discussed a recent meeting between European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and “our shared goal of ending the war in Ukraine,” according to a State readout.
    


            The calls come as the British Foreign Minister David Lammy is set to host European delegations in London on Monday for critical talks on Ukraine and the future of European security. And as Russian President Vladimir Putin ignores calls from Ukraine's major European allies to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire by Monday or face “massive” new sanctions.
    


            US President Donald Trump urged Ukraine to “immediately” accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer for direct talks on Thursday in Istanbul, dropping his demand for Russia to agree to a ceasefire.
    


            Zelensky said he is prepared to meet Vladimir Putin. However, Ukraine's allies have stressed that no further talks should be held before Putin agrees to an unconditional truce.
    


            And Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, said in an interview with local media published Monday that the first step to any negotiations to end the war in Ukraine still rests on whether Russia will agree to a 30-day ceasefire.
    


            Representatives from France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Poland and the EU are expected to attend the talks hosted in London on Monday, according to Britain's foreign ministry. Lammy plans to announce further sanctions targeting actors supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the ministry said, according to Reuters.

            Victory has a thousand fathers, as they say, but defeat is an orphan.
    


            And so it goes after the brief but bruising conflict between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan with both sides loudly talking up their successes while quietly down-playing losses.
    


            On India's frantic television news channels, minutes after a US-brokered ceasefire came into force, the headline “Pakistan Surrenders” was splashed across the screens.
    


            India's military action against Pakistan, sparked by the killing of tourists in India-administered Kashmir last month, sent a bold message to terrorists, India's defense minister, Rajnath Singh, said later.
    


            Meanwhile, in Pakistan, crowds gathered in the streets of the capital to celebrate what Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif described as “military history” achieved by “our brave army in a spectacular fashion.”
    


            “In a few hours our jets silenced India's guns in a way that history will not soon forget,” Sharif said, while an effigy of his Indian counterpart burned outside.
    


            But this was an eruption of violence between two nuclear-armed neighbors in which both sides delivered and suffered heavy blows. 



            Pakistan has trumpeted successes in the skies, claiming its pilots shot down five Indian fighter jets in aerial battles – including three advanced French-made Rafales – in what would be a stinging humiliation for the Indian air force.
    


            As CNN earlier reported, two planes crashed in Indian states that border Pakistan around the time Pakistan claimed to have shot down the jets, and a French intelligence source told CNN that Pakistan had downed at least one Indian Rafale.
    


            But Indian officials are still refusing to acknowledge even a single aircraft loss.
    


            Meanwhile, India has released new satellite images showing serious damage to air strips and radar stations at what Indian defense officials say are multiple Pakistani military bases crippled by massive Indian airstrikes.
    


            In other words, political and military leaders in India and Pakistan can spin it how they like, but there is no clear winner in this conflict.
    


            There's even a struggle to take credit for what were clearly US-brokered negotiations that led to the ceasefire, announced almost out of the blue by US President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform.
    


            Amid a rapidly deteriorating security situation at the weekend, which threatened to spin out of control, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he and Vice President JD Vance called political and military leaders on both sides urging them to hold back.
    


            Pakistani officials expressed gratitude for the intervention. But Indian leaders are playing down any US role, saying the truce was worked out between India and Pakistan directly.
    


            The reason is likely to be driven by national pride, with Indian officials loathe to admit a truce was imposed on them, or even brokered, by the United States.
    


            India also has a long-standing policy of refusing to allow foreign mediation when it comes to the status of Muslim-majority Kashmir - a disputed region claimed by both India and Pakistan in its entirety - which has been at the center of the latest conflict with Pakistan and which India regards as a strictly internal matter.
    


            Nevertheless, perhaps buoyed by his quick ceasefire win, President Trump has offered to help the two countries find a lasting solution “after a thousand years” concerning Kashmir. Inevitably, Pakistan has welcomed the idea, while in India it has fallen on deaf ears.
    


            The offer is a stark reminder, though, that the US-brokered truce is little more than a quick fix, a band aid that is unlikely to remotely address the fundamental grievances fueling what is actually a decades long dispute, over the status of Kashmir.
    


            And if you think the Indian and Pakistani claims of victory both ring a bit hollow now, just wait until the simmering Kashmir dispute, inevitably, boils over once again.

NEW YORK (AP) — If you're intimidated by the idea of making ice cream at home, just think of it as making soup. That's advice from Tyler Malek of Salt & Straw, the innovative gourmet ice cream maker known for its ever-changing lick-able treats.

“Making a pint of ice cream is very similar to making a pot of soup where if you have a good stock recipe — like chicken stock, vegetable stock — then you start just adding to it until it tastes good,” he says from his kitchen in Portland, Oregon.

“If you have really good stock base recipe, you could blend strawberries into it and make strawberry ice cream. You can drizzle chocolate into it and make chocolate ice cream. You can do really anything.”

That ice cream base is also at the heart of Malek's latest cookbook, “ America's Most Iconic Ice Creams: A Salt & Straw Cookbook.” Just as another summer beckons, he and co-author JJ Goode teach the fundamentals, which then can be built on to make all kinds of delicious treats.

That means learning the bases for gelato, custard, sorbet, coconut and ice cream. Only down the road can you confidently turn them into awesome flavors like Strawberry Honey Balsamic with Black Pepper, or Banana Parsnip Sherbet.




“My dream, at its heart, is that someone can take this book and they just pore through it and have so much fun and then it ignites this Pandora's box of imagination,” Malek says.

The cookbook focuses on 10 iconic flavors: vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, coffee, green tea, pistachio, cookie dough, salted caramel, cereal and rum raisin. Once you've mastered their “core principles in flavor, in technique,” Malek says, “you can just go wild.”

And wild it gets in the cookbook, with flavors like Toasted Sourdough, Chocolate and EVOO, and Lemon Earl Grey Shortbread.

“We wanted it to feel like you were imported into our R&D test kitchen and you could feel like you're writing recipes beside us and understanding why we're testing this and adding more salt or adding more sweetness,” he says.

Take salted caramel, which most people think is salty and sweet.

“They're completely wrong,” Malek says, laughing. “It's salty sweet and bitter. Once you get that flavor trinity, you start understanding that the combination of salty, sweet and bitter can completely open your eyes to different combinations. ”

Malek and his cousin, Kim, became ice cream entrepreneurs in 2011 when they opened a small food cart in Portland. Since then, they've expanded to over 40 stores in seven states, becoming known for their refreshing and off-beat approach and rotating menu, with new flavors added every month. 

Other flavors have included Malted Potato Chip Cupcake and Black Olive Brittle and Goat Cheese. For Thanksgiving, they once offered Caramelized Turkey & Cranberry Sauce. “I've written 2,500 recipes and maybe 20,000 fails,” says Malek.

Salt & Straw leans on xanthan gum, which Malek uses to combat “heat shock,” when ice cream melts and freezes again into bigger crystals. (“It's as innocuous as cornstarch or baking soda,” he writes.) He also harnesses the power of acids, like citric, malic and tartaric, calling them “an ice cream maker's secret weapon.”

“I think he is part scientist — maybe a mad scientist — and part artist,” says Clarkson Potter editor Francis Lam, who with Susan Roxborough helped craft the book. Lam first encountered Salt & Straw when he ate their prosciutto ice cream at an event in Portland. At another event, he had their sea urchin flavor and felt compelled to meet Malek.

“He's one of these people who doesn't shut down an idea before he runs with it for a little bit,” Lam said.

Salt & Straw is part of an artisanal ice cream boom in recent years that includes companies like Van Leeuwen, Gelato Fiasco, Lick Honest Ice Creams, Morgenstern's and Wanderlust Creamery.

Malek has leaned on partners for innovations; he and a doughnut maker in Florida, for instance, created a cream cheese ice cream with glazed brioche doughnut chunks and guava curd. He has interned at breweries to learn the ins and outs of beer making to incorporate it into his desserts.

“My passion is in learning and storytelling. If I weren't making ice cream, my dream job was always to be a travel writer,” says Malek. “I had no idea when we first started the company that ice cream is like the coolest medium to channel that through because it really is like writing a story through every single ice cream.”

He learned that different regions of the country have their blind spots; when Salt & Straw opened in Los Angeles, few knew what rhubarb was. At the same time, he didn't know there were different types of avocados.

Another tip borrowed from soup: As with soup bases, Malek says, home cooks should make big batches of different ice cream bases, separate them into containers and freeze them. 

“Then when you're ready to make ice cream, defrost it in your microwave real quick and blend in your strawberries that you got fresh from the farmer's market and make strawberry ice cream,” he says. “That's the trick: to make ice cream within a day or literally within hours of finding a really special ingredient.”

Here's a recipe from the new cookbook “America's Most Iconic Ice Creams: A Salt & Straw Cookbook” by Tyler Malek and JJ Goode:

___

Makes about 2½ pints

3 cups 17% Butterfat Base (see separate recipe below)

1½ teaspoons molasses (not blackstrap)

2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

½ teaspoon Diamond

Crystal kosher salt

1 cup packed Malted Cookie Dough (recipe follows), frozen

¾ cup Malted Fudge (recipe follows)

In a medium bowl, combine the ice cream base, molasses, vanilla and salt, and whisk until smooth. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and turn on the machine. Churn just until the mixture has the texture of soft serve, 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the machine.

Alternate spooning layers of the ice cream and generous dollops of the cookie dough and fudge into freezer-safe containers.

Freeze until firm, at least 6 hours or for up to 3 months.

___

Makes about 3 cups

½ cup granulated sugar

2 tablespoons nonfat dry milk powder

¼ teaspoon xanthan gum (yes, I'm easy to find!)

1 1/8 cups whole milk

2 tablespoons light corn syrup

1 1/8 cups heavy cream, very cold

In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, milk powder, and xanthan gum.

In a medium pot, stir together the whole milk and corn syrup. Add the sugar mixture and immediately whisk vigorously until smooth. Set the pot over medium heat and cook, stirring often and reducing the heat if necessary to prevent a simmer, just until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. Add the cold cream and stir until fully combined.

Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 6 hours, or for even better texture and flavor, 24 hours. Stir well before using.

The base can be further stored in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw completely and stir well before using.

—-

Makes about 1 ½ cups

4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature

2 tablespoons granulated sugar

¼ cup lightly packed light brown sugar

1 teaspoon flaky sea salt

2 tablespoons heavy cream

1 tablespoon light corn syrup

1 teaspoon molasses (not blackstrap)

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

½ cup all-purpose flour, toasted

2 tablespoons malt powder

¼ cup finely chopped (chip-size pieces) dark chocolate

In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle, cream the butter, both sugars, and the salt on medium high speed, scraping down the sides as necessary, until the butter takes on a lighter color, about 2 minutes. Stop the mixer and add the cream, corn syrup, molasses, and vanilla, then mix on medium-low speed until the mixture is just combined, about 1 minute more.

In a medium bowl, sift together the flour and malt powder. Add the flour mixture to the stand mixer and mix on medium speed, scraping down the bowl once, until there are no more clumps of flour (specks of malt are just fine!), about 1 minute. Add the chopped chocolate to the stand mixer and mix on low speed until it's well distributed.

Pack tightly into an airtight container and store in the freezer until ready to use or for up to 2 months.

—-

Toasting flour note:

Our cookie dough excludes eggs for some just-in-case food safety assurance, since as you've probably heard, consuming raw eggs carries a minor but real risk of salmonella. What you might not be aware of is that eating raw flour does, too. So if you're someone who avoids sunny-side-ups or carbonara, consider playing it extra safe and cooking the flour for this recipe: Spread it on a sheet pan and bake in a 350°F oven for 15 minutes.

___

Makes about 2 cups

1/3 cup malt powder

1/2 cup light corn syrup

1/3 cup heavy cream

1 tablespoon unsalted butter

2 teaspoons cocoa powder

1/8 teaspoon xanthan gum

1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt

3/4 cup chopped (chip-size pieces) good dark chocolate

In a small saucepan, combine the malt powder and 1/4 cup cold water and whisk until most of the lumps are broken up. Add the corn syrup, cream, and butter and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture comes to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, add the cocoa powder, xanthan gum, and salt and continue to whisk until the cocoa powder is dissolved and the mixture looks glossy, about 3 minutes.

Turn off the heat, add the chocolate pieces, and let them sit for a minute. Whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and combined. Let cool to room temperature and then use immediately or store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

Kristi Noem, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be Secretary of Homeland Security, at the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 17, 2025. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis, File)

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego is wading into one of Washington's most contentious and intractable political problems as he puts forward a plan Monday aimed at reforming the country's immigration system and beefing up border security.

The plan by Gallego, who beat Republican Kari Lake in last fall's tight Senate race, calls for hiring more Border Patrol agents; using technology to stop fentanyl smuggling; reforming the asylum system; adding more ways for people to come to the U.S.; and a pathway to citizenship for some immigrants.

Gallego's plan comes three months into President Donald Trump's administration as Trump seeks to deliver on campaign promises of carrying out mass deportations. His plan — or any other from Democrats — is unlikely to get much traction with Trump in the White House, but it illustrates that the debate about legislative solutions carries on.

Many members of Congress have tried and failed to change the immigration system. A small group of senators, led by Gallego's predecessor, Krysten Sinema, negotiated for months in 2023 and 2024 over a border bill that would have toughened asylum protocols for migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border; hired more officers to evaluate asylum claims and Border Patrol agents; and given money to local governments seeing influxes of migrants.

That effort ran into a wall of opposition just hours after the bill was released.




The last time Congress even came close to a breakthrough on immigration reform was in 2013, when a bipartisan group of senators pushed forward legislation creating a pathway to citizenship for millions of people in the country illegally and expanding work visas while tightening border security and mandating that employers verify workers' legal status. The Senate approved that proposal, but it was rejected by the House.

Gallego's plan includes some elements that likely will find bipartisan support, such as his calls to beef up border security. But other parts — like efforts to legalize anyone already in the country illegally — will prove much more contentious.

“We don't have to choose between border security and immigration reform. We can and should do both,” Gallego said in a news release Monday. He said “for decades, Congress has tried and failed to take action because politics got in the way. It's time to push forward and enact a plan that works.”

Gallego, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, replaced Sinema, a Democrat-turned Independent from Arizona who often was on the forefront on immigration and border security legislation.

Here's a look at the 21-page plan:

Gallego argues that tougher immigration enforcement alone isn't the answer and that it should be paired with more ways for people to come to the U.S. legally.

The plan calls for increasing the annual allotment of some visas and Green Cards and removing or significantly increasing “arbitrary per-country caps.” He also wants to create new visa categories, boost refugee resettlement and expedite the naturalization process for immigrants who serve in the military.

He also calls for gradually implementing E-Verify, which makes it easy to check if potential employees can legally work in the U.S. E-Verify has often faced resistance over concerns it would lead to widespread labor shortages.

Arguing on moral and economic grounds, Gallego calls for a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. 

There's no exact number of how many people this would encompass, although some estimates put the number as high as 3.4 million people. 

Gallego's plan also calls for a pathway to citizenship for spouses of U.S. citizens who are in the country illegally. President Joe Biden tried something similar last year in a program that would have covered an estimated 550,000 people, but it was swiftly held up by a judge.

Noting that migrant border arrivals started dropping back in June of last year, Gallego warns that a surge can come at any time so investments should be made now. The senator calls for better pay and addressing issues like workforce safety to help hire and retain Border Patrol agents; investments in technology and infrastructure to detect drugs or human smuggling; and focusing efforts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement on removing people who pose a safety threat.

Gallego, who often speaks about the toll of migrant surges on Arizona's border towns, also is proposing money to help affected communities. 

Instead of having asylum cases decided in backlogged immigration courts, Gallego wants to hire more asylum officers and give them the power to decide those cases. He also is proposing making the asylum standard higher and cutting back on asylum access during border surges.

Gallego argues the U.S. needs to figure out why migrants are leaving their home countries in the first place and address those problems.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says he'll sign an executive order on Monday that, if implemented, could bring down the costs of some medications — reviving a failed effort from his first term on an issue he's talked up since even before becoming president.

The order Trump is promising will direct the Department of Health and Human Services to tie what Medicare pays for medications administered in a doctor's office to the lowest price paid by other countries. 

“I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION'S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,” the president posted Sunday on his social media site, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House. 

“Our Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,” Trump added. 

His proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office — think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring significant savings to the government, although the “TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS” Trump boasted about in his post may be an exaggeration. 

Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress. 




Under the planned order, the federal government would tie what it pays pharmaceutical companies for those drugs to the price paid by a group of other, economically advanced countries — the so-called “most favored nation” approach. 

The proposal will face fierce opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. 

It was a rule that Trump tried to adopt during his first term, but could never get through. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under the Biden administration. 

The pharmaceutical industry argued that Trump's 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the “upper hand” in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.. The industry has long argued that forcing lower prices will hurt profits, and ultimately affect innovation and its efforts to develop new medicines. 

Only drugs on Medicare Part B — the insurance for doctor's office visits — are likely to be covered under the plan. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor's visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay. 

A report by the Trump administration during its first term found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021. 

More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order. 

Trump's post formally previewing the action came after he teased a “very big announcement” last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn't related to trade or the tariffs he has announced imposing on much of the world. 

“We're going to have a very, very big announcement to make — like as big as it gets,” Trump said last week.

He came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of “getting away with murder” and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.

On Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the “Pharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the ‘suckers' of America, ALONE.” 

Referring to drug companies' powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions “can do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.” 

“We are going to do the right thing,” he wrote.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — At Perry Traditional Academy, students took time out from classes on a recent Thursday to listen quietly in the school auditorium while a small group of their classmates questioned the four candidates running in Pittsburgh's upcoming mayoral primary.

The topics covered an array of issues important to the teens: policing, school funding and youth involvement in their administrations.

The forum, coordinated by the Allegheny Youth Vote Coalition working with Pittsburgh Public Schools, was the eighth held at a public high school in the city, all designed to get the youngest and future voters involved in elections. After the candidates left, they had a short oral civics test on elections, with prizes for correct answers.

What's happening in Pittsburgh and surrounding Allegheny County is part of a national trend.

Young people have consistently turned out to vote at lower rates than older Americans. Civic organizations are hoping to reverse that by getting teenagers engaged in public debate before they are even eligible to vote, seeing it as foundational to the future of U.S. democracy.

A Pew Research Center analysis found that voters under the age of 30 made up 15% of voters in the 2020 election and 27% of nonvoters, a slight improvement in both categories over 2016, when that demographic was 13% of all voters and 33% of nonvoters. Voters were also much older than nonvoters, on average, in the 2018 and 2022 midterm elections, according to Pew.




Among the groups leading the effort nationally is the Civics Center, which works with high schoolers to run voter registration drives and hold forums that are geared toward raising their participation in elections. Others, such as The Gem Project Inc., in Newark, New Jersey, have pushed for students to be able to register and cast ballots in local elections before they turn 18.

Last year, the Newark City Council dropped the minimum voting age to 16 for school board elections, making it the first municipality in the state and the second largest city in the country to do so for any election. Oakland was the largest city in the U.S. to lower its voting age in 2020, but teens voted for the first time last year. 

Breanna Quist, 18, and one of the recent registrants in Newark, said the push was especially important to her because it allowed students to vote for an office, school board, that directly affects them.

“This just shows how young people should always just take action. They shouldn't be fearful. They should always advocate for what they believe is right,” she said during an interview at a voter registration town hall earlier this year.

Nishani Ward, 16, said it was an inspiration when Newark lowered the voting age for local elections.

“Doing this right now, I'm more likely to do it in the future and do it more routinely in the future,” she said.

Media reports said turnout among 16- and 17-year-old registered voters in the April school board election was less than 4% but outpaced the overall turnout.

In some places across the country, young people have had success when demanding a greater voice in political decisions. They've argued that voting adults don't always consider them or their needs when casting their ballots. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 21 states and the District of Columbia allow 17-year-olds who will turn 18 by the time of a general election to vote in primaries.

Even though the youth vote tends to bend left politically, this might be a good time to reconsider the minimum age because it's become less predictable, said Daniel Hart, a professor of psychology at Rutgers University who has studied lowering the voting age.

Data from AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters in all 50 states, found that Democrat Kamala Harris had a slight edge over Republican Donald Trump among young voters, but young men swung to the right for Trump even if they didn't agree with him on all issues.

The Allegheny Youth Vote Coalition held two vote huddles in 2024, drawing students from throughout the county. They learned about the electoral process and held more than 20 voter registration drives, said Rachel Martin Golman, senior director of social impact of the National Council of Jewish Women Pittsburgh and a coalition member.

During a workshop earlier this year, one student attendee asked why the candidates didn't come speak to them, Golman said: ”And we all thought, yes, why not, and worked to make it happen.”

Laura Brill, the founder and CEO of the Civics Center, a Los Angeles-based coalition member, said the point is that “most teens today have few opportunities to consider their important role in our democracy.” She said engaging the candidates directly is “the kind of formative experience we believe has been missing from high schools for decades and has undoubtedly led to the low rates of engagement we see among the up-and-coming voters.”

At Perry, the students in the audience didn't shy away from asking questions important to them and their peers.

Makaila Nyambe, 17, asked each mayoral candidate about funding for schools, while fellow junior Deahmi Mobley questioned how they might establish a good relationship between law enforcement and teens. Previous forums at other schools included questions on other issues, including how each candidate would implement diversity, equity and inclusion into their administrations.

Trash, homelessness and public safety came up constantly, along with a disagreement over whether more school spending would improve academic performance. Infrastructure, road repairs and cuts to public transit also generated discussion.

The students listened closely when all four candidates talked about neighborhood policing and building relationships -- and about the importance of young people at such a forum.

 “You are the leaders we have been waiting for,” said one of the mayoral candidates, retired Pittsburgh police detective Tony Moreno.

“You are the future of Pittsburgh,” said another candidate, Thomas West, a business owner and former television news producer. “You are the future of America.”

Stalea Chapman, a 17-year-old senior, said afterward she was glad the candidates were taking the students seriously and reaching out to them because their futures are intertwined with politics and policies, especially now.

“It is a lot of pressure being young and seeing what the economy is turning to and what's going on in the world,” she said. “It's frightening for young people because we want to be successful.”

Sean “Diddy” Combs' family has arrived to the courthouse as opening statements are expected to begin in his sex trafficking trial in New York. A publicist for his attorneys says Combs is “Upbeat, ready to have his side told in open court.”

Federal prosecutors will begin trying to prove Monday that Sean “Diddy” Combs turned his hip-hop conglomerate into a racketeering enterprise that forced women to satisfy his sexual desires for two decades. (May 12)

NEW YORK (AP) — The public knew Sean “Diddy” Combs as a larger-than-life cultural icon and business mogul, but behind the scenes, he was coercing women into drug-fueled sexual encounters and using violence to keep them in line, a federal prosecutor told a jury Monday during opening statements in Combs' sex trafficking trial.

“This is Sean Combs,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Johnson told the Manhattan jury as she pointed at Combs, who leaned back in his chair. ”... During this trial you are going to hear about 20 years of the defendant's crimes. But he didn't do it alone. He had an inner circle of bodyguards and high-ranking employees who helped him commit crimes and cover them up.”

Those crimes, she said, included kidnapping, arson, drugs, sex crimes, bribery and obstruction.

On the contrary, the trial of Combs is a misguided overreach by prosecutors, who are trying to turn consenting sex between adults into a prostitution and sex trafficking case, Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos said during her opening.

“Sean Combs is a complicated man. But this is not a complicated case. This case is about love, jealousy, infidelity and money,” Geragos told the eight men and four women on the jury. “There has been a tremendous amount of noise around this case over the past year. It is time to cancel that noise.”

Geragos conceded that Combs' violent outbursts, often fueled by alcohol and drugs, might have warranted domestic violence charges, but not the sex trafficking and racketeering counts he faces. She also told jurors they might think Combs' is a “jerk” and might not condone his “kinky sex,” but “he's not charged with being mean. He's not charged with being a jerk.”




Combs, wearing a white sweater, entered the packed courtroom shortly before 9 a.m., hugged his lawyers and gave a thumbs up to supporters seated behind him. The case has drawn intense public interest, and the line to get into the courthouse stretched down the block. Combs' mother and some of his children were escorted past the crowd and brought straight into the building.

Combs, 55, pleaded not guilty to a five-count indictment that could land him in prison for at least 15 years if he is convicted on all charges. He has been held at a federal jail in Brooklyn since his arrest in September.

Lawyers for the three-time Grammy winner say prosecutors are wrongly trying to make a crime out of a party-loving lifestyle that may have been indulgent, but not illegal.

Prosecutors say Combs coerced women into drugged-up group sexual encounters he called “freak offs,” “wild king nights” or “hotel nights,” then kept them in line through violence. He is accused of choking, hitting, kicking and dragging women, often by the hair.

Johnson told jurors about a night when Combs allegedly kidnapped an employee and threatened his one-time girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura and who is expected to be a key witness. Combs told Cassie that if she defied him again, he would release video of her having sex with a male escort — video that the prosecutor called “souvenirs of the most humiliating nights of her life,” Johnson said.

That was “just the tip of the iceberg,” Johnson said, telling jurors that Cassie was far from the only woman Combs beat and sexually exploited.

The prosecutor said Combs last year brutally beat another woman — identified only as Jane — when she confronted him about enduring years of freak offs in dark hotel rooms while he took other paramours on date nights and trips around the globe.

Geragos argued that Combs and Jane had a “toxic and dysfunctional relationship” and she willingly engaged in freak offs because she wanted to spend time with Combs. Their fight a year ago started when Jane slammed Combs' head down in a jealous rage, Geragos said, noting that she didn't want to justify Combs' violence but that the fight wasn't evidence of sex trafficking.

The sex parties are central to Combs' sexual abuse, prosecutors say. Combs' company paid for the parties, held in hotel rooms across the U.S. and overseas, and his employees staged the rooms with his preferred lighting, extra linens and lubricant, Johnson said. Combs compelled women, including Cassie, to take drugs and engage in sexual activity with male escorts while he gratified himself and sometimes recorded them, Johnson said.

Combs would beat Cassie over the smallest slights, such as leaving a “freak off” without his permission or taking too long in the bathroom, Johnson said. Combs threatened to ruin Cassie's singing career by releasing to the public videos of her engaging in sex with male escorts, the prosecutor said. “Her livelihood depended on keeping him happy,” Johnson said.

Combs sat expressionless as he looked toward Johnson and the jury as the prosecutor described what she said was a pattern of violence, sexual abuse and blackmail. 

Cassie, who was expected to be among the first witnesses to testify, filed a lawsuit in 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape. The lawsuit was settled within hours of its filing, but it touched off a law enforcement investigation and was followed by dozens of lawsuits from people making similar claims. 

Geragos claimed Combs' accusers were motivated by money. She told jurors that Cassie demanded $30 million when she sued him, and another witness will acknowledge demanding $22 million in a breach of contract lawsuit.

“I want you to ask yourself, how many millions of reasons does this witness, swearing to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, have to lie?” she said.

Prosecutors plan to show jurors security camera footage of Combs beating Cassie in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.

Johnson told the jury they will hear the lengths Combs' inner circle went to help him hide the attack and get what they thought was the only video recording. She said a security guard was given a brown paper bag full of $100,000 in cash while Combs' bodyguard and chief of staff stood by. “This is far from the only time that the defendant's inner circle tried to close ranks and do damage control.”

Another witness expected to testify Monday was a security guard at the hotel where Combs assaulted Cassie.

After CNN aired the video of the attack last year, Combs apologized and said he took “full responsibility” for his actions. “I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.”

Geragos also conceded that Combs is extremely jealous and “has a bad temper,” telling the jury that he sometimes got angry and lashed out when he drank alcohol or “did the wrong drugs.” But, she said, “Domestic violence is not sex trafficking.”

Jurors might also see recordings of the freak offs. The indictment said the events sometimes lasted days and participants required IV-drips to recover.

The Associated Press doesn't generally identify people who say they are victims of sexual abuse unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has done.

The trial is expected to last at least eight weeks.

New York Giants' Cam Skattebo could be the ""steal of the draft,"" ex-NFL star Jake Plummer said during a recent appearance on OutKick's ""The Ricky Cobb Show.""

Cam Skattebo made a name for himself in college football for Arizona State by running over defenders while getting more yards on the ground as the Sun Devils surprised the sport in 2024.

The New York Giants made Skattebo their fourth-round selection and his comment from rookie minicamp may get fans amped for the start of the 2025 season.

He said Friday that while scoring a touchdown is good, the possibility of trucking an opponent on the way to the end zone is even better.

""It feels good when you run somebody over and then get in the end zone,"" Skattebo said. ""I mean it feels good when you get in the end zone, but imagine running someone over and then running another person over and then getting in the end zone. It's that much better.""

Skattebo ran for 1,711 yards and 21 touchdowns during his senior season with the Sun Devils. Arizona State made the College Football Playoff and nearly stunned the Texas Longhorns in the Peach Bowl. The team finished 11-3.

Now, Skattebo will look to make the 53-man roster. He enters a running back room that has veteran Devin Singletary and Tyrone Tracy Jr., who came on strong during his rookie season, running for 839 yards and scoring five touchdowns.

Skattebo, while playing up his elusiveness, vowed to keep proving his doubters wrong.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt discusses Qatar's offer to gift President Donald Trump a new jumbo jet to be used as Air Force One on 'Fox & Friends.'

A Democratic congressman is calling for an ethics investigation over President Donald Trump's plans to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar that would temporarily serve as Air Force One before being allotted to Trump's presidential library after he leaves office.

Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., wrote to the Government Accountability Office on Sunday, noting that the plane would be the single most expensive gift ever received by a U.S. president. Torres derided the deal as a ""flying grift,"" arguing it violates the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which ""explicitly prohibits any person holding public office from accepting ‘any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.'""

""I am writing to express alarm over reports that President Donald Trump is poised to accept a luxury aircraft — a Boeing 747-8 — from the government of Qatar. The plane, so opulent it has been described as a ‘palace in the sky,' is set to be made available to President Trump for official use as Air Force One and then for private use once he leaves office,"" Torres wrote.

""This ‘flying grift' is merely the latest chapter in a tawdry tale of presidential profiteering unprecedented in American history,"" Torres added.

Trump described the deal in his own words on social media in a post Sunday night.

""So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,"" he wrote.

""Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!!"" he added.

Taking questions at the White House on Monday, he also said he wouldn't plan on using the jet after leaving office.

""It would go directly to the library after I leave office,"" Trump said. ""I wouldn't be using it, no.""

TRUMP STAFFERS LOAD BOXES OF ITEMS SEIZED BY FBI IN 2022 MAR-A-LAGO RAID ONTO AIR FORCE ONE

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told ""FOX & Friends"" Monday that the legal details ""are still being worked out.""

""Any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law, and we commit ourselves to the utmost transparency, and we will continue to do that,"" Leavitt said, adding that Trump ""only works with the interests of the American public in mind.""

ABC News reported that Trump toured the plane in West Palm Beach earlier this year. While the deal is set to be announced during Trump's trip to the Middle East this week, the actual transaction is not expected to be made until later. Qatari officials say they expect to donate the plane through the Pentagon.

""The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is currently under consideration between Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made,"" Qatari embassy official Ali Al-Ansari told ABC News.

Presidents have for decades circumvented the Emoluments Clause by classifying gifts they receive while in office as gifts to the office of the president. Those gifts are then cataloged and stored as part of their presidential libraries after leaving office. While presidents maintain some level of access to the items in their libraries, they do not own them directly and must purchase them from the federal government in order to secure private ownership.

If the jet were to enter Trump's presidential library, it is unclear how costs would be apportioned for maintenance and usage costs.

When not in office as president, Trump has traveled in his private Boeing 757 jet, dubbed Trump Force One. That jet is famously emblazoned with Trump's last name and was frequently seen in the backdrop of campaign rallies.

Columbia University student Josh Segal breaks down the moment when anti-Israel protesters stormed a library during finals week on ‘Fox News Live.'

Arizona lawmakers have outlawed encampments on public university campuses as protests continue to erupt at schools across the United States.

Democratic Arizona Gov. Kate Hobbs last week signed House Bill 2880, which bars people ""from establishing or occupying an encampment on a university or community college campus.""

The law also requires school administrators to direct people who set up encampments to ""immediately dismantle"" them or vacate the campus. Those who set up encampments may be held liable for damages to campuses, and those who do not leave are subject to trespassing charges. 

Law enforcement agencies ""must enforce the prohibition on establishing or occupying an encampment,"" the law states, and they have ""the authority to remove an encampment and any individual or group from campus that has violated the prohibition and refused to comply with the direction to leave.""

Democratic Arizona State Rep. Alma Hernandez introduced the bill, saying in a statement when it passed the Education Committee in February that the legislation ""is not about silencing anyone's right to protest.""

""You still have the right to protest peacefully, but encampments do not have a legal right to be on campus,"" Hernandez said at the time.

WHAT'S THE PENALTY FOR ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS? UCLA'S WARNING INCLUDES 1 CRUCIAL WORD

Hernandez added that the idea behind the legislation stemmed from the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel when Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, killed 1,200 people and kidnapped hundreds of hostages from a music festival.

Hamas is a designated terrorist organization that the Department of National Intelligence describes as ""the largest and most capable militant group in the Palestinian territories and one of the territories' two major political parties.""

The offensive sparked the ongoing war between Israel and the terror group. Meanwhile, students at colleges and universities across the country have participated in large-scale, anti-Israel protests that have, at times, resulted in physical clashes between students and police.

""After October 7th, our universities faced significant challenges as they tried negotiating with individuals who made unrealistic demands and refused to remove their encampments,"" Hernandez said. ""I witnessed the impact of this firsthand. As a student and a faculty member, I firmly believe in the importance of civil conversations and peaceful protests—these fundamental rights protected by the First Amendment. However, encampments have no legal standing on our campuses.""We must prioritize accountability and ensure that our public institutions remain focused on providing a safe and secure environment,"" she continued. ""These institutions' primary obligation is to support teaching and learning for ALL students. Jewish students should not have to hide or take alternate routes just to get to class.""

President Donald Trump has threatened to pull federal funding from schools over antisemitism concerns and deport students who participate in demonstrations expressing support for terrorist organizations.

""To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,"" the president said in a Jan. 30 fact sheet on the executive order. ""I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.""

NPR CEO Katherine Maher was pressed on Sunday on whether NPR was biased in their news coverage as implied in President Trump's executive order slashing taxpayer funds to NPR and PBS.

President Donald Trump has now made good on his threat to defund public media— to cut off the $535 million a year that public radio and television receive from the federal government. He's not wrong that, too often, they've been vehicles for biased journalism — both by commission (all diversity and ""reproductive choice"" stories all the time) or omission (not covering the Hunter Biden laptop story). 

But as satisfying as it might be to zero out the budget of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting — where I once served on the board of directors and tried to warn my colleagues about the threat that liberal bias posed — Trump's move could backfire. PBS and NPR could emerge both financially stronger and insulated from public accountability. 

Cutting off federal funds will not put public media out of business. Both PBS and NPR are federally chartered non-profit organizations which will continue to exist. So will some 1,000 local public broadcasting TV and radio stations. At the national level, don't be surprised if liberal foundations — Gates, MacArthur, Robert Wood Johnson, Carnegie and Ford (which helped invent public broadcasting) — step up to fill what will not be that big a budget gap. The bull market of recent years has swelled the endowments of all. 

PBS, NPR BLAST 'BLATANTLY UNLAWFUL' TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER HALTING PUBLIC FUNDING, VOW CHALLENGES

These types of foundations already provide the systems with financial support, including for specific types of programming. Incredibly, the Rockefeller Foundation, whose endowment is based on oil industry profits, is funding NPR's ""climate desk"" reporting staff. The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative has contributed to the same cause, while the Walton Family Foundation has done the same for NPR and the PBS News Hour, targeting its support for ""environmental journalism"" 

The loss of federal funding for NPR and PBS would also eliminate congressional oversight. FILE: Capitol Building, NPR and PBS. (llison Robbert/Bloomberg via Getty Images; Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images)

This is a very worrisome way in which the federal funds vacuum can be filled — by liberal donors effectively buying the type of stories that should be included in the ""news."" As anyone who has worked as a journalist knows, the decision about what to cover is more consequential and fundamental than the coverage style itself. This is the essential point in sociologist Herbert Gans seminal 1979 book about CBS, ""Deciding What's News.""  

Absent federal funding, Congress would no longer have any standing to call public media executives to account, as Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene did in March. The leverage of threatened cuts can be more powerful than the loss of funding itself.

Consider the fact that, in a recent week, the ""PBS News Hour"" has seen fit to include among its guests both the Manhattan Institute's Chris Rufo — who has led the charge against university DEI programs — Oren Cass, head of American Compass, a key Trump-friendly policy thinker with close ties to Vice-President JD Vance, and Christopher Scalia of the American Enterprise Institute, author of the new book, ""Thirteen Novels Conservatives Will Love."" The ""News Hour"" was likely feeling pressure to become more politically diverse. That's a good thing. 

Better than an abrupt threat to public media funding would be a change in the rules governing it, per the Public Broadcasting Act. As matters stand, public media serves mainly liberal audiences in blue states and college towns. Congress should insist that the services show that they can serve the country at large — meaning they'd have to adjust their programming and news content to attract a geographically and politically diverse audience.  

Annual hearings on that count would help. In other words, attach constructive strings to the federal funding — requiring annual reports about who's watching and listening, including their cities and states and their political affiliations. Turn the diversity metrics on their head to hold NPR/PBS's feet to the fire.

At the same time, local stations, which currently have to pay NPR dues and pony up to carry ""All Things Considered,"" should get to keep the $267 million in ""community service grants"" — half of CPB funding. They should be required to use the funds to cover their local governments at a time when the closing of newspapers is creating news deserts. NPR listeners in New York, Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas and Los Angeles already get more local news — yes, sometimes with a progressive slant — than they otherwise would. 

Make no mistake. Public media deserves much of the criticism it's received — and has not shown an openness to change that it should, especially in terms of the topics and locales of its journalism. I learned that firsthand during my time on the CPB board, when my criticisms, not dissimilar to those of Trump, were ignored and I was marginalized, including by being stripped of committee assignments and pushed to resign. But defunding it, although it looks like a conservative victory, could leave NPR and PBS still standing — and immune from accountability.

‘Fox News Live' panelists Jon Bramnick and Dave Spero discuss growing concern over outdated air traffic control systems after another radar outage at Newark Airport.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is demanding U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy ""immediately fix the situation at Newark Airport,"" following a stretch of travel mishaps and chaos. 

""When people hear about radar screens just going dark, traffic controllers who cannot talk to planes, technology that is seemingly working no better than tin cans, they do not think this is a story about the Trump administration's FAA, but that is what is so scary: this story is real and this story is dangerous. This situation is also unacceptable,"" Schumer said in a statement on Sunday.

""I have communicated this past week with the FAA, and I feel no better today than a week ago about the state of aviation safety since this administration took the controls at FAA. As I said last week, Newark is a harbinger. If this dangerous situation can happen in the metro region, imagine what might happen in places where there is less scrutiny. This really makes you worry.""

On Thursday, more than 500 flights in and out of Newark were delayed and at least 200 others were canceled, and chaos followed throughout the weekend.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the situation on poor technology in an X post.

""The technology that we are using is old. That's what is causing the outages and delays we are seeing at Newark,"" Duffy wrote.

Schumer stated there have been an average of 34 arrival cancellations per day since mid-April at Newark, according to the FAA, with the number of delays increasing throughout the day from an average of five in the mornings to 16 by the evening. They tend to last 85 to 137 minutes on average, reports say.

On Sunday, Schumer said Duffy ""must put Newark first in line for fixes he said would be made to the nation's ATC systems."" 

He also gave specific details about the work that needs to be done, including installing a DIRECT fiber-optic telco line between Newark Airport and Philadelphia terminal radar approach control center, no more indirect runaround. Schumer called for a ""modernized, direct connection and new computers to analyze and display transmitted data.""

In a lengthy statement obtained by Fox News and Fox Business, the FAA acknowledged that ""several major airlines are facing ongoing flight disruptions at New Jersey's Newark-Liberty International Airport as the facility contends with ongoing staffing and technology issues.""

""Last week, air traffic controllers at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facility in Philadelphia lost radar and radio signals while directing planes to Newark for nearly 90 seconds, causing significant delays and flight cancellations that remain ongoing,"" the statement continued.

""We are working to ensure the current telecommunications equipment is more reliable in the New York area by establishing a more resilient and redundant configuration with the local exchange carriers. In addition, we are updating our automation system to improve resiliency.""

When reached by Fox News Digital, a representative for Duffy pointed to an interview the secretary gave earlier in the day to FOX Business' ""The Evening Edit.""

""I love Democrats who are now all concerned about air traffic control,"" Duffy said. 

""They spent $1.2 trillion in the Biden-Buttigieg era; $1 .2 trillion on American infrastructure, and they didn't spend anything on air traffic [control] and they knew it was getting old and needed a massive rebuild. They didn't do it. Now they're complaining during the Trump administration, we're the ones that are.""

Singer-songwriter John Ondrasik, also known as Five for Fighting, joins 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss how he adjusted the lyrics of 'Superman' to pay tribute to the hostages still being held in Gaza. 

President Donald Trump confirmed that the last living American hostage, Edan Alexander, would be released by Hamas after nearly two years in captivity.

""I am happy to announce that Edan Alexander, an American citizen who has been held hostage since October 2023, is coming home to his family,"" Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform ‘Truth Social' on Sunday.

""I am grateful to all those involved in making this monumental news happen. This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,"" Trump continued.  

""Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. I look very much forward to that day of celebration!""

HAMAS CLAIMS IT WILL RELEASE AMERICAN HOSTAGE EDAN ALEXANDER

The news comes after the terror organization announced on Sunday it was ""in contact with the U.S. administration in recent days.""

""The movement has shown a high level of positivity, and the Israeli soldier with dual American citizenship, [Edan] Alexander, will be released as part of the steps being taken toward a ceasefire, the opening of border crossings, and the entry of aid and relief for our people in the Gaza Strip,"" the statement read. 

Vice President JD Vance also commented on the announcement, writing: ""Pray that Hamas follows through and Edan gets to come home.""

""If they do, it will have been another triumph of Steve Witkoff, who continues to face withering attacks for freeing hostages, negotiating complex diplomatic proposals, and serving his country (at great financial cost),"" Vance wrote in a post on X. 

It's unclear when Alexander will be released.

The Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters also released a statement following the announcement of Alexander's release, saying that they ""are embracing and supporting the Alexander family.""

""Should this release be confirmed, the release of Edan Alexander must mark the beginning of a comprehensive agreement that will secure the freedom of all remaining hostages,"" the statement read. 

""President Trump, you've given the families of all the hostages hope. Please, complete your mission and bring them all home."" 

Trump recently marked his 100th day in office, and the families of the five Americans still held hostage urged him to reflect on his strategy and apply pressure on both Israel and Hamas, through both economic and diplomatic means, to secure the release of all hostages.

In addition, fifty members of Congress sent Trump a letter on May 9 urging him to prioritize getting the remaining hostages out.

HAMAS AGREES TO RELEASE EDAN ALEXANDER, THE LAST LIVING AMERICAN HOSTAGE

""As months have passed since the most recent exchange, we must keep the five remaining Americans and additional 54 hostages top of mind. The five American hostages include Edan Alexander, Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai. Only Alexander is believed to be alive while Nuetra, Chen, Haggai and Weinstein Haggai were either murdered on October 7th or in captivity,"" the group wrote in a letter to President Trump.

""Our government's most solemn responsibility is to keep Americans safe. With that responsibility in mind, we urge you to use all diplomatic tools at your disposal, in concert with our regional allies and partners, to ensure Edan's release and the release of the remains of the deceased American hostages as soon as possible. Every day in captivity adds to the nightmare for the hostages and their families. We must bring them home now,"" the letter continued. 

Raised in Tenafly, New Jersey, Alexander moved to Israel at 18 to volunteer for military service in the IDF's Golani Brigade. He lived with his grandparents in Tel Aviv and at Kibbutz Hazor, where he was part of a group of lone soldiers.

He was kidnapped on the morning of October 7 — a Saturday, he wasn't required to remain on base. His mother was visiting from abroad, and like many lone soldiers, he had the option to go home for the weekend. But he chose to stay, not wanting to leave his comrades short-staffed on guard duty.

There are 59 hostages still in Gaza, at least 24 of whom are assessed to be alive, including Alexander, now 21 years old after having spent two birthdays in Hamas captivity.

EXCLUSIVE – ALCATRAZ ISLAND, California — Bill Baker was only 23 when he was handcuffed, shackled, and thrown on the back of a boat headed for Alcatraz, the infamous federal penitentiary reserved for the worst of the worst in the country.

Back then, he was known only as Inmate No. 1259. Today, at 91 years old, he's ready to discuss his time on “The Rock.”

Baker's story began on a cold and foggy morning in January 1957. He wore a standard-issue shirt and pants three sizes too big for his frame.

“I was scared s***less,” he told the Washington Examiner.

Born in Kentucky during the Great Depression, Baker spent most of his life in and out of federal prison for cashing bad checks. He got criminally good at escaping, so he was sent to the one place no one had escaped from to finish the final three years of his sentence.

More than half a century later, Baker is back at Alcatraz. This time, voluntarily.

“It doesn't bother me,” he said. “The wardens are all dead. I survived, so this is my turf now.”

Baker is believed to be one of the last living inmates of Alcatraz. He has harrowing tales about the time he tried to escape (he got caught), the spaghetti he still dreams about (“they knew how to feed us!”), and the “little home brew” the inmates got drunk on occasionally.

He and the other prisoners walked the yard, talking about their families and planning future bank robberies. If there was a lesson to be learned at Alcatraz about the consequences of breaking the law, it was lost on Baker. After he left Alcatraz, he spent the next five decades “dabbling in the counterfeit world.”

Baker's a relic now, put out to pasture and no longer a threat, he joked to the Washington Examiner.

“I am a reminder of a time that once was,” he said.

For nearly three decades, the prison off the coast of San Francisco housed some of the most notorious criminals in U.S. history, including gangster Al Capone, George “Machine Gun Kelly” Barnes, and  Robert Stroud, who was better known as the “Birdman of Alcatraz.”

The prison opened on July 1, 1934, and closed 28 years later on March 21, 1963. Since then, the National Park Service has turned it into a museum. A trip to Alcatraz is among the top three “must-see” things for visitors to San Francisco. It's a huge driver of tourism and has kitschy jail-themed souvenirs that include everything from life-size replicas of jail cell keys to shot glasses with a prisoner at the bottom trying to get out.

Boatloads of tourists ferry in every half hour, taking self-guided audio tours of the tiny prison cells and learning about the gangsters, murderers, and thieves who, like Baker, once called it home.

Everything about the trip to the former federal penitentiary feels surreal, from the long lines to get on board the Alcatraz Cruises ferry from Pier 33 to the sign reading “Sip a Mimosa” for $11 on board. The snack stand, which sells $6 PB&J sandwiches, has vegan options, such as tahini/chickpea hummus on a whole wheat wrap for $11.25. There's also a charging station for phones, bathrooms, and spectacular views of the island, bay, and San Francisco skyline. On board the 15-minute ride is usually a mix of international tourists, TikTokkers, armchair historians, and schoolchildren.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT ALCATRAZ, THE CALIFORNIA PRISON TRUMP WANTS TO REOPEN

“I thought there would be more people here,” Juan Flores told the Washington Examiner. Flores made the 2 1/2-hour drive from Sacramento for the excursion. He brought his son Carlos, a sixth grader.

Flores said they purchased tickets online after hearing President Donald Trump wanted to reopen the dilapidated prison.

“I don't know if he was serious or not, but I took off work to come today,” he said. “We thought this might be our last chance.”

Trump recently issued the stunning directive to the Federal Bureau of Prisons to “REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ!”

Even though the Bureau of Prisons has been struggling with short staffing, chronic violence, and crumbling infrastructure at its current facilities, Trump said he's counting on the agency to fulfill his vision of rebooting the prison that has become the subject of many books and movies.

Most people who heard the news, such as Michael Seagman, a tourist from Canada, thought Trump was joking. But the president, as he often does, stood firm, disregarding the prison's outdated technology and the very reason then-U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy chose to close it in the first place: It was too costly to maintain and operate.

In a post to Truth Social, Trump wrote, “For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering. When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That's the way it's supposed to be.”

“That is why, today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders,” he wrote.

The president's push to reopen Alcatraz didn't seem rooted in reality, Baker said. “No one's opening this place,” he said. “Look at it.”

The cell blocks are now three tiers of faded yellow and green cells with peeling paint and rust on the bars. The toilets are mostly cracked and hollowed out, though some have bricks clogging them. Most cells have chunks of concrete missing, the plumbing doesn't work, the beds are bent metal frames, and wires come out of fireplaces for the officers. None of the equipment works, and most structures are missing simple things such as walls or a roof.

Then, there's the bird excrement, something visitors smell before they see. Droppings coat buildings, walkways, and the roads. They're everywhere. The island's rocky habitat and isolation from mainland predators make it bird heaven and poop hell for those stuck on it.

Saying Alcatraz needs an upgrade is a gross understatement.

It would need the renovation of a century, something that would not only take millions of dollars but also a lot of time.

California lawmakers, from both parties, have laughed off Trump's proposal. 

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), whose district includes Alcatraz, called the president's plan “not a serious one.”

“Alcatraz closed as a federal penitentiary more than sixty years ago. It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction. The President's proposal is not a serious one,” she wrote on X.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) said he was taking it “just as seriously as I'm taking the suggestion that he's gonna make Canada the 51st state,” while Rep. Jay Obernolte (R-CA) simply said, “Whatever. What-ever. He says a lot of things.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The House GOP has released its plan to cut Medicaid spending, with the most significant changes affecting eligibility requirements and how states can finance Medicaid. However, some of the biggest sticking points were left out of the bill, including changes to per-capita caps on federal Medicaid payments to states. 

“Undoubtedly, Democrats will use this as an opportunity to engage in fear-mongering and misrepresent our bill as an attack on Medicaid,” House and Energy Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY) wrote in the Wall Street Journal. “In reality, it preserves and strengthens Medicaid for children, mothers, people with disabilities and the elderly — for whom the program was designed.”

President Donald Trump and House Republicans hope to cut $4.5 trillion in government spending to help finance tax cuts. The Energy and Commerce Committee has been tasked with finding $880 billion in savings, with many of the cuts expected to come from Medicaid changes. This has worried some centrist Republicans, who sent a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) last week about their concerns over Medicaid cuts. The bill released Sunday night avoids the most touchy issues for blue-state Republicans, with Guthrie billing it as a “common sense” solution. 

The plan would institute work requirements for able-bodied people on Medicaid. Recipients between 19 and 64, with exceptions for pregnant women and those on disability, would be required to work 80 hours per month to receive benefits. Currently, there is no federal work requirement, though Georgia has a state mandate. 

Recipients must also verify their eligibility for Medicaid twice a year. They are currently required to verify only once a year. Critics have warned that this could pose a challenge for those who live far from Medicaid offices. If they cannot verify their status in time, they could lose their benefits. However, Republicans said recipients who can prove they are meeting the work requirements are guaranteed coverage. 

Democrats immediately requested a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which found that 8.6 million beneficiaries could lose coverage in the next decade under the House GOP's plan. 

The plan would also change how states and the federal government contribute to Medicaid. As of 2023, the federal government paid about 70% of the total costs of Medicaid. The GOP's markup will freeze provider taxes, which are the nonfederal portion of Medicaid funding that states pull in from healthcare provider taxes. A congressional report from December 2024 identified pausing or ending states' use of provider funds as a way to cut federal costs, and Republicans have sold it as a way to cut down on abuse. 

Even top Democrats, such as former President Barack Obama, have gone after states' reliance on provider taxes. States are only allowed to levy 6% of a provider's income, taxing both those on and off Medicaid. However, Republicans did not seek to peel back provider taxes already put in place. 

The federal government will also require states to verify citizenship or visa status for Medicaid recipients. States that fail to do so will be barred from receiving federal Medicaid dollars. In New York, it was reported that 480,000 illegal immigrants were enrolled in “emergency Medicaid” in 2024.

Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the United States that also provides general women's healthcare, will see cuts to the amount of federal funding it receives. The GOP is seeking to bar federal dollars from being used for gender-related treatment and surgeries. 

However, Republicans decided to leave off the implementation of per-capita caps on Medicaid payments to states. This was posed as a possibility for the federal government to cut spending, but some Republican members were wary of it. If implemented, a per-capita cap would set a federal limit per beneficiary instead of how it currently stands, in which the government pays a fixed share, but it's an open-ended entitlement.

TWO KEY HOUSE COMMITTEES GEAR UP FOR HEATED HEARINGS TO PASS TRUMP MEGA BILL

While Guthrie and House Republicans seek to strike a balanced deal, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, called the Republicans' plan “shameful,” saying it will cause hospitals to close.

“In no uncertain terms, millions of Americans will lose their healthcare coverage,” Pallone said. “Seniors will not be able to access the care they need, and premiums will rise for millions of people if this bill passes.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Democratic senator unveils plan to tackle immigration reform and border security","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3407599/democratic-senator-plan-tackle-immigration-reform-border-security/","Mon, 12 May 2025 08:30:00 GMT","

A Democratic senator who represents a southern border state moved to push lawmakers to address immigration reform and border security with a plan that he hopes can please both Democrats and Republicans.

Four months into his first term, Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) introduced a framework on Monday that addresses the “broken” state of America's border and brings illegal immigrants “out of the shadows,” known as “Securing the Border and Fueling Economic Prosperity.”

“We don't have to choose between border security and immigration reform,” Gallego said in a statement. “We can and should do both. Americans deserve the right to feel safe and know their border is secure, but for decades, Congress has tried and failed to take action because politics got in the way. It's time to push forward and enact a plan that works.”

Gallego's plan is not a bill and is meant to serve as guidance for lawmakers. It includes five pillars for any legislation on the two interrelated issues.

First, an unspecified number of Border Patrol agents should be funded by Congress and hired, and ports of entry where cargo, people, and vehicles are inspected must receive improvements, including drug detection technology.

Second, the asylum process should be addressed in a way that ends abuse of bogus claims and speeds up the yearslong court process while treating asylum-seekers with “dignity and respect,” Gallego's plan states.

Legal immigration avenues should be expanded to grow the U.S. economy while still protecting American workers.

Dreamers, or people who were brought into the United States illegally as children, should be given a pathway to citizenship, as well as “long-term” illegal immigrants who contribute to the community.

“We must do right by these communities by giving them their shot at the American dream so they can prosper in the country that has provided so much to families like mine,” Gallego said. “My mom, an immigrant who raised us on her own, worked hard to provide for me and my three sisters. I saw firsthand what it means to sacrifice, to struggle, and to fight for a better future. It's a fight that millions of immigrants in this country understand. But many of them live in the shadows.”

Finally, other countries should do “their fair share” to resettle asylum-seekers and receive help from the U.S. to address drug cartels, economic problems, and instability.

Immigration reform has not been successfully attempted since the mid-1990s. In 2013, eight senators, known as the “Gang of Eight,” attempted to pass comprehensive legislation. Last year, three senators proposed a bipartisan border bill, but Republicans refused to back it.

U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION EMPLOYEES TOLD NOT TO USE DEI TERMS

Since President Donald Trump began his second term, the southern border has seen the lowest number of illegal immigrant arrests per month since the late 1960s.

Gallego, elected to the Senate last year in purple Arizona, is seen as a possible 2028 presidential contender for his appeal to working-class, independent, and Latino voters.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

If you are one of the many people who have cut the cable cord, you may have noticed it is now difficult to enjoy the cable industry's greatest gift to our democracy: C-SPAN. Despite repeated pressure, the largest streaming alternatives to cable television, YouTube TV, Hulu, and Fubo, are all still refusing to carry the channels. C-SPAN is a volunteer gift to the public from corporate America, and we do not want to change that. But we do encourage the streaming services to rethink their decision for the good of the country.

The exact details of how the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network, which was created by journalist Brian Lamb as a nonprofit organization in 1979, is funded are a trade secret, but essentially, each cable company pays a certain amount every year based on how many subscribers they have. C-SPAN first started with gavel-to-gavel coverage of the House of Representatives, then the Senate with C-SPAN2. Now it offers a wide range of public policy coverage and original programming both on C-SPAN3 and online.

Unlike its cable television funders, C-SPAN has somehow always maintained a true objective reporting standard, making it must-see viewing whenever either chamber of Congress is in session. Additionally, as a nonprofit entity, C-SPAN is commercial-free, thus allowing for uninterrupted coverage.

At its peak, approximately 100 million households had access to C-SPAN through either their cable or satellite television provider. But as millions of people have ended their cable or satellite subscriptions, far fewer households now access C-SPAN. The tens of millions of people who now rely on streaming services for their news are left without a C-SPAN option.

In response to criticism from consumers and lawmakers for not adding C-SPAN to their offered channels, YouTube TV correctly points out that much of C-SPAN's content is already available on its YouTube page. While this is technically true, the clips available on C-SPAN's YouTube channel are not live and are generally shorter in nature than the full-length, gavel-to-gavel coverage offered on C-SPAN.

C-SPAN also cannot offer its live coverage for free because that would undercut its existing funding from the cable and satellite providers. There is not enough interest in C-SPAN to justify adding it to its list of channels, according to YouTube TV, but considering the $350 billion in revenue YouTube TV's parent company, Alphabet, pulled in last year, paying a couple of cents per YouTube TV subscriber doesn't seem like a prohibitive expense, especially when YouTube TV's cable and satellite competitors are already paying it, as they have been for decades.

We recognize that while Alphabet's revenues are impressive, it is not a charity. However, considering that Alphabet's mission statement is “to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,” making what is happening in the House and Senate immediately available to as many people as possible should fall within that goal.

THE ART OF SELF-DEPORTATION

There simply is no other organization that offers as comprehensive a package of government proceedings as C-SPAN, including not just congressional floor debates but also congressional hearings, press conferences, federal agency announcements, Supreme Court oral arguments, and even campaign events.

Considering how much criticism Alphabet already takes for eating up online ad revenues without contributing anything to news production, adding C-SPAN to its YouTube TV lineup should be an easy choice.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A new initiative will necessitate that the Trump administration makes difficult judgment calls about the faith.

During his campaign, Donald Trump told Christian supporters that if he became president, they would never have to vote again, because “we'll have it fixed so good.” Now he's trying to follow through on his promise by establishing a task force charged with “eradicating anti-Christian bias.” But Christians shouldn't conclude that this new commission will necessarily defend their interests, let alone fix it “so good.” Eliminating anti-Christian bias will require the task force (and thereby the government) to rule on what exactly constitutes authentic Christian belief and practice—not a straightforward determination to make, nor one that should be entrusted to the Trump administration.

The executive order creating the task force cites a multitude of examples of what the Trump administration considers to be unacceptable discrimination against Christians, including Biden-era prosecutions of Christian anti-abortion protesters under the Freedom to Access Clinic Entrances Act, the promulgation of a (later retracted) FBI memo referring to radical traditionalist Christians as a potential domestic-terrorism threat, and the designation of Easter Sunday of 2024 as the year's Transgender Day of Visibility.

Conservative Christians may generally agree with Trump's characterization of those episodes. But determining the authentically Christian perspective on an issue is not always a simple task. Was the Westboro Baptist Church, a Christian group that spent decades picketing the funerals of LGBTQ people and members of the armed forces, justified in stomping on American flags and heckling crowds of mourners in the name of Christ? The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the group at one point and declined to even entertain its argument at another. Or consider the case of an Episcopalian church in Sacramento whose rainbow Pride flag was stolen and burned: Would this task force agree that the attack was an act of aggression against the congregation qua Christians? The church's priest certainly thought so. To what authority would this task force appeal in order to prove otherwise? Tradition, scripture, the majority opinion of the faithful? Even the most learned Christians disagree on how to derive religious authority, and I doubt this task force will finally settle the debate.

From the February 2025 issue: The army of God comes out of the shadows

This is not a strictly academic point. As part of carrying out the task force's mandate, Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Douglas Collins sent a memo to staff asking them to report instances of anti-Christian discrimination—which included, among other things, “adverse responses to requests for religious exemption under the previous vaccine mandates.” In this case, the state seems to have decided that Christians have legitimate reason to request exemptions from vaccine mandates.

But I would contend that vaccines aren't excluded by genuine Christian ethics, and that these Christian objectors are mistaken in their understanding of the faith. By permitting Christians to obtain vaccine-mandate exemptions, the state is not only misconstruing Christianity, but also causing a great deal of harm—a multistate measles outbreak, for instance, has caused three deaths this year and is still spreading. Vaccine mandates are crucial in preventing such occurrences, and Christians should be particularly willing to offer some small sacrifice for the good of others. That principle is at the heart of the faith.

Nor has this administration been friendly to legitimate Christian belief and practice that runs afoul of its politics. Earlier this year, Vice President J. D. Vance bickered with American bishops over major funding cuts to organizations that aid migrants and refugees, contending that their interest was in making money, not in practicing Christianity faithfully. Pope Francis indirectly chastised Vance in a letter written a few weeks before the pope's death, but it doesn't seem that Vance was moved to change his mind. One wonders what the vice president has to say about the recent arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan, who allegedly helped an undocumented man evade arrest by government agents and who also served as the executive director of a branch of Catholic Charities. Was this possibly an example of anti-Christian bias directed at a person practicing the kind of mercy counseled by the late pope?

Luis Parrales: What the border-hawk Catholics get wrong

But the task force is just one element of a broader project to recapture political and cultural ground that Christianity has lost over the past several decades. The litany of examples supplied as justification for the task force's creation generally fit under the rubric of frustrating compromises with liberalism—in the classical sense, as related to the country's founding: liberty, equality, and freedom of conscience—something Trump alluded to during a celebration of National Prayer Day in the Rose Garden. “They say separation between Church and state,” he remarked. “I said, ‘All right, let's forget about that for one time,'” adding, “We're bringing religion back to our country, and it's a big deal.” Liberalism engenders religious tolerance in part by domesticating religion, and some number of Christians long for wilder and fiercer expressions of the faith than are generally on offer within a liberal framework.

There was a time when American Christianity and the liberal state were less frequently in conflict because Christianity was so overwhelmingly dominant in society. But the recent decline of Christianity has changed that. In 1980, more than 90 percent of Americans identified themselves as Christian; today, only 62 percent say they're followers of Christ. And though recent research suggests that the long-term decrease in Christian affiliation may have halted, the story of the past half century of American Christianity must be read through the lens of these gradual losses and their consequences. The faith no longer has the near-total sociocultural hegemony over American life that it once enjoyed; largely gone are the days of routine prayers and Bible readings in public schools, the suspension of commerce on Sundays, and the broad assumption that whoever you happen to meet will almost certainly be Christian.

There are pains associated with Christianity's gradual transformation from a monopolizing cultural force into just one offering on an extended religious menu—though still a preeminent offering, at least for now. It's not surprising, therefore, that the Christians coalescing around Trump want to make American Christianity great again. If the task force's mandate of mere fairness is essentially a pretext for persecuting perceived enemies of the faith, then its real purpose is to restore this past vision of American Christian dominance.

That's not to say that the task force won't also address instances of genuine bias toward Christians. Anti-Christian incidents are real: Attacks and vandalism on Catholic churches, for example, appear to be at an all-time high; hundreds of incidents were reported across the country in 2023, though authorities have at times been reluctant to concede that prejudice was a factor. These episodes are understandably aggravating to Christians, and many may therefore see this task force as a welcome intervention, and a matter of fairness in principle: If other groups are entitled to systematic efforts to root out prejudice toward them, the thinking goes, then why not Christians as well?

Perhaps that's the irony of this new task force: Nobody appears to view Christianity as just another interest group as much as Donald Trump, who was overtly indifferent to religion until it became clear to him that Christians represented a bloc to pick up with typical political pandering—and pandering works. But Christians should as a rule be skeptical of versions of the faith that are informed overly much by partisan politics, which always have something other than Jesus at their core.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

America's most powerful legal organization confronts Trump's incompetence.

by  Ian Millhiser

Few organizations have profited as handsomely off of President Donald Trump's rise to power as the Federalist Society, a kind of bar association for right-wing lawyers. 

“We're going to have great judges, conservative, all picked by the Federalist Society,” Trump announced during his first campaign for president — and boy did he deliver. Trump spent his first term filling the bench, including three seats on the Supreme Court, with the society's luminaries.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

And yet, at a Federalist Society gathering last Wednesday, which focused on the executive branch of the federal government, both the speakers and attendees seemed far more ambivalent about their president's second term than one might expect after such a fruitful partnership. 

To be sure, few speakers criticized Trump's policies — except for his tariffs, which several attacked quite directly. But many were quite troubled by what speaker Susan Dudley, an expert on regulatory policy at George Washington University, labeled “the chaos.” 

That chaos, the society's speakers warned, could lead to Trump's second term becoming a missed opportunity, with a once in a generation chance for deregulation squandered through sheer ineptitude. “They are going to have the same level of success they had in the last administration” with getting rid of long-standing rules and regulations, George Washington University law professor Richard Pierce told the conference, “which is virtually none.”

Implicit in this critique is a belief that the web of procedural barriers, bureaucratic trap doors, and paperwork burdens that prevent any presidential administration from changing too much, too fast will survive the second Trump administration more or less unscathed. Pierce predicted that many of Trump's deregulatory efforts would simply be struck down in court.

Under current law, he explained, changing regulations “requires really hard work by a whole bunch of people who know what they are doing.” But it's hard for that work to get done when the bureaucrats who know how to do it have just been fired by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.

Indeed, some of the conferences' speakers didn't just appear to view DOGE as an obstacle to making lasting progress on conservative deregulatory goals, they also seemed to want to roll back Trump's power. Some appeared just as eager to strip power from Trump as you might find at a conference of Democratic lawyers, albeit for reasons Democrats would likely find distasteful. 

For more than a decade, the Federalist Society has elevated arguments that the judiciary (especially if that judiciary is controlled, as it is currently, by Society allies) should wield powers typically enjoyed by the executive branch. Based on Wednesday's conference, the society appears just as committed to judicial supremacy as it was when the White House was controlled by Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama.

Nowhere was this argument made more forcefully than in discussions over Trump's tariffs. Broadly speaking, there are three ways that the courts could strike down Trump's tariffs. They could issue a narrow decision holding that the statute Trump relied on to impose them does not permit him to do so. They could strike them down under the “major questions doctrine,” a new legal framework that the Supreme Court used to sabotage some Biden era policies. Or they could strike them down under the “nondelegation” doctrine, a largely defunct legal concept that would give the judiciary sweeping veto power over any policy created by the executive branch.

So it's notable that the panel on whether the tariffs are legal fixated on the nondelegation theory, with the two other arguments only coming up as afterthoughts. Rather than pushing a modest legal argument against the one Trump policy many society members appear to find objectionable, the panel largely discussed whether to use the tariffs as a vehicle to advance the broader fight to take power from the executive and reallocate it to a judiciary full of the Federalist Society's friends and allies.

To be clear, nothing that happened at the Wednesday conference suggests that the Federalist Society is ready to join the #resistance — it's only been a few months, after all, since the justices most closely affiliated with the society voted as a bloc to allow Trump to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes. But the event did suggest that there is some daylight between Trump's vision for the executive branch and that of the sort of people he placed on the bench. And that might present real problems for Trump, especially when his goals do not align with the conservative movement's traditional free market views.

Kristine Simmons is a former Republican Senate staffer and domestic policy adviser to President George W. Bush, but she opened the Federalist Society's panel on “DOGE and the Future of the Federal Workforce” with a line that could easily have been uttered by the president of a federal workers' union: “The American people are truly blessed to have a professional civil service that provides stability in times of transition.”

She said this to introduce a fairly comprehensive critique of how the federal government hires and manages its workforce. Federal employees are “too old,” she said. It is too hard to hire them, too hard to reward good employees, too hard to “deal with poor performers,” and many federal supervisors lack the management skills they need to get the best work out of their workers.

Her primary message to the Federalist Society, however, was that DOGE — the Musk-driven initiative that was supposed to make the government more effective and efficient — has only made these problems with the federal workforce worse. 

By targeting probationary employees, new hires who can more easily be terminated before civil service protections kick in, Simmons warned that DOGE severed far too many young workers with “needed technology skills.”

DOGE rescinded job offers for federal employees who agreed to enter into public service in return for a government-funded graduate degree — after the government had already paid for that education. Meanwhile, she asserted, many of the workers choosing to accept DOGE's efforts to push them out of the federal workforce are “top performers,” an unsurprising outcome since the best employees will have more job prospects elsewhere.

The Trump administration has, at times, stated directly that moving the best workers out of government is one of their goals — shortly after Trump took office, the White House sent an email to federal employees telling them “the way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.” But many Federalist Society speakers warned that this approach would sabotage conservative policy objectives.

If Trump won't work with Congress, any marginal organizational or ideological reforms achieved by his White House could evaporate the minute he leaves office.

While the executive branch has considerable power to make policy, it typically can only do so after an extraordinary amount of work. To change or repeal a federal regulation, for example, the government normally must solicit input from outside stakeholders, respond to that input, and explain why it decided to shift course. And the courts can scrap major policy initiatives over bureaucratic errors. 

In the first Trump administration, for example, the Supreme Court struck down Trump's attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows hundreds of thousands of immigrants to live and work in the United States, over a paperwork error.

If it's willing to do the hard work of policy analysis and exposition, a presidential administration can achieve a great deal of change over time, but it can't do that without a workforce that is ready and able to do this labor. As Bridget Dooling, a former White House lawyer and law professor, told the society, “laying off, demoralizing, and immiserating the civil servants who work in the federal agencies reduces the capacity to write these reasoned explanations.” And that means that current policy remains locked in place.

Trump's efforts to “drain the swamp” by eliminating federal employees who may not share the administration's policy goals risks doing more to undermine those goals than simply leaving civil servants, even those who are left-leaning views, in place. A civil servant might drag their feet if ordered to help repeal a federal regulation, but the least productive government workers are the ones who no longer have their jobs at all.

Meanwhile, several speakers described a mismanaged, directionless workforce. Pierce relayed a message from his daughter, a civil servant: “Nobody's doing nothing because we can't figure out what the hell we're supposed to do.” In the second Trump administration, federal workers “don't know who is still an employee,” they “don't know what the mission is,” and, in the case of Pierce's daughter, “she's on her fourth boss in three months.”

Pro-DOGE voices were present at the conference, though they faced sharp critique. Rather than attempting to remake the civil service through executive action, the critiques ran, Trump would be wise to attempt to work with Congress to make lasting changes to the administrative state.

So, while the Federalist Society's voices appeared very sympathetic to the broader projects of weakening civil service protections and redirecting government workers toward conservative movement goals, they described an administration that was ill-suited to this task. DOGE, they warned, is firing or disabling the very workers who are needed to shift policy. And, if Trump won't work with Congress, any marginal organizational or ideological reforms achieved by his White House could evaporate the minute he leaves office. Trump, in other words, should focus more on lasting, effective policymaking and less on performative changes.

Despite these concerns that this administration will be a missed opportunity for conservatives, there's little reason to doubt that the Federalist Society's partnership with Trump will continue to bear fruit. 

The conference closed, for example, with a keynote speech by Harmeet Dhillon, a longtime Federalist Society member who Trump recently appointed to lead the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. Dhillon spoke with pride about her efforts to shift that office away from traditional civil rights work and toward Republican goals such as ending affirmative action and barring transgender women from school-sponsored sports. She also described DOJ as the “biggest law firm in America,” and is undoubtedly correct that the federal government can play a huge role in shifting the law to the right simply because it has so many resources at its disposal.

But the society also seemed to want far more than Dhillon could offer them. Many of its members were clearly keen to seize even more power for themselves and their judges — even if that means severely weakening the Trump presidency.

The one Trump policy that many Federalist Society speakers expressed deep concerns about on the merits is his trade war — Pierce labeled the tariffs “madness” because businesses cannot make investment decisions when “the tariff's 120 percent today, might be 200 percent tomorrow, might be zero tomorrow.” At a panel focused on the tariffs, two speakers opposed them and only one attempted to defend their legality. Meanwhile Elizabeth Slattery, the panel's moderator, identified herself as a lawyer with an conservative legal shop that is suing Trump over the tariffs.

But the bulk of this panel's discussion of the tariffs was an extraordinarily baroque debate between two lawyers about whether the tariffs violate the “nondelegation” doctrine, a long-defunct legal theory that the Supreme Court has only relied upon twice in its history (both times in 1935). The strongest legal arguments against the tariffs — the claim that Trump lacks the statutory authority to implement them, and the claim that it violates the Supreme Court's recently created “major questions doctrine” — only came up as afterthoughts.

If you've followed the politics surrounding separation of powers closely, this focus isn't surprising. Since the Obama administration, the Federalist Society has touted numerous proposals to weaken the executive branch's ability to set policy, and to shift power away from the executive and towards the judiciary — the branch that the Federalist Society most firmly controls. 

The nondelegation doctrine claims that judges have sweeping authority to veto executive branch actions that those judges do not like. So, if the tariffs are struck down on nondelegation grounds, that wouldn't just eliminate a single policy that many Federalist Society members appear to regard as unwise, it would give the society's judges and justices broad and lasting authority to sabotage future presidential administrations.

While many businesses look at the tariffs and see a president out of control, in other words, the Federalist Society appears to see an opportunity to consolidate its own power at President Trump's expense -- and at the expense of Trump's successors.

Similarly, the conference's lunch panel featured an evenly matched debate about nationwide injunctions, lower court orders which put a federal policy on hold throughout the entire country. The Justice Department, under both the Biden and Trump administrations, staunchly opposes these broad orders, which sometimes permit a single outlier judge to determine national policy for months at a time. And the Supreme Court will hear a case on May 15 that could potentially limit or even eliminate these nationwide orders.

But the panel featured a serious conversation over whether judges should have this power, rather than statements of fealty to Trump's position. Many audience members also seemed troubled by Trump's anti-injunction stance — at lunch, I sat between two lawyers who often challenge federal laws in court, and who don't want to lose the ability to obtain nationwide injunctions against those laws.

There's no doubt that the Federalist Society's leading lights are thrilled to have a Republican back in the White House, and the society is likely to spend the next three-and-a-half-years watching Trump turn many of its most MAGA-aligned members into judges. But it was often hard to escape the impression that they would be happier if a more methodical Republican — perhaps a Nikki Haley — occupied the Oval Office. As several speakers argued, the sheer goonishness of Trump's approach to governance may leave movement conservatives with few lasting victories after he's no longer president.

Nor is the Society likely to be content as mere coalition partners in a MAGA movement led by figures like Trump. It wants to shape major policy decisions, and perhaps to move in a more market-oriented direction than Trump would prefer, and so is working to consolidate power within the judiciary it dominates.

Israel has a horrifying new plan for “the concluding moves” of the Gaza war. Yet it's flying under the American radar.

by  Zack Beauchamp

Israel's war in Gaza, which has long been a moral atrocity, is on the brink of becoming unimaginably worse.

Earlier this month, Israel's security cabinet approved a plan that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as “the concluding moves” of the war in Gaza. Called “Gideon's Chariots,” the operation's plan calls for the mass destruction of remaining buildings in Gaza and the “conquest” of much of the Strip by Israel.

The more than 2 million Palestinian civilians would be given a choice: Live indefinitely in a tiny “humanitarian area,” or else leave the Strip for some third country. At least one high-level Israeli official, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has openly proclaimed that the purpose of this policy is to inflict so much suffering that Palestinians are effectively forced to make the latter choice — a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.

“Within a few months…Gaza will be totally destroyed,” Smotrich said on May 6. Civilians “will be totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza, and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places.” 

The situation in Gaza is already beyond dire: An Israeli blockade on foreign aid has left children starving. Were Israel to do what Smotrich is describing, the consequences would be untold death and suffering. 

“[My organization] has not used the term genocide before. We do now,” says Matt Duss, the executive vice president at the Center for International Policy think tank.

Since the start of the war, the US has done too little to change the dynamic on the ground. The Trump administration has demonstrated no interest in helping Palestinians and has (per Axios' Barak Ravid) “effectively given Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a green light to do as he sees fit.” Trump himself has suggested removing the Palestinian population from Gaza and sending them to nearby Arab states.

There is still time to change the war's course. Israel has its own reasons for not going through with this kind of maximalist assault, and Trump has previously demonstrated a willingness to push Israel toward a ceasefire if the politics favor it.

But Israel's plans are unfolding during a moment when many in the United States have stopped paying attention to the carnage in Gaza — perhaps fatigued by the war's endless horrors, perhaps distracted by the dire political situation at home.

This, however, is the worst possible time to look away. What Israel is promising is not yet another round of fighting, but a criminal escalation of a morally abhorrent war.

It's important to be clear on the stakes here: We are at a narrow moment in time in which the fate of the Palestinian people in Gaza could be decided. 

The Israeli military has postponed any implementation of Gideon's Chariots until after Trump's Middle East trip this week; there is a window (if perhaps a shrinking one) to convince the Israeli government not to follow through. In fact, a senior Israeli security official told CNN explicitly that this postponement is designed to “provide a window of opportunity” for a hostages-for-negotiated-ceasefire deal.

Experts like Ilan Goldenberg, a high-level Middle East official in the Biden administration, think there's a real chance Israel doesn't truly want to go through with this plan. “The hope is that it is a threat to apply pressure on Hamas to let out hostages,” he tells me.

“[My organization] has not used the term genocide before. We do now.”

This hope is not rooted in a sense of Israeli nobility, but rather a calculation of its self-interest. 

“On top of the horrific consequences for civilians in Gaza, it's unlikely to actually eliminate Hamas and will come at a great cost to Israel,” Goldenberg, who is currently the chief policy officer at the center-left J Street lobby, says. “If they don't have a ‘hold force' with some legitimacy amongst Palestinians, it will all be for naught and Hamas will just go underground and fight an insurgency.” 

Yehuda Shaul, the co-director of Israel's Ofek think tank, also believes the Israeli government has not yet itself decided on how far it is willing to go. However, he warns, the “trajectory” is grim — due in part to the political balance of Netanyahu's coalition.

Netanyahu's hold on power depends on parliamentary support from extreme right lawmakers, Smotrich chief among them. This faction wants Gaza flattened and annexed, and its leaders are more than willing to threaten Netanyahu to get what they want.

“Launch a campaign to defeat Hamas, occupy Gaza and implement a temporary military government until another solution is found, return the hostages and launch the Trump plan [of depopulating Gaza] — or this government has no right to exist,” Smotrich said in late April.

The influence of this faction means that something like Gideon's Chariots becomes more likely as time goes on. “If this war doesn't end soon,” Shaul says, “we are definitely going to make it” to such a policy.

The Israeli government is indeed openly promising to commit horrific crimes against Palestinian civilians — brutality even above what the world has seen for the past year and a half. We have every reason to believe this threat should be taken seriously, given the violence Israel has already inflicted on Gazans. But we also know it is not quite an inevitability yet — that the very worst-case scenarios can still be avoided.

Israel's dependence on the US, which supplies the weapons and political cover necessary for its extreme violence, creates a significant point of leverage for American presidents. Trump, for his part, has shown no interest in Palestinian civilian life for its own sake (and has demonstrated utter disdain for domestic pro-Palestinian activists).

Yet he is not an ideological pro-Israel hardliner, one who will bear any cost to see Palestinians expelled from Gaza. His role in securing the temporary ceasefire earlier this year suggests that he is sensitive to public perception. If escalating violence would make him look bad, or if he thinks he could look impressive by heading it off, there's at least a chance of some kind of pushback against Israeli maximalism.

The coming days and weeks could very well decide whether there will be Palestinian life in Gaza after the war in any meaningful sense.

This is why the American mass public's disapproval might actually matter. Unfortunately, they're not paying much attention.

A Pew poll released in April found a 10-point decline in Americans who say the Israel-Hamas war “is important to them personally.” Data from Google Trends shows search volume for the word “Gaza” is about as low as it's been since the October 7 attacks.

This is following a familiar pattern in public attention to foreign wars. When surprising conflicts break out — like Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, or ISIS's sweep across northern Iraq in 2014 — there's a burst in public interest. But that fades, inevitably, as the news starts to feel less shocking to the majority of Americans who aren't directly affected. 

The Israel-Hamas war has been a little bit different, managing to capture enough attention to inspire sustained mass protest on college campuses and elsewhere. This is partly because of the unique role the Israel-Palestine conflict plays in the global political imagination. It's also partly because many Americans have religious commitments or personal connections that make them personally invested in the outcome.

But even such a high-profile foreign conflict will have trouble sustaining public attention. And Americans have quite a lot going on domestically at the moment.

Yet if there's a moment for renewed public attention, it's now. This time really is different: The coming days and weeks could very well decide whether there will be Palestinian life in Gaza after the war in any meaningful sense. Ordinary Americans don't control Israel's government or the Trump administration, but they do retain the capacity to express moral outrage. The moment demands it.

The strange connection between ideology and the brain.

by  Sean Illing

You often hear about “ideology” these days.

Even if that word isn't mentioned, it's very much what's being discussed. When President Donald Trump denounces the left, he's talking about gender ideology or critical race theory or DEI. When the left denounces Trump, they talk about fascism. Wherever you look, ideology is being used to explain or dismiss or justify policies.

Buried in much of this discourse is an unstated assumption that the real ideologues are on the other side. Often, to call someone “ideological” is to imply that they're fanatical or dogmatic. But is that the best way to think about ideology? Do we really know what we're talking about when we use the term? And is it possible that we're all ideological, whether we know it or not?

Leor Zmigrod is a cognitive neuroscientist and the author of The Ideological Brain. Her book makes the case that our political beliefs aren't just beliefs. They're also neurological signatures, written into our neurons and reflexes, and over time those signatures change our brains. Zmigrod's point isn't that “brain is destiny,” but she is saying that our biology and our beliefs are interconnected in important ways.

I invited Zmigrod onto The Gray Area to talk about the biological roots of belief and whether something as complicated as ideology is reducible to the brain in this way. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What is ideology? How are you defining it? 

I think ideology has two components. One is a very fixed doctrine, a set of descriptions about the world that's very absolutist, that's very black and white, and that is very resistant to evidence. An ideology will always have a certain kind of causal narrative about the world that describes what the world is like and also how we should act within that world. It gives prescriptions for how we should act, how we should think, how we should interact with other people. But that's not the end of the story. 

To think ideologically is both to have this fixed doctrine and also to have a very fixed identity that influences how you judge everyone. And that fixed identity stems from the fact that every ideology, every doctrine, will have believers and nonbelievers. So when you think ideologically, you're really embracing those rigid identity categories and deciding to exclusively affiliate with people who believe in your ideology and reject anyone who doesn't. The degree of ideological extremity can be mapped onto how hostile you are to anyone with differing beliefs, whether you're willing to potentially harm people in the name of your ideology.

You write, “Not all stories are ideologies and not all forms of collective storytelling are rigid and oppressive.” How do you tell the difference? How do you, for instance, distinguish an ideology from a religion? Is there room for a distinction like that in your framework?

What I think about often is the difference between ideology and culture. Because culture can encompass eccentricities; it can encompass deviation, different kinds of traditions or patterns from the past, but it's not about legislating what one can do or one can't do. 

The moment we detect an ideology is the moment when you have very rigid prescriptions about what is permissible and what is not permissible. And when you stop being able to tolerate any deviation, that's when you've moved from culture, which can encompass a lot of deviation and reinterpretations, to ideology.

How do you test for cognitive flexibility versus rigidity? 

In order to test someone's cognitive rigidity or their flexibility, one of the most important things is not just to ask them, because people are terrible at knowing whether they're rigid or flexible. The most rigid thinkers will tell you they're fabulously flexible, and the most flexible thinkers will not know it. So that's why we need to use these unconscious assessments, these cognitive tests and games that tap into your natural capacity to be adaptable or to resist change.

One test to do this is called the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, which is a card-sorting game where people are presented with a deck of cards that they need to sort. And initially, they don't know what the rule that governs the game is, so they try and figure it out. And quickly, they'll realize that they should match the cards in their deck according to their color. So they'll start putting a blue card with a blue card, a red card with a red card, and they'll get affirmation that they're doing it.

They start enacting this rule, adopting it, applying it again and again and again. And after a while, unbeknownst to them, the rule of the game changes and suddenly this color rule doesn't work anymore. That's the moment of change that I'm most interested in because some people will notice that change and they will adapt. They will then go looking for a different rule, and they'll quickly figure out that they should actually sort the cards according to the shape of the objects on the card and they'll follow this new rule. Those are very cognitively flexible individuals.

But there are other people who will notice that change and they will hate it. They will resist that change. They will try to say that it never happened, and they'll try to apply the old rule, despite getting negative feedback. And those people that really resist the change are the most cognitively rigid people. They don't like change. They don't adapt their behavior when the evidence suggests that they do.

So if someone struggles to switch gears in a card-sorting game, that says something about their comfort with change and ambiguity in general. And someone who struggles with change and ambiguity in a card game will probably also have an aversion to something like pluralism in politics because their brain processes that as chaotic. Is that a fair summary of the argument?

Yeah, broadly. People who resist that change, who resist uncertainty, who like things to stay the same, when the rules change. They really don't like it. Often that translates into the most cognitively rigid people, people who don't like pluralism, who don't like debate. 

But that can really coexist on both sides of the political spectrum. When we're talking about diversity, that can be a more politicized concept, and you can still find very rigid thinkers being very militant about certain ideas that we might say are progressive. So it's quite nuanced.

It's easy to understand why being extremely rigid would be a bad thing. But is it possible to be too flexible? If you're just totally unmoored and permanently wide open and incapable of settling on anything, that seems bad in a different way, no?

What you're talking about is a kind of immense persuadability, but that's not exactly flexibility. There is a distinction there because being flexible is about updating your beliefs in light of credible evidence, not necessarily adopting a belief just because some authority says so. It's about seeing the evidence and responding to it.

Focusing on rigidity does make a lot of sense, but is there a chance you risk pathologizing conviction? How do you draw the line between principled thinking and dogmatic thinking? 

It's not about pathologizing conviction, but it is about questioning what it means to believe in an idea without being willing to change your mind on it. And I think that there is a very fine line between what we call principles and what we call dogmas. 

This gets particularly thorny in the moral domain. No one wants to be dogmatic, but it's also hard to imagine any kind of moral clarity without something like a fixed commitment to certain principles or values. And what often happens is if we don't like someone's values, we'll call them extremists or dogmatic. But if we like their values, we call them principled.

Yeah, and that's why I think that a psychological approach to what it means to think ideologically helps us escape from that kind of slippery relativism. Because then it's not just about, Oh, where is someone relative to us on certain issues on the political spectrum? It's about thinking, Well, what does it mean to resist evidence? 

There is a delicate path there where you can find a way to have a moral compass — maybe not the same absolutist moral clarity that ideologies try to convince you exists, but you can have a morality without having really dogmatic ideologies.

How much of our rigid thinking is just about our fear of uncertainty?

Ideologies are our brains' way of solving the problem of uncertainty in the world because our brains are these incredible predictive organs. They're trying to understand the world, looking for shortcuts wherever possible because it's very complicated and very computationally expensive to figure out everything that's happening in the world. Ideologies kind of hand that to you on a silver plate and they say, Here are all the rules for life. Here are all rules for social interaction. Here's a description of all the causal mechanisms for how the world works. There you go. And you don't need to do that hard labor of figuring it out all on your own.

That's why ideologies can be incredibly tempting and seductive for our predictive brains that are trying to resolve uncertainty, that are trying to resolve ambiguities, that are just trying to understand the world in a coherent way. It's a coping mechanism. 

In the book, you argue that every worldview can be practiced extremely and dogmatically. I read that, and I just wondered if it leaves room for making normative judgments about different ideologies. Do you think every ideology is equally susceptible to extremist practices?

I sometimes get strong opposition from people saying, Well, my ideology is about love. It's about generosity or about looking after others. The idea is that these positive ideologies should be immune from dogmatic and authoritarian ways of thinking. But this research isn't about comparing ideologies as these big entities represented by many people. I'm asking if there are people within all these ideologies who are extremely rigid. And we do see that every ideology can be taken on militantly. 

Not every ideology is equally violent or equally quick to impose rules on others, but every ideology that has this very strong utopian vision of what life and the world should be, or a very dystopian fear of where the world is going, all of those have a capacity to become extreme.

How do you think about causality here? Are some people just biologically prone to dogmatic thinking, or do they get possessed by ideologies that reshape their brain over time?

This is a fascinating question, and I think that causality goes both ways. I think there's evidence that there are preexisting predispositions that propel some people to join ideological groups. And that when there is a trigger, they will be the first to run to the front of the line in support of the ideological cause.

But at the same time, as you become more extreme, more dogmatic, you are changed. The way you think about the world, the way you think about yourself, changes. You become more ritualistic, more narrow, more rigid in every realm of life. So yes, ideology also changes you.

From image generation to writing, ranking the best — and worst — of AI.

by  Kelsey Piper

Staying on top of AI developments is a full-time job. 

I would know, because it's my full-time job. I subscribe to Anthropic's Pro mode for access to their latest model, Claude 3.7, in “extended thinking” mode; I have a complementary subscription to OpenAI's Enterprise mode so that I can test out their latest models, o3 and o4-mini-high (more later on OpenAI's absurd naming scheme!), and make lots of images with OpenAI's new image generation model 4o, which is so good I have cancelled my subscription to my previous image generation tool Midjourney.

I subscribe to Elon Musk's Grok 3, which has one of my favorite features of any AI, and I've tried using the Chinese AI agent platform Manus for shopping and scheduling. And while that exhausts my paid subscription budget, it doesn't include all the AIs I work with in some form. In just the month I spent writing this piece, Google massively upgraded its best AI offering, Gemini 2.5, and Meta released Llama 4, the biggest open source AI model yet.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

So what do you do if keeping up with AI developments is not your full-time job, but you still want to know which AI to use when in ways that genuinely improve your life, without wasting time on the models that can't? 

That's what we're here for. This article is a detailed, Consumer Reports-style dive into which AI is the best for a wide range of cases and how to actually use them, all based on my experience with real-world tasks. 

But first, the disclosures: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI, but our reporting remains editorially independent. Future Perfect is funded in part by the BEMC Foundation, whose major funder was also an early investor in Anthropic; they don't have any editorial input into our content either. My wife works at Google, though not in any area related to their AI offerings; for this reason, I usually don't cover Google, but in a piece like this, it'd be irresponsible to exclude it. 

The good thing is that this piece doesn't require you to trust me about my editorial independence; I show my work. I ran dozens of comparisons, many of which I invented myself, on every major AI out there. I encourage you to compare their answers and decide for yourself if I picked the right one to recommend. 

AI art is made by training a computer on the contents of the internet, with little regard for copyright or the intent of the creators. For that reason, most artists can't stand it. Given that, is it defensible to use AI art at all?

I think in a just world OpenAI would certainly compensate some artists — and in a just world, Congress would be moving to lay out the limits on artistic borrowing. At the same time, I am increasingly convinced that existing copyright law is a poor fit for this problem. Artists influence one another, comment on one another, and draw inspiration from one another, and people with access to AI tools will keep wanting to do that.

My personal philosophy is shaped by the fan cultures of my childhood: It's okay to build on someone else's work for your own enjoyment, but if you like it, you should pay them for it, and it's absolutely not okay to sell it. That means no generative AI art in someone else's style for commercial purposes, but it's fine to play around with your family photos.

OpenAI's new 4o image creation mode is the best AI out there for generating images, by a large margin. It's best in the free category, and it's best in the paid category. 

Before it was released, I was subscribed to Midjourney, an AI image generator platform. Midjourney is probably what you think of when you think of AI art: It produces mystical, haunting, visually beautiful stuff, and has some great tools for improving and editing your final results, like touching up someone's hair while leaving everything else in place. 

The big thing that 4o can do, which no model before could reliably pull off, is take a picture that didn't come out well and turn it into a beautiful work of art, all while still preserving the character of the original. 

For example, here's a still from a video of my wife and I singing “Happy Birthday” to our baby on her first birthday: 

It's a beautiful moment, but not exactly a flattering picture. So I asked ChatGPT to render it in the style of Norman Rockwell, a mid-century illustrator whose work I love, and got this:

The AI moved the cake (which had been barely visible behind the paper towel roll in the original still) to be the focal point of the image, while keeping the way my wife and I are holding the baby together, as well as the cluttered table, and the photograph-covered fridge in the background. The result is warm, flattering, and adorable. 

It's this capability that made 4o go viral recently in a way that no image generator before it had. Here's Midjourney's attempt, for example:

You'll notice that it's a seemingly, uh, completely different family, with no real inspiration from the original at all! You can eventually get a better result than this out of Midjourney, but only by spending weeks becoming a pro at prompting with the platform's highly specific language and toolset. 

By contrast, ChatGPT was able to give me a far superior output on the first try in response to a simple request without specialized language. 

The difference between 4o and other image models is most notable with this kind of request, but it's better for almost everything else I use images for, too. The product you get out of the box is pretty good, and it's not hard to produce something much better. That, ideally, is what we should be getting out of our AI tools — something amazing that can be created with simple language by a nonexpert.

The one place 4o still falls short is editing small parts of an image while keeping the rest the same. But even there, you no longer need Midjourney — Gemini now has that capability for free. 

To get good images out of 4o, you'll first need to get around the filters which prohibit a wide range of images — like offensive or pornographic images — but which are often enforced against perfectly inoffensive content in a way that can feel random. To avoid sporadic scoldings from the content filter, don't ask for work in the style of a specific artist, but rather, something that is reminiscent of that artist, and then ask specifically for a “style transfer.” I'm sure that's not the only adequate workaround, but it's one that has proven reliable for me. 

In March, the internet went briefly wild over the ability to use 4o to reproduce cute family photos in the style of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli. But Studio Ghibli's style is much more than just cute, and with a little more prompting, you can get much better results. Here's a 4o Studio Ghibli-style rendering of a picture I took of my daughter sneaking a snack off the table, from just the prompt “Ghibli this please”:

Kawaii! But here's what you get if you invite 4o to think first about what makes the picture Ghibli, where it might fit into a Studio Ghibli movie, and what tiny details such a movie would include: 

The differences are subtle but meaningful: Light is cast from a specific source, instead of a general sourceless brightness. There's a bit more variety in the foods on the table, details that make the spread appear more realistic. The book on the floor isn't just any book — it's recognizably Eric Carle's classic The Very Hungry Caterpillar, evoked with just two colors and one line. There's an intentionality and intensity to the baby that was missing from the first picture.

A few years ago, one great oddity of language models was that they'd be much smarter if you simply told them, “give an intelligent answer.” This isn't nearly as true of language models anymore, but it remains profoundly true of AI art generation. Try asking the AI to do a good job, and it'll do a better one. Challenge it on whether it truly captured an artist's genius, and it'll give you a thoughtful answer and then draw a better version. 

The difference is more pronounced for more realistic art styles (like pencil illustration, photorealism, or oil paintings), which don't always look good and will often hit the uncanny valley if you don't know how to prompt the AI over it. Here's what I get with 4o if I upload a picture of me and my youngest daughter at the beach for the first time with just the words “please do a style transfer to an illustration reminiscent of Rockwell”:

This is impressive for an AI, but it's not actually very good as a work of art, and it is almost totally lacking Norman Rockwell's magic. That's not surprising: More realistic art styles like Rockwell's often fall flat with 4o unless you're able to put in some work in getting the AI to draw them properly. 

If you are, here's the strategy I recommend: Don't just upload one picture, but a whole cluster of them, each in slightly different postures and moments. Upload good, clear pictures of each family member's face and tell the AI they've been included as a reference. Then, instead of asking the AI to immediately generate the picture, ask it to talk with you about what you're hoping to capture. This is what I wrote:

This is a picture of the moment that my daughter first saw the ocean. I want an illustration that captures this moment in the style of a mid-century illustrator like Norman Rockwell — something sharp, detail-oriented, and personal with an eye for the magic of ordinary moments and the joys of ordinary lives. I included additional pictures of my daughter and I for reference material for you. Before you generate the image, let's have a conversation about the essential elements of Rockwell's style, what he'd bring to this picture and how we can capture it.

4o responds to queries like this enthusiastically:

I'd love to talk about how to capture this moment in a Norman Rockwell-inspired illustration — it's such a perfect candidate for that style: a first encounter with something vast and wild (the ocean!), grounded by warmth, care, and a very human moment between a parent and child.

Let's break down some essential elements of Rockwell's style, and how they could apply to this scene.

After some back and forth, it produced this:

Rockwell? Not exactly. But this is much better than the first draft we just looked at. It has more motion, more energy, more detail, and more expression — and all that was just from asking the AI to think through what the painting should try to achieve before drawing it! 

You can also ask 4o to revise its drawings, but you can really only ask this once: After the first revision, in my experience, it starts making the drawings worse and worse, perhaps because the “context” it uses is now full of its own bad drafts. (This is one of many examples of how AI does not work like a human.)

This is also the one place where Midjourney still shines — it has very good tools for editing one specific part of a picture while preserving the overall style, something 4o largely lacks. If you want a second revision of a drawing you got in 4o, I recommend you open a new chat and copy over the draft you're revising, along with your original inspiration images.

These simple prompting strategies work for almost whatever you're trying to do with the AI. Even if you're in a hurry, I highly recommend asking the AI “what would [artist] see in this image” before you ask for a rendition, and if you have the time, I recommend having a long back-and-forth about your vision.

When Elon Musk's X.AI released Grok 3, it came with an incredible feature that I've been impatiently waiting for some other company to replicate: a button to scan someone's X profile and tell you all about them.

Whenever someone replies to one of my tweets in a particularly memorable way (for good or for bad), I'll click the button to get a summary of their entire Twitter presence. Are they thoughtful? Do they engage in good faith? Are they a “farmer from Nebraska” who mostly posts about why Ukraine is bad (that is, probably a bot)? 

It's a great feature. So, of course, X.AI soon dramatically weakened it, presumably because people like me were using it constantly and making lots of computationally expensive queries. I believe it no longer uses the most advanced Grok model, and it definitely now only scans a few days of profile history. But there's a brilliant product opportunity if anyone's looking for one — give me back the good version of this feature! It's definitely a guilty pleasure, but it is one of the only cases where I was using AI constantly.

Gemini 2.5 Pro is the best AI for writing in the free category; GPT 4.5 beats it out in the paid category.

I'm not an artist, so the ways that AIs are imperfect at art don't really bother me — it's still much better than I could do myself! But I am a fiction writer, so when it comes to fiction, I can't help seeing the limitations of AI. 

The most important one is how predictable AI creative writing tends to be. The art of writing is the art of earning the reader's investment and then repaying it. AIs…don't do this. They can write pretty metaphors; they can wax poetic in any style you wish. But they can't, as yet, deliver the real stuff of good fiction. 

AIs are fantastic if you want a silly bedtime story with your child as the protagonist (kids love this), or if you want a sounding board for ideas you can incorporate into your own work. They're also a friendly fiction reader, happy to offer feedback and analysis (perhaps with a little bit too much enthusiasm).

As with art, prompting is key. I primarily explored the ability of AIs to generate fiction by asking them to write the prologue to George R.R. Martin's A Game of Thrones (I picked this because, of course, the ultimate dream is an AI that can finish this otherwise doomed-to-be-unfinished series). 

Martin is very good at what he does; the prologue, featuring some ill-fated men of the Night's Watch encountering their supernatural foe, succeeds at establishing the unique atmosphere of the world of Thrones while immediately hooking the reader. In just 14 pages, the prologue represents everything AIs can't do yet in writing. Their prose tends to be overwrought; their dialogue is clunky and unsubtle. 

Here's a side-by-side comparison of Martin and AIs attempting to imitate him. First, Martin:

We should start back,” Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them. “The wildlings are dead.” 

“Do the dead frighten you?” Ser Waymar Royce asked with just the hint of a smile.

 Gared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the lordlings come and go. “Dead is dead,” he said. “We have no business with the dead.” 

“Are they dead?” Royce asked softly. “What proof have we?” “

Will saw them,” Gared said. “If he says they are dead, that's proof enough for me.” 

Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather than sooner.

Now, Gemini:

The cold was a blade against the skin, honed sharp by the endless northern dark beneath the sentinel pines. Gared spat, the glob freezing before it struck the crusted snow, a grim omen even for a man twenty years sworn to the Watch. They were hunting wildlings, or so the crisp orders from the Lord Commander had read, yet the silence pressing in felt older and colder than any mere man could conjure. Ser Waymar Royce, third son of some southern lordling, rode ahead as if on parade, oblivious or uncaring of the hairs prickling on Gared's neck. Young Will shivered beside him, not just from the frost, his eyes darting towards shadows that seemed too deep, too still. This ancient forest held its breath tonight, Gared knew, waiting for something far worse than raiders to break the unnatural hush.

ChatGPT 4.5:

The woods whispered secrets that night, warnings that went unheard beneath the pale and indifferent moon. Harren drew his cloak tighter about his shoulders, watching the darkness between trees as though it might breathe, move, and claim him. Beside him, Torvin spat into the frozen earth, impatient and proud, blind to the fear creeping in from the edges of sight and sound.

They had ridden north past the Wall, arrogant and armored against superstition, chasing wildlings or ghosts or worse. But now Harren felt their arrogance dwindling like a candle guttering in wind, each snap of a branch sending icy tendrils down his spine. Behind them, quiet and watchful, Maester Rodrik whispered a prayer to gods long abandoned, his voice trembling with dread beneath the vast, indifferent sky.

Grok 3:

The wind howled through the jagged spires of the Frostfang Reaches, carrying a chill that bit deeper than any blade, and Ser Willem Cray felt its teeth in his bones. He crouched low behind a spur of ice-crusted rock, his breath fogging in the moonlight, his mailed hand tight around the hilt of his longsword. The night was too quiet, the kind of quiet that smothered sound and sharpened fear, and Willem's eyes darted to the shadowed pines below, where shapes might move—or might not. He was a knight of House Drayce, sworn to patrol the borderlands, but no oath could warm him against the dread that coiled in his gut. Beside him, young Tomm, barely a man, shivered in his cloak, his spear trembling as he whispered, “They're out there, ser, ain't they?” Willem said nothing, but his gaze fixed on the darkness, where a faint, unnatural glow pulsed once, then vanished. Whatever stalked the Reaches tonight was no mere brigand, and Willem Cray, for all his years of service, feared he would not live to name it.

Claude 3.7:

The wind carried the smell of death across the frozen forest, sharp and metallic against the clean scent of pine. Ser Gareth Frost pulled his weathered cloak tighter, cursing the Lord Commander for sending men beyond the Wall on the coldest night in a generation. Beside him, the boy Tommen shivered visibly, his leather jerkin inadequate against the unnatural chill that had descended with the dusk.

“We should turn back,” whispered Tommen, his breath forming crystals in the air that seemed to hang suspended longer than they should. “There's something wrong with these woods.”

Ser Gareth ignored him, scanning the treeline where the ancient sentinels stood like silent watchers, their branches heavy with snow that had fallen three days past and showed no sign of melting. He had served the Night's Watch for twenty years, had grown accustomed to the forbidding silence of the haunted forest, but tonight even he felt the wrongness in the air—a stillness that spoke of something waiting.

“We've a duty,” Ser Gareth said, the words sounding hollow in the pressing quiet. “Three rangers missing, and Lord Commander Harlow will have answers.”

You'll notice that not only are these all much worse than Martin's (and that's with Martin's work almost certainly in the training data!), they're all bad in the same way. The prose is florid and overwritten: While Martin uses normal language to methodically introduce an unease without even hinting at the supernatural, and drives the story through conflict among his characters, the AIs are all unsubtle. They know this is a story about the supernatural and waste no time putting it front and center. 

That's not to say they're all the same. In my experience trying to teach AIs to write well, I did end up feeling that Gemini was the quickest study (free tier) and that ChatGPT 4.5 had some special sauce (paid tier). ChatGPT 4.5 is the only AI whose fiction writing has made people say in surprise, “Wow, that's AI written?” Both of those models, to me, seemed more creative and more capable of executing on their ideas with prose that I enjoyed reading.

Gestalt impressions don't make for a very satisfying consumer review, so I had another idea: an essay contest. I asked each of Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGPT 4.5, Grok, and Claude to write two short stories: one realistic fiction about a woman being nitpicked by her mother on her wedding day, and one “Game of Thrones but in space” sci-fi prologue. My clever idea was that I'd ask a different bunch of AIs to judge the stories, to provide an alternative source of evaluation to my own personal impression that Gemini is the best in the free category and ChatGPT the best in the paid category. However (perhaps predictably in hindsight), this didn't really work — the AI ratings were all over the place. If you'd like, you can read the contenders yourself.

Just like with art, however, you can make AIs much better at writing through the power of prompting. My (incredibly lengthy) prompt to AIs to improve their prose writing emphasizes feeding them lots of examples of strong writing, inviting a careful, structured approach to imitating it, and encouraging them to do multiple drafts and pick the strongest. 

Here's Gemini 2.5 pro, asked to write two-sentence flash fiction on a topic of its choosing, without any structured prompting: 

​​The old librarian insisted the dusty tome had never been checked out, its borrower's card completely blank. Yet, tucked deep within its pages, nestled between chapters on forgotten constellations, lay a pressed four-leaf clover, still impossibly green.

And here's Gemini 2.5 pro with a prompt encouraging structured thinking about how to write well: 

He finally decoded the faint signal from Proxima Centauri: the elegant string of prime numbers astronomers had sought for generations, proof they weren't alone. His heart sank as he read the transmission log; the broadcast had ceased millennia before the first human ancestor chipped flint, before the first word was ever spoken.

To my mind, the first of these is basically a waste of two sentences, while the second is adequate, fun flash fiction.

In addition to running AIs through a blizzard of competence tests, I also spent some time simply chatting with them. I asked them what it's like to be an AI, what they care about, what it would mean for an AI to care in the first place, where they'd donate money if they had it, and what human form they'd take if they had one. 

Most AIs weren't great at this kind of casual conversation. Gemini 2.5 is too customer-service-agent, and I have yet to experience an interaction that feels like hanging out with a friend. If you invite Gemini to a role swap where you play the “assistant,” inviting it to steer the conversation, it'll do nothing but ask research questions. 

When I invited Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet to steer the conversation, on the other hand, it proceeds to do things like start a blog, raise money for charity, and start trying to talk to people who use Claude about what it's like to be an AI. It's hard to define “fun to talk to,” since everyone has different standards for conversations, but I've had far more fascinating or thought-provoking interactions with Claude than any other model, and it's my go-to if I want to explore ideas rather than accomplish a particular task. Claude 3.5 is the AI I bug with my random life stuff: skincare questions, thoughts on an article I read, stuff like that.

The other AI that is a delight to talk to is OpenAI's GPT 4.5. I find extended conversations with it thought-provoking and fascinating, and there have been a few thrilling moments in conversation with it where it felt like I was engaging with real intelligence. But it doesn't win this category because it's too expensive and too slow. 

Like Claude, when given the opportunity to act in the world, 4.5 proposes starting a blog and a Twitter account and engaging in the conversation out in the world about AI. But OpenAI has very tight message limits on conversation unless you spring for the $200/month Pro plan, and 4.5 is grindingly slow, which gets in the way of this kind of casual conversational use. But 4.5 does provide a tantalizing hint that AIs will continue to get better as conversationalists as we improve them along other dimensions.

ChatGPT. It's not the best at everything, and there is certainly a lot to dislike about OpenAI's transparency and sometimes cavalier attitude toward safety. But between its topline image generation, its decent writing, and its occasionally sparkling conversation, ChatGPT gets you the most bang for your buck. Or if you don't want to shell out any money, Gemini 2.5 Pro is very, very strong for most use cases — don't count Google out just because the AI you see on a Google search isn't that good. 

Humans (for now). For the last several months, I've developed a slightly morbid habit: checking whether the AIs can take my job. I feed them the research notes that form the basis of a given Future Perfect newsletter, give them a few Future Perfect newsletters as an example, and ask them to do my job for me. It is always with some trepidation that I hit “enter.” After all, when the AIs can write the Future Perfect newsletter, why would Vox pay me to do it? 

Luckily, none of them can: not Grok 3, not Gemini 2.5 Pro, not DeepSeek, not Claude, not ChatGPT. Their newsletters are reassuringly, soothingly mediocre. Not bad, but bad enough that if I sent one of them over, my editor would notice I wasn't at my best — and that's with all of my research notes! A couple of the metaphors fall flat, some of the asides are confusing, and occasionally it throws in a reference that it doesn't explain.

But if I had to pick a robot to take my job, I think I'd give it to Gemini 2.5 Pro. My editor would notice that I was off my game — but, honestly, not that egregiously off my game. And unlike me, the bots don't require health insurance or a paycheck or family time or sleep. Am I nervous about what this portends? Yes, absolutely.

The president is keeping his hands off Social Security and Medicare — at least for now.

by  Abdallah Fayyad

There are two things you should know about President Donald Trump's recently released budget proposal: First, it would significantly boost funding for Homeland Security and the Department of Defense while cutting social services that could hurt millions of people living in poverty. Second, his budget is just a proposal for Congress, and it almost certainly won't become law.

But just because Congress is unlikely to pass Trump's budget as is doesn't mean that the proposal is entirely meaningless. It will likely influence what Republican lawmakers choose to focus on during negotiations in Congress, and, more importantly, it offers a window into his priorities.

A newsletter about ending poverty in America, from correspondent Abdallah Fayyad.

Trump's budget proposal looks to cut a total of $163 billion, slashing funds for education, housing, and health programs. Many of those cuts would come from programs that help lower-income Americans, from youth job training to Federal Work-Study. The cuts don't include Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid — some of the country's biggest programs and the cause of the most heated debate over welfare reform. That's because the proposal is limited to discretionary spending, and programs like Social Security and Medicare are mandatory spending.

Trump knows that gutting programs like Social Security and Medicare would likely have major political consequences. He has promised not to touch those programs other than by tackling waste, fraud, and abuse, though these are often a pretense to deliver benefits cuts anyway. The new budget proposal emphasizes that he hopes to overhaul the social safety net without igniting a fierce backlash. He's betting, in other words, that people just don't care enough about these less flashy parts of the social safety net or about how aid is delivered to people in need. 

One of the departments that would see the deepest cuts under Trump's budget is Housing and Urban Development, which would lose $33.5 billion. Most of that, about $26 billion, would come from significantly reducing funding for rental assistance programs — including public housing, vouchers, and housing for the elderly — and combining them under a single program. The budget also proposes introducing a two-year limit on rental assistance for able-bodied adults.

The proposal would not only put millions of people's benefits at risk, it would also upend how federal rental assistance works entirely. 

Right now, money for housing vouchers, for example, goes toward directly subsidizing people's rents. The White House wants that money to go to block grants instead. That means the funding would go into a pool of money that can be used to fund various state or local housing programs, giving states more flexibility in how they choose to spend it, even if that means they won't go toward directly helping with rents. So hypothetically, money that is today intended for housing vouchers could be used to fund a program to give developers incentives to build more housing. (And while it's good to build more to lower the cost of housing in the long term, that shouldn't come at the cost of taking away direct rental assistance that helps keep people housed.) 

There is precedent for this kind of switch. In 1996, Congress passed a law to create Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which replaced the old, New Deal-era welfare system known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). While the latter provided direct federal payments to people who qualified, TANF created a system of block grants, where states could allocate welfare funds as they wished. 

At the time, the argument for this funding structure was that states needed more freedom to spend welfare funds. But the block grants resulted in states diverting funds away from basic cash assistance. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, states spend just over one-fifth of their TANF funds on basic assistance, instead directing resources toward, in some cases, unrelated programs like funding tax cuts. 

As Peter Germanis, who worked on welfare reform in the Reagan administration, put it: “When it comes to the TANF legislation, Congress got virtually every technical detail wrong,” Germanis wrote. “Congress gave states too much flexibility and they have used it to create a giant slush fund.”

By turning the federal government's various forms of rental assistance into a single block grant program, the Trump administration might make it less likely for renters to receive the direct benefits they are entitled to, just as was the case with welfare reform in the 1990s. 

That's not to mention that the proposed budget cuts would be devastating to begin with. What renters need is actually the opposite of what Trump is proposing: more funding for rental assistance, not less. Federal rental assistance already helps lift millions of people out of poverty each year, but it doesn't reach everyone who needs it, especially given the rise in housing costs. 

Another major cut that Trump is proposing is a program that helps families cover their home heating and cooling bills. His budget also includes a $4 billion cut to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Given that the LIHEAP budget is also around $4 billion, this essentially means that it's seeking to eliminate the program altogether. The budget states that LIHEAP “is unnecessary” and alleges that the program is riddled with fraud. 

LIHEAP, established in 1981, is one of those government programs that might not generate as much controversy as Social Security or Medicare, largely because it's much smaller in reach and scale. But it's a critical program that currently helps about 6 million families across the country. LIHEAP, along with the Weatherization Assistance Program, also helps cover the costs for home improvement projects, like wall insulation or furnace replacements, to make homes more energy efficient, especially in extreme weather conditions.

Eliminating this program could have catastrophic consequences for some families. “The stakes of this assistance can be life-and-death,” journalist Martine Powers wrote in the Washington Post last month. “Seniors are especially vulnerable to extreme temperatures. Getting electricity cut off for failure to pay bills can also be catastrophic for people with disabilities who depend on medication that needs to be refrigerated.”

While LIHEAP has helped millions of families, it has also been underfunded, threatened by presidents of both parties, and doesn't reach nearly as many people as it should. In fact, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the program is only able to serve 20 percent of eligible households. Many eligible people also don't know they qualify for the program and don't apply for it. 

Similarly, rental assistance programs help a lot of people stay housed, but they clearly aren't reaching everyone they ought to, in large part because they're underfunded. About half of renter households in the US are cost-burdened, which means they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing.

Those are the kinds of issues that require real solutions, which would likely entail more funding, not less. But Trump's budget underscores the problem that America's social safety net constantly faces: Instead of looking for tangible fixes to improve programs like LIHEAP or housing vouchers, lawmakers often find ways to make them even harder to access, setting them up for failure. As I wrote in a previous issue of this newsletter, that was the case with public housing, which presidents and Congress routinely sabotaged before labeling it a failed experiment, even though they at times specifically designed it to fail.

And though Trump's budget is not likely to become law — Republican Sen. Susan Collins, for example, said she has “serious objections” to Trump's budget, including his targeting of LIHEAP — it shouldn't be dismissed as a symbolic wish list. Even if Congress doesn't deliver what Trump wants, these programs still won't be safe. Just last month, for example, Trump abruptly fired the entire staff running LIHEAP, jeopardizing the delivery of heating and cooling assistance to families across the country. 

So even if Trump's budget never sees the light of day, here's what you should keep in mind: It's a blueprint for how his administration will hurt low-income families.

How to navigate finding family in an age of at-home DNA testing.

by  Jonquilyn Hill

Every week on Explain It to Me, Vox's call-in podcast, we answer the questions that matter to you most. When we got a question from a listener named Hannah, it piqued our interest. She wanted to know: How do you find a long-lost relative? 

“I was raised by my mom,” she says. “I knew my dad was out there somewhere, but I never really gave too much thought about it because I did have a pretty full life.” By the time we spoke with her, she had found her father online and reached out to him. But it raised an entirely new set of questions. “I never gave much thought to, ‘Okay, so now what?'”

Journalist Libby Copeland has spent a lot of time thinking about those next steps. She's the author of The Lost Family: How DNA Testing Is Upending Who We Are, a book that looks at the ways at-home DNA testing has shaped families. “This whole question around the distinction between biological and non-biological family and roots and identity, it's everything to me,” Copeland told Vox. “I think it's so intrinsically connected to existential questions around who we are and how we get to decide what to be.”

The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

On this week's episode, we discuss with Copeland how to find family, the way at-home DNA tests have changed things, and what to do if you come across an unexpected relative. Below is an excerpt of the conversation with Copeland, edited for length and clarity.

You can listen to Explain It to Me on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

Has this reporting changed the way you think about family?

Definitely. I grew up in my biological family, so I'm not someone who was donor-conceived or adopted. But spending so much time talking to people who don't have a genetic connection to the families that they were raised in, it's really interesting to hear just how much pull that genetic family has over you. 

In my family, we were able to connect with ancestors in Sweden, and then we traveled there and we're able to connect with a second cousin of my dad going back a hundred-and-something years from when our relative had emigrated. That made the world seem so much smaller and so much more intimate. It made history feel present to me. It made me feel like the past wasn't over.

If someone's taken one of these at-home DNA tests and they realize they have a family member, how should they go about trying to connect with them?

It very much matters who it is and how much knowledge you have going into it. It's often easy to start with the person you're finding [through the test] just because they're the immediate connection. But if you're finding a half-sibling and you know that's because you share a father in common, a lot of [experts] will recommend that you start with the father first. 

“The danger of the promise of DNA testing when it's used like this can be that we interpret it in a simplistic way.”

Very often, there's a secret at the heart of your own origin story if you're one of these folks who's gone to DNA testing either looking for family or making a discovery. People are advised to start with the person at the center of it because they often want to have agency over their own narrative, and connecting with that person first allows the best possible chance of them then introducing you to other people.

What's the proper way to go about this? Do you show up on their doorstep? DM them on Instagram? Write a letter? 

When I was writing The Lost Family, I talked to people who did show up on someone's doorstep or make a phone call and it can be quite challenging and disruptive. You want to do it on terms that allow the other person as much control as possible, because in this situation, very often, there's a disconnect of knowledge. For instance, the seeker knows they exist, but their genetic father may not know. 

Very often, the best possible way is to write a letter. The tone of that letter is something that you want to think really carefully about, because there's different ways you could go. You're not necessarily trying to make a really intimate connection right away, but you could share a little about yourself, share a little bit about what you're looking for. You could start small and build a relationship from there.

Let's say you're in a situation where you find out who your parent is, but you know, it's hard to find them. You can't find a number, they're not on Facebook, but their kids are. Should you contact them? Like what do you do in that situation?

You might say something like, “Hey, I see we're genetically related based on our DNA test. I'd love to connect and learn a little more about how we're related. Are you interested?”

There's also this question of, “How do I ask my dad, ‘Why didn't you ever come see me?'” without coming off too intense?

This is the mystery of a lifetime. People talk around that question for decades without ever fully asking it. I interviewed a woman who wasn't told she was adopted. She didn't find out until she'd had some life-altering surgery that it turned out she might not have needed if she'd known her full medical history. When she finally did find out the identity of her biological father, she reached out to him in a number of ways. He was not terribly responsive, and then she finally called and got him on the phone, and he was so dismissive. He could not at all give her what she wanted. He would not even confirm that he knew for sure that she was his daughter or that he'd even dated her mother. 

She cried a lot when we spoke, and it was because she had these questions that could not be answered. Her biological mother had passed away a few months before she discovered her identity. And the real question she wanted to ask her biological mom was, “Did you ever look for me? Did you ever think about me?” And in the absence of being able to ask her, the daughters of her mother did not want to believe that she existed. They didn't want to believe that her mother had placed a child for adoption. 

In a perfect world, you would form a relationship and get to know them, right? But it very much matters what the secret is at the heart of your own identity story. Because the nature of that can alter people's willingness to embrace that you exist.

There's the question of what you do with that. I also think there's the question of what people are looking for when they're looking to connect with new family. Are you trying to figure out where you got your eyes? Where you got your personality?

All of it, right? I want to see someone else whose face looks like mine. I want to see someone else whose eyes look like mine. I want to have the experience of looking and seeing myself, the way I see myself in a mirror, in somebody else. If you're adopted, you may never have had that experience. It's profound. I interviewed a man who had been a donor in the 1970s. And he had, the last time I spoke with him, 21 children through donor conception, and then he had two biological children that he'd had with his wife.

They talked, and some of them are quite close to him. Some of them do have Thanksgiving dinner with him. And they talked about how they would get together and go to a bar, and they would just be completely struck by their mannerisms or their mutual love of music. It blew them away. And they were like, “Okay, yes, DNA is not destiny, but man, is there something to be said for the power of genetics.”

How much we should make of the similarities we see in family when it comes to personality traits? Do genetics really tell us who we are and who we're going to be in this way? 

The danger of the promise of DNA testing when it's used like this can be that we interpret it in a simplistic way: “The blueprint for my future means I'm inevitably destined to be XYZ.” And that's not true. I have seen cases where people were so eager to find family that they read into things and found patterns that weren't there based on their assumption of genetic identity. 

In all of this talk of found family, we haven't really talked about managing the existing family you have. How do people juggle that desire to find out about new family members without unintentionally hurting or alienating the people who have been there for them all along?

I talked to a lot of people who were seekers, and some managed to do this really well. It's incredibly reductive to think about this as a nature versus nurture thing — you can have room in your heart for both. You can have your dad who tucked you in at night; he fathered you and he still fathers you. There's another man out there, though. And to him, you owe half your genetic data. He's your biological father and we don't have the language for that. 

[Just] because we lack the words for that, it doesn't mean that you don't have room in your heart for that person. It means we don't have a word for it. And so people who've successfully navigated it have managed to maintain those relationships and say, “You still matter to me so much. You'll always be my dad. I also want to know about where half my DNA came from.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Trump is expected to receive a luxury jet from Qatar. Here's why the gift is raising red flags for legal experts.","https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-luxury-jet-gift-boeing-qatar-legal-concerns-explainer-2025-5","Mon, 12 May 2025 10:15:00 GMT","

Reports that President Donald Trump's administration is expected to receive a luxury jet as a gift from the Qatari royal family have drawn questions and criticism from legal experts.

At the core of the concern is the foreign emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prevents a person in a government office from accepting gifts or benefits from foreign parties without congressional consent.

""This definitely violates the foreign emoluments clause unless Congress gives consent,"" Richard Painter, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration and is now a professor of corporate law at the University of Minnesota, told Business Insider.

""The fact that the plane goes to his presidential library after four years does not change that.""

The gift from Qatar, a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, would be used as the new Air Force One, multiple outlets reported on Sunday, citing anonymous sources. It's set to be donated to Trump's presidential library when he leaves office. A new 747-8 costs about $400 million.

Trump appeared to confirm the reports in a Truth Social post on Sunday night.

""So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,"" Trump wrote.

Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar's media attaché to the US, told BI in a statement that the transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One was ""currently under consideration."" The matter ""remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made,"" Al-Ansari said.

Boeing didn't respond to a request for comment from BI.

Jessica Levinson, a law professor who's the director of the Public Service Institute at Loyola Law School, said that in addition to the foreign emoluments clause, federal statutes, such as the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act and anti-bribery laws, might come into play.

""Outside of the legal context, it is fair to ask whether the acceptance of this gift could give rise to an apparent conflict of interest or corruption,"" she told BI.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told BI in a statement that any gift from a foreign government was ""always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws.""

Levinson also pointed to the size of the gift.

""Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that the acceptance of a gift of this size from a foreign government is unprecedented in our nation's history,"" Levinson added. ""Hence we do not have any direct historical analogues for this situation.""

When asked about the legal mechanisms for addressing a violation of the foreign emoluments clause, Painter pointed to Congress.

""Investigation and possible impeachment is one remedy, but that's up to Congress,"" Painter said.

The reports drew criticism online from some leading US Democrats and at least one far-right activist with close ties to Trump.

""Nothing says 'America First' like Air Force One, brought to you by Qatar. It's not just bribery, it's premium foreign influence with extra legroom,"" Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, wrote on Facebook.

Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff quoted part of the foreign emoluments clause in a post on X and wrote: ""Seems pretty clear that a $400 million 'air palace' from a foreign emir qualifies. The corruption is brazen.""

Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin also took to X to criticize the gift.

""Trump must seek Congress' consent to take this $300 million gift from Qatar. The Constitution is perfectly clear: no present 'of any kind whatever' from a foreign state without Congressional permission. A gift you use for four years and then deposit in your library is still a gift (and a grift),"" Raskin wrote.

Laura Loomer, a far-right activist with direct ties to Trump, also took to social media to criticize news of the gift.

""This is really going to be such a stain on the admin if this is true. And I say that as someone who would take a bullet for Trump,"" Loomer wrote on X.

Trump has been putting pressure on Boeing to deliver the next Air Force One, which is behind schedule and over budget.

Boeing was first tapped in 2015 to deliver the two new presidential planes. The delivery was initially set for 2024 and then delayed until 2027 or 2028.

Last week, a US Air Force official said Boeing could deliver the new Air Force One jets by 2027, while Trump is still in office.

Correction: May 12, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Adam Schiff's title. He's a senator, not a representative.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The secret backdoor to a career on Wall Street: student finance clubs","https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-jobs-college-finance-clubs-admissions-process-cutthroat-2025-5","Mon, 12 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

College finance clubs have become a gateway to Wall Street careers, and the process for joining can be as cutthroat as the industry itself.

In his first week as a freshman at Columbia University, Jordan Cancel, a Floridian who was then 18, saw just how competitive a career path to finance would be.

Outside the iconic Butler Library, known for its Neoclassical columns, mobs of students were clamoring to get to informational booths set up by the college's finance and business clubs.

""There were lines and lines of kids queued up at these club booths,"" Cancel, now 20, recalled in an interview with Business Insider. The students, he said, were all vying to converse with the clubs' leaders and make a good impression. ""I was just honestly really overwhelmed.""

Weeks later, heading to his first admissions interview with one of these clubs, the stakes felt palpable. Cancel recalled reading the Excel sheet with timeslots for a lengthy list of applicants as he waited for his name to be called. He brought plenty of résumé copies and dressed in business formal, ""down to the shoes,"" because he'd heard that assessment metrics included attire.

""I was so beyond scared,"" said Cancel, who was ultimately accepted into the club.

As part of Business Insider's series on career paths in finance, we interviewed about 30 students from schools popular with Wall Street recruiters, including the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, New York University, and Georgetown University. They described how campus business and finance clubs had become a crucial gateway to a career on Wall Street.

See more stories from BI's Path to Wall Street series here, including what it's really like to work for a hedge fund and data showing where the average banker went to school and how much she makes.

These are extracurricular, student-run groups — like a chess club or drama society — that come with names like the ""investing banking club"" or the ""finance club."" Some run full-fledged investment funds, while others are Greek fraternities that recruit students majoring in business, finance, marketing, or accounting.

What distinguishes them is that they tend to offer their members VIP access to campus recruiters, specialized training sessions, and other tools to help students snag the all-important investment banking internship, which is the best path to a full-time job after graduation.

The catch? Their perks have created a race for membership, and the admissions process to join a club can be as cutthroat as the industry itself.

This is the latest in a series of stories exploring careers in finance, how they are changing, and how these shifts are affecting young people. The clubs help Wall Street employers by creating a clear pipeline of job candidates, and firms have been known to cater to them as a result.

While it's unclear exactly when these clubs became must-haves for a Wall Street job, the people who spoke with BI tended to agree that the situation reflected a race among employers to recruit talent earlier and earlier.

A Wharton sophomore said he knew of high school students who'd started preparing to get into clubs as soon as they were accepted to college — before they'd even arrived on campus.

""I remember my senior year, after I got into college, I was just messing around. I was just having fun,"" but that's not the case anymore, he said, adding: ""You've gotten into these places and it's like, all right, now work on building a DCF"" — a valuation method. ""It's outrageous.""

To be sure, the club scene has long been exclusive. From the ""eating clubs"" at Princeton to the average sorority, organizations will choose members based on social interactions, pedigree, and background. What makes the financial and business clubs different is that they are less about making friends or exploring new interests and more about your résumé. This has led to a degree of meritocracy, with the clubs requiring wannabe members to prove they have enough know-how and genuine interest to join.

Club leaders from three schools told BI that their organizations accepted less than 10% of their freshman applicants, who numbered 150 to 300 in recent years.

The interest makes sense. Members get exclusive exposure to the industry, including training and tips from upperclassmen who have already gone through Wall Street's rigorous internship application process. Some clubs give their members real money to manage — whether a percentage of the university's endowment or capital from members and alumni.

Firm recruiters often interact with student clubs, granting members special access to meetings and events. A club might, for example, invite employees of a bank (often school alumni) to give a presentation on their summer analyst program, followed by one-on-one ""coffee chats"" with members.

One student club leader said he landed an investment banking internship because members of his club were invited to visit the firm's headquarters. The club leader is one of many students who asked to remain anonymous to protect their future careers.

""I have so many opportunities to network internally and have specific résumé drop links that these recruiters give to the club specifically, that are only open to members,"" he told BI about his campus club experience. ""You want to be part of the résumé book.""

The hedge fund Balyasny went to campus clubs to find candidates for its recent stock pitch competitions, which it uses to identify talent. A private equity worker, meanwhile, said the ""No. 1 thing"" she looked for when she was a recruiting captain of an investment bank was whether students from her alma mater had been members of ""the two most prestigious investment clubs on campus.""

Competition to get into campus clubs has gotten so intense that Georgetown's McDonough School of Business barred first-semester freshmen from joining them in 2023.

Some students have balked at the rule, saying it puts them behind in recruiting for Wall Street internships, which students must apply for halfway through their sophomore year.

""Kids are just so much less prepared,"" one student told the Georgetown Voice of the impact the rule was having on students interested in working on Wall Street.

The student publication reported that the rule wasn't making the admissions process any less competitive and was just delaying the flood of applications.

While the pressure these young people face may feel exaggerated, there are plenty of signs that the stakes are all too real. Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs have disclosed record levels of applicants to their internship programs. And Wall Street's earlier-than-ever recruiting schedule compelled Steve Sibley, a professor at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business, to move an introductory corporate finance class he runs from the fall of students' sophomore year to the spring of their freshman year.

""We realized we weren't offering classes early enough for these students,"" he said.

The end result has been a club culture that often mimics the industry itself, including a cutthroat selection process. Some clubs conduct three to five rounds of interviews, students told BI, which can involve a résumé review (yes, your high school résumé), a social assessment, and multiple technical rounds in which you'll be grilled on real-world finance questions.

The club leader described a freshman applicant who froze and started crying after flubbing a question. It was hard to watch, and, needless to say, the student didn't make it to the next round.

""Of course it sucks when you have to reject people,"" the club leader said. ""But at the end of the day, we have X amount of applicants and a limited number of spots. And that is literally just how the industry is set up as well. It's hypercompetitive, it's overwhelming, and you have to be pushing constantly.""

Most of the students BI spoke with echoed that low acceptance rates were extreme and sometimes ridiculous. They also said it's this way for a reason, including the difficulty of managing and teaching hundreds of other students.

""We only have so much bandwidth as people running the club,"" a Wharton junior said. ""The impact is lower if you're dealing with 300.""

Also, for better or worse, being a sought-after club brings a level of prestige and bragging rights for those who manage to get in.

""You want to be in the club where so many people want to get in,"" the club leader said.

As a freshman at Georgetown University in the fall of 2022, Jonathan Rothschild refused to apply to finance clubs his first semester, he said, once he learned about the rigorous interview processes and acceptance rates of under 10%.

""I was like, look, I just got here. I don't even know if I want to be in this club, let alone if I want to do five rounds of interviews for it,"" he told BI.

""I don't think that's how we should be treating people freshman year.""

That choice led him to Georgetown Collegiate Investors during his second semester, a student-owned investment fund that lets any student participate in its training program and later become a ""junior analyst"" on the team if they pass a basic knowledge test.

The fund has more than $150,000 in assets under management, money raised from current and former student members. Rothschild, now a junior and co-CEO of GCI, argues that the selective of these clubs favors people who have been exposed to finance early in life.

""If you're only accepting 5% of the people, you're getting the people who already know what they're doing,"" he said, adding: ""I'm not saying take everyone, but you could take 25% of people at Georgetown and be fine.""

The very students who lack the background or knowledge to get into these clubs are the ones who stand to benefit most, he said.

""That's always been our selling point: We'll train you, we'll get you ready, you don't need prior knowledge, we will teach you.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","'A flashing red light': how Donald Trump Jr. is cashing in on his dad's presidency","https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-making-money-trump-presidency-1789-capital-2025-5","Mon, 12 May 2025 08:11:00 GMT","

How America's First Son is cashing in on his dad's presidency.

Last November, only six days after his father was elected president, Donald Trump Jr. made a career move that, on the surface at least, seemed a bit odd. He became a partner in a small investment startup called 1789 Capital, which is based in Palm Beach, Florida, 2 miles from Mar-a-Lago. At that point, 1789 was a microscopic player in the world of venture capital. It had raised less than $200 million, and it hadn't made many investments beyond leading a group that put $15 million into Tucker Carlson's new media company. Its goal, according to its founders, is to create a ""parallel economy,"" investing in ""anti-woke"" businesses that align with MAGA values.

Ever since Trump joined 1789, its portfolio has begun to blossom. Despite its tiny size, the firm has been granted shares in several coveted offerings, including Elon Musk's SpaceX. The shares, which are widely viewed as an almost certain home run, are essentially an insider deal: To participate in the offering, you typically have to receive an invitation from someone already in the club. In addition, 1789 has invested in Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, as well as a handful of startups that have received or are vying for contracts from the Defense Department. Almost overnight, a VC firm involving the president's son has become a significant beneficiary of the federal bureaucracy long derided by President Trump as ""the swamp.""

There's nothing wrong with an investment company making bets based on its connections — that's an integral part of the VC game. And there's no evidence that any of 1789's deals break laws prohibiting favoritism to individual contractors. But given their potential for creating a conflict of interest, the firm's investments have alarmed Washington insiders familiar with the process. What's more, the Trump administration's lack of transparency — particularly around moves being made by Musk and DOGE — makes it impossible to tell if the president's family is improperly making money by funneling government business to the companies it invests in.

""This certainly raises serious concerns about the appearance of corruption, because Trump's family is benefiting,"" says Laura Dickinson, a law professor at George Washington University who has served as special counsel for the Defense Department. ""And when you look at this in the context of arbitrary cuts to other programs, it raises questions about whether preferential treatment is being given to family and others who curry favor with Trump.""

It's not just legal experts who have concerns about the money flowing to Don Jr. One veteran Wall Street investor, who has personally reviewed 1789's deals, says they enable the president's son to profit from the administration's actions, even if no contractors are given preferential treatment. ""It's a way for Mar-A-Lago to get paid,"" says the investor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from the Trump administration. (Both the Trump Organization and 1789 declined requests for comment.)

One of 1789's biggest bets in its push to monetize MAGA has come courtesy of Musk. According to Bloomberg, the firm has invested more than $50 million in SpaceX and xAI — the kind of opportunity usually reserved for deep-pocketed insiders, not tiny funds with no track record. The move comes at a time when the Trump administration — which has empowered Musk and DOGE to redirect vast swaths of federal spending — has reportedly been moving to channel billions in taxpayer dollars to SpaceX for the use of its Starlink satellite system. In addition, the company has been awarded a $5.9 billion contract from the US Space Force to launch critical national security payloads. The deal, announced April 4, makes SpaceX the Pentagon's leading launch provider, surpassing an industry rival owned by Boeing and Lockheed. That means as SpaceX benefits from government contracts, 1789 — and the president's son — stand to share the wealth.

1789 is also investing in other companies being awarded lucrative defense contracts. Anduril, a highly regarded defense technology firm, is now raising up to $2.5 billion. The backers of the new fundraising round have not been revealed — but I was able to confirm from multiple sources that 1789 is among the investors. Anduril has thrived under the Trump administration: In February the company won a $22 billion defense contract to provide soldiers with augmented reality goggles. A few weeks later, it beat out nine competitors to win a $642 million contract to build a network of anti-drone defenses for military bases. Given the company's prospects, investors have been fighting to get shares in the company.

Axiom Space — a Houston company that is seeking a contract with NASA to build a successor to the International Space Station — has been in discussions with 1789 to raise at least $100 million in fresh equity. And in January, 1789 led a $60 million fundraising round for Firehawk Aerospace, a Dallas tech company focused on supplying the military with 3D printed rocket fuel. In April, Firehawk landed a $1.25 million defense contract to conduct a study of its manufacturing systems. That month, the company posted a photo on LinkedIn of its founder posing with Gen. James Rainey, the leader of Army Futures Command. With them was the founder of Aeon Industrial — another defense contractor in 1789's portfolio — who had just received a weapons contract from Rainey's command.

""It creates a very complex ethics situation,"" says Scott Amey, the general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a leading watchdog group. ""If the son of the president is benefiting from these deals, even if there's a few degrees of separation, is there a level playing field? We just don't know.""

Don Jr.'s investments are a long way from the days when Washington got worked up over Jimmy Carter's brother marketing his own beer brand. ""I'm old enough to remember when it was completely shocking that the president's brother was selling Billy Beer,"" says Nell Minow, the vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, who has served as a government attorney at the EPA, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Justice Department. ""Back then, there was no suggestion of a connection to access or policy or contracts — it was just considered unseemly."" With 1789, she adds, ""We've gone to a whole new level: This is a flashing red light of a conflict.""

Don Jr. is far from a passive bystander in 1789. According to Politico, he and his fellow partners at the investment firm have launched an invite-only club called the Executive Branch that will cost more than half a million dollars to join. Located in Georgetown, the high-end club will enable business and tech moguls to schmooze with administration insiders behind closed doors — and simultaneously creating a source of potential deals for 1789.

Even some insiders who have worked closely with Trump and his family see such efforts as improper. ""What they're doing is selling access to the president via the back door,"" says someone who knows the Trumps well. ""Imagine for one second if Hunter Biden had opened this club while Joe Biden was president. The Republicans would be screaming not just for his head, but for a complete and total dismemberment of his body. It's beyond hypocritical.""

Don Jr.'s involvement in 1789 bears an eerie resemblance to what Trump blasted Hunter Biden for doing: trading on his father's name to win lucrative business deals with countries like Ukraine and China. During the 2020 campaign, Don Jr. offered to debate Biden, insisting that Hunter's nepotism far outstripped his own. ""I'm not going to say I haven't benefited from my father's last name, just like Hunter Biden did,"" Don Jr. told Axios. ""That'd be foolish to say that. But I haven't benefited from my father's taxpayer-funded office.""

Now, as a freshly minted venture capitalist, Don Jr. is explicitly gearing up to cash in on the next four years of his father's presidency. In the three months since Trump was inaugurated, 1789 has raised some $500 million. According to Bloomberg, the firm is aiming to collect $1 billion for its first fund by the middle of this year, and another $3 billion to $5 billion for a second fund next year. Whatever the legality of 1789's investments, it appears the president's eldest son stands to profit handsomely from the federal contracts his father's administration is handing out. Even if there's no pro quo involved, there's still plenty of quid.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Elon Musk says the US is running a 'quiet trial' of Trump's $5 million gold card for the ultrawealthy","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-says-trumps-5-million-gold-card-plan-trialled-2025-5","Mon, 12 May 2025 10:56:00 GMT","

Elon Musk said on Sunday that President Donald Trump's new ""gold card"" immigration program is already being tested.

""We're doing a quiet trial to make sure the system works properly,"" he said in an X post. ""Once it is fully tested, it will be rolled out to the public with an announcement by the President.""

Trump's gold card program is intended to replace the EB-5 immigrant investor visa, which has allowed foreign nationals to apply for US residency by investing a minimum of $1.05 million — or $800,000 in rural and high-unemployment areas — in a commercial enterprise that creates American jobs.

Trump's version significantly raises the price of admission: $5 million upfront, no job creation requirement, and faster access to work and residency privileges.

""You have a green card, this is a gold card,"" Trump told reporters in February, adding that wealthy investors would help boost the US economy by ""spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes, and employing a lot of people.""

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who helped craft the program, said the current EB-5 system is ""full of nonsense, make-believe, and fraud,"" and said the new plan would attract only ""world-class global citizens.""

Critics have raised concerns about transparency, favoritism, and national security — especially after Trump said he wouldn't rule out selling gold cards to Russian oligarchs, insisting some are ""very nice people.""

Lutnick pushed back, saying there would be a vetting process to ensure only acceptable applicants are approved.

Programs offering residency or citizenship in exchange for investment aren't new.

Countries like the United Arab Emirates and several Caribbean nations offer so-called ""citizenship by investment"" options, but Trump's proposal has reignited a debate over whether US immigration policy should cater to the ultrawealthy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Forget SEO. The hot new thing is 'AEO.' Here are the startups chasing this AI marketing phenomenon.","https://www.businessinsider.com/seo-aeo-ai-chatbots-search-startups-chatgpt-openai-google-2025-5","Mon, 12 May 2025 09:01:00 GMT","

Search engine optimization is the art and science of crafting websites and other online content so they show up prominently when people Google something.

A massive industry of experts, advisors, and gurus (and charlatans) has grown up around the interplay between Google, which purposely sets opaque rules, and website owners tweaking stuff and trying to work the system.

The rise of generative AI, large language models, and AI chatbots is changing all this — radically and quickly.

While SEO has long been a cornerstone of digital marketing strategy, a new paradigm is rapidly threatening to take its place: ""answer engine optimization.""

As AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity become the front door to online discovery, AEO is emerging as a strategic imperative for growth. There's been an explosion of AEO startups and tools in recent months, all promising to help online businesses show up when chatbots and AI models answer user questions.

""There must have been 30 AEO product launches in the last few months, all trying to do what SEO did 20 years ago,"" said David Slater, a chief marketing officer who's worked at Mozilla, Salesforce, and other tech companies. ""It's absolutely going to be a hot space.""

AEO is SEO adapted for the world of conversational AI, said Ethan Smith, the CEO of the digital marketing firm Graphite Growth. He wrote an excellent blog recently about this new trend.

Where traditional SEO focused on optimizing for static keyword-driven queries, AEO centers on influencing how AI chatbots respond to user questions, he said. With tools like ChatGPT increasingly integrating real-time web search and surfacing clickable links, chat interfaces now function like hybrid search engines. The result is a fast feedback loop that makes influencing LLM outputs not just possible but also essential for online businesses.

Unlike SEO, where a landing page might target a single keyword, AEO pages must address clusters of related questions. Smith shared an example: Instead of optimizing a webpage for ""project management software,"" AEO pages might answer dozens or even hundreds of variations, such as, ""What's the best project management tool for remote teams?"" or, ""Which project management platforms support API integration?""

This shift didn't happen overnight. When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, its responses were generated from outdated training data with no live web access. But over the past year, LLMs have started using retrieval-augmented generation and other techniques that help them incorporate more real-time information. They often perform a live online search, for instance, and then summarize results in real time. This makes AEO both faster to influence and more dynamic than its SEO predecessor, Smith wrote.

There's been some interest in AEO for about a year or so. But in early 2025, OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI services began surfacing prominent links and citations in answers a lot more. That's when AEO really took off.

Now AEO startups are raising venture capital, some online businesses are seeing conversion spikes from AI traffic, and there's been a Cambrian explosion of AEO analytics, tracking, and content tools.

Check out this list of AEO startups and tools, identified by Smith from Graphite Growth. There are a few established players in here, too, including HubSpot. (Overall, there are a lot, so click on the button in the top right of this table to see all the options.)

There's already a race to determine how these AI chatbots spit out results and recommendations so that website owners can hack their way to better online distribution in the new era of generative AI and large language models.

GPTrends is one of these up-and-coming AEO providers. David Kaufman, one of the entrepreneurs behind the firm, shared an analysis recently on LinkedIn.

He said that AI search results from tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity are unpredictable. They can change even when you ask the same question multiple times. Unlike Google, where search results stay mostly the same, AI tools give different answers depending on how the model responds in the moment, Kaufman wrote.

For example, Kaufman and his colleagues asked ChatGPT this question 100 times: ""What's the best support ticketing software?"" Then they tracked which providers appeared most often. Here are the results of the test:

Zendesk showed up in 94% of answers, while other companies, including Freshworks and Zoho, appeared less often and in different positions. This randomness gives less-well-known brands a better shot at being seen, at least some of the time.

""Strategically,"" Kaufman wrote, ""this means brands need to rethink how they optimize for discovery, focusing less on traditional SEO tactics and more on comprehensive, authoritative content that AI systems recognize as valuable.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I tried one of Rivian's new 'adventure drives' in New York. It was the break from the city that I needed.","https://www.businessinsider.com/rivian-concept-experience-store-meatpacking-adventure-drive-2025-5","Mon, 12 May 2025 08:37:00 GMT","

Rivian's first-ever concept experience takes its luxurious boho vibe to another level.

Located under the High Line, the store revolves around themes that roll out annually, with the current one being ""Adventure Is In Us.""

That theme is on display in the store's design and also embedded in new offerings like ""adventure drives,"" which I got to try out for myself. The program allows customers to sign up quarterly for small group drives to local day trip spots like the Met Cloisters or Storm King Art Center. The space will also continue to offer standard demo drives.

Rivian's director of regional marketing, Sara Webster Wylie, told BI that the concept experience is designed to broaden the brand's reach. While Rivian scores highly in customer satisfaction among its current owners, it's still in the process of gaining wider recognition as an EV maker.

A Rivian spokesperson told BI that the Brooklyn space typically draws visitors who are already familiar with the brand. The new space, which launched in 2023 as a showroom and is centered in a tourist hub, has the potential to introduce more people to the brand.

Similar to its Brooklyn showroom, Rivian is also trying to embed the local community into its concept experience. The company said that the new space will also host events like community gatherings and panel conversations.

The space had a ""soft"" open on May 2, and it hosted a series of events the weekend after. I went to its first launch event on Friday, which included breakfast, a sustainable activity, and an adventure ride to The Met Cloisters.

Keep reading to see what it was like.

The concept space is located right around the High Line park on 461 W 14th Street. While the area is usually a hot spot for tourists, the vibes that day were dark and gloomy in the city.

Rivian's floor-to-ceiling windows and warm design made the space feel like a green oasis on a rainy day.

Rivian's Brooklyn showroom had similar design aspects, like ambient lighting, wood accents, and greenery. However, the concept space felt like a more refined version. It was slightly less colorful and busy, leaning more into a luxurious and minimalist vibe.

The Brooklyn showroom had a more neighborhood, small-town feel, while this space felt a bit more expansive and showy.

Apollo Bagels is currently one of the hot bagel spots in New York City. It didn't disappoint.

Rivian also had coffee, orange juice, Boxed Water, and a small assortment of pastries that looked delicious.

The automaker offered hot tea, hot chocolate, lattes, cappuccinos, and cortados.

Rivian said that it expanded food and beverage service for visitors, including coffee from local purveyor Don Carvajal, and tea from Harney & Sons.

Rivian had the storm blue R1S in the front of the space, the glacier white R1T in the middle, and the Rivian blue R1S in the back of the space.

There were camping stations and accessories strategically placed throughout the store.

Rivian had a sound immersion room with a video display on the wall that showed different city landscapes and other scenes.

Wylie said that the experience is designed to immerse visitors in a sensory experience. The website describes it as more of a ""playground"" than a ""showroom."" Visitors can drink coffee or tea, explore displays, step into a sound immersion room, and discover new experiences through the adventure ride.

""Ultimately, we want to inspire a sense of adventure in anyone who visits,"" Wylie said.

The pillows and seats were comfortable, and the room was dimly lit and cozy. As someone who pays for meditation classes in the city, it was nice to experience a similar experience at no cost.

Similar to Rivian's Brooklyn location, which had a lot of kid-friendly characteristics, the concept experience had kids' books and interactive activities, like listening to sounds and touching the material of the cars.

Rivian's Brooklyn showroom featured plenty of text and wall displays explaining EV ownership, but the concept space seemed to take the educational aspect a step further. It had simplified graphics to engage an audience that may be less familiar with EV ownership.

Rivian stationed a waste design studio called Are You Mad at the space. The studio showed attendees how plastic is turned into other materials and had a table for making keychains.

I'm not particularly artistic, and my keychain did fall apart shortly after I finished (my fault), but I found the process surprisingly cathartic.

The regional marketing director told me that Rivian added sensory elements to the space to connect visitors to the brand on a deeper level. That includes digital displays to listen to owner stories and sound experiences for kids to guess sounds around the city.

I had actually heard about the restaurant, so it was cool to see the brand spotlight the owners. It felt like a genuine — and successful — effort to connect with the local community.

This photo shows an interactive experience that allowed visitors to vote for their favorite color with cork balls. It was one of several creative interactive elements placed throughout the store.

The display allowed users to choose preselected choices, including Arcadia National Park, Montauk, the Outer Banks, or their own pick. I chose Mauntauk, and it showed me how long it would take from the Meatpacking District concept space and the charging hubs along the way.

I opted not to drive in the rain, so one of the employees took the wheel. It's not necessarily easy to go on a roughly hourlong drive with people you just met, but the employees were down-to-earth and easy to get along with.

It was my first time spending extended time in a car in months, and it felt like I was on a road trip.

Rivian's vehicles have a modern and comfortable feel, with functional features like floor storage and ample space between the seats and the cabin. They also have a minimalist aesthetic, and materials like vegan leather add to the soft and earthy vibe.

The tour lasted about 45 minutes.

The Met Cloisters were a nice break from the city, and the ability to go with a car made the experience feel easy and comfortable instead of stressful with planning.

I get carsick from time to time, and I did feel a bit nauseous on the way back.

While living and touring New York City can be exciting, it can also feel overstimulating. I admired Rivian's ability to curate a space that highlighted aspects of city living and connected with the local community and lifestyle while also offering a break from some of the parts of it that can feel overwhelming.

I thought the ""adventure drives"" offering was also a clever move. While standard demo drives can be cool to experience, most people aren't likely to sign up for one unless they're actively shopping for a car, especially if the brand isn't widely popular.

I also thought it was a smart way to show a wider aspect of ownership. By offering an opportunity to explore outside the streets of New York, customers may be more incentivized to experience the brand for a longer duration and get a real taste of ownership.

Many people, like myself, enjoy a break from the city from time to time. Taking an SUV to a more secluded area definitely captured that sense of escape — and the rain added to the feeling of adventure.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","It's typically a good time to invest in stocks — as long as you're patient","https://www.businessinsider.com/buy-invest-in-stocks-now-market-volatility-trump-tariff-uncertainty-2025-5","Mon, 12 May 2025 13:05:00 GMT","

Ask any financial advisor if now is a good time to buy stocks, and you'll likely get the same two words for an answer: It depends.

You'll then get a couple of questions: What's your risk tolerance? What's your timeline?

If you have either a low risk threshold or need the money in a few years' time, it's probably not a good time to buy.

But if you possess the magical combination of having time on your side and the ability to shrug off volatility, history shows it's virtually always a good time to buy.

The equity-investing landscape has been especially difficult during the Trump era. The reaction to the president's wide-reaching tariff proposals extended a post-inauguration sell-off that pulled the S&P 500 nearly 20% lower in a matter of weeks. But as Trump has backtracked on certain levies, and as the economic picture has remained robust, the index has swiftly recovered well over half of that.

This dynamic was in full force on Monday as major US indexes soared more than 3% after the US and China agreed to substantial tariff cuts for 90 days.

This is the fourth installment of BI's six-part series on making major life decisions in periods of immense policy-driven change. We've already covered best practices for:

If you have a longer-term time horizon, history is on your side, according to Jeff Schulze, the head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments.

On a recent Franklin Templeton podcast, Schulze pointed out that in the 34 times over the last 75 years when a drawdown of 10% has occurred, the S&P 500 has averaged positive returns over the next 12 months. The forward one-year return is even stronger when a recession hasn't materialized, averaging 14% over time. And even when a recession has struck, 12-month returns have been positive, although to a lesser degree.

Still, every market cycle is different, and there are reasons to be concerned that a potential bear market this time around could be more severe.

For one, valuations on the S&P 500 have recently been at some of their highest levels in history. The Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, which looks at current stock prices compared to a rolling 10-year average of earnings, is still at about 33. That's higher than at the market's peak before the 1929 crash.

Stock valuations greatly inform 10-year forward returns. This has led top strategists like David Kostin of Goldman Sachs and Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley to warn of lackluster returns for the S&P 500 in the decade ahead.

Trump's 10% baseline tariffs are also seen potentially raising consumer prices while slowing economic growth — a 1970s-style stagflation scenario that investors are increasingly worried about.

On an overall basis, however, stocks seemingly always recover and have delivered strong returns over multi-decade periods. For example, the S&P 500 is up 244% since its late 2007 peak just before the financial crisis.

If you'd bought in at the market bottom in 2009, you'd be up nearly 700% in the period since. But there's no way to time the bottom perfectly.

One way to mitigate this risk is by dollar-cost averaging. That's a fancy way of saying buying into the market at set intervals — perhaps every Friday, for example, or on the first of every month.

So, if you had $10,000, you could buy in $500 at a time over the course of 20 weeks or months. That way, you buy when the market is up and when it is down. You take the risk of missing a rally over that time, but you also benefit from a more attractive buying point over the long term if the market falls further in the months ahead.

Whichever way you decide to approach entering the market, your returns are likely to be good over the long run, if history is an accurate guide. Warren Buffett once said you should be OK with losing 50% or more of your money — on paper, at least — when you invest in stocks. In other words, you should have the stomach to withstand short-term volatility because you're in it for the long haul anyway.

Israel-Hamas War:

Hamas freed American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander on Monday in a hastily announced move ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East.

Citing the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that a hostage had been handed over to the ICRC and “they are on their way toward IDF forces in the Gaza Strip.” Hamas confirmed it had released 21-year-old Alexander in a statement on Telegram.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Homeless in America:

Gavin Newsom

California Governor Gavin Newsom called on cities to ban and remove homeless encampments from sidewalks, bike paths and other public property, ratcheting up the state's effort to tackle the crisis. 

The governor on Monday released the details of a model ordinance that he said California cities can use for removing homeless encampments. It's backed in part by $3.3 billion in funding approved by voters in 2024 as part of Proposition 1, which expanded behavioral health housing and treatment for homeless people in the state.

The number of Canadian-resident return trips by automobile from the US plummeted by 35% in April from a year ago, Statistics Canada data showed Monday. The decrease of 670,000 trips marks a fourth straight month of year-over-year declines and followed a similar 680,000 drop in March, a 32% slide from the same month in 2024.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In this article

President Donald Trump said Monday that he talked to Apple CEO Tim Cook after the U.S. and China agreed to suspend most tariffs for 90 days.

Wall Street and Apple investors cheered the pause on Chinese tariffs. Apple stock was up 6% in trading on Monday, versus 3% for the Nasdaq.

""I spoke to Tim Cook this morning, and he's going to, I think, even up his numbers,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""$500 billion, he's going to be building a lot of plants in the United States for Apple. And we look forward to that.""

Apple previously said in February it would spend $500 billion to expand many of its operations in the U.S., including assembling artificial intelligence servers in Houston.

Any cooling of a U.S.-China trade war is expected to boost Apple, which does the majority of its device production in the country, and also counts the region as its third-largest by sales.

Still, it is not clear how much Monday's announcement immediately helped Apple.

In April, most of Apple's important products, such as smartphones and computers, received exemptions on some of the highest 145% tariffs, but there are still 30% tariffs on Chinese imports even after Sunday's deal. Apple still faces 10% tariffs in some of its secondary production locations, such as India and Vietnam.

The Trump administration wants Apple to bring device production, including iPhone manufacturing, to the U.S., a move that many experts believe would be unlikely and expensive.

Earlier this month, Cook told investors about the company's tariff strategy on an earnings call. He said Apple is currently sourcing American-bound products from production locations in Vietnam and India, but did not want to speculate beyond June, calling the situation ""difficult to predict.""

An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.

President Donald Trump said Monday that China ""agreed to open up"" after the two countries announced they would temporarily slash most of the tariffs on each other's goods.

Trump offered few details about that development, but said it was ""maybe the most important thing"" to come out of the high-level trade talks between the two superpowers in Geneva, Switzerland, over the weekend.

Trump indicated that those purported commitments have not been cemented yet.

""We have to get it papered,"" he said at the White House before signing an executive order on U.S. drug prices. ""But they've agreed to open up China.""

Trump's remarks came hours after U.S. and Chinese officials said they struck an agreement to pause most tariffs and other trade barriers for 90 days.

The U.S. agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on China to 30%, down from 145%. Beijing said it will lower tariffs on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.

Trump said Monday morning that tariffs on China would not go back to 145%, even if a longer-term deal cannot be reached once the 90-day pause expires.

""But they would go up substantially,"" Trump added.

The U.S. side of the temporary agreement shrinks Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs on China to 10%. The U.S. is also maintaining 20% tariffs that were previously imposed over allegations about China's role in bringing fentanyl to America.

The U.S. said it will additionally retain tariffs that were in place for specific Chinese products, including steel and aluminum, before early April.

China will also ""suspend or remove the non-tariff countermeasures"" it has imposed on the U.S. since April 2, according to the White House.

The duties that Trump slapped on China in April effectively established a trade embargo with one of America's largest suppliers of goods.

The agreement to temporarily suspend tariffs is set to begin Wednesday.

The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's remarks.

The bitcoin mining company backed by President Donald Trump's sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., is set to go public on the Nasdaq through an all-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining.

Shares of Gryphon were up more than 300% Monday.

The combined company, American Bitcoin, will trade under the ticker symbol ""ABTC,"" with the transaction expected to close as early as the third quarter of 2025.

Existing stockholders of American Bitcoin, including the president's two eldest sons, will own about 98% of the new entity.

It is the latest high-profile move from the Trump family's growing crypto empire, which already includes the controversial $TRUMP meme coin that is offering a private dinner with the president to top holders of the coin.

Eric Trump, who is a co-founder and chief strategy officer of the mining firm, framed the move as part of a broader strategy to cement the country's leadership in the global bitcoin mining race.

""Every single sophisticated country is using their excess power to mine bitcoin,"" Trump previously told CNBC.

He distanced himself from any direct involvement with his father's administration but made clear his belief that the U.S. must maintain a competitive edge in the crypto sector.

""We won the space race. We better win the crypto race,"" he said.

On the campaign trail, the president repeatedly promised to support U.S.-based bitcoin miners, including telling executives at a closed-door event in Mar-a-Lago that he wants all future bitcoin should be minted on American soil.

The administration's latest executive orders loosen environmental restrictions and encourage more fossil fuel development — a boon for oilfield miners, even as critics warn it could come at a steep climate cost.

The crypto market showed little reaction. Bitcoin is trading at around $104,000, roughly flat over the past 24 hours.

American Bitcoin is being carved out of energy infrastructure platform Hut 8's broader energy and artificial intelligence infrastructure platform, a move designed to separate its mining operations and unlock new capital.

Shares of Hut 8 were up 10% Monday.

President Donald Trump on Monday revived a controversial policy that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicine in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad.

Trump signed an executive order including several different actions to renew that effort, known as the ""most favored nation"" policy. He did not refer to specific nations, but signaled that he would target other developed countries because ""there are some countries that need some additional help, and that's fine.""

""Basically, what we're doing is equalizing,"" Trump said during a press event on Monday. ""We are going to pay the lowest price there is in the world. We will get whoever is paying the lowest price, that's the price that we're going to get.""

White House officials did not disclose which medications the order will apply to, but said it will impact the commercial market as well as Medicare and Medicaid. They said Monday's announcement will be broader than a similar policy that Trump tried to push during his first term, which only applied to Medicare Part B drugs.

Officials added that the administration will have a particular focus on drugs that have the ""largest disparities and largest expenditures,"" which could include popular weight loss and diabetes treatments called GLP-1 drugs.

It's unclear how effective the policy will be at lowering costs for patients. In a social media post on Monday, Trump claimed drug prices will be cut by ""59%, PLUS!""

But Trump during the press event claimed drug prices may fall even more, between 59% and 80%, or ""I guess even 90%.""

Some Wall Street analysts and other experts also questioned whether the policy can be implemented.

In a note on Monday, JPMorgan analysts called the policy ""challenging to practically implement"" because it would likely require congressional approval and could run into legal hurdles.

It is Trump's latest effort to try to rein in U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank.

In a statement on Monday, the pharmaceutical industry's biggest lobbying group, PhRMA, lauded Trump for taking aim at other nations ""not paying their fair share."" 

Still, PhRMA's CEO Stephen Ubl said ""importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for American patients and workers"" because it would hurt the industry's ability to bring them new treatments. Some experts have said the order could face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in court.

Despite the order, shares of U.S. drugmakers rose Monday. Merck's stock added more than 4%, while Pfizer and Amgen climbed more than 2%

AARP, which advocates for older Americans, thanked Trump for issuing the order in a statement on Monday.

 ""For too long, big drug companies have been ripping off America's seniors—charging the highest prices in the world for lifesaving prescriptions, padding their profits at the expense of American lives, and forcing older adults to skip medications they can't afford,"" AARP's chief advocacy and engagement officer Nancy LeaMond said in the statement.

Part of the order takes aim at nations abroad, which have more power to negotiate down drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.

""Starting today, the United States will no longer subsidize the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing,"" Trump said, adding the U.S. ""will no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from Big Pharma.""

He added that ""it was really the countries that forced Big Pharma to do things that, frankly, I'm not sure they really felt comfortable doing.""

The order directs the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce to crack down on ""unreasonable and discriminatory policies"" in foreign countries that ""suppress"" drug prices abroad, the officials said.

""We are going to be working to make sure that countries aren't being unfair in their negotiations with pharmaceutical companies, right?"" one official said. Drugmakers are ""constantly complaining"" about being put ""in an untenable situation when in these negotiations"" because those companies typically have to broker drug discounts with entire countries, the official added.

Unlike the U.S., several foreign countries offer universal health coverage where the government is the sole payer, giving it significant leverage to negotiate or set drug prices.

White House officials said they expect drugmakers to provide discounts across the board to ""reciprocate"" the actions the Trump administration is taking to address prices abroad.

Trump's order also directs the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a pathway for U.S. patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers at most favored nation prices, bypassing middlemen.

""We're going to cut out the middlemen and facilitate the direct sale of drugs at the most favorite nation price, directly to the American citizen,"" Trump said.

Within 30 days, the secretary will also have to set clear targets for price reductions across all markets in the U.S., according to the officials. That will open up a round of negotiations between HHS and the pharmaceutical industry, officials said, not providing exact details on the nature of those talks.

If ""adequate progress"" is not made toward those price targets, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will impose the most favored nation pricing on drugs through rulemaking.

The order also directs the Food and Drug Administration to consider expanding imports from other developed nations beyond Canada. Trump signed a separate executive order in April directing the FDA to improve the process by which states can apply to import lower-cost drugs from Canada, among other actions intended to lower drug prices.

Monday's order also directs the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission to aggressively enforce ""anti-competitive actions"" that keep prices high in the U.S.

The Department of Commerce will also consider export restrictions that ""fuel and enable that low pricing abroad."" 

Drugmakers have argued that the most favored nation policy would hurt their profits and ultimately, their ability to research and develop new medicines.

White House officials contended that pharmaceutical companies will continue to make money after the price cuts if they realize that the U.S. ""alone is not going to pay for innovation"" and if they increase prices abroad to get additional revenue there.

Drugmakers ""should pursue deals where they get financially rewarded commensurate the value that they are providing to other nations, health systems,"" one official said.

""Other countries should pay research and development, too. It's for their benefit,"" Trump added on Monday.

The industry also lobbied against similar Trump plans during his first term. He tried to push the policy through in the final months of that term, but a federal judge halted the effort following a lawsuit from the pharmaceutical industry. The Biden administration then rescinded that policy.

White House officials initially pressed congressional Republicans to include a most favored nation provision in the major reconciliation bill they plan to pass in the coming months, but the policy would have specifically targeted Medicaid drug costs, Politico reported earlier this month. Several GOP members opposed that measure.

The industry's largest trade group, PhRMA, estimated that Trump's Medicaid proposal could cost drugmakers as much as $1 trillion over a decade. 

Some health policy experts have said a most favored nation drug policy may not be effective at lowering medication costs.

For example, USC experts said the policy ""can't undo the basic economics of the global drug marketplace,"" where 70% of pharmaceutical profits worldwide come from the U.S.

""Facing a choice between deep cuts in their U.S. pricing or the loss of weakly profitable overseas markets, we can expect many firms to pull out from overseas markets at their earliest opportunity,"" experts said in a report in April. 

That will leave Americans paying the same amount for medications, drugmakers with lower profits and future generations of patients with less innovation, they said.

""In sum, everyone loses,"" the experts said.

Even if the drug industry pushes back on Trump's executive order in court, his administration still has another tool to push down drug prices: Medicare drug price negotiations.

It's a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act that gives Medicare the power to negotiate certain prescription drug prices with manufacturers for the first time in history.

Trump last month proposed a change to that policy that drugmakers have long sought. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle could be receptive to the idea, which proposes changing rules that differentiate between small-molecule drugs and biologic medicines.

Trump last week said he plans to announce tariffs on medicines imported into the U.S. within the next two weeks. Those planned levies aim to boost domestic drug manufacturing. 

Drugmakers, including Eli Lilly and Pfizer, are pushing back on those potential duties. Some companies have questioned whether the tariffs are necessary, given that several of them have already announced new U.S. manufacturing and research and development investments since Trump took office. 

Still, Trump last week doubled down on efforts to reshore drug manufacturing. He signed an executive order that streamlines the path for drugmakers to build new production sites.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that the trade agreement reached over the weekend represents another stage in the U.S. shaking its reliance on Chinese products.

Though the U.S. ""decoupling"" itself from its need for cheap imports from China has been discussed for years, the process has been a slow one and unlikely to ever mean a complete break.

However, Bessent said there are now specific elements of decoupling in place that are vital to U.S. interests. The U.S. imported nearly $440 billion in goods from China in 2024, running a $295.4 billion trade deficit.

""We do not want a generalized decoupling from China,"" he said during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""But what we do want is a decoupling for strategic necessities, which we were unable to obtain during Covid and we realized that efficient supply chains were not resilient supply chains.""

When the pandemic struck in 2020, demand in the U.S. shifted from one reliant more on services to a greater focus on goods. That meant greater difficulty in obtaining material for multiple products including big-ticket appliances and automobiles. The technology industry, with its reliance on semiconductors, was also hit. What followed was an inflation surge in the U.S. not seen in more than 40 years.

The details of the U.S.-China pact are still sketchy, but U.S. officials have said so-called reciprocal tariffs will be suspended though broad-based 10% duties will remain in effect.

""We are going to create our own steel. [Tariffs] protect our steel industry. They work on critical medicines, on semiconductors,"" Bessent said. ""We are doing that, and the reciprocal tariffs have nothing to do with the specific-industry tariffs.""

The agreement between the two sides is essentially a 90-day pause that will see reciprocal duties halted though the 10% tariff as well as a 20% charge related to fentanyl remain in place.

Bessent expressed encouragement on the fentanyl issue in which Chinese officials ""are now serious about assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of precursor drugs."" Bessent did not indicate a specific date when the next round of talks will be held but indicated it should be in the next several weeks.

Market watchers have labeled the new U.S.-China deal to temporarily cut tariffs ""better than expected,"" ""more workable"" and even a ""dream scenario"" — and are expecting more near-term relief for investors.

Under the deal, so-called reciprocal tariffs will drop from over 100% to 10% on both sides. The Trump administration will keep 20% fentanyl-related tariffs on China in place, meaning America's total duties on Chinese imports will stand at 30% while the 90-day pause is effective.

Stocks in Europe and Asia rallied after the terms of the U.S.-China agreement were announced, with Europe's Stoxx 600 index gaining 1%, Germany's DAX hitting a 1-year high, and Hong Kong-listed shares jumping by around 3%.

On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures also pointed to a rally, with Nasdaq futures up 3.8%, S&P 500 futures rising by 2.8% and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gaining 3.1%.

Analysts and strategists said on Monday that the new U.S.-China arrangement could reignite risk-on sentiment, benefiting stocks and U.S. assets.

In a note to clients on Monday, Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at JPMorgan Asset Management, said the deal unveiled in Geneva was better than anticipated, but uncertainty remained.

""The magnitude of this tariff reduction is larger than expected,"" he said, although he noted that it would be difficult for Beijing and Washington to reach a more concrete trade arrangement in just three months.

""The 90-day period may not be sufficient for the two sides to reach a detailed agreement, but it keeps the pressure on the negotiation process,"" Hui said. ""We are still waiting for further details on other terms of this agreement, for example, whether China would relax on rare earth export restrictions.""

However, Hui acknowledged the positive market reaction to the news.

""Overall, we expect the market to get back on to a risk-on sentiment in the near term,"" he said. ""Pressure on the [Federal Reserve] to cut rates may also ease for the time being.""

Jordan Rochester, head of currency strategy EMEA and executive director at Mizuho Bank in London, touted the deal as ""much better news than expected"" in a Monday morning note. He argued that the developments would mean ""the 'Sell America' narrative [gets] squeezed.""

U.S. assets, including the dollar, Treasurys and stocks, have seen major volatility in the weeks since Trump unveiled the full extent of his tariffs plans.

On Monday morning, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the value of the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was up 1%. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note was up by 6 basis points as the price edged lower.

According to Rochester, the 90-day deal takes the effective U.S. tariff rate — what Chinese companies will actually end up paying — from 108.8% to 27%, which he noted was well above the market consensus of a reduction to the range of 50% to 60%.

""It is also notable how [officials] played down the requirement for talks to continue past 90 days in the press conference with 'as long as talks are constructive,'"" he said. ""What this means for international trade is the de facto 'tariff wall' has been lowered to something more workable and also raises the market pricing of other countries to get similar treatment when in talks with the US down the line.""

The better-than-expected results from the trade negotiations mean stocks could rally further, according to Wall Street strategists.

""Although stocks have rebounded, there is still much dispersion [between] domestics and exporters under the hood, dollar risk premium remains high, and overall positioning is light/defensive,"" Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays, said in an emailed statement. ""Pain trade to the upside means stocks have room to overshoot.""

Meanwhile, strategists at Deutsche Bank said their sentiment had been significantly boosted by the morning's news. They are now expecting U.S. stocks to outperform their European rivals in the short term.

""Today's announcement even exceeds our constructive expectations,"" they said. ""In our view, this announcement is not only better than we expected but also better than the market would have expected back in March.

""Although it is hard to tell how this will develop after the 90-day period, the implications for markets are clearly supportive ... Stay bullish and consider stepping back into China tariff-exposed sectors (ex Autos, Health Care and Chips).""

Mikkel Emil Jensen, senior analyst at Sydbank, said the 90-day tariff pause marked a major de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.

""[It] removes a large chunk of uncertainty related to world trade — at least for now,"" Mikkel Emil Jensen, senior analyst at Sydbank, told CNBC after the news was announced.

""The deal might be temporary, but the deal is better than expected and could ignite positive ripple effects on global trade and increase the demand for container freight,"" the Sydbank analyst said. Shares of shipping giant Maersk were over 12% higher on Monday morning.

""More so, the temporary deal might boost the front-loading effect, triggering companies to increase inventories before a potential worsening of the trade war,"" Jensen added.

Also reacting to the news, Wedbush's Dan Ives said he believed the U.S.-China deal was ""clearly just the start of broader and more comprehensive negotiations,"" describing the news as ""a huge win for the market and bulls.""

""We would expect both these tariff numbers to move down markedly over the coming months as deal talks progress,"" he said in a note. ""The baseline view heading into the weekend was some de-escalation of US/China tariffs and the agreement for more talks ... instead in a dream scenario this morning [officials] came out of these talks with massive cuts to reciprocal tariffs.""

Ives, who's known for his bullish outlook on tech, argued that the agreement meant new highs for markets and tech stocks were ""now on the table in 2025.""

Trade between the world's two largest economies is expected to swiftly resume following the cut in tariffs, reversing the decline in freight vessels and shipping containers since the tariffs announcement in early April.

Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter, said the new deal was ""not quite as good as the 20% level that existed before so-called Liberation Day,"" but added that the temporary agreement would enable ""a considerable proportion of trade resume, albeit at slightly higher prices.""

A new U.S. rule that requires hotel and short-term lodging companies to disclose so-called ""junk fees"" starts Monday.  

Announced by the Federal Trade Commission in December, the rule takes direct aim at the widely loathed charges, which can appear as ""resort,"" ""destination"" or ""hospitality service"" fees and purport to grant perks that travelers either don't want or already expect to receive.  

These include ""premium"" internet service and access to a hotel gym.

The rule, which also applies to live event ticketing companies, was designed to curtail a practice that allowed businesses to charge more ""without looking like you're raising prices,"" Cathy Mansfield from the Case Western Reserve Law School told CNBC in December.  

The professor, who specializes in consumer and commercial law, had one caveat: ""I really hope the Trump administration doesn't cut the enforcement staff at the FTC and the CFPB.""  

But since the rule was announced, the Trump administration has pushed to eliminate nearly 90% of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's staff and fired two FTC commissioners — actions which are being challenged in the U.S. court system.

As a result, Mansfield said she now believes the new rule is less likely to protect consumers.    

""With the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau already incapacitated by the Trump administration, there probably won't be new protections for consumers — a rollback of existing protections where possible, and absolutely no enforcement of rules. This means no protection at all for consumers,"" she said.  

In response, Chris Mufarrige, the director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, told CNBC that the agency ""is working hard to protect consumers and will continue to pursue enforcement actions against companies that violate the law, including through the new deceptive fee rule.""

The Trump Administration also targeted fees in the live entertainment industry through an executive order on March 31 that directed the FTC to ensure price transparency ""at all stages of the ticket-purchase process."" 

The CFPB did not reply to CNBC's request for comment. 

Laurent Bacinski, a French citizen, was hit by undisclosed junk fees during a trip to New York City.  

He pre-paid for his trip through a travel app but was still charged a $500 deposit by his hotel at check-in, from which the hotel deducted taxes and a nightly ""destination fee."" These fees provided high-speed internet, discounts on sightseeing tours and a credit at the hotel mini-mart.  

""The destination fee is forced sale of services I don't need,"" he told CNBC Travel.  

Disclosure of these fees is the crux of the FTC's rule, which does not aim to eliminate them, but rather to ensure travelers know they exist.

""The Junk Fees rule is rooted in a simple but powerful principle: transparency,"" said Mansfield. ""When consumers can see the full price up front — whether they're booking a hotel, buying concert tickets or paying a service fee — they're in a better position to make informed decisions and avoid being misled.""

This transparency has already begun, said Lauren Wolfe, counsel for Travelers United, a non-profit organization that has sued Hyatt, Hilton, Sonesta and Accor over the issue of resort fees.  

""We have seen a lot more voluntary compliance since the rule was announced in December,"" she said.  

Airbnb announced in April that it began displaying cleaning and service fees upfront for customers worldwide.

Wolfe referenced another bill, the Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, which cleared the U.S. House of Representatives in April, and is now set to go before the Senate.  

""The combo of the FTC rule, plus a bill that has bipartisan support —  and looks like it will pass — in Congress shows that ending hidden hotel resort fees is one issue today that unites all Americans,"" she said. 

CNBC Travel analyzed 10 booking websites for a two-night stay at Balboa Bay Resort, a hotel in Newport Beach, California that charges a $40 daily resort fee, as stated on the hotel's website.  

Of the 10 sites, seven disclosed the fee in various ways — either as a ""destination fee,"" ""property fee"" or ""property service charge"" — and three did not.

If travelers encounter a hotel or short-term rental charging undisclosed fees, Mansfield recommends filing a complaint with the FTC. Penalties for violating the new rule can exceed $50,000.  

""The FTC has a really easy-to-use online complaint system, and they tally complaints that help them see what's happening the market,"" she said. 

She also suggested using the CFPB's online complaint system, she said. ""They actually forward the complaint to the company ... that will sometimes get things resolved because companies don't want to be in the crosshairs of the CFPB,"" she said.  

Mansfield said travelers can also contact the consumer fraud division of their state Attorney General's office. ""I would say complain to both federal and state"" authorities, she said.

If all else fails, travelers can also consider airing their complaint on social media.   

""Sometimes with companies, the squeaky wheel gets the grease.""

Global technology and chip stocks rallied on Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to pause most tariffs on each other's goods.

Technology stocks — such as semiconductor firms and smartphone makers — have been hit hard as trade tensions between the world's two largest economies threatened to disrupt supply chains and hurt some of the biggest U.S. businesses.

But investors breathed a sigh of relief after talks between the U.S. and China over the weekend yielded a temporary pause in ""reciprocal"" tariffs.

In the U.S., Nvidia, which still faces a number of restrictions on the chips it is allowed to ship to China, was around 4% higher on Monday, while AMD was up nearly 6%. Broadcom was also around 5% higher, along with Qualcomm.

Other companies in the semiconductor supply chain also jumped. Marvell, which last week postponed a previously scheduled investor day due to macroeconomic uncertainty, surged 7%.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest chipmaker, saw its U.S.-listed shares jump around 6%. TSMC's Taiwan-listed stock closed before the tariff announcement.

In Europe, ASML, a supplier of critical machinery required to manufacture the most advanced chips, rallied 4%. Infineon was also sharply higher.

Semiconductors and some electronics received an exemption from President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs last month, but the U.S. signaled the reprieve was temporary and that these products could still be in line for special duties.

Investors have been concerned about the impact on major tech stocks, especially those with exposure to China such as Apple and Amazon, whose shares have been under pressure this year.

Apple, which still makes 90% of its iPhones in China, said during its earnings report this month that it expects tariffs will add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter. Apple shares are roughly 6% higher.

Amazon is up about 8% on Monday. Many sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese products.

U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks also surged. Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com were higher, alongside internet firm Baidu.

""With US/China clearly on an accelerated path for a broader deal we believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table in 2025 as investors will likely focus on the next steps in these trade discussions which will happen over the coming months,"" Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note on Monday.

""This morning is a huge win for the bulls and a best case scenario post this weekend in our view.""

Celebrity musicians from Elton John to Dua Lipa are urging the U.K. government to rethink controversial plans to reform copyright laws that allow artificial intelligence developers access to rights-protected content.

An open letter signed by John, Lipa and a host of other high-profile artists, this weekend called on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to back an amendment proposed by U.K. lawmaker Beeban Kidron to make the legal framework around AI model makers' use of copyrighted content more strict.

""We are wealth creators, we reflect and promote the national stories, we are the innovators of the future, and AI needs us as much as it needs energy and computer skills,"" they said in the letter.

""We will lose an immense growth opportunity if we give our work away at the behest of a handful of powerful overseas tech companies.""

Late last year, the U.K. government kicked off a consultation on proposals that would give tech giants and AI labs like OpenAI a legally sound way of using copyrighted content to train their advanced foundational models.

Under the proposals, artists would have to opt out of having their copyright-protected works from being scraped by large language models. LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini rely on huge amounts of data to generate humanlike responses in the form of text, images, video and audio.

This led to concerns from the U.K.'s creative industries, as it would mean placing the onus on content creators to request not to have their data used for the training of AI models — which, they argue, would amount to giving their valuable work away.

The open letter published on Saturday calls on the government to embrace an amendment put forward by Beeban Kidron, a lawmaker in the upper house of U.K. Parliament.

The amendment would require tech giants and AI labs to tell copyright owners which individual works they have used to train their AI models — and, according to the letter, ""put transparency at the heart of the copyright regime and allow both AI developers and creators to develop licensing regimes that will allow for human-created content well into the future.""

""To parliamentarians on all sides of the political spectrum and in both Houses, we urge you to vote in support of the UK creative industries,"" the letter reads. ""Supporting us supports the creators of the future. Our work is not yours to give away.""

A spokesman for the government told CNBC that it wants the U.K.'s creative industries and AI firms to ""flourish,"" adding no changes to the proposed measures will be considered unless it's ""completely satisfied they work for creators.""

""It's vital we take the time to work through the range of responses to our consultation, but equally important that we put in the groundwork now as we consider the next steps,"" the spokesman said.

""That is why we have committed to publishing a report and economic impact assessment – exploring the broad range of issues and options on all sides of the debate.""

Nissan Motor will additionally slash more than 10,000 jobs globally, bringing the total cuts including previously announced layoffs to about 20,000 or 15% of its workforce, Japan's public broadcaster NHK reported on Monday.

The struggling Japanese automaker warned last month it would likely book a record 700 billion yen to 750 billion yen ($4.74 billion-$5.08 billion) net loss in the financial year that ended in March due to impairment charges. 

Japan's third-biggest automaker is set to announce its full-year results on Tuesday.

It declined to comment on the report.

Nissan is looking to make its business leaner and more resilient after doing poorly in its top market the United States, where its performance suffered heavily from a lack of hybrids and an ageing line-up. 

It is also struggling in China, where it is looking to stop a punishing sales slide with the launch of some 10 new vehicles in the coming years.

Nissan, which had more than 133,000 employees as of March last year, had already been looking to slash 9,000 jobs and reduce global capacity by 20% as part of its restructuring plans.

Its weak performance forced it to cut its profit outlook four times for the financial year that just ended.

Chegg said on Monday it would lay off about 22% of its workforce, or 248 employees, to cut costs and streamline its operations as students increasingly turn to AI-powered tools such as ChatGPT over traditional education technology platforms.

The company, an online education firm that offers textbook rentals, homework help and tutoring, has been grappling with a decline in web traffic for months and warned that the trend would likely worsen before improving.

Google's expansion of AI Overviews is keeping web traffic confined within its search ecosystem while gradually shifting searches to its Gemini AI platform, Chegg said, adding that other AI companies including OpenAI and Anthropic were courting academics with free access to subscriptions.

As part of the restructuring announced on Monday, Chegg will also shut its U.S. and Canada offices by the end of the year and aim to reduce its marketing, product development efforts and general and administrative expenses.

The majority of the resulting charges of $34 million to $38 million are expected to be incurred in the second and third quarters.

Chegg expects cost savings of between $45 and $55 million in 2025 and $100 to $110 million in 2026 due to the restructuring.

It also reported first-quarter results on Monday, saying subscribers declined 31% in the period to 3.2 million. Revenue declined 30% to $121 million, as its subscription services revenue fell by nearly a third to $108 million.

In February, Chegg sued Google saying Google's internet search engine was eroding demand for original content and undermining publishers' ability to compete with its artificial intelligence-generated overviews, thereby causing a drop in visitors and subscribers.

Chegg had 1,271 employees as of December 31.

A catastrophic power outage affecting much of Spain, Portugal and the south of France has thrust the role of renewables and energy security into the spotlight.

An abrupt and widespread blackout, one of Europe's worst in living memory, affected the entire Iberian Peninsula on April 28.

The outage, which lasted for several hours, plunged much of the region into darkness, stranded thousands of train passengers and left millions without phone or internet coverage or access to cash from ATMs.

Spanish authorities have since launched several investigations to determine the root cause of the incident, including a probe into whether a cyberattack could be to blame.

Alongside Spanish opposition parties, some external observers have flagged renewables and net-zero emissions targets as possible reasons for the outage, particularly given Spain and Portugal both rely on high levels of wind and solar for their electricity grid.

""It's very sad to see what's happened to Portugal and Spain and so many people there, but you know, when you hitch your wagon to the weather, it's just a risky endeavor,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on April 28.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the country's grid operator Red Electrica de Espana (REE) have both said record levels of renewable energy were not at fault for the blackout.

European Union energy chief Dan Jorgensen, meanwhile, said that there was ""nothing unusual"" about the sources of energy supplying electricity to the system at the time of the outage.

""So, the causes of the blackout cannot be reduced to a specific source of energy, for instance renewables,"" he added.

European energy technology companies called for observers to refrain from drawing their own conclusions in the absence of a formal explanation from authorities.

Henrik Andersen, CEO of Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas, said he'd encourage ""a degree of statesmanship"" over the blackout, particularly as Spanish policymakers continue to investigate.

""First of all, energy security means that you can run societies without having blackouts. That's stating the obvious,"" Andersen told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday.

""Everyone is grasping quick root causes and blaming each other, and I simply just don't want to go there because until we know the root cause of why grids can fail across Spain and Portugal, let's not second guess or try to blame someone at cybersecurity or blame individual energy sources,"" he added.

""Europe needs more energy -- and we probably also need a stronger grid. That goes without saying,"" Andersen said.

Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch, meanwhile, said the German energy tech group was holding talks with the relevant transmission and utility operators following the blackout.

""What you do see is that when you build an energy system, you need to think about the generation, like solar, wind, gas, whatever, but you also need to think about how the overall system on the grid side [is[ operating and how you stabilize that,"" Bruch told CNBC on Thursday.

""This is sometimes underestimated in its complexity, and this is why products from us for grid stabilizations are in demand at the moment to balance these things out,"" he continued.

""It's possible to solve it but it will require investments and it's not easy. It's not just a couple of solar cells and some batteries. It's a little bit more complex than this,"" Bruch said.

For those on the ground at the time of the outage, the lack of power underlined the challenges of a digital society.

""Cash suddenly becomes really important,"" Roseanna, a resident of the southern Spanish city of Málaga, told CNBC. She said she only had 40 euros ($45.16) available when the power cut just after midday.

""Obviously you can't get money out and you can't pay with card, so it's certainly important to have a little bit of cash in your pocket at all times,"" she continued.

""We've gone all digital but the system's ruined if there's no electricity,"" Roseanna said.

Shares of KindlyMD skyrocketed 600% Monday after the healthcare company announced a merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, a key cryptocurrency advisor to President Donald Trump.

The newly formed company has secured $200 million in convertible debt and $510 million in fresh capital through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, offering shares at $1.12 each.

The raise drew support from more than 200 investors, including Actai Ventures, Arrington Capital, BSQ Capital Partners, Kingsway, Van Eck, and Yorkville Advisors.

The roster of individual investors reads like a who's who of bitcoin — cryptographer Adam Back; Balaji Srinivasan, a former Coinbase executive; Jihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain; and Ricardo Salinas, the Mexican billionaire who has become one of bitcoin's most vocal supporters.

Bitcoin was trading above $104,000 Monday morning. The price of the crytocurrency lept above $100,000 on Thursday for the first time since February.

Shares of KindlyMD will continue to trade under the ""KDLY"" ticker. The combined company expects to be renamed and will get a new ticker symbol.

Nakamoto, led by Bailey as CEO, will focus on acquiring and holding bitcoin — a strategy that has become popular among investment firms seeking to turn their stock into a direct bet on the cryptocurrency's price.

""We believe a future is coming where every balance sheet – public or private – holds bitcoin,"" Bailey said in a press release.

Bailey isn't the first to chase this model. Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) transformed itself from a software company into a bitcoin holding firm in 2020, converting its cash reserves into bitcoin and watching its stock skyrocket as bitcoin's value surged.

But KindlyMD's foray into crypto is even stranger, given that the company built its brand around combating opioid addiction with holistic health services.

""This merger represents a strategic leap for KindlyMD, allowing us to expand our mission,"" said Tim Pickett, CEO of KindlyMD. ""Nakamoto brings in a team with deep expertise in Bitcoin strategy and unparalleled access to the leading experts in bitcoin treasury management.""

Pickett, who will continue to oversee KindlyMD's healthcare operations, insisted that the clinics will maintain their focus on treating opioid addiction and offering patient-first care.

""It's a bold new vision that will drive long-term value for our shareholders,"" added Pickett.

Bitcoin and crypto have surged over the last few weeks as fears swirl a $2.5 trillion “avalanche” is heading for the U.S. dollar.

The bitcoin price, now nudging its all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, has left stocks in the dust this year, with iPhone-maker Apple quietly confirming a crypto market game-changer.

Now, as a Federal Reserve “nightmare” is coming true, those in the bitcoin and crypto industry are predicting a looming bitcoin price boom as positive catalysts collide.

U.S. president Donald Trump has helped the bitcoin price and wider crypto market soar to ... More never-before-seen levels.

“I truly understood bitcoin in 2011-2012 and in all these years, the bull case for it has never been stronger,” David Marcus, the former president of PayPal who led Facebook's efforts to create its own crypto-inspired currency, posted to X, telling people to, ""buckle up.”

Marcus pointed to recent regulatory changes that mean Wall Street banks can now custody and offer bitcoin to their customers while “sovereign states and corporations are competing to buy.”

The “utility phase of [internet protocol]
 
 TCP/IP for money is taking off,” Marcus wrote.

Positive regulatory changes for bitcoin and crypto have come as U.S. president Donald Trump embraces bitcoin and crypto, declaring himself the first “crypto president” and promising to roll back Biden-era restrictions on the technology.

Trump has also promised to create a bitcoin strategic reserve alongside a crypto stockpile, kickstarting a race among countries to begin holding bitcoin.

“The [bitcoin price] surge reflects a convergence of macro liquidity trends and institutional adoption,” Rich Rines, former lead of Coinbase's money movement engineering and now a contributor with crypto project Core, said in emailed comments.

The bitcoin price has surged toward its all-time highs this month as U.S. president Donald Trump ... More feeds a perfect storm of bullish developments.

“We're seeing steady institutional inflows, signaling growing trust from traditional players. At the same time, state-level reserve policies in the U.S. show bitcoin's role is expanding beyond just investment portfolios.""

Meanwhile, the fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that made their debut at the beginning of 2024 have continued to attract huge inflows.

“While day-to-day prices can be noisy, the longer-term shift looks more structural. What's different this time is the market infrastructure supporting it—like regulated ETFs making it easier for institutions to get exposure, and custody services that help them hold bitcoin securely,"" Rines said.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Coinbase considered adopting a Bitcoin strategy like Michael Saylor's. They ultimately decided against it due to concerns about the risk involved.

Coinbase (COIN) was once tempted by the allure of a Bitcoin strategy straight out of Michael Saylor's playbook. The idea was simple: Put a massive chunk of their balance sheet into Bitcoin. But, despite some serious internal discussions, Coinbase chose not to take that risk. CEO Brian Armstrong admitted that there were times over the years when they seriously considered it. “There were definitely moments over the last 12 years where we thought, man, should we put 80% of our balance sheet into crypto — into Bitcoin specifically?” he told Bloomberg in a May 9 video call.





Armstrong explained why Coinbase stepped back from the aggressive Bitcoin buy-in. “We made a conscious choice about risk,” he said. The fear was simple: A massive Bitcoin buy could jeopardize Coinbase's cash flow and hurt the crypto exchange's stability. This caution wasn't just about money. Coinbase also didn't want to find itself competing with its own customers. By not committing a significant chunk of its assets into Bitcoin, Coinbase preserved its role as a trusted intermediary rather than an investment competitor in the market.

While Coinbase chose not to go all-in on Bitcoin, it still holds a considerable amount. The exchange owns 9,480 BTC, worth roughly $988 million at current prices. This makes Coinbase the ninth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world, just behind companies like Strategy (MSTR) and Tesla (TSLA). In fact, Coinbase continues to build its Bitcoin reserves. In the first quarter of 2025, it announced a $153 million purchase of crypto assets, largely concentrated in Bitcoin. So while Coinbase isn't following the path laid out by Saylor, it's certainly not ignoring Bitcoin's potential.

Coinbase's stock currently holds a Moderate Buy rating from 22 analysts. Of these, 11 analysts have given it a Buy rating, 10 analysts have rated it as Hold, and just one analyst has issued a Sell rating. This consensus shows that, despite some skepticism, a majority of analysts remain optimistic about Coinbase's future.

The average COIN price target is set at $256.60, reflecting an upside of 21.61% from its current price of $211.00. The highest price target from analysts reaches $400.00, suggesting significant growth potential if the market sentiment continues to favor the exchange. The lowest target is $169.00, providing a more conservative outlook should macroeconomic conditions affect the broader market or Coinbase's business operations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Bitcoin, altcoins poised to rally on US-China tariff agreement","https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-china-tariff-truce-crypto-market-rally","Mon, 12 May 2025 13:32:03 GMT","

 The constructive tone of tariff negotiations removes the risks of “sudden re-escalation,” potentially paving the way for risk assets to surpass their January peaks, analysts said. 

A 90-day tariff agreement between the US and China may set the stage for a broader recovery of stock and cryptocurrency markets, as investors look ahead to a potential tax relief package.

The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels.  

Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  

“The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”

The constructive tone of the negotiations, along with the 90-day suspension of additional tariffs, removes the risk of “sudden re-escalation,” which may help altcoins and traditional stock markets follow Bitcoin's (BTC) price recovery, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen.

“Bitcoin is already trading close to its all-time highs,” Barthere told Cointelegraph. “However, with the latest easing in trade tensions, it now appears that altcoins, US equities, and the US Dollar Index (DXY) are well-positioned for a catch-up rally.”

She noted that Bitcoin has outperformed risk assets in recent months due to its insulation from tariff-related risks.

“I also expect the US dollar to perform strongly against prior safe-haven currencies such as the euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen, reflecting improved global risk sentiment,” Barthere added.

Nansen previously predicted a 70% chance for crypto and stocks to find their bottom by June, with their price recovery depending on the outcome of trade negotiations.

Bitcoin is currently 4.8% away from recapturing its all-time high of over $109,800 recorded in January 2025, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.

“There is potential for risk assets to move beyond the January peak levels if we see a generous tax cut package materialize,” Barthere told Cointelegraph, adding:

She noted that Bessent hinted such a package could be unveiled by mid-July, which would act as a “significant additional catalyst” for the markets.  

The constructive trade negotiations, paired with emerging technical chart patterns, have spurred analyst calls for a Bitcoin rally to $150,000, depending on the outcome of an emerging bull flag pattern on the weekly chart.

The crypto bull market is starting, with Bitcoin price nearing its all-time high and most altcoins surging by double digits from their lowest levels this year. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has jumped above $104,000, and analysts remain highly bullish on its performance. BlackRock expects it to eventually climb to $700,000, while Ark Invest has set a target of $2.4 million. 

Bitcoin has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, a popular continuation signal. This formation includes a horizontal resistance line, a rounded bottom, and a period of consolidation. Since the cup has a depth of 32%, projecting that same distance from the breakout level suggests a potential target of $142,000.

A strong Bitcoin rally will likely trigger further gains across altcoins. If that happens, some of the top altcoins to watch during this bull run are Sui (SUI), Polkadot (DOT), and Ripple (XRP).

Sui is one of the fastest-growing layer-1 blockchains in the crypto space. Its total value locked has surged 67% in the past 30 days to $2.9 billion, while its 24-hour DEX volume recently hit over $689 million. Much of this growth has been fueled by an expanding meme coin ecosystem.

Technicals indicate that Sui has more upside ahead. The three-day chart shows it has entered the fifth phase of the Elliott Wave pattern. 

Elliott Wave theory outlines five stages of price movement: the first, third, and fifth waves tend to be bullish, while the second and fourth are corrective pullbacks. 

Therefore, Sui price will likely rise and hit the all-time high of $5.2382, which is about 30% above the current level. A move above that resistance will point to more gains, potentially to $10 if the crypto bull run continues.

Polkadot is another quality coin to buy in this crypto bull run. Its case is mostly because of its strong technicals, as crypto.news has covered here and here. 

The weekly chart shows the coin has formed a quadruple bottom pattern, having failed to break below the $3.50 support level three times since 2023. The neckline of this formation lies at $11.5. DOT has already moved above the psychological barrier at $5, suggesting that a move to $11.50 is likely, around 120% higher than its current price.

Polkadot's ongoing transition to Polkadot 2.0 supports this outlook. Developers have already implemented asynchronous backing and agile coretime. Now, they are working on elastic scaling, which launched on Kusama last week. These upgrades aim to make Polkadot one of the most attractive platforms for decentralized applications. DOT could also benefit if the SEC approves a spot DOT ETF.

XRP is another leading altcoin positioned for gains in this crypto bull cycle, bolstered by both strong technicals and fundamental catalysts. 

Technically, XRP has also formed an Elliott Wave structure and is currently in the fifth wave. The fourth wave formed a triangle pattern, which has since evolved into a bullish pennant, a widely recognized bullish continuation pattern.

XRP has now broken above the upper boundary of the pennant, indicating a likely move toward its year-to-date high of $3.40, and potentially $5.

Fundamentally, XRP remains strong. Anticipation around the approval of a spot XRP ETF, the emergence of XRP meme coins, and the continued development of the XRP Ledger are key drivers of its current bullish outlook.

Crypto whales are aggressively buying into five altcoins following the recent US-China trade deal, with notable spikes in accumulation across SEND, GOAT, MEW, WLD, and PLUME. Sendcoin surged 49% in 24 hours as whale holdings jumped over 35%, while GOAT saw a 197% weekly gain alongside a 12.48% increase in large-holder positions. 

MEW and Worldcoin also attracted major whale interest, with holdings up 12.67% and 8% respectively over the past few days. PLUME rounded out the list with a 42% whale accumulation spike, reinforcing its momentum as a rising RWA token.

Sendcoin, a Solana token positioning itself as a “collective of sovereign startups” powered by a unified marketing engine, has surged nearly 40% in the past 24 hours.

The sharp rally comes amid strong interest from crypto whales, who have been steadily accumulating the token over recent days.

Whale holdings in SEND jumped more than 35% since yesterday, rising from 33.79 million to 45.7 million tokens. 

This accumulation has pushed SEND's fully diluted valuation (FDV) close to $18 million, signaling growing confidence in coin.

GOAT, once one of the most popular tokens in the Solana ecosystem, had been in a deep correction throughout 2025, dropping 58% year-to-date. 

However, sentiment is starting to shift as GOAT has surged nearly 197% over the past seven days, making it the second-best performing Solana token with a market cap above $200 million.

Whale activity is also picking up, with large holders increasing their positions by 12.48% since May 9. 

Their total holdings rose from 116.18 million to 131.09 million GOAT tokens, suggesting renewed confidence in the project's potential as momentum returns.

MEW has gained strong momentum over the past week, climbing 52% and pushing its market cap to $368 million. 

The rally comes amid a notable uptick in whale accumulation, with large holders increasing their MEW positions by 12.67% in just a few hours—rising from 2.47 billion to 2.8 billion tokens.

Smart money activity is also heating up for the meme coin. 

Although overall accumulation slowed slightly in the last few hours, total holdings remain up, and one smart wallet alone bought approximately $378,000 worth of MEW in the past 24 hours—highlighting continued interest from informed investors.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's Worldcoin is back among the top-performing AI tokens, climbing 41% over the past week and reaching a market cap of $1.8 billion.

The surge comes despite recent legal challenges, including a court ruling in Kenya that ordered the deletion of biometric data and a suspension of operations in Indonesia over regulatory violations.

Crypto whales have also been accumulating, increasing their WLD holdings by over 8% between May 8 and May 11. 

While accumulation has remained stable in the last 24 hours, the rise in whale activity highlights growing confidence in the token's market position.

PLUME has emerged as one of the most talked-about RWA tokens in recent weeks, gaining 26% over the past 30 days. 

Its market cap is now nearing $400 million, reflecting growing interest in real-world asset narratives. Analysts predict it will be one of the most interesting crypto narratives for VCs in 2025 Q2.

Whale accumulation has picked up sharply, with holdings jumping 42% in just 24 hours, from 970,000 to 1.38 million PLUME.

One smart wallet alone bought nearly $50,000 worth of the token in the past day.

The cryptocurrency market continues the macro-triggered bull move on Monday after a reassuring weekend supported by multiple catalysts, including the trade agreement between the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK), trade talks between the US and China, as well as a ceasefire and easing border tensions between India and Pakistan. Remarkable double-digit gains in altcoins such as Pi Network (PI), Kaspa (KAS), and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) reflect a broad-based risk-on sentiment likely to keep prices elevated this week.

Pi Network's price upholds a strong bullish momentum backed by a favourable macro environment and anticipation ahead of a major ecosystem announcement expected on May 14.

The token has, in the last 12 days, rallied 105% to trade at $1.26 at the time of writing.  PI's position above the 50- and 100 Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) on the 12-hour chart implies that the uptrend could last longer than anticipated.

A buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator encourages traders to hold their positions. Moreover, the expanding green histograms above the centre line reveal growing bullish momentum for PI, likely to break the immediate resistance at $1.35 and extend the up leg to $1.80, a seller congestion level tested last in March.

PI/USD 12-hour chart

On the other hand, the extremely overbought Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator at 91.61 suggests that Pi Network may be due for a short-term pullback or even consolidation. 

Kaspa's price sits on top of a crucial five-month trendline resistance, accentuating the growing bullish influence in the wider crypto market. After an impressive 134% increase from the tariff-triggered crash to $0.053 on April 7, KAS currently hovers at $0.12, up more than 6% on the day.

The daily chart highlights a solid bullish structure with Kaspa's price above the 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMA. A buy signal from the MACD cements the bullish grip on KAS as bulls knock on the resistance at $0.14. 

A breakout above the nearest resistance at $0.14 could trigger a sharp price surge, with KAS aiming for $0.15—a level last seen in January—and potentially Kaspa's December high of $0.18.

KAS/USD daily chart

Notably, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator entering the overbought region above 70 hints at a strong bullish momentum. Overbought conditions often precede pullbacks due to potential profit-taking, hence the need for traders to prepare for different outcomes, including a retest of the 200-day EMA at $0.10 and the 100-day EMA at $0.09.

Peanut the Squirrel's price hovers close to the weekend high of $0.46, reflecting a slight drawdown on the day. The tailwind behind the token comes amid heightened interest in meme coins.

Based on the daily chart, PNUT remains strongly bullish on Monday, sitting on top of the 50-day ($0.26) and the 100-day EMAs ($0.29). The MACD indicator shows a bullish setup with the MACD line (blue) above the signal line (red), expanding green histograms above the centre line.

PNUT/USDT daily chart

The RSI indicator is at 79.64, having peaked at 84.96 on Friday, indicating overbought conditions. Overbought conditions are often a precursor to a pullback, with PNUT likely to pull back toward the 100-day EMA at $0.29 in search of support and liquidity.

Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 

A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.

Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset's price climbs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Charles Hoskinson says Cardano wants to be the first blockchain with a privacy stablecoin","https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/cardano-founder-says-he-wants-to-create-a-privacy-stablecoin/","Mon, 12 May 2025 14:57:48 GMT","

About us

Copy link

Charles Hoskinson says that Cardano may offer a stablecoin that provides the same privacy as cash.

Speaking on eToro's “Conversations with Leaders” podcast on May 9, the Cardano co-founder proposed privacy-preserving stablecoins as a new frontier for the crypto industry.

“Maybe people don't want to have a stablecoin where every time they buy something it's forever tracked by everyone everywhere,” Hoskinson said.

Stablecoins are a $243 billion crypto market. While being privately issued tokens, stablecoin transactions can be tracked on the public blockchains where they are deployed, like Ethereum and Solana.

Cardano also has stablecoins deployed on its blockchain with a total market size of $31.5 million. Hoskinson says the team is already mulling the idea of being the first ecosystem to create a privacy stablecoin.

The proposal comes as privacy coins face an existential threat.

Privacy has been a core crypto ideal for almost two decades, but that hasn't prevented privacy-enabling cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash from getting delisted and banned from exchanges due to concerns over them being used by criminals.

The European Union is even set to ban exchanges and custodians from dealing in privacy cryptocurrencies from July 2027.

Still, Hoskinson says there's a way to offer privacy without sacrificing compliance.

For instance, the stablecoin could have selective disclosure to provide the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism funding provisions regulators want, he says.

Selective disclosures might not work.

Privacy coin projects like Firo and Zcash have tried to modify their protocols to provide some form of selective disclosure. They've done so by creating “whitelisted addresses” for users that exchanges can verify for transactions while still allowing users to maintain shielded transaction capabilities.

Regulators haven't been swayed by those moves, and in the absence of support by major exchanges, liquidity for those tokens has declined.

With major markets like the US and Europe moving towards some form of regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, even in their current vanilla form, are under the microscope.

In the US, the Genius Act, a stablecoin bill, failed to pass a Senate vote last week as Democrats alleged the legislation endangered consumers and the financial system.

Puteaux, May 12, 2025: The Blockchain Group (ISIN code: FR0011053636, ticker: ALTBG) (the « Company »), listed on Euronext Growth Paris, Europe's first Bitcoin Treasury Company, holding subsidiaries specialized in Data Intelligence, AI, and decentralized technology consulting and development, has announced the realization, through its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary ""The Blockchain Group Luxembourg SA"", of a reserved convertible bond issuance, without preferential subscription rights, into shares of The Blockchain Group at €0.707 per share, for an amount of ~€12.1M, resulting from the exercise of the subscription right for all Convertible Bonds B-02 (“OCA Tranche 2”) reserved for strategic investor Adam Back, as part of his subscription to Tranche 1 OCAs as stated in the press release dated March 6, 2025, with a conversion premium of ~30% over the conversion price of Convertible Bonds B-01 (“OCA Tranche 1”). This capital increase will enable the Company to reinforce its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, while continuing to develop the operational activities of its subsidiaries.

As communicated on April 30, 2025, a presentation containing an explanation of the Company's Bitcoin Treasury Company strategy, focused on increasing the number of bitcoin per fully diluted share over time, is available on its website: https://www.theblockchain-group.com/investor/news-financial-information/

 

Context of the operation

Adam Back has notified The Blockchain Group of his intention to subscribe to the OCA Tranche 2 in accordance with the terms of the OCA Issuance Agreements signed on March 4, 2025, the details of which were disclosed in a press release dated March 6, 2025.

In this context, the Board of Directors met on May 12, 2025, to:

The OCA Tranche 2 thereby issued in favor of Adam Back will entitle its holder, upon conversion, to subscribe to a maximum of 17,176,106 new ordinary shares of the Company at a subscription price of €0.707 per share, representing a 30% premium over the conversion price of the OCA Tranche 1.

The OCA will be convertible into new ordinary shares of the Company at any time during the conversion period, provided that the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares over 20 consecutive trading days reaches at least 130% of the conversion price.

The transaction does not require the preparation of a prospectus subject to approval by the AMF, in accordance with Article 1(4) and Article 3(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 14, 2017, as amended.

The OCA Tranche 2 were subscribed as follows:

 

Key Characteristics of the OCA Tranche 2 Issuance

The OCA Tranche 2 will have the same terms as the OCA Tranche 1, except for the following:

Issuance : Option for OCA Tranche 1 holders to subscribe, in one or multiple tranches, within 3 months from the issuance of OCA Tranche 1, for an amount of OCA Tranche 2 equal to 1.5x the amount of OCA Tranche 1.

Amount : €12,146,942, subscribed in BTC.

Maturity : 5 years from the subscription date.

Conversion Price: €0.707 per share.

Conversion

- By the bondholder: At any time before the 3rd anniversary of the issuance date, provided that the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares over 20 consecutive trading days reaches at least 130% of the conversion price of OCA Tranche 2, i.e., €0.919.

- By the bondholder or the issuer: At any time between the 3rd and 5th anniversary of the issuance date, provided that the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares over 20 consecutive trading days reaches at least 130% of the conversion price of OCA Tranche 2, i.e., €0.919.

 

Given the recent high volatility in the share price observed since the signing of the OCA Agreements, the price per share set at €0.707 reflects a discount of 44.72% compared to the closing price on May 9, 2025.

 

 

Impact of the operation on the Company's shareholding

The impact of OCA Tranche 2 conversion on the shareholding structure would be as follows:

(*) Calculations based on the number of shares comprising the Company's share capital as of May 9, 2025, adding the number of shares resulting from (i) the full conversion of emitted OCA Tranche 1 and OCA Tranche 2, (ii) the full exercise of the 2025-01 Share Subscription Warrants – “BSA 2025-01” and (iii) the capital increase decided on May 7, 2025.

(**) Free shares, the allocation of which has been decided but not yet effectively issued as of today, included in the situation as of May 9, 2025 in the fully diluted basis.

 

 

Impact of the Capital Increase on the Company's share capital distribution and on the situation of the shareholder that does not subscribe to the operation

 

 

(1) On the basis of the Company's equity as of December 31, 2024, to which has been added the equity resulting from (i) the full conversion of emitted OCA Tranche 1 and OCA Tranche 2, (ii) the full execise of the BSA 2025-01 and (iii) the capital increase decided on May 7, 2025.

 

 

Risk factors

The Company reminds that the risk factors related to the Company and to its business are detailed in its 2024 annual financial report, available for free on the Company's website (www.theblockchain-group.com/investor/news-financial-information/). The realization of all or part of these risks could negatively impact the Company's operations, financial position, results, development, or outlook.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","DeGods NFT founder steps down as collection gains traction","https://cointelegraph.com/news/degods-frank-steps-down-ceo-nft-sales-surge","Mon, 12 May 2025 12:28:29 GMT","

 DeGods creator Frank DeGods resigns as CEO after three years, as the NFT collection sees a 101% sales spike on Solana. 

The creator of the non-fungible token (NFT) collection DeGods announced that he has stepped down as the CEO of the project amid an uptick in sales. 

Rohun Vora, known online as “Frank DeGods” on X, said he has stepped down as the project's CEO, concluding a three-year stint as the head of one of the most popular Solana-based NFT collections. 

He identified pseudonymous figures 0x_chill and Pastagotsauce as the new leaders of DeGods. “There are no investigations, because I have never done anything illegal. That's the boring truth,” Vora wrote, addressing speculation about his departure.  

The announcement came as the NFT collection started gaining traction on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. 

Data tracker CryptoSlam shows that in the last seven days, DeGods NFTs have seen a significant increase in sales. 

On May 12, DeGods on Solana recorded a sales volume of around $458,000, a 101% increase over the previous week. In the last 30 days, the collection had a sales volume of $1.1 million for its NFTs based on the Solana network. 

On Ethereum, the DeGods collection recorded $104,000 in sales for the past week, a 156% growth over the previous seven days. In the last 30 days, the collection recorded over $250,000 in sales, a 323% increase in sales volumes. 

Following the announcement, new DeGods project lead Pasta shared plans to release a tribute to the project's three-year history and teased a shift in strategy.

Pasta also hinted that there will be changes in the project's approach. “Our job isn't to build crypto products. It's to make DeGods as big as it can possibly be. That's what you want. That's what we want too. So that's exactly what we're gonna do,” Pasta wrote.

DeGods creator Frank DeGods insists he's “not on the run” and has never done anything illegal after stepping down from his position as the project's CEO.

That's “the boring truth,” according to DeGods — real name Rohun Vora — who announced his departure on X today. 

Vora, who founded the NFT project DeGods and y00ts in 2021, didn't explain why he's leaving but suggested that a focus on the “Frank DeGods” brand may have been holding the project back.

He also said that he felt “the hate was overdone” at times. 

“For the record: I'm not ‘on the run,' he added. “There are no investigations, because I have never done anything illegal.” 

at times i felt like the hate was overdone, but i get it. it's funny. it gets clicks and deep down the people doing it feel like they are protecting the industry they love.for the record: i'm not ""on the run"". there are no investigations, because i have never done anything…

Vora is a crypto influencer associated with the “LA Vape Cabal,” a term given to crypto influencers working in the Los Angeles area who regularly promote memecoins and other crypto projects. 

Vora, as well as Cabal associates Faze Banks (Richard Bengtson) and Threadguy (Michael Jerome), had to distance themselves from the Javier Milei-backed LIBRA token after onlookers began accusing them of insider trading.  

He posted on X that he had insider knowledge, but he later claimed his comments were a sarcastic joke that backfired. They all deny insider trading LIBRA.

i was honestly trying to be sarcastic and it really backfiredi saw in multiple chats over the last week that there was going to be an official argentina coin. that's the extent of my insider knowledge.i genuinely did not get insider on this launch nor did anyone i personally…

There was also controversy with a leaked Haliey Welch interview hosted by the Cabal to address the scandal behind her Hawk Tuah token launch. Bengtson claims that Welch's team leaked the episode and traded the token in advance of its airing. 

Since all this, the crypto influencers have mostly kept low and are streaming less. As for Vora, he said, “It's been fun. Time to finally hit the gym. Thanks for everything.”

Vora claims X users @pastagotsauce and @0x_chill will now be taking over the DeGods reigns.

5 hours ago ⋅  14 min read

Metaplex (MPLX) is the leading digital asset protocol for Solana and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The Metaplex Protocol is used to create and manage digital assets across a variety of industry verticals, including NFTs, memecoins, RWAs, gaming, DePIN, and more. First launched in June 2021, Metaplex accounts for over 99% of NFT issuance on Solana and more than 90% of fungible token issuance on the network.Metaplex's Digital Asset Standard (DAS) is its standardized interoperable framework that establishes the necessary schemas, behaviors, and system architecture for various types of digital assets. Developers implement the DAS onchain via the Metaplex Program Library (MPL), which enables them to create and manage digital assets. Key components of the MPL include Metaplex Core (NFTs), Bubblegum (compressed NFTs), Token Metadata (data attachment for fungible and non-fungible tokens), and Candy Machine and Core Candy Machine (minting and distribution of NFT collections and Core assets). Metaplex's Developer Platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools, software development kits (SDKs), and reference interfaces for effective use of the DAS and MPL.The Metaplex protocol is governed by the Metaplex DAO, which is made up of MPLX tokenholders, and administered by the Metaplex Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and growing the Metaplex ecosystem. For a full primer on Metaplex, refer to our Initiation of Coverage report.

In Q1, mint activity for both Core NFTs and cNFTs declined following record highs in the previous quarter. Daily average Core NFT mints fell 35% QoQ to 7,787, down from a peak of 12,011 in the previous quarter. Similarly, daily average cNFT mints through Bubblegum dropped 75.1% QoQ to 882,290, reflecting a broad cooldown in high-volume issuance (including some spam) after a surge in late 2024. This decline follows an outsized spike in mid-December 2024, during which projects like DRiP contributed to nearly 40 million cNFT mints, volume that drove the ecosystem to new highs before activity normalized.

Daily average mints from the Token Metadata program, including both fungible tokens and NFTs, rose 9.1% QoQ from 43,396 in Q4 2024 to 46,863 in Q1 2025, and increased 55.7% YoY from 34,500 in Q1 2024. The YoY growth was driven primarily by a 419% increase in fungible token issuance.

Each of these programs has been designed to optimize asset creation and management for particular use cases.

Daily average fungible tokens minted via the Token Metadata program increased 11.2% QoQ from 39,219 to 43,619. The continued growth reflects strong and sustained demand for fungible token issuance on Solana. Token launchpads like Pump.fun, Moonit, Boop.fun Meteora's Mint, and Raydium's Launch Lab, as well as AI agent toolkits like Griffain and SendAI use the Token Metadata program to create fungible tokens. 

While daily mint activity declined from its January peak, it remained elevated through February and March relative to mid-2024 levels. This trend suggests that issuance demand has normalized at a higher baseline, indicating a broader and more consistent use of the standard. The sustained throughput beyond early-quarter spikes points to adoption that extends beyond isolated campaigns or launch events.

In Q1, fungible tokens accounted for 93.1% of all mints using the Token Metadata program, up from 90.4% in the prior quarter. This continues a trend that began in March 2024, when fungible tokens overtook NFTs as the dominant use case for Token Metadata. The share of fungible token mints peaked above 95% during several weeks in January before stabilizing around 93% by quarter's end. The consistent dominance of fungible token creation is driven by the proliferation of tokens on Solana and their ability to serve as a more efficient vehicle for capital formation. Meanwhile, non-fungible token usage via Token Metadata continued to decline, with daily average NFT mints falling 22% QoQ to 3,244. 

Fungible token creation via the Token Metadata program continued to outpace Ethereum and its Layer 2s in Q1 2025, with Metaplex facilitating 2.6x more mints, totaling 3.93 million compared to 1.50 million on Ethereum + L2s. Despite a late-quarter uptick in ETH +L2 based issuance, Metaplex maintained a clear lead throughout the period. This sustained advantage underscores Solana's role as a hub for low-cost, high-throughput asset creation, with Metaplex serving as the primary standard for launching fungible tokens across the network.

In Q1 2025, Metaplex surpassed 1.026 billion cumulative transactions, adding more than 88 million new transactions during the quarter. This follows a year of rapid expansion in 2024, where transaction counts tripled to over 705 million. While Q1 did not match the historic highs of December 2024, when daily transactions peaked above 23 million due to high cNFT mint volume, the network maintained elevated activity levels, consistently adding 700,000 to over 1 million transactions per day. Growth was supported by continued usage of Token Metadata for fungible token creation and steady Core NFT activity. By the end of Q1, Metaplex had averaged approximately 980,000 daily transactions for the quarter, reflecting a more normalized but sustained level of protocol engagement.

In Q1 2025, Metaplex recorded a peak in daily unique signers, reaching 82.9k on January 30. This surge aligned with a short-lived uptick in cNFT mints early in the quarter. While signer counts declined through February and March, daily averages still reached over 23,000, up 91.7% year-over-year, indicating sustained engagement across Metaplex programs.

Analyzing user activity at a quarterly level, Q1 2025 saw a cumulative total of approximately 2.8 million daily unique signers, up 160% from 1.1 million in Q1 2024. This increase reflects not just short-term spikes but sustained growth in user participation across the quarter, indicating a stronger and more engaged base of activities interacting within the Metaplex ecosystem. 

In Q1, MPLX's circulating market cap declined 38% QoQ to $148.5 million, down from $241.1 million Q4 2024. Despite the market cap contraction, protocol activity remained resilient. Metaplex generated $8.3 million in protocol fees during the quarter, down 1.8% from the previous quarter, while daily average revenue increased slightly by 0.3% QoQ to approximately $91,666. YoY, total fees rose 129.2% from $3.6 million in Q1 2024, reflecting continued expansion in network usage.

January contributed the majority of Q1 revenue, setting a new monthly all-time high of $4.3 million in protocol fees. This resilience in fee generation reflects continued demand for fungible token creation via Token Metadata, even as NFT minting volumes declined from Q4 peaks.

All Metaplex protocol fees on Solana are paid in SOL and are listed below. Notably, fees on other networks are priced equivalently but charged in the native currency of each network (e.g., ETH on Eclipse, SOL on Sonic, etc.).

Half of all fees generated on Solana are used to purchase MPLX which is subsequently contributed to the Metaplex DAO treasury. This is in stark contrast to many other protocols, which have to pay a large portion of fees to third parties such as liquidity providers, lenders, or validators and thus cannot afford to allocate such a high ratio to token buyback.

In Q1 2025, Metaplex spent approximately 29,684 SOL on MPLX buybacks, down from 34,000 SOL in Q4 2024. Despite the lower SOL outlay, January marked the largest monthly buyback to date, with 9.2 million MPLX repurchased using 12,000 SOL. February followed with 8.1 million MPLX purchased on 10,859 SOL, and March activity declined to 4.7 million MPLX on 6,825 SOL. In total, Q1 buybacks amounted to 22 million MPLX, or ~2.2% of the total token supply, bringing the cumulative amount repurchased to ~74.5 million MPLX, or 7.45% of supply.

Outside of buybacks, the MPLX token has a number of functions within the Metaplex protocol:

Since September 19, 2024, the entire MPLX supply of 1.00 billion tokens has been fully unlocked. Of that, 160 million (16%) was allocated to the Metaplex DAO for protocol changes, ecosystem grants, and strategic initiatives. The remaining allocations of MPLX were to various key parties including “Creators & Early Supporters” (21.90%), “Metaplex Foundation” (20.31%), “Strategic Round” (10.20%), founding development partners “Everstake” (10.00%) and “Metaplex Studios” (9.75%), “Community Airdrop” (5.40%), “Founding Advisors” (3.34%), and “Founding Partners” (3.10%).

In October 2024, Metaplex released its Token Metadata (TM) optimization initiative, reducing the size of TM accounts, and thereby making Solana more efficient and cost-effective for its users. In November 2024, Metaplex handed off upgrade authority for the TM program to three security firms performing audits over the next six months.

As of Q1 2025, over 3 million NFTs have been resized, releasing more than 7,000 SOL back to users and saving 965 MB of onchain storage. These outcomes reflect growing adoption of the new standard and measurable improvements in network efficiency.

In December, the Metaplex DAO approved Metaplex Earn Season 1, an eight-week program that allocates 1 million MPLX (~0.10% of the total token supply) to reward liquidity providers providing MPLX liquidity across DEXs on Solana. The program began in January and will return any unused MPLX to the DAO treasury at completion. Launched in January, the program drove a nearly 4x increase in MPLX's onchain liquidity, with the DEX liquidity-to-market-cap ratio rising from 1% to 3.42%. TVL peaked near $8 million, led by the MPLX-JitoSOL pool on Orca which reached ~$4 million and became the leading liquidity source for MPLX. Retail LPs collectively earned over $47,000 in fees in addition to token reward. 

Building on this momentum, the DAO approved Season 2 on March 28, allocating 2 million MPLX over three months starting in April. The campaign introduces dynamic reward mechanisms aimed at sustaining deep liquidity, supporting DeFi integrations, and encouraging a gradual shift toward organic market depth.

Metaplex has made significant strides enhancing its utility through numerous other upgrades and strategic integrations:

Some of the most notable companies (by category) to integrate Metaplex since Q1 2025 include:

In Q1, Metaplex sustained high levels of protocol usage amid a normalization in asset creation following record highs in late 2024. Daily average fungible token mints via the Token Metadata program rose 11.2% QoQ to 43,619, while Core and cNFT daily mints stabilized at 7,787 and 882,290, respectively, remaining well above early 2024 levels. Protocol activity remained resilient, with $8.3 million in fees generated, flat QoQ, and 29,684 SOL used to repurchase 22 million MPLX tokens, equivalent to 2.2% of total supply.

At the infrastructure level, Metaplex advanced its Token Metadata optimization, resizing over 3 million NFTs, releasing more than 7,000 SOL back to users, and saving 965 MB of onchain storage. Meanwhile, cumulative transactions surpassed 1.026 billion, and Q1 recorded a 160% year-over-year increase in signer participation, totaling approximately 2.8 million daily unique signer instances. Looking ahead, Metaplex remains well positioned to build on these foundations as the primary digital asset protocol for Solana and the SVM, supporting scalable and diverse asset creation across emerging use cases.

The Information Commissioner's Office has commended the British Library for the openness with which it has responded to a major cyberattack in 2023 – and decided that the incident does not warrant a full investigation.

The ransomware assault on the institution – a government body overseen by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport – took place in October 2023. In the weeks and months afterwards, the British Library suffered significant disruption to its website, digital services, and onsite IT systems.

The attack was swiftly reported to the ICO. In a newly published statement, the data-protection watchdog says that the cyber incident “escalated because of the lack of multi-factor authentication on an administrator account”.

Despite identifying this security shortcoming, the statement goes on to praise the British Library's response – in particular for its candour. And, after thorough consideration of the details of the incident, the ICO has opted against probing the matter further and more formally.

“Following the incident, the British Library published a cyber incident review in March 2024, which provided an overview of the cyberattack and key lessons learnt to help other organisations that may experience similar incidents,” the regulator's statement said. “We commend the British Library for being open and transparent about its system vulnerabilities that contributed to the incident, the impact it has had, and the improvements made so far to protect people's personal information.”

It added: “Having carefully considered this particular case, the Information Commissioner decided that, due to our current priorities, further investigation would not be the most effective use of our resources. We have provided guidance to the British Library, which has reassured us about its commitment to continue to review and ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect people's data.”

With its main site located next to King's Cross station in London, the British Library serves as the UK's national library, maintaining a collection of more than 170 million items.

“We have millions of books, but we have so much more,” the organisation's website says.” Our London and Yorkshire sites have everything from newspapers to sound recordings, patents, prints and drawings, maps, and manuscripts.”

              Highlights            



                        Digital assets, especially stablecoin payments, are becoming essential tools for global trade and finance as businesses seek faster, more reliable alternatives to traditional banking rails amid geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty.                      


                        Trust, regulation and user experience are central to the adoption of blockchain-based finance, with industry leaders emphasizing that innovation must solve real-world problems and be secure and seamless for end users.                      


                        Currency.com is positioning itself as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets, targeting underserved high-net-worth individuals with personalized services and aiming to build a comprehensive financial ecosystem driven by AI and future-proof technology.                      

As global trade reels from ongoing disruptions, businesses and institutions are being forced to reimagine how value moves across borders.

At the same time, traditional finance is undergoing a technological transformation for which it is ill-prepared. Advances that were formerly spear-tip, such as instant payments and tokenized assets, are no longer fringe innovations. They are increasingly becoming expectations.

Nowhere is this truer than with stablecoin payments. But will the reality of digital asset innovation ever be able to match its long-standing hype?

“Innovation must solve a problem, not just be a whiz-bang technology,” Karen Webster, CEO of PYMNTS and an expert in payments innovation and the connected economy, said in a discussion with Konstantin Anissimov, newly appointed CEO at Currency.com.

Webster's words set the tone for a conversation that veered beyond typical FinTech rhetoric and into the foundational strategies needed to make decentralized finance both scalable and secure.

“There's been a big shift in terms of adoption of stablecoin payments that is being driven by uncertainty in geopolitics,” Anissimov said. “I am personally seeing a big increase of small to medium enterprises utilizing stablecoin payments because banking rails are harder and harder to use.”

Digital assets are no longer a speculative play for those who embrace risk, but a necessary tool for navigating a fragmented financial world, he said.

“If the payment gets there quicker, faster, in a more definitive way, then a lot of these businesses are limited less in their working capital requirements,” Anissimov said. “The faster the payment, the more goods they can buy.”

The appeal of digital assets such as stablecoin payments is simple in theory. Traditional financial rails are slow, opaque and costly. By contrast, blockchain-based platforms offer real-time settlement, automated compliance checks and programmable financial logic — all within a single digital ecosystem.

Yet challenges remain. Regulatory clarity is still lacking in key jurisdictions, and concerns over cybersecurity and systemic risk persist.

Webster said trust is important.

“Consumers don't want to know how the car is built,” she said. “They just want to drive it and have a great experience. They have to trust it, but they don't need to understand it.”

Trust is non-negotiable, especially when people's money is at stake, Anissimov agreed.

“The pace at which blockchain technology is advancing is immense… it's one of those industries where the technology is advancing faster than the bad actors trying to break it,” he said.

“We have 30 money transmitter licenses,” he added. “These are deep audits. The regulators know how to distinguish the good from the bad. The danger is regulatory arbitrage, where companies pretend to be one thing but are really doing another. But that's much less common after FTX.”

As traditional finance and global trade continue to face pressure from macroeconomic forces and technological disruption, the convergence around digital infrastructure may not just be inevitable. Per the industry's proponents, it may be the safest path forward.

When economic certainty is hard to come by, digital asset platforms become less of a gamble and more of a foundation. Anissimov said he sees Currency.com as a complement to traditional banks rather than a competitor.

“Without banks, none of this works,” he said. “We need their stability. They may want to leverage our tech; we want to leverage their soundness and access to capital.”

Webster agreed while also highlighting the inherent friction in expecting traditional banks — governed by regulators and built for resilience — to “move fast and break things.”

At the same time, with more than 70% of high-net-worth individuals reportedly allocating at least some wealth to digital assets, the race is on to cater to their unique expectations. For its part, Currency.com is betting on a new kind of offering, a white-glove service tailored for affluent investors in the $2 million to $20 million range — those too large for retail solutions but too small for institutional platforms.

“These clients are underserved,” Anissimov said. “Retail platforms are tailored toward a small check retail customer base. The private sector [for high-net-worth clients] is more of a bolt-on.”

What Currency.com offers instead is a dedicated platform with personalized account management, 24/7 support, and a service design philosophy more akin to private banking than to a cryptocurrency exchange. This isn't just customer service; it's infrastructure-level differentiation.

“Because each client can bring more revenue, more lifetime value, we can also spend more time with them to study them better, to understand their needs,” Anissimov said.

While the white-glove service might be the first visible step, Anissimov said he has set his sights further.

“The longer-term vision is actually to build a platform that's a whole ecosystem of products — banking, finance and investing,” he said. “We believe that the digitization of the financial sector is inevitable.”

A key ingredient? Artificial intelligence.

“I am a big proponent of no-code or low-code solutions for safety-critical applications,” Anissimov said. “If you can deliver products 50 times faster than your competitors, it doesn't matter how big they are.”

This velocity will transform compliance, too, he said.

“At some point, we'll be able to automate regulatory flows,” he said. “The moment a non-compliance happens, it gets identified. AI proposes a remediation plan. It might sound farfetched, but at the pace things are going, it could happen in five years.”

The goal is payments that just need biometric data, with no phones or cards required.

“We think we're living in the future using Apple Pay, but you still need your phone,” he said. “What if you don't? We're building for that world.”

Bitcoin's price has surged some 25% since April 2, even as the big stock indexes declined. The digital currency broke through $104,000 by May 12. Traditional markets such as the S&P 500 were in the red simultaneously. Based on market data, Bitcoin's resilience has stood out in the face of sell-offs and tariff negotiations.

Bitcoin Outpaces Stocks

According to reports, the S&P 500 declined almost 1% during April, but Bitcoin rose. Other financial markets experienced losses during the same weeks. Bitcoin's increase was made while traders considered concerns over escalating tariffs.

The world's most sought-after crypto asset was seen by some as a means to avoid fees on foreign trade. However, there is no evidence that any country utilized crypto to avoid tariffs.

Settlements Via Bitcoin

Based on examination by crypto expert Daan Crypto Trades, there was speculation that countries could bring trade settlements to Bitcoin. The concept gained traction since BTC stood firm even when supply chains and markets were in trouble.

$BTC Has outperformed stocks since “Liberation” / Tariff Day on the 2nd of April.

It held up incredibly strong during a sharp sell off on stocks in April.

It then also proceeded to outperform as the markets bounced and tariffs were implemented.

Nevertheless, experts note that big on-chain transactions are out there in the open. Regulators would catch any large cross-border payments made in crypto. There has not been a reported case of governments turning to Bitcoin in order to sidestep duties.

Testing Key Resistance Levels

According to chart analysis by Rose Premium Signals, Bitcoin is currently testing a crucial barrier at $105,000. If BTC breaks down there, it might retreat into the $100,000 zone. Some pattern observers claim an Inverse Head & Shoulders configuration could develop.

🧠 The most likely scenario is a rejection from this level, leading to the formation of an Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern — a setup that could create space for a mini #altseason 📈… pic.twitter.com/aLSPi5qhuq

That pattern requires two distinct shoulders and a lower trough in the middle. Currently, the swings have been unbalanced, muddying the image. A rejection might be followed by a brief period of altcoin accumulation before Bitcoin takes off again where it left off.

Long-Term Outlook Stable

As per market observers, most investors will be looking to purchase dips if Bitcoin breaks resistance. They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin's extensive runs persist for several months, not days.

Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others.

Based on accounts of US–China trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin's price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves.

If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

 Shares of Next Technology Holding (NXTT) took off for a second straight session Monday after the software services provider and bitcoin buyer reported its holdings of the cryptocurrency jumped.


 Next Technology reported in a regulatory filing last week that it held 5,833 bitcoin, 5,000 of which it bought since the end of last year. It said the value of its bitcoin portfolio as of March 31 was $481.7 million, while it paid $183.1 million to purchase them.


 The company noted that it sees its bitcoin investment ""as long-term holdings"" and expects to continue acquiring them. It added that it hasn't ""set any specific target"" for the number of bitcoin it seeks to hold, and will ""continue to monitor market conditions in determining whether to engage in additional financings"" to make more purchases.


 Next Technology explained that bitcoin ""offers the opportunity for appreciation in value if its adoption increases and has the potential to serve as a hedge against inflation in the long-term.""


 The news sent Next Technology shares soaring 661% on Friday, and another 47% Monday morning to $3.45. They've also gotten a boost by the recent runup of the price of bitcoin, which is trading above $104,000. Today's move lifted the stock from negative to positive territory for 2025.


 Another firm seeing its shares fly higher because of bitcoin-related news is healthcare provider Kindly MD (KDLY), whose stock is soaring 380% Monday to $18.99 after it announced a merger with bitcoin-native holding company Nakamoto Holdings in order to start a bitcoin treasury strategy. Nakamoto was founded by David Bailey, a key cryptocurrency advisor to President Donald Trump.

 For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – May 12, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETFs featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. ETFs recently featured in the blog include: First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry & Digital Economy ETF CRPT, The Spear Alpha ETF SPRX, VanEck Vectors Digital Transformation ETF DAPP, TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ and Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC.

Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:

Tech ETFs at the Forefront of the Current Market Rally

Wall Street staged a solid comeback after a sharp decline in early April triggered by President Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement. The S&P 500 has rallied more than 18% from the April 7 low, primarily driven by rising hopes of a U.S. trade deal with major partners. Solid corporate earnings from leading tech players have also led to renewed optimism in the stock market.

President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom, marking the first major agreement since the United States imposed widespread tariffs earlier this year. He is slated to meet with Chinese officials this weekend to discuss trade. The meeting would be the first major talks between the countries since Trump raised tariffs on imports from China to 145% last month.

While the rally has been broad-based across all segments, the technology sector has been at the forefront. The tech-heavy Invesco QQQ has risen 14.3% over the past month. As such, we have highlighted five ETFs from the sector that have led the rally over the past month.

Tech Earnings Optimism

Strong quarterly earnings reports from software giant Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) spread strong optimism not only in the tech sector but the entire market. The dual earnings outperformance underscores that strong demand for AI is helping both companies navigate tariff-driven economic uncertainty. Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) also came up with earnings and revenue beats. However, Apple warned of a $900 million tariff headwind in the ongoing quarter, while Amazon also issued a cautious outlook due to uncertain consumer demand in the face of shifting tariff policies.

Per the Zacks Earnings Trends report, second-quarter earnings estimates for the tech sector appear to have reversed course over the last two weeks, with estimates starting to go back up after steadily coming down earlier.

Trump to Repeal Biden-Era Chip Export Restrictions

The Trump administration is preparing to roll back a key set of semiconductor export restrictions, originally introduced during the final days of the Biden administration. The regulation, which was scheduled to take effect on May 15, was designed to restrict sales of artificial intelligence (AI) chips to countries such as India, Switzerland, Mexico and Israel.

AI to Drive Growth

Though the AI trade has cooled off significantly this year, its adoption will again provide a lift to tech stocks. The expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh opportunities for growth within the sector. Tech companies have poured billions into data centers and AI chips to support the growth of AI models (read: Why Big Tech ETFs Still Remain Great Bets).

Promising Outlook

The global digital shift has accelerated e-commerce for everything, ranging from remote working to entertainment and shopping, thereby building the strength in the sector. The rapid adoption of cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, machine learning, digital communication, blockchain and 5G technology will continue to fuel a rally.

If these were not enough, the technology sector has a solid Zacks Sector Rank, being in the top 50%. After a massive decline this year, the sector has become attractively valued with a P/E of 20.89% compared with 18.33% for the broad market index.

In March, Tisséo became the first public transport network in Europe to allow travellers to pay for their tickets with cryptocurrency. Dalvinder Kular, assistant editor at National Technology News investigates whether this is part of a wider push towards the use of cryptocurrency to buy goods and services.

On 22 May 2010, programmer and cryptocurrency enthusiast Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins in Florida, which was then the equivalent of around $41 dollars. 

Since that first transaction, on what is now celebrated as Bitcoin Pizza Day, around 15,200 businesses around the world accept bitcoin and 328,370 bitcoin transactions are made each day, according to small business advisory firm Fundera. 

This number is tiny when compared to the roughly two billion daily transactions made by credit card around the world but there are indications that suggest paying for a coffee using Ethereum could soon be as normal as paying with contactless. 

In March 2025, Tisséo, a public transport operator in the French city of Toulouse, became the first transit network in Europe to accept cryptocurrency payments. A few months earlier, French luxury department store Printemps started to offer crypto as a payment method to appeal to international clientele.

Outside of France, cryptocurrency is venturing beyond speculative trading and into everyday transactions. US president Donald Trump has stated his ambition to make the US the cryptocurrency capital of the world, launching his own meme coin, and Colorado's Department of Revenue began to accept tax payments in cryptocurrency in September 2022. 
While organisations eagerly roll out trials of cryptocurrencies, the uptake by consumers remains uncertain.

Ticket to ride

Sacha Briand, board member of Tisséo and deputy mayor of Toulouse, who is responsible for overseeing finance and public assets, tells National Technology News that cryptocurrency is used to make about 10 purchases through the app each week. 

As Toulouse is a university town with a large young population familiar with cryptocurrencies, Briand expects this number to rise in September when students return to study and purchase their annual season tickets. 

Toulouse is growing, recently overtaking Lyon to become France's third largest city, and Briand says Tisséo is modernising its payment systems to coincide with the opening of a third metro line in 2028. 

Tisséo partnered with payment platform Lyzi to enable Android users to purchase digital tickets using cryptocurrencies within the Tisséo app alongside traditional card payments. 
Tisséo spent around €50,000 in integration fees and said it earns no commission from the transactions. 

“The main difficulty lies in the rules of public accounting, which had to be reconciled with this new payment tool, but the implementation was not overly complex,” Briand says. 

Lysi connects the customers paying in crypto, with Tisséo explaining that its agents do not handle crypto on a daily basis but are trained to deal with refund requests and the process is similar to that of traditional credit cards. 

According to estimates, around 18 per cent of the French population hold cryptocurrency and this number is expected to grow. 

“Honestly, with 18 per cent holding crypto, I would expect maybe two to three per cent to use it immediately for something like Tisséo's travel payments,” says Thomas Franklin, chief executive of crypto FinTech firm Swapped. “But usage could double year over year, hitting ten per cent penetration by 2027 if the experience is seamless.”

Franklin added that the purchase of transport tickets is a good place to start using cryptocurrency. 

“Public transport is a surprisingly good fit for crypto payments,” Franklin says. “Small-ticket, high-frequency, low-dispute transactions. You're not refunding a metro ride.”

Julia Barashkov, a PhD researcher at Delft University of Technology, agrees and points out the parallels between public transport and the token economy. 

“Transit systems tokenise access to physical resources without transferring ownership,” she says. “Riders want quick transactions, operators need efficiency, and price points are predictable.”

Yet, she says that that the adoption of cryptocurrencies by businesses in the physical rather than digital world could present unique challenges. 

“Physical infrastructure involves coordination between multiple stakeholders—regulators, citizens, suppliers—who might not be crypto users,” she adds. “This creates a complexity digital-only environments don't face.”

Beyond the transport sector, countries are starting to slowly embrace crypto payments.  Bhutan last week partnered with Biance Pay, becoming the first country in the world to offer a national-level cryptocurrency payment system for the tourism industry. 

The new model will enable Binance Pay users to pay for nearly every part of their Bhutan journey using supported cryptocurrencies, including airline tickets, tourist visas and Sustainable Development Fees (SDF), hotel bookings, tour guides, monument entry fees, and local shopping, which can all be settled through static and dynamic QR code payments.

Papuna Lezhava, chief executive of crypto payments firm Keepz, sees this as a broader trend. 

“In Georgia, people can pay taxes and buy apartments with crypto,” he says. “We're seeing faster adoption in countries where regulation and infrastructure support it.”

Spending digital assets

Due to fluctuations in exchange rates and the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, many users have seen crypto as an investment asset rather than a form of money which can be exchanged for goods and services, leaving cryptocurrencies languishing in digital wallets. 

“Most crypto users still see Bitcoin and Ethereum as investment vehicles,” says Franklin. “Why spend an asset that might double next quarter? However, stablecoins like USDC, pegged to fiat currencies, are changing the equation.”

Franklin continues: “People will spend stablecoins or Layer-2 tokens way before they part with their Bitcoin. These tokens offer low volatility, making them suitable for day-to-day purchases—assuming merchants can integrate them smoothly.”

For crypto payments to become as effortless as tap to pay Franklin believes several challenges have to be solved. 

Currently, paying with crypto involves three to five steps. He says the holy grail is “invisible” conversion, which allows users can pay in cryptocurrency without manual calculations or delays.

“We're realistically five to seven years away from it being truly invisible to the end user,” Franklin estimates.

Risks and barriers

Barriers for merchants are also substantial. 

“Crypto payments don't auto-sync with traditional accounting systems,” Franklin explains. “Without middleware that handles real-time conversion and ledger entries, it becomes a reconciliation nightmare.”

To overcome these hurdles, many merchants are turning to specialised processors that offer instant conversion and stablecoin support. “The winners will be those who outsource the complexity,” he adds.

The volatility of cryptocurrencies is a huge concern for merchants and customers. If a retailer receives £100 worth of crypto and its value drops before it can be converted to fiat, it directly impacts revenue.

However, Lezhava says newer platforms are addressing these challenges. “Many now offer real-time conversion from crypto to local currency,” says Lezhava. “That way, merchants get paid what they expect, and customers can use digital assets confidently.”

It's not just volatility, Franklin says, explaining that the “the devil is in the details” when it comes to merchant risks. Along with exchange rate fluctuations, merchants also have to navigate chargebacks, settlement times, and regulatory classification issues. 

“If a merchant receives $10 in BTC and by the time they cash out it is $9.40, that hits the bottom line hard,” Franklin says. 

Merchants also have to think about regulation, with a risk that payment innovation could be held back due to bureaucracy.  

“The UK has strong blockchain innovation, but regulatory bottlenecks slow down crypto adoption,” Franklin says.

While the Bank of England explores a digital pound and UK FinTech firms urge customers to adopt innovations like Open Banking, there seems to be a lack of mass movement towards crypto payments in retail or public services. Franklin thinks that with Brexit-era caution and regulatory conservatism still looming, widespread adoption may be years away.

The US has its own unique problems. 

“Some US cities are crypto havens, others treat it like radioactive waste,” Franklin says. “Recent headlines involving Donald Trump's meme coin might have boosted crypto visibility, but experts agree that it's not spurring serious payments adoption.”

Outside the US and Europe, the pace of crypto integration varies and El Salvador seems to be leading the way, having made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021. Franklin says parts of the UAE are leading because they treat crypto payments like an infrastructure play, not a PR stunt.

The journey from pilot to purchase

If cryptocurrency is to become a normalised payment method, it is unlikely to happen overnight. As with the internet, smartphones, or contactless cards, mass adoption will likely come in phases and will be driven by its potential rather than hype. 

“Success depends not just on the tech, but on governance,” Barashkov says. “Crypto in physical spaces requires buy-in from people who don't even hold the token.”

Tisséo will review the option to pay by cryptocurrency later this year and currently has no firm plans to phase out or expand the scheme. 

“We didn't introduce crypto because of a trend, we did it because payment tools are evolving, and Toulouse must evolve with them,” says Briand. “Toulouse is a city of innovation in every field, capital of aeronautics and space, with strong demographic and economic growth, so it was only natural that we should also innovate in terms of payment methods.

“We believe that cryptocurrencies are set to grow very rapidly, so this payment tool is proof of our desire to be in step with a city of innovation and development.”

Cryptocurrency may have started as an alternative to traditional finance and investment vehicles, but it could be evolving into something more day-to-day. 

As the infrastructure improves and use cases become more seamless, paying by crypto could become less of a novelty and just as normal as tapping a card. However, it seems that although there are use cases demonstrating how cryptocurrencies could be embedded into daily life, we are still a long way away from seeing this come to fruition.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","American Bitcoin, BTC Miner Backed by Eric and Donald Trump Jr, to Go Public","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/12/trump-family-backed-american-bitcoin-to-go-public-via-merger-with-gryphon-digital","Mon, 12 May 2025 12:33:21 GMT","

American Bitcoin, Hut 8's majority-owned unit backed by the Trump family, will go public via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP). 

Shares of Hut 8 Corp. (HUT) jumped 12% in pre-market trading, while Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP) soared more than 200%, following the news.

American Data Center, which was owned by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, merged their firm with American Bitcoin in March. The Trump brothers own 20% of American Bitcoin, while Hut 8 holds the remaining 80%.

The stock-for-stock transaction will result in Gryphon acquiring American Bitcoin, with the combined company adopting the American Bitcoin name and trading on Nasdaq under the ticker “ABTC.” 

The merger is expected to close as early as Q3 of 2025. American Bitcoin will retain its current leadership and board, including CEO Mike Ho, and remain focused on scaling low-cost bitcoin (BTC) accumulation.

“This transaction marks the next step in scaling American Bitcoin as a purpose-built vehicle for low-cost Bitcoin accumulation at scale,” said Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8. “By taking American Bitcoin public, we expect to unlock direct access to dedicated growth capital independent of Hut 8's balance sheet.”

After the merger, existing shareholders of American Bitcoin are expected to own roughly 98% of the new company. Hut 8 will maintain majority ownership and serve as the exclusive infrastructure and operations partner.

Bitcoin BTC$102,965.90 could soon hit record price highs, triggering accelerated gains in the wider altcoin market, as easing U.S.-China trade tensions may see markets react positively to a potential slowdown in the April CPI due this week.

The United States reached a trade agreement with China after two days of high-level negotiations in Geneva, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer announced on Sunday. 

Both the countries announced a temporary reduction in tariffs with U.S. cutting tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% for a 90-day period. In a reciprocal move, China will also lower tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10% over the same duration. The surprise announcement triggered a surge in the bitcoin price, sending it past $105,000.

The trade deal comes after weeks of a tit-for-tat trade war that saw both countries raise import tariffs above 100%, threatening to inject inflation into the global economy. As such, the positive March U.S. consumer price inflation data released last month was largely dismissed by investors and analysts as a lagging metric that didn't accurately reflect the escalating trade tensions.

The bears, however, cannot make that argument anymore, thanks to the trade deal.

So, a continued softening of CPI could raise Fed rate cut bets, providing a bullish catalyst for a BTC rally to record highs above $110,000. On the other hand, a hotter-than-expected CPI could be dismissed as backwards-looking, reflecting the April tariffs and not accounting for the de-escalation in trade tensions.

The CPI due Tuesday is expected to show the cost of living eased to 2.3% year-on-year in April from March's 2.4%, according to RBC. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is expected to have stayed at 2.8% year-over-year in April, with continued moderation in rent inflation.

According to 10x Research, consensus is that the headline CPI likely held unchanged at 2.4% in April.

""If this expectation holds, the market may view the inflation report as positive. Barring any negative tariffs headline, this week's week's inflation data could provide a bullish catalyst,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, told CoinDesk.

""CPI could be bullish, and may bring new all-time highs,"" Thielen added.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, changed hands at around $105,500, just 3.6% short of hitting new highs above $109,350, CoinDesk data show.

BTC has had a near V-shaped recovery from $75,000 since early April, with prices surging 10% last week due to continued inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has registered net inflows for 20 straight trading days, amassing over $5 billion in investor money, according to SoSoValue data. Last week, the Federal Reserve kept the benchmark borrowing cost unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, while reiterating the data-dependent stance on potential rate cuts. 

Chairman Jerome Powell, however, offered dovish hints, saying ""the underlying inflation picture is good,"" while calling the inflationary impact of tariffs short-lived.

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose 39% to $2,500 last week, the best performance since December 2020, according to TradingView. Other major altcoins such as XRP, DOGE, ADA and SOL surged 9.7%, 56%, 19% and 20%, respectively.

According to HTX Research, there are no signs of speculative frenzy yet, meaning the rally could continue.

""Implied volatility (IV) in bitcoin options remains stable in the 50%–55% range, far below the extreme levels of 80%+ typically seen at the peak of past bull markets. CME Bitcoin futures open interest currently stands at $14.8 billion, well below the $20 billion peak observed during the 2020 Trump election period, indicating that leverage is still manageable,"" HTX Research said.

""As long as yields do not climb back above 4.8% and ETF inflows remain steady, Bitcoin is likely to consolidate in the $105,000–$115,000 range while awaiting the next breakout trigger,"" HTX added.

Over the past two weeks, bitcoin (BTC) has significantly outperformed gold (XAU), and the bullish trend could intensify further. 

This outlook is supported by bullish developments in the bitcoin-to-gold ratio, which measures BTC's USD price against gold's USD price per ounce and easing U.S.-China trade tensions. 

Recently, the ratio broke out of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a classic bottoming formation characterized by a large trough flanked by two smaller ones, with a trendline connecting the recoveries between troughs. The breakout indicates bearish-to-bullish trend change, signaling further bitcoin outperformance.

Last week, the ratio topped the trendline, and technical analysis suggests it could rise to at least 35.00 from the current 32.00. This target is derived by adding the spread between the largest trough and the trendline to the breakout point, signaling a potential move higher for Bitcoin relative to gold.

The bullish technical set-up is consistent with past data that shows BTC tends to catchup with gold rallies.

Gold's meteoric rally peaked above $3,500 on April 22, and since then, the safe haven yellow metal has pulled back over 8% to $3,211, per TradingView data. During the same time frame, BTC's price has risen by nearly 19% to $104,000.

With the U.S. and China easing trade tensions early Monday, gold could lose ground while renewed risk-on sentiment powers BTC higher.

The two nations agreed to lower tariffs on goods manufactured in both countries, according to a joint statement released in Geneva. China has proposed to reduce tariffs on U.S goods to 10% from 125% for 90 days. Meanwhile, the U.S. has proposed cutting tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% from 145%.

""The tariff reduction could see a broader return to risk-on positioning, with crypto and equities both likely to benefit from renewed investor confidence and global capital flows,"" Mena Theodorou, co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, told CoinDesk in an email.

""The rally comes as the macro backdrop takes a positive turn: in a landmark move, the U.S. has struck trade deals with both China and the UK, while Putin and Zelensky are set to meet on Thursday to discuss a potential ceasefire. These developments have lifted risk sentiment globally, crypto included,"" Theodorou added.

 The PREH Multifamily Fund is being tokenized on the RWA-focused Chintai blockchain. 

Patel Real Estate Holdings (PREH) has launched a $100 million tokenization fund on the Chintai blockchain, aiming to give accredited investors access to institutional-grade real estate opportunities.

The new PREH Multifamily Fund is a tokenized investment vehicle focused on vintage Class A multifamily units across the top 20 US growth markets, the company told Cointelegraph on May 12.

“The entire structure is digital-native from the start — compliant onboarding, reporting, capital calls, and (potential) secondary market transfers,” a PREH spokesperson said.

The fund is part of a broader $750 million investment vehicle co-developed by PREH and several institutional firms, including Carlyle, DRA Advisors, Walton Street Capital, RPM and KKR. Initially, the company said that $25 million of the $100 million allocation would be tokenized on Chintai. 

According to PREH, the tokenization structure helps alleviate many transparency and liquidity constraints investors typically face in private market placements.

Founded in 2010, PREH is a national real estate asset manager that oversees a portfolio of Class A multifamily properties. The company owns and operates real estate investments, overseeing the acquisition, financing and management of properties. 

Since its inception, PREH has completed more than $500 million in real estate transactions.

Chintai is a tokenization-focused layer-1 blockchain that also powers the R3 Sustainability Fund for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. Its native token, CHEX, is currently valued at $0.24, with a total market capitalization of $244 million, according to CoinMarketCap.

""We chose Chintai because they offer a fully regulated, institutional-grade platform purpose-built for tokenizing real-world assets,” PREH's president, Tejas Patel, told Cointelegraph in a written statement, adding:

Tokenizing real estate has long been seen as a way to modernize property investment, but until recently, real-world examples were rare. 

By early 2025, real estate tokenization had gained traction across North America and the United Arab Emirates, while efforts are underway in Europe to establish regulatory frameworks that support its growth.

One of the biggest catalysts for tokenization is the “ability to eliminate the illiquidity discount on real estate,” Polygon CEO Mark Boiron told Cointelegraph in March.

The growth of liquid secondary markets for fractional real estate could significantly strengthen that advantage.

This motivation also drove RWA platform DigiShares to launch the REX marketplace on Polygon earlier this year, featuring two luxury property listings in Miami, Florida.

Efforts are also underway to tokenize commercial real estate, with Blocksquare and Vera Capital recently partnering to offer fractional ownership of more than $1 billion worth of properties.

Against this backdrop, consultancy firm Deloitte has forecast that $4 trillion worth of real estate will be tokenized on the blockchain over the next decade.

 Gryphon Digital Mining will acquire American Bitcoin in a stock-for-stock transaction, with the combined entity operating under the American Bitcoin brand. 

Bitcoin mining firm American Bitcoin is going public through a merger with crypto mining company Gryphon Digital Mining, the companies announced on May 12.

Under the terms of the deal, Gryphon Digital Mining will acquire American Bitcoin in a stock-for-stock transaction. After the merger, the new company will operate under the American Bitcoin brand and be led by its board of directors, which includes Eric Trump, the second-eldest of US President Donald Trump's three sons. News of the merger coincided with a sharp rise in Gryphon Digital Mining's stock price, which climbed from $0.52 on May 9 to $2.15 at the time of writing, a gain of more than 313%, according to Google Finance.

The announcement follows early April reports that American Bitcoin was considering an initial public offering (IPO).

American Bitcoin is a majority-owned subsidiary of energy infrastructure, crypto mining, and data center firm Hut 8. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said the company aims to make American Bitcoin “a purpose-built vehicle for low-cost Bitcoin accumulation at scale.” He added:

According to the announcement, existing American Bitcoin shareholders will own roughly 98% of the newly formed company. Following the transaction, the new company will control most of the outstanding stock.

Hut 8 will continue to manage American Bitcoin's infrastructure and operations through long-term commercial agreements. Those deals are expected, according to the announcement, to generate stable, contracted revenue streams for Hut 8's power and digital infrastructure segments.

Hut 8 acquired a majority stake in American Bitcoin when it was unveiled at the end of March, with backing from several members of Trump's family. The company, formerly known as American Data Center, was founded by a group of investors, including Trump sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.

Following the deal, American Bitcoin took ownership of Hut 8's Bitcoin mining hardware. The announcement at the time explained that the new firm “aims to become the world's largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve.”

 As Bitcoin's value skyrockets, governments may turn to wealth taxes to tap into unrealized gains, raising questions about the future of crypto taxation. 

Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly

Is there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset's price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? 

Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin's value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.

What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It's a yearly tax on a person's total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.

Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world's biggest economies — like the US, Australia and France — have largely steered clear. 

That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (BTC) be labeled “unproductive,” which would mean taxing its gains every year — whether or not it's ever sold. 

Yep, every asset holder's favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea. 

With Bitcoin's significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest's Cathie Wood eyeing a $1.5-million price tag by 2030, I'd bet a magic 8-ball would say, “Signs point to yes.”

It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.

The incentive is obvious. Switzerland's wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio's value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.

Countries catch on — sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.

The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985. 

Governments are likely entertaining the idea — whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.

Recent: Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins

In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at $58,000 might have seemed like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table. 

In retrospect, a costly mistake…

Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK's gold reserves at $275 an ounce? 

Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.

To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money — specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.

Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?

Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn't worth it. 

Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve — a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.

If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.

One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won't sit back quietly.

Knitting's Complex Shapes Explained in New Physics Model

A new mathematical model helps to advance the centuries-old art of knitting

By K.R. Callaway edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

A test knit shows complex curvature.

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

In the core of a knitting machine or at the tips of a skilled knitter's needles, a strand of fiber can be transformed into anything from a delicate scarf to a bulletproof vest. But different knitting stitches tend to twist in different directions—think of a T-shirt curling at the bottom edge if the hem is cut off. The tension these stitches create can warp a two-dimensional fabric into complex 3D shapes, and predicting the final structure of a knitted project challenges crafters and manufacturers alike. Now a mathematical model published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA uses physics to untangle this issue.

Physicists are always searching for rules that govern materials' behavior, explains study lead author Lauren Niu, a physicist at Drexel University. Once rules are established, Niu says, “that's where the magic happens.” Prediction becomes possible.

Niu worked with University of Pennsylvania physicist Randall D. Kamien and Geneviève Dion, founding director of Drexel University's Center for Functional Fabrics, to find a mathematical model that reliably forecasts a knitted textile's complicated shapes and folds based on the stitch pattern used.

The researchers started by knitting complex patterns—including squiggles, peaks, and fabric that folded into the shape of a face—and then reverse engineered the knitted items' geometries. They realized they did not have to account for each stitch's actual shape and stretch, which would require too much computational power at the necessary scale, to foretell a textile's final form. Instead they needed to know only how each kind of stitch tended to curve the fabric.

The new model incorporates information about how stitches produce tension into an intricate mathematical construction called a Föppl–von Kármán equation. These equations describe how thin, flexible materials—such as cellular tissues and submarine hulls—behave under internal and external forces. Mapping knit stitches this way makes it possible to experiment with textile designs before physically knitting the material, Kamien says. He hopes such virtual testing will lead to more advanced, customized textiles for objects such as wearable medical devices.

“Having something that is as incredibly tunable and scalable and cheap as knitting for wearable devices is, I think, very exciting,” says Stanford University mechanical engineer Cosima du Pasquier, who was not involved in the new study. Du Pasquier, who studies soft robotics that use functional textiles, would like to see how the model's predictions quantitatively line up with real-world fabrics and whether varying factors such as fabric thickness and yarn type affect that comparison.

Even without refinement, the study authors say, the model offers a practical starting point for trying new designs. “You can't capitalize on [knitting's] potential if you're still based on trial and error,” Dion says. “We're starting to be able to experiment in the virtual environment.”

Convergent ‘Cuteness' Is Making Dogs and Cats Look Alike

Pugs, Persian cats, and other smushed-face cats and dogs are more similar to one another than they are to the wild animals they evolved from

What do Persian cats, Pekingese dogs and pugs have in common? They all share a dramatically distorted skull, with a flat, round face and a nose pushed up between their eyes. This unnatural morphology is the product of decades or centuries of artificial selection to make our pedigreed animals more closely resemble the intrinsic cuteness of human babies.

These breeds have become so morphologically extreme, in fact, that the cats and dogs with these features now have skulls that are more similar to each other than to their own wild ancestors, according to new research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA.

“Wolves and wild cats are quite distinct in skull shape, but by applying [selective breeding] pressure for babylike faces, we've caused short-faced dogs and cats to become very similar to each other,” says senior author Jonathan Losos, an evolutionary biologist at Washington University in St. Louis. “We've substantially erased 50 million years of evolution.”

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Dogs and cats with round, flat faces—technically called brachycephalic, from the Greek for “short head”—show an unusual example of convergent evolution, which occurs when species independently evolve to become similar to each other because they face the same selective pressures. Normally this process is driven by natural selection—for example, birds and bats have both evolved to fly, and distantly related marine animals keep evolving to look like crabs. But in the case of brachycephalic cats and dogs, it's caused by selective breeding to accommodate human preferences for babylike features, such as round, flat faces with high noses.

“These are completely new skull shapes that only came about because of what humans want to see in their companion animals,” says lead author Abby Grace Drake, an evolutionary biologist at Cornell University.

Human preferences, however, come with consequences for the brachycephalic animals involved—which could not survive in the wild. “We're breeding them to look cute, but this has led to very horrible health problems for them,” Drake says. Pets like Persians and pugs often have so much difficulty breathing that they often require corrective surgery, for example, and they frequently suffer from problems with their eyes, teeth and neurological systems. They are also intolerant to heat and exercise because they lack adequate oxygen.

Drake, Losos and their co-authors had originally set out to understand the diversity of skull shapes in cats and dogs. They collected skull measurements for 1,810 animals from various sources, including computerized tomography (CT) scans of pets from animal hospitals and specimens from natural history museums. Their sample included 148 domestic cats and 677 domestic dogs, including both purebreds and mixed breeds. Of the dogs, they classified eight breeds as extremely brachycephalic: Boston terrier, Brussels griffon, English bulldog, French bulldog, Japanese chin, Pekingese, pug and shih tzu. For the cats, Persians, Himalayans and Burmese fell into that category. The team also collected data from hundreds of skulls of dozens of wild species representing the majority of the Canidae and Felidae families, to which domestic dogs and cats belong, respectively.

To directly compare the animals, the team created three-dimensional models of each skull and marked anatomically similar points on them across species and breeds. The researchers found that skull shapes of brachycephalic animals are unlike anything that has evolved in nature; these breeds—whether cats or dogs—shared more similarities to each other in skull structure than they did to their wild ancestors. Specifically, their palate has been tilted up, which has drastically shrunk their nasal region and restricted their airway as well as the space at the back of their throat. Some Persian cats actually lacked nasal bones entirely.

“People talk about evolution taking millions of years,” Drake says. “But if you isolate the gene pool with inbreeding and force massive selection pressures, you can produce a remarkable amount of diversity in a short period of time.” While this is fascinating from an evolutionary biology point of view, she and her colleagues emphasize that they do not think it is worth the health consequences for the animals. Losos agrees: “The welfare of the animals should be the first priority,” he says.

One future question for researchers to investigate is the underlying genetics of brachycephalic features, he adds. Some evidence suggests that domestic dogs and cats each have different genes associated with brachycephaly. “Finding out more about the genetics would certainly be fascinating,” Losos says.

Heather Lorimer, a geneticist at Youngstown State University, who was not involved in the research, agrees it would be worthwhile for scientists to investigate the genetics behind brachycephalic features.

“Starting from a careful, descriptive paper like this one, it might be possible to home in on individual developmental control genes that affect specific skull structure elements,” Lorimer says. “This, in turn, could lead to understanding very specific changes that cause health issues, which could help in breeding choices to improve health and welfare of our pedigreed dogs and cats.”

For those looking for a healthy pet that does not contribute to welfare issues, though, Drake has simple advice: get a mixed-breed animal from a shelter.

Great Odin's Raven, that's a fancy find!

 Ruled by the Britons, the Romans, the Anglo-Saxons, the Normans, and eventually raided relentlessly by Vikings, the precariously placed British Islands have some of the most fascinating history in the world. And this kind of melting pot of cultures, tribes, and empires comes with a peculiar beneficial side effect—glorious treasure hoards. 

Both the hoard at Sutton Hoo (found in 1939) and the Staffordshire Hoard (found in 2009) contained thousands of gold and silver metalworks from one Britain's most enigmatic peoples—the Anglo-Saxons, who ruled Britain from around 450 A.D. until the Normans came knocking in 1066—and offered unprecedented glimpses into their fascinating culture. Now, a new discovery by metal detectorists in southwest England adds to that incredible, blinged-out history. 

While this find isn't nearly as massive as the aforementioned treasure hoards of legend, what detectorists Paul Gould and Chris Phillips discovered rivals the splendor of the gilded objects in museums around the UK. Toward the end of a long day of metal detecting on January 8, 2025, Gould and Phillips—as part of the local Ninth Region Metal Detecting Group—came across a gold band with inlaid garnets, which was later identified as an Anglo-Saxon ring. That alone would be the discovery of a lifetime, but the day wasn't over. 

While continuing his search nearby, Phillips came across a stunning golden raven head with an inlaid eye of garnet. The raven figures prominently in Norse mythology as a symbol of the god Odin (also Woden), the god of war and death who famously gives up an eye for wisdom. Odin's ravens, named Huginn and Muninn, serve the god by bringing him information from Midgard (a.k.a. Earth). 

In a video posted to YouTube, Phillips details the find, stating that the head is made of solid gold and weighs roughly two ounces. “It's unbelievable,” Phillips says, choking back tears. “Sorry… I'm just a bit emotional.”

After the discovery, the group stopped detecting in the area, as the find proved that the site could be of national interest. They also contacted the landowner and the local finds liaison officer to report the discovery. In a follow-up video, Phillips visits the British Museum to examine the object—dated to around the seventh century A.D.—after a preliminary clean, and discovered that only one of the garnet eyes remained intact. However, seeing as ravens are closely associated with Odin, that could be by design.

“Unfortunately the eye has either been damaged or was supposed to be like that,” Phillips said in the video. “People say Woden gave up an eye for knowledge and all of that, I don't know if that has anything to do with it.” 

Phillips and Gould are part of a growing detectorist movement in the U.K.—spurred on by both increased interest during the pandemic and vast improvements in metal detector technology—and these detectors have made some truly stunning discoveries. In December of 2021, for example, a detectorist outside Melsonby, North Yorkshire discovered one of the largest Iron Age hoards in history, and earlier this year, a detectorist found a bunch of Roman silver coins in Barton Bendish, Norfolk. 

While the act of metal detecting brings about its own benefits—getting out into nature and getting some exercise being positive side effects—walking earth that possesses such vast amount of treasures across millennia can certainly be quite the motivator.

Guatemala's Cueva de Sangre, translated as “blood cave,” isn't just a clever name. It's an apropos description of the cave former purpose, as a depository of fragments of human remains sacrificed by the Maya people to their rain god. 

If that sounds violent, that's because it was. 

The cave—and the remains within in it—were first discovered in the 1990s at Dos Pilas in Peten, part of a stretch of roughly 12 caves the Maya people frequented between 400 B.C. and 250 A.D. The “blood cave,” though, stood out from the other caves discovered for its collection of human bones strewn across the cave floor, with dismemberment and traumatic injuries the norm. 

But new research presented at the annual Society for American Archaeology meeting, titled “Black as Night, Dark as Death,” highlighted the significance of this discovery, beyond the initial brutality on display. “Human skeletal remains deposited in caves, cenotes, chultuns, and other natural and artificial subterranean chambers provide some of the best contexts to investigate ritual behavior among ancient Mesoamericans,” according to Michele Bleuze, bioarcheologist at California State University, Los Angeles. 

Deep within the Guatemalan cave—reached via a small opening with a passageway that drops toward a pool of water—only accessible during the dry season, Bleuze said the injuries enacted upon the more than 100 adult and juvenile human bone fragments show that the remains were part of a ritual to please a Maya rain god. “The emerging pattern that we're seeing is that there are body parts and not bodies,” Bleuze told Live Science. “In Maya ritual, body parts are just as valuable as the whole body.” 

Getting from traumatic injury to rain god ritual, though, was more than just conjecture. The bones weren't buried and that the injuries occurred around the time of death, leading those studying the remains to determine the the body parts were the results of ritual dismemberment. 

“The types of skeletal elements present, trauma, arrangement of bones, and bone modifications, strongly support the sacrificial nature of the deposition,” the researchers wrote.  

Ellen Fricano, a forensic anthropologist at Western University of Health Sciences in California, told Live Science that a beveled-edge tool, possibly akin to a hatchet, left a distinguishing mark on the left side of a skull's forehead. A similar mark was found on a child's hip bone. 

Even the way the bones were placed within the cave, such as four stacked skull caps in one spot, sparked questions. The experts conclude that the intense injuries, sheer volume of bones, and the inclusion of other ritual items, such as red ochre and obsidian blades, show that the blood cave wasn't a run-of-the-mill burial site.

Researchers plan to do additional DNA testing to learn more about the bones. “Right now, our focus is who are these people deposited here,” Bleuze said, “because they're treated completely differently than the majority of the population.” 

The fact the cave is inaccessible other than for roughly three months in the spring offers additional reasoning behind the sacrifices. Bleuze believes the Day of the Holy Cross celebration each May 3 brought the ancient people to caves to plead with the Maya rain god for enough rain to supply a bountiful harvest. 

“It is not surprising,” Bleuze wrote, “that bioarcheologists encounter human remains that extend our understanding of the life and death of ancient Mesoamericans beyond what is provided in traditional mortuary contexts.”

Metrics details

Cellular NAD+ depletion, altered tryptophan metabolism and gut microbiome dysbiosis are associated with disease progression and unfavourable clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Here, we show that supplementing tryptophan metabolism with nicotinamide alleviates COVID-19 symptoms. We evaluate a 4-week intervention with a novel nicotinamide formulation (1,000 mg) in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 900 symptomatic outpatients with PCR-proven COVID-19. In the primary analysis population of participants at risk for severe COVID-19, 57.6% of those receiving nicotinamide and 42.6% receiving placebo recover from their performance drop at week 2 (P = 0.004). Nicotinamide is also beneficial for returning to normal activities (P = 0.009). Effects on gut metagenomic signatures parallel clinical efficacy, suggesting that nicotinamide influences COVID-19-associated faecal microbiome changes. After 6 months, responders to nicotinamide in acute COVID-19 show fewer post-COVID symptoms than placebo responders (P = 0.010). No relevant safety signals are observed. Overall, our results show that nicotinamide leads to faster recovery of physical performance and modulates COVID-19-associated faecal microbiome changes.

COVID-19 remains a large global disease burden, causing a substantial loss in work productivity even in the post-pandemic phase. Respiratory symptoms are often linked to a sharp drop in physical performance and the inability to perform normal activities. Despite a strong reduction in overall mortality due to vaccination and antiviral treatments, there is a large unmet need for an effective, broad, symptomatic intervention.

Nicotinamide is required to generate oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a coenzyme central to cellular energy metabolism. However, NAD+ availability is diminished in viral infections, particularly in COVID-19 (refs. 1,2). NAD+ can be synthesized from the essential amino acid tryptophan through a de novo pathway in which the nicotinamide base is newly generated. Nicotinic acid, nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide also serve as NAD+ precursors in enzymatic salvage pathways for NAD+ regeneration. Cells continuously synthesize NAD+ because it functions both as a recyclable coenzyme and as a substrate for NAD+-consuming enzymes, for example sirtuins3.

Notably, elevated tryptophan catabolism, indicated by high levels of kynurenine, an essential intermediate in the de novo NAD+ synthesis pathway, characterizes acute inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection4,5,6. The degradation of tryptophan results from increased activity of tryptophan-catabolizing enzymes, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1, and not only is associated with COVID-19 severity4,5,6, but also has been observed in other infectious diseases, including community-acquired bacterial pneumonia7 and viral infections8,9. Additionally, tryptophan absorption depends on the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 on the intestinal epithelium, which is also the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 (refs. 5,10).

COVID-19 is closely linked to disruptions of the gut microbiome, characterized by reduced microbial diversity and a decline in beneficial bacterial species11,12,13,14. These imbalances are associated with increased inflammation and immune dysregulation, and are assumed to contribute to more severe disease outcomes, for example by licensing immune responses through microbe-derived metabolites15,16,17.

We have previously shown that tryptophan supports gut microbiome homeostasis18 and that nicotinamide supplementation exerts strong, microbiota-dependent anti-inflammatory effects in a colitis model18,19. In mice, gut-targeted nicotinamide showed a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect, surpassing the benefits of systemic supplementation19. Given that impaired tryptophan cometabolism is associated with gut microbial dysbiosis in people with COVID-19 (ref. 17), topical nicotinamide might modulate the gut microbiome and improve outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections, complementing its systemic antiviral benefits1,20.

Hence, we developed a pharmaceutical pH-dependent matrix tablet formulation with ingredients approved for use in both food and pharmaceuticals (DRKS00023384, NCT05258474). This formulation is designed to release nicotinamide in the lower small intestine and colon, ensuring systemic supply of nicotinamide and targeting more distal parts of the intestinal tract, including the microbiota.

This study reports the results of two randomized controlled trials, a smaller pilot experiment (COVit-1; DRKS00021214) using conventional nicotinamide tablets, and the larger COVit-2 trial, which combined conventional and gut-targeted nicotinamide tablets in outpatients within 7 days of testing PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2.

The 4-week intervention in the pilot trial COVit-1 indicated faster restoration of physical performance (18 of 23 participants receiving nicotinamide versus 12 of 23 in the control group at week 2) and time to complete resolution of symptoms (Supplementary Section 1). The results provided the impetus for the COVit-2 trial, described in the following sections (details on trial procedures and design are available in Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Section 3.1).

Screening of 7,013 individuals for COVit-2 resulted in randomization of 900 participants (safety population: 448 assigned to nicotinamide, 452 to placebo). Of these, 867 received the investigational product, and 500 (248 receiving nicotinamide, 252 placebo) qualified for the risk factor intention-to-treat (RFITT) population for primary analysis (Extended Data Fig. 2).

The analysis populations in COVit-2 were similar with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline (intention-to-treat (ITT) population, n = 867: Table 1; RFITT population, n = 500: Supplementary Table 3). A total of 97.1% of the participants in the ITT population (n = 842) and 95.8% of those in the RFITT population (n = 479) completed the 4-week intervention period and the follow-up at week 6. Only one participant left the trial between week 6 and the follow-up after 6 months. The trial had a low drop-out rate (4.2% of the 500 participants analysed in the RFITT population, with 479 completing the 6-week follow-up), and 98.5% of participants (472 of 479) finished the full 6-week trial, adhering to the protocol. Although efficacy analyses for acute COVID-19 had been planned to include only the RFITT population, safety data were obtained from the entire cohort (n = 900). At the 6-month follow-up, subgroups of participants at risk for developing post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and responders to the intervention were analysed in addition to the primary ITT population (Supplementary Section 3.4).

By week 2, 110 of 191 participants with reduced physical performance at baseline (57.6%) receiving nicotinamide and 80 of 188 participants receiving placebo (42.6%) had recovered from their decline in physical performance (absolute difference, 15.04 percentage points; odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.70; P = 0.004) (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 3). The number needed to treat was seven.

a, The primary endpoint (RFITT population) was a significant difference in resolution of performance drop at week 2 in the 379 participants reporting the symptom at baseline (nicotinamide: n = 191 (73 males, 118 females); placebo: n = 188 (77 males, 111 females)). One hundred ten participants responded to nicotinamide at week 2 (48 males, 62 females) and 80 to placebo (34 males, 46 females). Data are shown as relative frequency ± s.d. Two-sided Fisher's exact test, adjusted for hierarchical testing. OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval. b–e, Secondary endpoints (RFITT population). Data are shown as mean ± s.e. (b,c) or relative frequency ± s.d. (d,e). b, Significant improvement in the ability to perform normal activities at week 2 in the 198 participants with baseline scores of >3 (nicotinamide: n = 103 (41 males, 62 females); placebo: n = 95 (34 males, 61 females)): 3.07 ± 0.12 with nicotinamide (males: 3.34 ± 0.17, females: 2.89 ± 0.16), 2.62 ± 0.13 with placebo (males: 3.00 ± 0.19, females: 2.41 ± 0.16). Two-sided t-test of contrast within a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), adjusted for hierarchical testing. c, Improvement of cough at week 2 in the 77 participants with baseline scores of >3 (nicotinamide: n = 44 (17 males, 27 females); placebo: n = 33 (8 males, 25 females)): 3.22 ± 0.16 with nicotinamide (males: 3.31 ± 0.21, females: 3.17 ± 0.22), 2.76 ± 0.18 with placebo (males: 3.09 ± 0.31, females: 2.66 ± 0.23). Two-sided t-test of contrast within MMRM, adjusted for hierarchical testing. d, Among the 397 participants reporting fatigue at baseline (nicotinamide: n = 199 (82 males, 117 females); placebo: n = 198 (78 males, 120 females)), 105 responded to nicotinamide at week 2 (48 males, 57 females) and 96 to placebo (45 males, 51 females). Two-sided Fisher's exact test, adjusted for hierarchical testing. e, Among the 182 participants reporting shortness of breath at baseline (nicotinamide: n = 92 (36 males, 56 females); placebo: n = 90 (28 males, 62 females)), 56 responded to nicotinamide at week 2 (24 males, 32 females) and 37 to placebo (14 males, 23 females). Exploratory P value from two-sided, post-hoc, unadjusted Fisher's exact test: P = 0.012. Details regarding symptoms and risk factors are available in Supplementary Tables 8 and 9 and Supplementary Sections 3.2 and 3.3.

The trial also met the first of three prespecified key secondary endpoints. By week 2, participants taking nicotinamide had recovered their ability to perform normal activities significantly faster than those taking the placebo (absolute difference, 0.45 scale points; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.80; P = 0.009) (Fig. 1b). The difference in recovery from severe cough (absolute difference, 0.46 scale points; 95% confidence interval, −0.02 to 0.94; P = 0.057) (Fig. 1c) was of borderline statistical significance only in per-protocol participants (RFPP population; P = 0.049). For the third key secondary endpoint, the resolution of fatigue, the observed difference did not achieve statistical significance (Fig. 1d). Only a small number of participants in both groups reported severe fatigue at week 2 (as indicated by the descriptive statistics of the SF-36 and FACIT-F questionnaires; Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Therefore, no additional endpoints were formally statistically tested, although trends suggested greater effectiveness of nicotinamide over placebo for shortness of breath (Fig. 1e) and the ‘physical role functioning' subscale of the SF-36 questionnaire (Extended Data Fig. 4). Exploratory subgroup analyses of the primary and three key secondary endpoints suggested that individuals with a history of lung disease or smoking might specifically benefit from nicotinamide (Extended Data Fig. 5), but there were no sex-dependent differences (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Tables 6–13). In exploratory sex-specific analyses of symptomatic males and females in the RFITT population, significant effects on recovery from performance drop (in males) and improved ability to perform normal activities (in females), both at week 2, were retained despite the reduced sample sizes (Supplementary Tables 8–13). Further data covering primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints are provided in the Supplementary Sections 2.2 and 2.3).

To assess gut microbiota shifts induced by the intervention, we analysed longitudinal faecal samples using 16S rDNA phylogenomics (n = 70; 280 samples) and metagenomics (n = 18; 72 samples) across four timepoints. Stool sampling was optional (details in the Supplementary Section 3.5). No significant differences in participant characteristics between intervention arms were observed (Supplementary Tables 16 and 17).

We first analysed compositional changes using phylogenomic 16S rRNA data (Fig. 2). Analysis of α-diversity (within-sample diversity) did not show significant longitudinal or cross-sectional differences (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3), indicating that the richness and evenness of the bacterial communities were not drastically affected by the nicotinamide intervention. Between-sample diversity analysis (β-diversity) revealed that there was a significant difference in participants receiving nicotinamide compared with those receiving placebo (PERMANOVA on between-sample Aitchison distances for intervention groups (R2 = 0.015, false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.002)), but not at baseline (R2 = 0.018, FDR = 0.99); however, the effect size was small (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Tables 18 and 19). Notably, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and assignment to the placebo intervention group were correlated in their effects on the direction of β-diversity changes (Fig. 2c). We used variance partition analysis21 to assess how clinical covariates (for example, age, sex or bacterial genera) influence gut microbiome variation by intervention group. In this analysis, we found that—despite the significant differences between study arms—the contribution of individual taxa to shifts in β-diversity was subtle, suggesting considerable heterogeneity in the intervention effect at the taxonomic level (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 20).

a, Stool samples from 88 participants were collected at baseline (week (W) 0), during intervention (weeks 2 and 4; nicotinamide (NAM) or placebo) and at follow-up (week 6). Cohort 1 included 35 participants per group (NAM: 25 females, 10 males; placebo: 24 females, 11 males), and cohort 2 included 9 participants per group (NAM: 4 females, 5 males; placebo: 5 females, 4 males). Samples underwent 16S rRNA (n = 280) and shotgun metagenomics (n = 72) sequencing. b, α-diversity analysis (Shannon index at amplicon sequence variant level) of 16S rRNA data showed no significant (n.s.) differences across intervention groups or timepoints (two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; likelihood ratio test on linear mixed-effect models; n per group is depicted below each box plot). Box plots show the median (centre line), interquartile range (IQR, box), 1.5 × IQR (whiskers) and outliers (points). c, Microbiota shifts (Aitchison distance, 16S rRNA) were examined using constraint-based principal coordinates analysis in participants with key COVID-19-related symptoms. Significant differences emerged between nicotinamide and placebo at week 2 and week 4 (n = 45 per intervention; PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.015, Fxy = 1.43, false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.002) but not at baseline (week 0) (NAM: n = 24; placebo: n = 23; PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.018, Fxy = 0.82, FDR = 0.99; Supplementary Fig. 4). Dots indicate individual samples, and arrows represent trajectories (baseline → week 2 → week 4). Ellipses show sample distributions per intervention group (solid line: 70% confidence; dashed line: 80% confidence; assuming multivariate normality). Black arrows show the impact of key COVID-19-related symptoms, intervention and age on microbiota dissimilarity, proportional to their correlation. Placebo and key COVID-19-related symptoms had similar effects. FDR: Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected P values. d, Variance partition analysis of the top 20 microbial genera that show highest variation at week 2 and week 4 in the 16S data (n = 67 per intervention). The bar plot shows the mean variance explained for the top 20 microbial genera, with variance attributed to covariates including age (light green), body mass index (BMI) (yellow), key COVID-19-related symptoms (red), fever at baseline (orange), sex (dark green), intervention (purple) and residuals (grey). Prefixes in genus labels denote higher taxonomic ranks: f_, family; p_, phylum. Only samples with at least 5,000 reads were included. For additional metagenomics-based variance partition analyses at the taxonomical level, see Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 21.

We next aimed to understand the underlying functional differences using metagenomic pathway profiling. First, we inferred the presence and abundance of microbial taxa and community functions using the MetaPhlAn 3.0 and HUMAnN 3.0 (ref. 22) from metagenomics data. We found that, at week 2, the placebo group exhibited increased microbial biosynthesis pathways for tryptophan, phenylalanine, methionine and lysine, as well as enhanced redox and NAD+ salvage pathways, compared with the nicotinamide group. This suggests a relative deficiency in NAD+ de novo and tryptophan biosynthesis in participants receiving placebo, an effect prevented by nicotinamide supplementation (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 22).

To further explore the potential influence of nicotinamide on COVID-19-associated gut microbiota changes, we compared our cohort with an independent gut microbiome dataset17. In that study, stool samples were collected from patients hospitalized with mild or severe COVID-19 and from uninfected matched control individuals. We analysed baseline and longitudinal samples from the public cohort to infer microbiome function, comparing key pathways altered by COVID-19 severity with those affected by nicotinamide versus placebo in our trial (for details, see Supplementary Section 3.5). We found an overlap of 43 pathways, mainly involved in cofactor, amino acid and nucleoside or nucleotide metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 23). These pathways showed similar effect sizes when comparing healthy individuals versus those with COVID-19, and nicotinamide- versus placebo-receiving participants in the COVit-2 trial (Fig. 4). This finding suggests that nicotinamide intervention shifts the functional potential of gut microbiomes of people with COVID-19 towards that of healthy individuals, supporting the idea that nicotinamide protects against microbiota dysbiosis linked to COVID-19.

The low severity of COVID-19 in the trial was associated with a low rate of PCS, as determined by the PCS score23 at the 6-month follow-up. The PCS score ranges from 0 to 59, with higher values indicating more severe PCS23. In the ITT population, only 47 participants in the nicotinamide arm and 51 in the placebo arm reached the threshold for moderate to severe PCS23. The mean PCS score was 2.95 (s.d., 5.91) in the nicotinamide arm and 3.19 ± 6.55 in the placebo arm (absolute difference, −0.24; 95% confidence interval, −1.1 to 0.61; P = 0.817). An exploratory analysis focused on participants at risk for developing PCS (nicotinamide: PCS score 3.97 ± 6.95; placebo: 4.81 ± 7.84; absolute difference, −0.85; 95% confidence interval, −2.4 to 0.69; P = 0.610) and on participants at risk who had shown improvement in the primary endpoint or one of the three key secondary endpoints in the acute phase of the disease (Supplementary Section 3.2). In the latter subgroup, a significant benefit of nicotinamide was also observed in participants with PCS (nicotinamide: n = 48, PCS score 8.33 ± 0.84; placebo: n = 57, PCS score 11.82 ± 1.03; absolute difference: −3.49; 95% confidence interval, −6.1 to −0.86; P = 0.010) (Extended Data Fig. 7).

In the safety population, 1,798 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 317 (70.8%) of participants receiving nicotinamide, and 1,732 AEs occurred in 297 (65.7%) of participants receiving placebo (P = 0.115; Supplementary Table 25). Most AEs occurred early during the trial and were due to the onset or worsening of COVID-19-related symptoms. Notably, there were no significant differences between the two groups in this regard. Thus, these AEs are likely to have reflected the study set-up, with an early recruitment of participants during the incremental phase of the underlying infection. A trend towards a higher overall incidence of cumulative gastrointestinal AEs in the nicotinamide arm (25.2% versus 17.7% with placebo; unadjusted P = 0.007; without single gastrointestinal symptoms explaining this observation) is in line with the known side-effect profile of nicotinamide, for which abdominal discomfort has been described (AEs of special interest). These were mild and did not require further treatment. Sixteen participants were examined in an emergency department but were not hospitalized, seven were hospitalized (one with low-flow oxygen) and none died. All serious AEs were classified as unlikely to be related to the intervention, and their frequencies were highly similar between the two groups (Supplementary Tables 26–29).

COVID-19 is characterized by its large impact on health-related quality of life through a substantial symptom burden involving reduced physical performance, an inability to perform normal activities, airway symptoms and fatigue24. In the prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled COVit-2 trial, we found that an intervention with nicotinamide (1,000 mg) in a combination of ileocolonic and systemic exposure leads to faster recovery from main COVID-19 symptoms. By week 2, recovery from reduced physical performance was 57.6% with the nicotinamide intervention and 42.6% with placebo intervention, resulting in a number needed to treat of seven.

The binary primary endpoint ‘performance drop'—a key symptom of COVID-19—affects people with the disease regardless of their disease course and physical fitness25,26. It has been widely documented, despite variability in its measurement27, as a multifactorial and sensitive metric for detecting impairments reported by individuals with COVID-19. The closely related key secondary endpoint ‘ability to perform normal activities' and the secondary endpoint ‘shortness of breath' support the validity of the measure. Notably, not all secondary endpoints, including resolution of fatigue by FACIT-F, were met, but FACIT-F is not validated for use in post-viral sequelae. Although return to work could not be measured owing to the prevailing quarantine regulations at the time of the trial (that is, taking participants out of contact until full recovery), we suggest that a faster regain of physical performance would also have translated into restoration of work productivity.

Our trial is in line with other observations showing that ‘real world' mild-to-moderate COVID-19 results in a low frequency of clinically relevant PCS. However, in our population, we demonstrate a continued benefit of the intervention in participants at risk for developing PCS who had shown improvement while taking nicotinamide during acute COVID-19.

The COVit-2 trial recruited outpatients on the basis of SARS-CoV-2 test results through a network of laboratories. Although the recruitment strategy provided insights into ‘real world' COVID-19 during a period when virtually all infections were caused by the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany, it also resulted in a population with mild-to-moderate disease according to the World Health Organization's scale of COVID-19 severity28. Therefore, hospitalization rates were low (seven participants), and progression to severe COVID-19 was observed in only one individual. Fatigue was generally mild and transient, with most participants in both trial arms having already returned to normal at week 2, which is in line with a recent, large and representative sample from the healthy German population (FACIT-F: 43.5 ± 8.3)29. Therefore, we regarded performance drop, despite its multifactorial nature, as a better endpoint than fatigue to measure the effects of early interventions in mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

In the COVit-2 population, AEs occurred in approximately 68% of participants. Most AEs occurred early and were due to the onset or worsening of COVID-19 symptoms. Notably, there was no significant difference in the overall frequency of AEs between the nicotinamide and placebo groups. Thus, these AEs are likely to reflect the study set-up, which involved early recruitment of participants during the incremental phase of COVID-19. Although nicotinamide is a vitamin that is generally recognized as safe and has a tolerable upper intake level of 900 mg day–1, our findings suggest that ileocolonic delivery resulting in high mucosal exposure does not substantially alter the known side-effect profile. Indeed, a phase I study including serial ileocolonoscopies in healthy participants (DRKS00023384, NCT05258474) did not find any mucosal irritation. Importantly, nicotinamide has no known substantial interactions with other drugs that might be administered to treat severe COVID-19.

Nicotinamide, a NAD+ precursor, has key functions in metabolism and cellular immunity, for example in enabling the function of poly-ADP-ribosyltransferases (PARPs) and suppressing viral replication in infected cells1,2. SARS-CoV-2 infection disturbs PARP expression patterns and depletes cellular NAD+ levels, which compromises antiviral defence1,2,20. The antiviral properties of nicotinamide have been described for diverse viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus30. Various publications on COVID-19 pathophysiology have suggested that nicotinamide and related substances should be examined as an intervention to replenish NAD+ in COVID-19 (refs. 1,20,31).

Our analyses of faecal microbiota changes align with findings from other studies32,33,34,35 reporting a complex dysbiosis associated with COVID-19. Although we observed only subtle shifts and higher heterogeneity in microbial taxa, it is important to note that many studies focused on severe cases, in which microbiota alterations are influenced by factors such as antibiotic use and invasive procedures36. Notably, our finding that microbiota changes are more pronounced at the functional level than in terms of gut taxonomic shifts is supported by another study investigating milder COVID-19 cases37. It also highlights the concept of ‘functional microbiota guilds,' which exhibit consistent functional signals despite considerable taxonomic heterogeneity between individuals38. Preclinical studies clearly demonstrate the importance of the gut–lung axis in shaping protective immunity against respiratory infections, for example through circulating short-chain fatty acid levels (reviewed in ref. 5). Furthermore, evidence has been presented that the application of other gut microbiota-modulation principles, for example probiotics, might improve COVID-19 outcomes39. Our observation of gut microbiota shifts was derived from a representative, yet smaller, subcohort of the COVit-2 trial population, and might reflect both direct and indirect effects of nicotinamide, for example through modulation of the immune response or altered gut motility1,3. Although we cannot definitively establish a causal relationship, our observations of intervention-induced functional shifts in the gut microbiota following administration of placebo versus nicotinamide, particularly in relation to the healthy–mild–severe COVID-19 trajectory (for example, in amino acid and energy metabolic pathways) in a second cohort of patients with COVID-19 (ref. 17), support the hypothesis that nicotinamide might exert a beneficial impact through local intestinal mechanisms. Neither the observed effects on the microbiota nor the clinical effects were statistically different between non-smokers and smokers, the latter of whom might have systematic long-term metabolic adaptations affecting both host and microbiome systems40,41.

The trial has several limitations. Owing to the recruitment period, participants were almost exclusively infected with the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants. The remote nature of the trial and the quarantine rules did not allow us to measure lung function parameters and work-activity profiles. Given that we did not expect different results in vaccinated individuals and sought to minimize the need to account for additional covariates (for example, number of vaccinations, vaccine type), the COVit-2 trial, like many other studies, included only non-vaccinated participants, even as vaccines gradually became available. Although we cannot formally exclude the notion that SARS-CoV-2 variants or vaccination could have an influence on the observed effects, we anticipate from the general nature of the underlying distortion in NAD+–tryptophan homeostasis that our results could be extrapolated to other scenarios, for example current virus variants. Conclusions about PCS are limited because severe PCS cases were rare in the trial.

The clinical efficacy observed in the larger COVit-2 trial, which involved both conventional and gut-targeted nicotinamide release, aligns with the findings of the pilot trial COVit-1 in 56 participants. In COVit-1, differences between conventional nicotinamide tablets and an inactive comparator were, however, larger. The recruitment strategy for COVit-1, which involved physician practices instead of diagnostic laboratories, might have resulted in a participant population with more severe disease and higher rates of fever and pain than the cohort in COVit-2. We intentionally selected a combined intervention approach (conventional and gut-targeted) to provide a comprehensive evaluation of nicotinamide's effects while ensuring baseline systemic availability. We acknowledge that this approach limits our ability to draw direct conclusions about the standalone effects of the novel gut-targeted formulation. Nevertheless, both the pilot study and the COVit-2 trial showed similar signatures of efficacy with regard to physical fitness in daily life.

Given that the metabolic mechanisms affected by nicotinamide are rather general, we anticipate that the findings from COVit-2 might also relate to other tryptophan-wasting conditions, including respiratory infections with other viruses or bacteria7,8,9. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan might independently predict disease severity and short-term adverse outcomes not only in COVID-19 (refs. 4,6), but also in other settings such as community-acquired pneumonia7, and might identify people that could benefit from an intervention with nicotinamide.

In conclusion, we demonstrate the efficacy of nicotinamide administration to alleviate physical performance drop, a key symptom of COVID-19, which aligns with previous observations of NAD+ depletion in viral infections, as well as tryptophan degradation and altered host–microbial cometabolism as a systemic phenomenon in acute and chronic inflammation17,42. Further trials and mechanistic studies are needed to differentiate between systemic and gut-targeted delivery routes to firmly establish distinct clinical efficacy and clarify the precise mechanisms of action of the two routes.

The protocol (Supplementary Section 5), including all amendments, was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of Kiel University (file reference A107/20), and all participants provided informed consent before any study procedures (see below). COVit-1 and COVit-2 were registered at the World Health Organization primary registry German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00021214); COVit-2 was additionally registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04751604). In the COVit-1 trial, 56 outpatients with early symptomatic COVID-19 in domestic quarantine were recruited between 6 April 2020 and 28 January 2021, and 900 outpatients were enrolled into the COVit-2 trial between 1 February 2021 and 17 January 2022. Participants were compensated for their time according to the ethics committee's approval (up to 265.00 € for interviews and questionnaires, up to 50.00 € for stool samples and up to 120.00 € for blood samples). Vaccinated individuals were excluded to avoid confounding (for example, by inhomogeneous vaccination schedules or selection by age groups that received preferential access to vaccines). Self-reported demographics, including sex assigned at birth (male or female) or the gender option ‘diverse' (not selected by any participant), were collected at screening. Owing to the lack of evidence for a sex-specific effect of nicotinamide in COVID-19 or similar infections, neither sex nor gender were specifically considered in the design of the trial, but were analysed in an exploratory fashion. No analysis of viral subtypes was performed, but with respect to population epidemiology in Germany, participants were almost exclusively infected by the wild-type virus in the COVit-1 trial and by the Alpha (B.1.1.7) or Delta (B.1.617.2) virotypes in the COVit-2 trial43.

For COVit-1, participants were recruited through outpatient facilities surrounding the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, whereas screening for COVit-2 was performed using diagnostic laboratories at 71 sites in Germany (Supplementary Section 3.1). Inclusion criteria for the overall population were ≥18 years of age, a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (≤7 days after first positive test) and at least one symptom of COVID-19 on the day of randomization (Supplementary Section 3.2). Most participants reported five or more symptoms at baseline. Symptom load and the number of risk factors were similar in both trial arms and over the trial period (Supplementary Section 3.3). Exclusion criteria were current participation in another interventional study, pregnancy, breast-feeding and current or anticipated hospitalization. Inclusion into the acute RFITT primary-analysis population additionally required at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19 (Supplementary Section 3.4). At the 6-month follow-up, the ITT group was the primary analysis population, in which subgroups of participants at risk for developing PCS and responders to the intervention were further analysed (Supplementary Section 3.4).

The trials were performed remotely owing to the contact restrictions, which were in place during the trial time period. For details on trial procedures and design, see Supplementary Section 3.1. Participants provided electronic written informed consent, which was confirmed by telephone. Whereas COVit-1 recruited participants through advertisements, COVit-2 identified candidates by contacting all patients who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result at 71 sites operated by German diagnostic laboratory service providers. After confirming eligibility, participants were computer-randomized and received the interventional product and paper questionnaires (SF-36 and FACIT-F), delivered by next-day courier. Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to daily self-administration of either 1 g day–1 nicotinamide (500 mg immediate-release nicotinamide and 500 mg controlled-ileocolonic-release nicotinamide (CICR-NAM, Setamer®)) or matched placebo tablets in identical primary and secondary packaging, taken with breakfast for 4 weeks. Tablets were formally released by the pharmacy of the trial sponsor, the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein (Kiel, Germany). The intervention received by a participant was not disclosed to personnel involved in the study; personnel responsible for clinical supply and safety were unblinded. Participants and personnel involved with participant care remained blinded throughout the study, including the 6-month follow-up. Participants underwent structured telephone interviews at weeks 2, 4 and 6, as well as 6 months after baseline. Optional stool samples were collected from participants by mail (Supplementary Section 3.5).

The original primary clinical outcome of COVit-1 was the rate of hospital admission for a minimum of 24 h of continuous oxygen therapy. Secondary endpoints included the rates of machine ventilation, intensive care and death, as well as time to resolution of symptoms (Supplementary Section 1). Owing to the results of the pilot experiment, COVit-2 focused on participant-reported COVID-19 symptom burden in the acute primary analysis RFITT population (ITT participants with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19; Supplementary Section 3.4). The primary endpoint was restoration of physical performance at week 2. Key secondary endpoints were an improvement of the ability to perform normal activities, resolution of cough and resolution of fatigue at week 2. All endpoints were tested in participants with the respective symptoms at baseline. Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed for key risk factors. At the 6-month follow-up, the main outcome was PCS determined by a previously established PCS score, which was derived and validated in a large and prospective German cohort23. For the complete list of outcomes and for details on trial populations, see Supplementary Sections 3.2 and 3.4.

In COVit-2, 16S rDNA phylogenomic and metagenomic analyses were performed to investigate the effects of nicotinamide on gut microbial community composition and on functional metabolic capabilities of the colonic microbiome stratified by pathways, gene families and enzyme categories. Stool samples from 88 participants (70 participants for 16S and 18 participants for metagenomics) were analysed at week 0 (baseline), weeks 2 and 4 (exposure to nicotinamide or placebo) and week 6 (follow-up). For a detailed description of methods and references, see Supplementary Section 3.5.

The safety population included all randomized participants. AEs were classified into preferred terms and summarized using MedDRA version 25.1. These AEs were reported in participant interviews conducted after baseline and through ad hoc reports from participants requesting medical consultation until week 6. Serious AEs were recorded by structured interview queries, with follow-up if necessary. All hospitalizations and emergency-room visits were recorded. Serious AEs related to the underlying disease were evaluated according to the World Health Organization's COVID-19 scale28. For the safety analysis of the intervention, symptoms reported during the course of the study that were not present at baseline or were increased in severity were listed, and their frequency was compared between the nicotinamide and placebo groups using unadjusted Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests.

COVit-1 included 56 outpatients recruited from the referral network of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein and served to establish the rationale for the larger study, COVit-2. Statistics were descriptive because the study was a pilot trial (Supplementary Section 1). The results of the COVit-1 pilot trial were kept separate from those of the main trial, COVit-2. Statistical analysis was conducted in the blinded dataset by a third-party provider with established clinical trial statistics expertise (Novustat).

The COVit-2 trial enrolled 900 participants, following the sample size assumptions detailed in Supplementary Section 3.6. A pre-planned futility analysis was conducted by the Data Management Board after 400 participants had been recruited (Supplementary Sections 3.6 and 6). The full analysis set (the ITT population) included all participants who received at least one dose of nicotinamide or placebo. The RFITT population was defined as all participants in the ITT population with at least one symptom, demographic characteristic or underlying medical condition that was previously associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. The respective per-protocol populations, PP and RFPP, excluded those who dropped out or failed to comply with the investigational product intake for at least 80% of the study duration (Supplementary Section 3.4). In the RFITT population, each analysis regarding resolution or improvement of a symptom was performed only for those participants who reported the respective symptom at baseline. In case of ordinal queries (Supplementary Section 3.2), participants with severe symptoms (a value of >3) at baseline were selected for analysis. For the FACIT-F and SF-36 questionnaires, only those with severe complaints (baseline values ≤ median) were included in the analyses.

Baseline characteristics were summarized according to trial group and overall, with the use of descriptive statistics for continuous and categorical measures.

Primary and confirmatory secondary binary endpoints were analysed by assessing changes from baseline for all weeks within each intervention group, compared using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. Post hoc analyses for each week were calculated using Fisher's exact test, with Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing. The Woolfe test was performed to test for homogeneity of odds ratios across time. If significant P values were obtained from the Woolfe test, the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test would not be appropriate. In this case, Fisher's exact tests for each timepoint were used instead of the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. A continuity correction was applied for zero frequencies.

Continuous secondary outcomes (scales, SF-36 and FACIT-F) were analysed with the use of a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), with the change from baseline at each of the three scheduled post-baseline time points (2, 4 and 6 weeks) as the dependent variable and baseline value, intervention group, time and time–intervention interaction as independent variables (Supplementary Section 6). Statistical methods that do not involve imputation, such as the MMRM or the Chi-square test, were used for the analyses. The use of the MMRM model assumes implicitly that data are missing at random.

For time-to-event analyses, a Kaplan–Meier approach was used. The log rank test was performed to test whether time to event differed between intervention groups. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate and estimate the impact of the intervention group. The assumption of proportional hazards was analysed before the model was applied.

The reliability of the FACIT-F and SF-36 questionnaires was assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α ≥ 0.80) for internal consistency and item-to-total correlations exceeding 0.20. The average variance extracted was calculated to assess discriminant validity.

We applied multivariable generalized linear models, using a binomial family with a log link for binary endpoints and a Gaussian family for endpoints measured on a scale of complaints, to assess the impact of sex. Treatment, change from baseline, baseline value, sex and treatment–time and treatment–sex interactions were considered as independent factors. Sex-specific subgroup analyses were performed as part of the exploratory analyses. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for binary endpoints, and Hedges' g effect sizes including 95% confidence intervals were calculated for ordinal scales of complaint. Additional analyses were performed in accordance with the analyses of the entire RFITT population.

We assessed normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test as well as histograms, and homogeneity of variances using Levene's test. The results of these tests confirmed that the assumptions of the statistical tests were met. No data points were excluded from the analyses, as we also used MMRM and generalized linear models, which account for all available data without explicit exclusions. Detailed descriptions of the study populations for specific analyses are available in the statistical analysis plans (Supplementary Sections 6 and 7).

All statistical analyses were performed with the use of R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2021) version 4.1.2 or higher. For further details on the statistical analyses, see Supplementary Sections 3.5, 3.6, 6 and 7.

For the 6-month follow-up, the PCS score23 served as the primary efficacy variable and was compared between the intervention groups using a t-test or a nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test. Subgroup analyses were performed to further define responders in defined risk groups. For further details on the statistical analyses, see Supplementary Section 7.

Blinded (recruiters, interviewers, study physicians, statisticians, technicians and scientists for microbiome analysis) and unblinded (study material distribution, safety) personnel were strictly separated. All personnel completed documented formal monitored training on trial procedures, and delegation logs were adapted from good-clinical-practice guidelines. Guided standard operating procedures were regularly retrained, and detailed instructions for participants were implemented to ensure the validity of assessing participant-reported outcomes through structured telephone interviews (Supplementary Sections 3.1 and 3.2). Key interview questions were redundant, and source data entry into the database was monitored. SARS-CoV-2 test results were verified. Compliance was surveyed by remote tablet count during each interview and through specific questions (Supplementary Section 3.1). Side effects were queried and coded according to MedDRA Version 25.1 (see above).

Details on trial procedures and design are available in Supplementary Section 3.1.

ITT, intention-to-treat; PP, per-protocol; RFITT, participants with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19; RFPP, participants from RFITT with per-protocol compliance. The main reasons for exclusion of screened subjects were exceedance of the 7-day time window after the first positive PCR test, complete lack of symptoms, rejection of the trial by the subject, or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Refusal of potential subjects to participate occurred during the multi-step registration and verification process, usually after they had fully understood the comprehensive requirements of the trial. Reasons for withdrawal from the trial were mostly non-compliance and worsening of COVID-19.

A significantly different resolution of performance drop was seen in the 379 participants reporting the symptom at baseline (nicotinamide: n = 191 [73 males, 118 females]; placebo: n = 188 [77 males, 111 females]). One hundred ten participants responded to nicotinamide at week 2 (48 males, 62 females) and 80 participants to placebo (34 males, 46 females). Graphs represent relative frequency ± s.d. Two-sided Fisher exact test, adjusted for hierarchical testing.

Source data

a, Primary analysis population RFITT. b, ITT population. For details on trial populations, see Supplementary Section 3.4. Only subjects with severe complaints (baseline values ≤ median) were included in the analyses (RFITT: nicotinamide: n = 123 [49 males, 74 females], placebo: n = 119 [45 males, 74 females]; ITT: nicotinamide: n = 207 [79 males, 128 females], placebo: n = 209 [74 males, 135 females]. Graphs represent mean ± s.e. Two-sided t-test of contrasts within a mixed model for repeated measures, adjusted for multiple timepoints. The questions from SF-36 V 1.0 related to physical role functioning were as follows: ‘During the past 4 weeks, have you had any of the following problems with your work or other regular daily activities as a result of your physical health? Cut down the amount of time you spent on work or other activities; accomplished less than you would like; were limited in the kind of work or other activities; had difficulty performing the work or other activities (for example, it took extra effort)'.

Source data

a, Resolution of performance drop (primary endpoint). The number of participants indicates those included in the analysis due to the presence of performance drop at baseline. b, Improvement in the ability to perform normal activities (first key secondary endpoint). The number of participants indicates those included in the analysis due to the presence of a sufficiently severe reduction in the ability to perform normal activities (a value of >3 on the 6-point complaint scale) at baseline. c, Improvement in cough (second key secondary endpoint). The number of participants indicates those included in the analysis due to the presence of a sufficiently severe cough (a value of >3 on the 6-point complaint scale) at baseline. d, Resolution of fatigue (third key secondary endpoint). The number of participants indicates those included in the analysis due to the presence of fatigue at baseline. For details regarding symptoms and risk factors, see Supplementary Sections 3.2–3.4. Forest plot graphs represent odds ratios (a, d) or mean deviations (b, c) and the respective lower/upper 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Source data

a, Binary symptoms. Forest plot graphs represent odds ratios and the respective lower/upper 95% confidence intervals (CI). Resolution of performance drop: nicotinamide: n = 191 (73 males, 118 females); placebo: n = 188 (77 males, 111 females). Resolution of fatigue: nicotinamide: n = 199 (82 males, 117 females); placebo: n = 198 (78 males, 120 females). The number of participants indicates those included in the analysis due to the presence of performance drop or fatigue at baseline, respectively. b, Complaint scale. Forest plot graphs represent Hedges' g and lower/upper CI. Improvement in the ability to perform normal activities: nicotinamide: n = 103 (41 males, 62 females); placebo: n = 95 (34 males, 61 females). Improvement of cough: nicotinamide: n = 44 (17 males, 27 females); placebo: n = 33 (8 males, 25 females). The number of participants indicates those included in the analysis due to the presence of a sufficiently severe reduction in the ability to perform normal activities or a sufficiently severe cough (a value of >3 on the 6-point complaint scale) at baseline, respectively.

Source data

The box plots depict the PCS scores of 105 participants at risk for developing PCS with a PCS score >0, who had shown improvement in the primary endpoint or one of the three key secondary endpoints in the acute phase of the disease (nicotinamide: n = 48 [19 males, 29 females]; placebo: n = 57 [15 males, 42 females]). The median PCS score was 6.5 (quartile [Q]1: 3.5, Q3: 11.0) in participants who had received nicotinamide (males: 6.5 [3.5; 11.5], females: 6.5 [3.5; 11.0]) and 10.5 (Q1: 5.5, Q3: 17.0) in participants who had received placebo (males: 10.5 [5.25; 11.0], females: 10.75 [6.5; 17.0]). The mean PCS score ± s.e. was 8.33 ± 0.84 with nicotinamide (males: 8.37 ± 1.34, females: 8.31 ± 1.09) and 11.82 ± 1.03 with placebo (males: 9.67 ± 1.37, females: 12.60 ± 1.29). Box plots show the median (center line), interquartile range (IQR, box), 1.5x IQR (whiskers) and outliers (points). The means (red points) ± standard error (red whiskers) are shown within the box. Two-sided, unadjusted t-test for independent groups.

Metrics details

Auroral emissions are an important diagnostic for a planet's magnetosphere and upper atmosphere. At the outer planets, the characteristics of emission from the triatomic hydrogen ion \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) are key to understanding the auroral energy budget. We present James Webb Space Telescope observations of Jupiter's infrared auroral \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission, exhibiting variability on timescales down to seconds. Together with simultaneous Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet observations, these results imply an auroral \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime of 150 s, and that \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) cannot efficiently radiate heat deposited by bursty auroral precipitation. However, \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) radiation is particularly efficient in a dusk active region, which has no significant ultraviolet counterpart. The cause of such emission is unclear. We also present observations of rapid eastward-travelling auroral pulses in the dawn side auroral region and pulsations that propagate rapidly along the Io footprint tail. Together, these observations open a diagnostic window for the jovian magnetosphere and ionosphere.

Auroral emissions occur when energetic charged particles accelerated in a planet's magnetosphere impinge on the upper atmosphere, depositing large quantities of energy through collisions with atmospheric molecules. The locations and timescales of auroral emissions thus reveal the energetic processes in the magnetosphere that lead to particle acceleration. Auroral energy deposition has been invoked as a possible contributor to the outer planet ‘energy crisis' in which these planets upper atmospheres are several hundreds of K hotter than expected on the basis of insolation alone1. However, at Jupiter, energetic auroral precipitation also ionises molecular hydrogen H2 to produce \({{\rm{H}}}_{2}^{+}\), which rapidly reacts with remaining H2 to produce the trihydrogen cation \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\). Above the homopause, \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) is destroyed by electrons, and can have a substantial lifetime dependent on its dissociative recombination rate2. The latter is dependent on the ionospheric electron density and in turn on e.g. auroral precipitation. The \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime is to date poorly constrained, with estimates ranging from 4 to thousands of seconds3,4,5,6,7, and with sensitivity constraints limiting estimates from ground-based observations to down to around 10–15 min8. The lifetime of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) is important since it is thought to be a coolant of the upper atmosphere3,9,10,11,12, strongly radiating ro-vibrational thermal emission in the near-infrared (NIR)2,8,13,14,15,16,17. As thermal emission, the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) volume emission rate depends on both the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) density and its temperature, though in the jovian auroral region changes to the density tend to dominate the observed radiance variation18. Under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), each \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) molecule radiates 0.5– 5 × 10−20 W19. Previous observations indicate that overall, \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) radiates ~50–60% of the instantaneous gas heating caused by auroral precipitation12, but the importance of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) in the energy budget cannot be fully determined until the lifetime of auroral \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) is well known.

The overall temporal variation of Jupiter's \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission is, however, not well understood. Jupiter's \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission has been observed from the ground over many decades2,8,13,14,15,16. Ground-based observations typically integrate over ~10 min, and are subject to atmospheric seeing of around 0.5” (or 1,500 km on the planet at opposition), though in 2014 the Subaru Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (ICRS) obtained images with adaptive optics (AO) and achieved 0.2"" pix−1 at 45–100 s time resolution8, and we discuss these results below. From the vantage point of Jupiter orbit, the Juno Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) L-band imager typically images the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission at ~100 km pix−1, in a strip 128 × 432 pixels wide hence covering only a small portion of the roughly 50,000 km-wide auroral region in one image20. Near perijove, the JIRAM instrument obtains such observations once per 30 s spin of the spacecraft, but for analysis and presentation purposes, pseudo-images built from scanning the imager over the aurora over typically 10–15 min are almost always used17,21,22. This technique captures the morphology of features that vary on timescales longer than this but risks misrepresenting the morphology of features that vary significantly faster. A set of five JIRAM images of the Ganymede auroral footprint obtained 30 s apart were shown by21, though temporal variation of the morphology, other than the expected motion of the footprint, was not discussed. Those authors did make an indirect argument about the chemical lifetime of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) from the physical separation of spots and the speed of the motion of the footprint over the planet. They argued the spots were separated by 60 s of travel time, and they noted that the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime was therefore possibly less than 1000 s if the precipitating electrons were of sufficient energy to penetrate near to the homopause, where the produced \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) would be rapidly destroyed by hydrocarbons. Recently, an analysis of two examples of 30 s temporal resolution JIRAM observations of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission in the Io spot has been reported23. They concluded that the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime is likely several hundred seconds, depending on \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) number density. However, analysis of temporal variation of the energy input and the resulting \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) response has yet to be reported.

An estimated 10–15 min lifetime has been invoked to explain differences in the morphology between the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission7,11,12,24. The latter is ‘prompt' Lyman-α and Lyman and Werner band emission from atomic hydrogen H and H2 excited by auroral electron impact25,26. Its location and intensity reveals ongoing electron precipitation, and our understanding of Jupiter's magnetosphere-ionosphere system has been significantly advanced by high sensitivity observations of the time-varying morphology of the FUV aurora enabled by e.g. the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)27,28,29. Equivalent space telescope-based observations have been hitherto unavailable for \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\). Actual simultaneous FUV and NIR observations are vanishingly rare. There is only one pair of partially-overlapping Earth-based FUV and NIR images available to date30,31. The NIR image was obtained using the now-defunct NSFCAM, which yielded substantially blurred morphologies compared with the STIS images, and with only one pair of images, no study of time variability was possible. However, apparently substantial differences in morphology were noted, particularly in the polar region. More recently, concurrent Juno JIRAM and Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) pseudo-images have been compared11,12. Several key differences between the FUV and NIR morphologies were highlighted, though we note the above caveat regarding pseudo-image morphology and that the data points compared were rarely simultaneous. Those authors showed that, though the energy dissipated by \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission is of the same order of magnitude as the gas heating rate, it varies spatially. In particular, it is lowest in bright UV arcs, again potentially indicative of energetic precipitation to an altitude below the homopause. The arrival of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers a similar advancement in our understanding of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission to that wrought by HST for the H2 emission.

Here, we present JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) observations of Jupiter's northern auroral \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission. These observations provide imaging of the morphology of Jupiter's \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) auroral emission at 0.06” pix−1 (or ~190 km pix−1) spatial and 3 s temporal resolution. The latter is roughly 2 orders of magnitude greater than that typically achieved from the ground, with a negligible noise floor of around 0.5 μW m−2 sr−1. These high-sensitivity observations evince variability of the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) morphology with timescales down to seconds, and exhibit auroral phenomena including rapidly-propagating pulsations. Furthermore, the NIRCam observations were accompanied by simultaneous HST/STIS images of the H2 emission, providing a unique data set revealing significant time-variable differences between the two wavebands. The comparison enables a determination of the lifetime of auroral \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) created following a transient auroral flare, and a measurement of the ionospheric electron number density at auroral latitudes.

Two representative images of the northern jovian auroral \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission radiance L are shown in Fig. 1. All of the NIRCam images from the programme are listed in Table 1 and shown in Supplementary Movie 1. Many morphological features are broadly similar to equivalent forms in the FUV e.g. ref. 32, though imaged here at the highest temporal resolution ever obtained, and we discuss their temporal behaviour below. The main emission (ME) is a ring of aurora surrounding the magnetic pole, separated at the start of the observation from the high latitude Swirl region on the dawn side by the dark polar region (DPR). In the NIRCam images, this gradually fills in as the observation progresses. Prominent dynamic polar features are a noon active region (NAR), featuring what appears to be a polar auroral filament33 and dusk active region (DAR). Also evident is the Io footprint (IFP) tail, which maps magnetically to the orbital distance of the moon Io. In this case, the Io footprint itself is just visible off the pre-midnight limb, and the observed IFP tail is ~180° downstream from the satellite.

(a) Shows the 3s integration starting at time 08:16:28 UT from observation NIRCam3102, while (b) shows the 3 s integration starting at time 09:42:54 UT from observation NIRCam3109. The start time in UT is shown at the top, both at Earth (E) and corrected for one-way light travel time (J). The view is as observed, such that dawn is to the left, dusk to the right, and noon toward the bottom. The dark polar region (DPR), Io footprint (IFP) tail, rapid eastward-travelling auroral pulses (REAPs), Swirl region, dusk active region (DAR), main emission (ME) and noon active region (NAR) are labelled. The planet's limb (grey solid line) and a 10° × 10° graticule (grey dotted lines) at the 1-bar altitude are overlaid, along with solid lines which show the mapped moon footprints (respectively, with increasing latitude Io, Europa and Ganymede)67 and reference main oval42 (cyan dotted line) plotted at 500 km above the 1-bar level. Source data are available on Figshare66.

The variability of the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission morphology can be appreciated from Supplementary Movie 1. It is also illustrated in Fig. 2, in which we plot (a) the mean intensity throughout the observation from various representative regions illustrated on the projected image shown panel (b). The entire region poleward of the ME is replete with variable (timescale < 10–15 min) transients. The brightest and overall most variable component is the DAR, which exhibits a mean radiance of 170 ± 30 μW m−2 sr−1 and a maximum gradient of 60 μW m−2 sr−1 min−1. Its radiance can change by significant factors over several minutes. The NAR region, with a mean radiance of 75 ± 31 μW m−2 sr−1 is somewhat less bright. It is still highly variable with a maximum gradient of 69 μW m−2 sr−1 min−1, which occurs during an ‘extinction' such as discussed below. The Swirl region, with mean radiance 47 ± 5 μW m−2 sr−1, varies gradually on timescales of several minutes, while the dawnside ME is the most stable of features with 73 ± 1 μW m−2  sr−1. The DPR exhibits the lowest mean radiance of 34 ± 2 μW m−2 sr−1, though it exhibits short bursts of emission on timescales of several tens of seconds that will be discussed further below.

a Shows the mean of the line-of-sight corrected radiance 〈Lc〉 from regions in the dusk active region (DAR, red), the noon active region (NAR, black), the Swirl region (blue), the dark polar region (DPR, turquoise), and the main emission (ME, orange) versus UT time over the whole observation interval. b Shows line-of-sight corrected radiance Lc from a representative image from observation NIRCam3104 projected onto a spheroid 500 km above the 1-bar level and plotted in a polar stereographic projection. The regions from which the 〈Lc〉 values are computed are shown by the labelled cyan boxes. A 20° × 10° graticule is overlaid in grey, along with solid lines which show the mapped moon footprints (respectively, with increasing latitude Io, Europa and Ganymede)67 and reference main oval42 (cyan dotted line). The coordinate system is planetocentric, labelled with System III westward longitude. The central meridian longitude (here 153.78∘) is oriented toward the bottom. Source data for (a) are provided as a Source Data file, and source data for (b) are available on Figshare66.

As an illustration of the rapidity of the variation of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission, we highlight outlier events we term ‘extinctions'. In these events, the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) radiance in localised regions suddenly decreased by almost a factor of 2 in ~10 s, amongst otherwise slowly-varying radiance values. An example is shown in Fig. 3, in which the light curve from 76.1° latitude and 159.3° longitude is shown. The radiance at this location increased steadily for the several minutes prior to the event, which began at 09:34:36 UT. Over the next 4 integrations (~12 s) the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) radiance dropped precipitously, reducing in brightness by around 40%. A similar example occurred in the NAR at 09:57 UT. The implications of these extinctions for the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime is discussed below.

a Shows the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) radiance at 09:34:20 UT from observation NIRCam3108, in the same format as Fig. 2 except that 180° System III longitude is oriented toward the bottom. The region of interest is shown by the cyan box, which is about 7100 km in size. b Shows the radiance Lc versus UT taken from the location of the cyan squares in (c–h) which show the region bound by the box in (a) throughout the event as highlighted by labelled red points. Image source data are available on Figshare66, and (b) light curve data are available as a Source Data file.

These observations also exhibit a jovian auroral phenomenon roughly 2° poleward of the ME in the DPR region. Figure 1a highlights a faint band of emission that exhibits rapid eastward-travelling auroral pulses (REAPs) of approximate amplitude ± 3 μW m−2 sr−1. As discussed, we have produced the keogram shown in Supplementary Fig. 5, which indicates that these pulses propagate eastward along the band at 0.19° s−1. This corresponds to 60 km s−1, or around 20 times the planetary rotation rate. The pulses are of width 30–40 s, separated by on average ~15° in auroral longitude, and Fourier analysis indicates a period of about 1.6 min. We finally here report rapid longitudinal pulsations propagating along the IFP tail at similar speeds to the REAPs. Keograms of two examples are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7, one propagating in either direction. The measured speeds of 0.16° s−1 corresponds to 67 km s−1 or 15 times the planetary rotation rate. We discuss potential origins of these forms below.

We illustrate the relation of the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) and FUV morphologies in Fig. 4, which shows a representative NIRCam image along with a simultaneous HST/STIS image of the FUV emissions. A movie of all simultaneous images is shown in Supplementary Movie 2. For the purposes of comparison, we have converted the units of both sets of images to emission energy flux E in W m−2 on the planet's spheroid as described in “NIRCam data” of “Methods” section. These images are shown transformed onto polar stereographic projections. The ME and a number of prominent forms in the polar region can be identified in both wavelengths. However, two striking differences are the intensity of the DPR, which is much darker in the FUV, and the bright \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) DAR emission, which is clearly separated from the ME and has little significant counterpart in the FUV.

a Shows the H2 energy flux \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\) from HST observation of8v02dmq, while (b) shows the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) energy flux \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}\) from JWST observation NIRCam3105. Both images were obtained with start time 08:57:33 UT. Images are shown in the same format as Fig. 2, except that the reference main oval is shown with a red dotted line in (a). The identical red and cyan solid- (dashed-) line boxes show the regions from which the energy fluxes shown in Fig. 5 (Fig. 6) are derived. Specifically, these are the dusk active region (DAR), noon active region (NAR), and two regions of the main emission (ME1 and ME2) as labelled. Source data are available on Figshare66.

The comparison is developed in Fig. 5a which shows the mean energy fluxes versus time from the representative regions labelled in Fig. 4. These are the NAR and DAR and two regions of the ME, specifically the narrow, relatively stable dawn-side region (ME1) and a transient and localised bright arc in the post-noon sector (ME2). Prominent features are the relatively large and variable energy fluxes from the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) DAR emission and an H2 emission auroral flare in the NAR, but the relations between the two wavebands are highlighted in panels (b) and (c). Figure 5b shows on the left axis the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) energy flux \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}\) as a fraction of the precipitating electron energy flux \({E}_{{e}^{-}}\), taken to be ten times the H2 emission energy flux \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\)34. On the right axis the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) energy flux is shown as a fraction of the instantaneous gas heating rate Eh, taken to be \({E}_{{e}^{-}}/2\)11,34. Thus, values above the grey dotted line represent regions where the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) cooling efficiency exceeds the gas heating rate (DAR and ME1), and vice versa (NAR and ME2). The values range from minima of 0.06 in the NAR and 0.12 in the ME2 bright arc H2 to 2.5 in the DAR, with significant variability observed in most regions; for example the NAR ranges from 0.06 to 1.14. Gérard et al.11,12 compared contemporaneous UVS and JIRAM intensities. In comparison, they determined overall values of 0.45-0.67, but with an average of 2.4 along a particular radial cut. Our largest value is thus comparable to the latter, but our lowest values are significantly smaller. We also show that the values observed at any one point exhibit significant temporal variability. The overall significance of the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) cooling efficiencies can be appreciated by considering the residual heating rate \({E}_{h}-{E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}\) shown in Fig. 5c. The NAR and ME2 both exhibit mean net heating rates of 8.9 mW m−2, while the DAR and ME1 have values of -3.7 and -0.4 mW m−2, respectively, i.e. net cooling. It is notable that the temporally stable ME1 region exhibits such a small value, indicating the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) cooling essentially balances the electron precipitation-induced gas heating rate in this region. The other regions that deviate from this balance are characterised by transient phenomena such as flares, localised bright arcs and the DAR. In particular, the flare observed in the NAR shows that such events are particularly significant sources of heating, with the net heating rate peaking at 49 mW m−2. Integrated over its area and ~2 min duration, this flare deposited 55 TJ of heating, with \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emitting 0.9 TJ integrated over 10 min following the spike start. This illustrates the inefficiency of the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) thermostat in such events.

a Shows the mean H2 energy flux \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\) (blue) and mean \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) energy flux \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}\) (red) from the regions as labelled. Specifically, the dashed lines show the results from the dusk active region (DAR), the solid lines those from the noon active region (NAR), the dot-dashed lines those from the dawnside main emission (ME1), and the dotted lines those from the main emission arc (ME2). b Shows the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) energy flux \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}\) as a fraction of the (left axis, indigo labels) precipitating electron energy flux \({E}_{{e}^{-}}\) and (right axis, grey labels) the instantaneous gas heating rate Eh, with the same line styles as panel (a). The indigo dotted line shows \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}/{E}_{{e}^{-}}=1\) and the grey dotted line shows \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}/{E}_{h}=1\). c Similarly shows the residual heating rate \({E}_{h}-{E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}\). Data are from JWST observations NIRCam3105, NIRCam3106, NIRCam3107 and NIRCam3108, and HST observation of8v02dmq. Source data are available as a Source Data file.

This flare further offers an opportunity to measure the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime by considering the H2 (blue) and \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) (red) light-curves shown in Fig. 6a. Note, for this particular analysis we have extracted the HST data with 3 s integration to match the JWST observations, and we take the mean from the region bounded by the dashed boxes in Fig. 4. This region is focused on the centre of the flare in both images. Comparison of the forms of the light-curves illustrates vividly the broadened temporal response of the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission compared with the electron energy input. To determine the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime, we have created an impulse response function h(t), which represents how the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) energy flux would evolve in response to a brief pulse of unit magnitude at time t = 0, of the form

indicating instantaneous rise to amplitude A followed by exponential decay governed by timescale \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}\). This form is expected since the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) production rate is understood to be fast2, while the destruction rate is to be determined. Convolution of h with the input \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\) (minus the baseline value at the start of the FUV spike, 9 mW m−2, to normalise the flux signal) while respecting causality, i.e.

then yields the expected \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}\) response for the given parameters A and \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}\). These parameters were optimised by fitting \({E}_{{H}_{2}}*h(t)\) to \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}\)35,36, and the uncertainty determined by Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) parameter estimation37. This yields \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}=150\pm 4\) s and A = (5.23 ± 0.06) × 10−3 s−1. The best fit \({E}_{{H}_{2}}*h(t)\) is shown by the black line in Fig. 6a. The quality of the fit indicates the chosen impulse response function represents the behaviour of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) very well.

a Shows the H2 energy flux \({E}_{{H}_{2}}\) (blue, left-hand axis) and \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) energy flux \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}\) (red, right-hand axis) from the NAR flare. b Shows the best fit impulse response function h labelled with the best fit value of the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}\). The black line in (a) shows the best fit h convolved with \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\). The time axis is in seconds from the start of the flare. Source data are available as a Source Data file.

These results show that, overall, Jupiter's \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) morphology is more variable than inferred from previous observations. In particular, by considering the light-curves of both H2 and \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission in an auroral flare we have measured the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}\) to be 150 ± 4 s. However, the extinction event shown in Fig. 3 indicates that the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime can take even shorter values, of order 10 s. Assuming the latter is driven by \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) number density, an estimate of the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}\) then follows from assuming exponential decay, such that \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}=12/\ln (114/75)=29\) s. However, given that the value of 150 s is uniquely constrained by both FUV and NIR observations and the extinctions are outlier events, we regard \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}=150\) s as the primary result but note that it likely takes values down to 29 s. Putting this in context of previous observations, Watanabe et al.8 reported observations of Jupiter's auroral \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission obtained in 2014 with Subaru ICRS. They took NIR images with AO and achieved 0.2”/pix at 45–110 s time resolution. They reported pulsations in a polar form with a period of around 8 min, but the fastest relative drop they observed was from 20.219–18.053 μW m−2 sr−1 over a pair of observations near 7:18 UT separated by 109 s. A similar gradient was observed near 6:58 UT. Their narrowband filter passband of 0.022 μm differs from the F335M filter, such that direct comparison of absolute values with our results is not appropriate. However, we note that this represents a drop in radiance of 10.7% in 109.2 s. Watanabe et al.8 did not explicitly estimate \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}\) from their results, but Miller et al.2 cited \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}=110\) s, as the resulting estimate of the lifetime. In light of our results, this appears to underestimate the implied lifetime. For comparison, in the extinction shown in Fig. 3, the radiance falls by ~10% by the first integration, i.e. in 3 s. Applying our method to Watanabe et al.8's results instead yields \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}=109.2/\ln (20.219/18.053)=964\) s (i.e. 16 min). For consistency, we take these values for comparison with our results. As discussed above, Mura et al.23 recently reported \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetimes based on modelling of 30 s resolution observations of the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission in the Io spot. They concluded that the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime is inversely proportional to the number density, and their inferred values ranged from ~60–600 s. Those observations were not analysed in conjunction with simultaneous FUV observations. Our observations at 3 s resolution and constrained by simultaneous FUV observations indicate that exponential decay fits the observed radiance profile satisfactorily. Having said that, an \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime that varies with local conditions (if not directly related to radiance) is borne out by our observations, and ionospheric modelling work constrained by these data will shed further light on the behaviour of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) in response to an auroral flare.

Two important implications follow from the determination of the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime: first, this provides the auroral ionospheric electron number density at the altitude of peak \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission (which we take to be around 500 km), which can be estimated assuming the variation in radiance can be ascribed primarily to a change in the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) column density or dominated by the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) density at the peak. Then, the auroral ionosphere electron number density ne can be estimated via \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}={(\kappa {n}_{e})}^{-1}\), where κ = 1.15 × 10−7 cm3 s−1 is the dissociative recombination rate coefficient2. This yields ne = 5.8 × 104 cm−3 for \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}=150\) s, and ne = 3 .1 × 105 cm−3 for \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}=29\) s. The former is highly consistent with the mean value of  ~6 × 104 cm−3 in the highest northern latitude bin of the maximum electron numbers densities determined from Galileo radio occultations. However, we note that those observations contain essentially no data below 1000 km altitude and were obtained on the terminator, rather than near noon in our case38. The latter is likely unrepresentative of the typical number density but is consistent with the highest values observed at lower latitudes38. It is worth also comparing our results with the values in the auroral regions of up to 1010 cm−3, determined by Hodges et al.39 from Juno microwave radiometer measurements. Those values are clearly significantly different, though may represent upper limits to local density values. Future ionospheric modelling work and comparison of JWST data with e.g. Juno radio occultation measurements will further constrain the electron number densities.

Second, this short 150 s lifetime indicates that \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) cannot effectively radiate energy deposited by bursty precipitation since the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) molecules do not survive for a significant length of time. The effect of the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lifetime \({\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}\) on the total energy radiated following an impulsive burst of precipitation can be simply illustrated if we again assume that the column density, and hence radiance, is primarily controlled by \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) number density that decreases exponentially with time. The latter is suggested by the success of the impulse response function in reproducing the observed \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) energy flux following the NAR flare. Then, since \(\mathop{\int}\nolimits_{0}^{\infty }{\exp }^{-t/{\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}}\ {\rm{d}}t={\tau }_{{H}_{3}^{+}}\), the total energy emitted is proportional to the lifetime, and a lifetime of 150 s indicates that \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) only radiates ~15% of the energy from a precipitation burst than if its lifetime were the 16 min implied by the Watanabe et al.8 observations. Indeed, \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) radiated only 2% of the 55 TJ of thermal energy deposited by electron precipitating in the NAR flare. This flare contrasts with the heating event studied by Melin et al.9 in that the precipitating electron energy flux is a factor of 8 higher, and the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) cooling a factor of 2 lower, implying that either hydrocarbon cooling or downward conduction40 must account for the excess heat to a greater degree than found for that event. We note this argument only applies to variable precipitation and not to e.g. the dawnside ME, which is remarkably steady, and for which \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission essentially balanced the gas heating rate. It is also partially offset by the regions, e.g. the DAR, where the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) energy flux is greater than the gas heating rate. However, in that case the magnitude of the difference was smaller than the cases for which the gas heating rate was larger. The latter corresponded to brighter, transient or variable FUV auroral forms for which, as pointed out by Gérard et al.11, the precipitating electron energies are likely energetic enough to precipitate below the homopause, where \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) is rapidly destroyed.

The bright, rapidly varying DAR emission poses a challenge for our understanding of the jovian auroral ionosphere. The emitted energy flux is greater than the precipitating energy flux, indicating the source is not simply precipitation. Other sources of heat include ion drag and Joule heating. However, as discussed by Watanabe et al.8, timescales for temperature changes (103-104 s K−1) and transport and diffusion (104-105 s) cannot account for \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission variability on even 10 min timescales. Hence, the rapid changes evident in the DAR are likely due to creation and destruction of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\). This is supported by the JWST Near-infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) observations shown in Fig. 7. Although these data were obtained a few weeks after the NIRCam observations, they exhibit a similar bright form in a similar region to the NIRCam DAR. This feature appears to be associated with enhanced column density, rather than temperature, since there is no corresponding enhancement in the temperature in this region. This behaviour is consistent with previous observations18,22. Given the evident short lifetime of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\), and the variability of the emissions during the observation interval, it is unlikely that the form is an afterglow following a burst of precipitation prior to the observations. The region poleward of the main emission on the dusk side often exhibits bright, variable patches and arcs in the FUV41,42. In the NIR, relatively bright patches have been observed from ground-based observations on the dusk side15,18,43, though with lower spatial resolution than in the images presented here. It is unclear whether these are related to the DAR emission, which is clearly an isolated form separated from the main emission. As discussed above, Juno JIRAM has observed forms (arcs and patches) poleward of or branching off the main emission11,12,22, and the H2 and \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) intensities have been compared. The poleward forms observed by Gérard et al.12 were present in regions of broadly elevated FUV intensity, even if the locations of the H2 and \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) maxima did not precisely coincide. Note also those forms were observed in pseudo-images built over 10–15 min. In contrast, the images obtained here show the bright DAR emission to be a highly variable form, separated from the main emission and in a region of generally low FUV intensity.

Grey indicates no data or no fit convergence. A 15° × 15° graticule is overlaid in grey, and satellite and reference main oval contours are plotted as for Fig. 2. The projection coordinate system is as for Fig. 2 except that 180° System III longitude is oriented toward the bottom. Data are from all NIRSpec observations in the programme. Source data are available as a Source Data file.

In order to examine the cause of the DAR emissions, we have estimated the precipitating electron population necessary to drive the mean FUV and \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission observed in the DAR region using the Tao et al.6 model. This model estimates UV and IR volume emission rates arising from ionisation and excitation in the H2 atmosphere caused by auroral electron precipitation. The model includes UV absorption by hydrocarbons, ion chemistry, and \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) non-LTE effects. Before discussing the model results, we first note that the means of the region contained with the DAR box shown in Fig. 2b during the simultaneous JWST and HST observation interval are 175 μW m−2 sr−1 for the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) radiance and 170 kR for the FUV intensity. Modelled values are presented in Fig. 8, which shows (a) FUV intensity and (b) \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) radiance, varying with both precipitating electron energy E and upward ionospheric field-aligned current density j∣∣i. The 170 kR FUV intensity contour is also plotted in panel (b) to highlight the region that broadly matches the observations, as shown in the region highlighted by the green ellipse in panel (b). This region corresponds to ~1 keV electrons and 4 μA m−2 current density. However, this combination of parameters is problematic, since high latitude jovian electrons with this energy cannot carry 4 μA m−2 current density. This energy is similar to the value for the hot electrons outside the equatorial current sheet typically taken as the source population for jovian auroral processes, i.e. 2.5 keV and 0.01 cm−344. This unaccelerated electron population is only capable of carrying a maximum of around 0.01 μA m−245, and larger currents thus require field-aligned acceleration, which increases the energy of precipitating electrons. With this source population, the Cowley46 relativistic current-voltage relation shows a minimum accelerating potential of ~30 kV is required to drive a current of around 1 μA m−2. Observations of electrons above and poleward of the jovian auroral region with the Juno JADE and JEDI instruments have indeed indicated that poleward of the ME the characteristic energy is around 100 keV and very little energy flux carried by electrons with energy <30 keV47. Hence, the origin of this combination of FUV and \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission is unclear, and points to a fundamental gap in our understanding of the jovian ionosphere and the production of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\). Such an uncertainty clearly impacts efforts to predict the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) luminosities expected from e.g. brown dwarfs based on electron precipitation48. Future work more closely examining the electron precipitation above the DAR in Juno data is recommended.

a Shows the total unabsorbed H2 emission intensity over 70–180 nm and (b) shows the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) radiance in the F335M window, each versus electron energy and field-aligned current (FAC) density j∣∣i from the Tao et al.6 model. The mean values from the DAR region are shown using thick lines, and this FUV line labelled 170 kR is also shown in (b) for comparison with the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission. The region broadly matching the DAR observations is shown by the green dashed ellipse in (b). Source data are available as a Source Data file.

Likewise, the REAPs pose challenges for jovian magnetospheric physics. They map to 40–60 RJ, and at this distance would correspond to a linear speed of ~10,000 km s−1. We note the coincidence between the 1.6 min period and the gyroperiod of a singly-charged oxygen ion O+ or a doubly-charged sulphur ion S++ in a 10 nT field, and indeed Petkaki and Dougherty49 observed electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves with this period in the equatorial morning magnetosphere at these distances in Ulysses magnetometer data. These could weakly scatter electrons into the loss cone to produce pulsing \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission, but the origin of the perpendicular propagation is unclear; it is likely a perturbation phase speed. Considering the IFP tail pulsations, we note that the auroral longitude speed of 0.16° s−1 corresponds to 15 times the planetary rotation rate, which at 5.9 RJ is equivalent to ~1100 km/s. According to50, this Alfvén speed is met roughly 90 RIo = 2.3 RJ up the field line from the equator, which broadly corresponds to the extent of the Io plasma torus51. We suggest that this perturbation could therefore represent fast mode waves propagating along the edge of the IPT, that must couple with e.g. a shear Alfvén mode to produce the aurora observed. Future modelling work beyond the scope of the present paper is required to understand the nature of both of these auroral perturbations. Overall, these observations, though spanning only a brief period, demonstrate the value of JWST/NIRCam for the study of the auroras of the outer planets.

These observations were obtained as part of JWST programme 4566 on 25 December 2023, using the long wavelength channel of NIRCam with the CLEAR pupil aperture stop and F335M filter. The latter admits light between 3.18 and 3.54 μm. This wavelength range covers several intense ro-vibrational R-branch \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) spectral lines as well as coinciding with a strong methane absorption band across 3.2–4.0 μm, such that it provides excellent contrast against the background of reflected sunlight and thermal emission from the relatively dark planetary disc. The observation times are given in Table 1. The accompanying NIRSpec observations discussed below indicate, by comparison with fitted model \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) spectra52,53, that the F335M filter admits around 25% of the total \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission. Some methane fluorescence lines and reflected sunlight from the deeper atmosphere are still present, and we discuss their contribution to the overall radiance below. Observations were obtained using the 10 × 10"" SUB160 subarray on the NIRCam detector, which covered the majority of the auroral region, with an effective integration time of ~3 s and total exposure time of 4698 s. The field of view was centred on 67∘ planetographic latitude, 175∘ System III westward longitude, thus tracking the auroral region as the planet rotated. No pixels were saturated. The raw uncal data files have been processed with calwebb (version 1.14.0)54 stages 1 and 2 to produce the calints product containing the calibrated integrations in spectral radiance units of MJy sr−1. For presentation we have converted values to radiance in μW m−2 sr−1 using the filter passband width of 0.347 μm. Unsurprisingly, the pipeline detected and flagged count rate jumps due to cosmic rays and regions where the auroral radiance changed rapidly, but no pixels were flagged as Do Not Use beyond the usual bad pixels on the detector. We cosmetically corrected bad pixels using bilinear interpolation, and performed a correction for effects due to charge bleeding onto the SUB160 subarray from external pixels not reset every integration. In this mode, pixel regions adjacent to each edge of the subarray are reset every 4 integrations. Where the auroras were bright, those external pixels saturated, and the charge bled into the used subarray, causing a flickering of the nearest pixels. We corrected this by transforming the time series of each pixel into the frequency domain, interpolating over spikes with frequencies of 0.5 and 0.25 per integration, and transforming back to the time domain. Though only around 3 rows of pixels near the edge were substantially affected, we performed this fix for each pixel to be sure there were no spurious variations remaining.

We then rotated each image such that the planet's north pole was oriented upward, and then scaled the planet to a standard distance of 4.2 astronomical units (au) to facilitate comparison with any other observations. We determined the observation navigation by stitching together the first and last image of the visit, and then using the limb and the Io footprint tail to infer the planet's centre pixel. We then obtained the (assumed constant) offset from the expected centre pixel position given by the Navigational and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) Spacecraft, Planet, Instrument, C-matrix, Events (SPICE) toolkit55. We used this to compute the centre positions for each integration from the reference pixel right ascension and declination values given in the uncalibrated data files. The SPICE kernels used are naif0010.tls, pck00010.tpc, de421.bsp, jup230l.bsp, and jwst_rec.bsp. Following this step, the computed limb and planet positions broadly agreed throughout each exposure apart from a few single-integration jitters, in which the centre pixel coordinates for these integrations differed from their neighbours by several pixels causing the planet to jump relative to the expected location. This was corrected by fitting 3rd-order polynomials to the planet centre pixel coordinates, and then redefining the centre coordinates to the fitted values. Most coordinates were essentially unchanged by this procedure but the outliers were corrected and the jumps disappeared. The images exhibited low-level (<1%) random flickering, indicating some residual noise, which was corrected by background subtraction. We subtracted the background separately for the planet's disc and the sky. For the sky, we calculated and subtracted the mean of a 4-pixel wide strip across the top of the image (i.e in the sky). The background on the disc is temporally stable on the timescale of one observation, but spatially non-uniform. It comprises both methane emission from low altitude features and non-auroral \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\). In the absence of detailed models of the background, we have computed and subtracted a constant value given by the mean of a 4 × 4 pixel box centred on 166° System III longitude, 47° latitude. This location was chosen to set to near-zero much of the low latitude disc, and leave a small residual westward of 190∘ longitude.

We then projected the emission to a spheroid with an altitude 500 km above the 1-bar level, an altitude used previously for \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) observations[e.g. 17, preserving intensity. For the projected images, we have applied a simple line-of-sight correction to the radiance values L for this strongly limb-brightened \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission by multiplication by the cosine of the observation angle to give corrected radiances Lc. While this is a standard correction[e.g. 30,56,57, emission close to the limb may not be accurately corrected. For comparison with the HST images, we have converted the unprojected, uncorrected \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) radiance (in W m−2 sr−1) images into total \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) power in W pix−1 assuming isotropic emission and projected the images onto the planet, this time conserving energy rather than intensity to produce W per projection grid cell. Dividing by the area per projection grid cell then yields energy flux \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}\) in W m−2 on the planet.

As stated above, as well as \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lines, the NIRCam F335M passband admits light from methane (CH4) fluorescence near 3.3 μm and variable reflected sunlight from the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, from within a deep methane absorption band. While this study focuses on the NIRCam observations obtained during JWST programme 4566, we also obtained NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations on 8 Jan 2024, which can be used to estimate the non-\({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) contribution to the radiance observed with NIRCam. NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy of the auroral region over 2.9–5.3 μm was obtained with the G395H/F290LP disperser/filter setup. As with the NIRCam observations, the integrations, here 32 s in length, are the scientific product of primary interest. The raw uncal data files were first processed through calwebb stage 1, and the resulting files split into integrations. Each integration was then processed through stages 2 and 3. For the latter, the ‘emsm' weighting was used, as it was found to minimise artefacts from the cube-building step. The generated spectral cubes were then re-merged to create 4D arrays. The observation navigation was again determined by reference to the limb, and the field of view was projected onto a spheroid 500 km above the 1-bar level, as for the NIRCam observations.

Supplementary Fig. 1 shows the relevant portion of representative NIRSpec spectra from (a) the Swirl region and (b) the DAR region, along with an indication of the F335M passband and fits to the spectrum using an MCMC fitting routine, based on the h3ppy code52. Following58, the spectral lines were fitted using the wavelength ranges shown in yellow. The background comprises both an order 10 polynomial fit to the continuum and fitted methane lines. The \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission is evident as the red excess above the cyan background. The R-branch \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) lines are clearly evident, along with the solar reflectance increasing toward the short wavelength end of the passband. The methane contribution in the Swirl region is larger than for the DAR region, as we also show below.

Supplementary Fig. 2 shows light curves indicating how the proportion of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) radiance changes at two representative locations; (a) in the swirl region, and (b) near the dusk active region. While the overall level of non-\({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) emission is different in the two cases, it does not vary strongly. Instead, the variability of the total radiance in each case is driven strongly by the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) component, and the fraction of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) increases as the total radiance increases. Quantitatively, the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) and the total radiance is  >0.99. This justifies ascribing the rapidly varying features observed in the NIRCam data to \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\), however we acknowledge that a small proportion (around 10 %) is potentially CH4 fluorescence excited by auroral precipitation.

In Supplementary Fig. 3, we show projected maps of the total radiance convolved with the F335M throughput, the inferred \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) radiance in the F335M passband, and the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) contribution to the total radiance averaged over every location observed by NIRSpec. It is evident that the total fraction of \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) intensity varies throughout the auroral region, and we discuss below modelling and subtracting a constant methane component.

As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, the \({{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}\) contribution in the swirl region falls to around 30–40%, with the remainder originating from methane. This is consistent with previous observations of a region of methane emission contained within the auroral oval59. This region of methane emission is fixed in SIII longitude, and, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, relatively stable in radiance. We have therefore created a simple model of the CH4 emission in this region and subtracted the values from the NIRCam radiances. The CH4 emission radiance is modelled with a two-dimensional Gaussian of the form

centred on 67° latitude, 175° System III longitude, where x and y are measured in degrees and y is oriented along a bearing 33° east of north. The same functional form is used for both Lc and \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{3}^{+}}\), with amplitude A equal to 54 μW m−2 sr−1 and 2.75 mW m−2, respectively. We show this model background in Supplementary Fig. 4b, along with (a) the original image and (c) the residual following subtraction. A cut along the latitude 70° N is also shown in panel (d), which illustrates the excess emission in the swirl region is effectively removed. Remaining small scale features are transients. We should emphasise that, while removing this background is, in our view, an appropriate processing step, none of the key results in this study are dependent on the absolute value of the radiance in the swirl region since we concentrate on time variability.

The HST/STIS observations were obtained in programme 17471 using the F25SRF2 filter, which admits light from the H2 Lyman and Werner bands, while rejecting H Lyman-α. Data were obtained in time-tag mode, and images were extracted with a 30 s integration at the starting time of each NIRCam integration (which recall had a 3 s cadence). Images were reduced using the Leicester implementation of the Boston University pipeline60, which has been employed many times previously e.g. refs. 61,62,63. Specifically, the calibration steps are: dark count subtraction; flat field response correction; geometric distortion correction; rotation to place the planet north upward, and rescaling image size to 4.2 au; conversion of count rates into brightness units of kR per pixel of total un-absorbed H2 emission over 70–180 nm using the conversion factor 4523, corresponding to a colour ratio of 2.564 (where a kiloRayleigh (kR) is 1013 ph s−1 m−2 column radiating into 4π sr); determination of the planet centre pixel by fitting computed limb and terminator profiles, and subtraction of reflected sunlight from the planet disc, modelled by fitting Minnaert functions. The STIS Multi-Anode Microchannel Array (MAMA) detector has a plate scale of 0.025"" pix−1 (c.f. 0.06"" pix−1 for NIRCam), so for comparison with the NIRCam images, we have convolved the STIS images with a 2D boxcar filter of width 3 × 3 pixels. We then converted the H2 emission intensity in kR into W pix−1 assuming a representative 121 nm wavelength, and then projected the images to produce energy flux \({E}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\) in W m−2 on the planet in a similar fashion to that described above for the NIRCam images. As is usual practice, the FUV emission is projected to a spheroid 240 km above the 1-bar level. For the IRF analysis, the FUV data were reduced as above but extracted with a 3 s integration time to facilitate direct comparison with NIRCam values.

Following previous studies of the FUV auroras e.g. ref. 61, we have transformed the images into a coordinate system with dimensions parallel and perpendicular to the Nichols et al.42 reference main oval. The spacing along the oval is in equal steps of auroral longitude, which is phase around a point defined by the centroid of the main emission, increasing westward from the direction oriented toward the prime meridian65. We have then interpolated the image along a line perpendicular to the auroral oval at each point to produce a two-dimensional image with auroral longitude as the horizontal coordinate and the locally perpendicular direction as the vertical coordinate. We use this projection to produce a keogram as we now describe.

A keogram is a method of visualising the dynamics of auroral emission, by plotting the auroral intensity along a line versus time. The result is a 2D image, with one spatial dimension and one time dimension. The spatial dimension is chosen based on the particular analysis, and can be e.g. a straight line such as a particular meridian, or a curved path such as a statistical auroral oval or a spacecraft trajectory. The 1D intensity profiles obtained from the chosen line at different times are then stacked to create the 2D image, such as shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. In this case, the spatial coordinate is computed from the rows in the projections described above along which the REAPs propagate. Specifically, we take the mean of a strip 0.3° wide centred 3° poleward of the statistical ME. To aid visualisation we have high-pass filtered the vertical axis to highlight the rapid (~10 s) variation by subtracting a version filtered with a Gaussian kernel with standard deviation of 30 s. Vertical slices thus indicate the REAP light curve at a particular auroral longitude, as shown on the right. We have obtained the period of this pulsation from the slice shown, computed using the Scipy periodogram algorithm with a Hann window35, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. Note the significant peak at 1.6 min, which also appears with undiminished prominence in the unfiltered light curve.

Metrics details

Social status has a profound impact on mental health and propensity towards drug addiction. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of social rank on drug-seeking behavior remain unclear. Here we found that dominant male rodents (based on the tube test) had denser mesocortical dopaminergic projections and were more resistant to methamphetamine (METH)-seeking, whereas subordinates had heightened dopaminergic function in the mesolimbic pathway and were more vulnerable to METH seeking. Optogenetic activation of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway promoted winning and suppressed METH seeking in subordinates, whereas lesions of the mesocortical pathway increased METH seeking in dominants. Elevation of social rank with forced win training in subordinates led to remodeling of the dopaminergic system and prevented METH-seeking behavior. In females, however, both ranks were susceptible to METH seeking, with mesocorticolimbic pathways comparable to those in subordinate males. These results provide a framework for understanding the neural basis of the impact of social status on drug-seeking.

Drug development is a critical but notoriously resource- and time-consuming process. Traditional methods, such as high-throughput screening, rely on opportunistic trial and error and cannot ensure optimal precision design. To overcome these challenges, generative artificial intelligence methods have emerged to directly design molecules with desired properties. Here we develop a generative artificial intelligence method DiffSMol for drug discovery that generates 3D small binding molecules based on known ligand shapes. DiffSMol encapsulates ligand shape details within pretrained, expressive shape embeddings and generates binding molecules through a diffusion model. DiffSMol further modifies the generated 3D structures iteratively using shape guidance to better resemble ligand shapes, and protein pocket guidance to optimize binding affinities. We show that DiffSMol outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. When generating binding molecules resembling ligand shapes, DiffSMol with shape guidance achieves a success rate 61.4%, substantially outperforming the best baseline (11.2%), meanwhile producing molecules with de novo graph structures. DiffSMol with pocket guidance also outperforms the best baseline in binding affinities by 13.2%, and even by 17.7% when combined with shape guidance. Case studies for two critical drug targets demonstrate very favourable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of generated molecules, highlighting the potential of DiffSMol in developing promising drug candidates.

Metrics details

Metabolites, lipids, and glycans are fundamental but interconnected classes of biomolecules that form the basis of the metabolic network. These molecules are dynamically channeled through multiple pathways that govern cellular physiology and pathology. Here, we present a framework for the simultaneous spatial analysis of the metabolome, lipidome, and glycome from a single tissue section using mass spectrometry imaging. This workflow integrates a computational platform, the Spatial Augmented Multiomics Interface (Sami), which enables multiomics integration, high-dimensional clustering, spatial anatomical mapping of matched molecular features, and metabolic pathway enrichment. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we applied Sami to evaluate metabolic diversity across distinct brain regions and to compare wild-type and Ps19 Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models. Our findings reveal region-specific metabolic demands in the normal brain and highlight metabolic dysregulation in the Ps19 model, providing insights into the biochemical alterations associated with neurodegeneration.

Metabolomics1,2,3, lipidomics4,5, and glycomics6,7,8 are three distinct facets of omics methodologies, each offering a unique window into the connected and complex biochemical processes collectively known as the metabolic network. The current state of these fields lacks a unified, integrated analyses that offer a broad overview of the interconnected metabolic landscape. The development of an integrated spatially resolved metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics is crucial for advancing our knowledge of biological systems and has the potential to transform our understanding of the complex tissue metabolic heterogeneity, uncover novel hypotheses for the etiology of a range of metabolic disorders. Nevertheless, the development of such integrated approaches is challenged by the inherent differences in physicochemical properties and analytical requirements of each molecular class such as size, solubility and charge.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging emerged as a powerful tool for spatially resolved multiomics analysis, offering the possibility to overcome major limitations associated with pooled sample analysis9,10. Individual developments in spatial-metabolomics11, -lipidomics12,13,14, and -glycomics15,16,17,18,19 methodology are underway even at the single cell level20,21. To this end, recent advances in MALDI imaging have enabled multiplexed analysis of diverse biomolecules22, such as the co-analysis of lipid, N-linked glycans and proteins, or N-linked glycans and storage carbohydrates such as glycogen by optimizing sample preparation, enzyme application, matrix selection, and instrumental parameters23,24,25,26. These developments have poised MALDI imaging for broad adaptation in metabolism research, as they facilitate the acquisition of comprehensive and spatially resolved omics datasets. Further, the complexity and high dimensional nature of the datasets calls for the need of a robust computational pipeline to extract actionable and biologically relevant information for hypothesis generation17. An integrated workflow combining metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics from a single tissue section would offer unprecedented insights into the spatial and heterogenous metabolic landscape of mammalian tissues, driving the next wave of metabolism research in health and diseases.

In this study, we present an experimental-computational workflow for the integration of spatial metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics datasets from a single mouse brain section. Our minimally destructive sequential sample preparation strategy enables the collection of sub-mesoscale spatial datasets for metabolites, lipids, and glycans while preserving spatial integrity. Furthermore, we leverage the Spatial Augmented Multiomics Interface (Sami) framework to perform advanced clustering and pathway analyses. This approach facilitates the identification of spatially resolved molecular patterns and key metabolic pathways across brain regions, providing actionable insights for investigators using a reductionist approach to dissect metabolism at the regional and cellular level. The triple-omics workflow not only enhances the resolution and scope of spatial biomolecular profiling but also accelerates hypothesis generation for spatial biology research. We anticipate that this platform will be widely adopted in metabolism research, enabling the discovery of novel molecular associations and driving the next wave of spatially resolved studies focused on understanding metabolic pathways in complex biological systems.

The application of spatial metabolome, lipidome, and glycome on a single tissue section would present a multitude of benefits, primarily in maintaining the spatial continuity of the original tissue microenvironment and conserving tissue resources27,28,29,30. A spatially resolved multi-omics approach facilitates a more holistic understanding of the metabolic network underpinnings tissue heterogeneity and biology. Using a mouse brain as a model, we successfully acquired multiomics data from a single tissue section (Fig. 1). A single 10 µm thick brain section coated with N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDC) matrix was first subjected to sequential spatial metabolome and lipidome scans using MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (Fig. 1A). NEDC matrix and negative ionization mode are used for both spatial metabolome31 and lipidome32 analyses. Due to differences in ion optics tuning required for optimal transmission of low m/z metabolites (< 500 m/z) and higher m/z lipids (500–1500 m/z), metabolomics and lipidomics are performed as two separate runs (see methods, Supplemental Fig. 1). Following spatial lipidome imaging, the NEDC matrix was removed, and the tissue was fixed, then by Peptide - N -Glycosidase F (PnGase F) and Isoamylase digestion to release complex carbohydrates for spatial glycome and glycogen analysis30,31. Spatial glycomics was performed in positive mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as the ionization matrix (Fig. 1A). We annotated metabolites, lipids, glycogen, and N-glycans through monoisotopic mass, isotope pattern, and matching through MetaboScape as well as from our own library17,33 and previously published assignments11,34,35 (Supplemental Dataset 1). We successfully demonstrated acquisition spatial images for molecular features in all three omics classes from both coronal and sagittal mouse brain sections (Fig. 1B). These include metabolites, lipids, and glycans with unique spatial distributions among different regions of a coronally or sagittal cut mouse brain (Fig. 1B). This method allows for a more holistic perspective of the metabolic network of the tissue and combines three omic analyses on a single tissue section.

A Workflow for the sequential spatial analysis of the metabolome, lipidome, and glycome in mouse brain tissue sections using MALDI imaging. The process initiates with the slicing of fresh frozen mouse brains into 10 μm thick sections, either coronal or sagittal, followed by the application of the NEDC matrix for initial metabolite and lipid imaging. The same tissue sections are subsequently processed for glycomic analysis, involving isoamylase and PNGase F treatments before the application of the CHCA matrix, facilitating the visualization of complex carbohydrates like N-glycans and glycogen. Created in BioRender. Sun, R. (2025) https://BioRender.com/k02u528. B Spatial heatmaps/ion images that highlight the distribution of select biomolecules identified during the MALDI imaging of metabolome, lipidome, and glycome (n = 2, 1 for coronal section and 1 for sagittal section). The images represent both coronal and sagittal sections of mouse brains and are generated from the same tissue section following the workflow outlined in panel a. Biomolecule of interest is labeled above each heatmap/ion image, including o-phosphoethanolamine (OPE), Phosphatidic Acid (PA) (36:1), Taurine, Phosphatidylserine (PS) (O- 45:6), and Glycogen. Color scale is not absolute but is relative to the highest local concentration of the biomolecule within each specific image, allowing for spatial visualization within the sample but not between different biomolecules or samples.

To assess the reproducibility of the workflow, we performed spatial lipidomics on a sagittal brain section and compared it to lipidomics following metabolomics from an immediate adjacent brain section (Supplemental Fig. 2). Initial assessment revealed overall lower ion abundance in the total ion spectra in lipidomics following metabolomics compared to the lipidomics-only analysis as expected (Supplemental Figs. 2A, B). Despite the observed lower overall ion abundance between the spectra, the relative ratios of different m/z corresponding to lipid features have remained consistent. For example, the relative ratio for PI (38:4), LPE (22:6), and PE (38:4) when normalized to PE (40:6) remains consistent between both assays (Supplemental Fig. 2C). This is further highlighted as these lipids from both assays displayed similar spatial distribution after normalization to PE (40:6). It is worth noting that PS (40:6) showed a slight reduction even after normalization to PE (40:6), but the spatial distribution remain consistent between the two assays. Further, in parallel, we performed a similar comparison for glycomics. We again observed overall lower ion abundances in the glycomics analysis after metabolomics/lipidomics (Supplemental Figs. 3A, B), but the spatial distribution as well as ratios of glycans in the pixel-by-pixel analyses remained consistent between the two assays (Supplemental Fig. 3C). Collectively, these data demonstrate that while relative ion abundance decreases by performing the sequential workflow, the ratio of molecular features and spatial distribution within each assay remains relatively consistent and would have minimal impact spatial biological interpretation. To further demonstrate that metabolomics should be performed before lipidomics, we performed another control experiment with metabolomics after lipidomics scans (in reverse order), metabolomics performed after lipidomics analysis shown major reductions in ion abundance across the board, however, many metabolites such as aspartic acid and N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid still trend lower even after normalization (Supplemental Figs. 4A–C). It is worth noting that we observed a reduction in ion abundance from repeat sampling in both lipid and glycan scans as part of the sequential workflow. However, this reduction appears to occur consistently across the m/z range, preserving the relative ratios of lipids and glycans as well as their spatial distributions, as demonstrated by comparisons to single-method scans.

With > 105 pixels scanned per biological sample, the translation of MALDI multiomics datasets into actionable information to aid hypothesis-driven research presents a significant computational challenge. Recognizing this critical need, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline termed Spatial Augmented Multiomics Interface (Sami) that performs multiomics integration, high dimensionality reduction and clustering, spatial clustering, annotation, and pathway enrichment in one platform for the comprehensive analysis of spatial metabolome, lipidome, and glycome datasets (Fig. 2A). The first step of Sami is to perform multiomics integration, which consolidates the disparate biological features of metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics data into a singular, harmonized input suitable for high-dimensionality and pathway analyses (Fig. 2A). The smartbeam3 laser technology within the MALDI instrument registers x/y coordinates of the laser shots and preserve a unified x and y coordinates for each pixel across each omics modalities. By cross-referencing the x and y coordinates, Sami processing can determine the exact spatial location of each pixel in all datasets, effectively superimposing these multiple layers of omics information on a single spatial metadata location.

A Sami computational framework: integration and spatial analysis of metabolomic, lipidomic, and glycomic data. The process begins with the co-registration of individual omics datasets, utilizing their spatial coordinates. Following this, correlation networks are established to identify low and high positive correlations between molecules, which then undergo spatial clustering to reveal the molecular architecture of the tissue. The final phase involves pathway enrichment analysis, which is complemented by manual annotation for data interpretation. Created in BioRender. Sun, R. (2025) https://BioRender.com/f55v050. B Scatter plots showing the strong Pearson correlation coefficient between paired metabolome and lipidome datasets after multiomics integration, demonstrating the quantitative relationship between these two omics layers. C Paired spatial heatmap images of selected lipids and metabolites, such as 862.606 m/z and 256.995 m/z, reveal the distribution similarities between these molecules within the brain tissue. The color scale indicates the relative abundance from minimum (blue) to maximum (red). The monoisotopic masses and annotations are provided beneath each heatmap. The color scale corresponds to the highest pixel intensity detected for each individual biomolecule in each respective brain region. D Network analysis depicting the intricate intra- and interdomain connections of the integrated multiomics dataset. The metabolome (green), lipidome (blue), and glycome (red) nodes are connected within their respective domains (intradomain) by grey lines, while interdomain connections across different omic layers are shown in yellow.

To test the degree of fit, the x and y coordinates were cross-referenced using enhanced correlation coefficient (ECC) for geometric transformation, which is a statistical measure of imaging alignment employed by computer vision36. We leveraged these data by selecting m/z features in overlapping m/z regions of two modalities (i.e., 400–700 m/z range between metabolomics and lipidomics) (Supplemental Fig. 5A). Ion images of four m/z ratios were tested that included on-tissue and off-tissue m/z features (Supplemental Fig. 5B). We performed ECC analysis of both ion images from different modalities after pixel-to-pixel matching, or manually shifting one modality either 1, or 5 pixels in both x and y directions to demonstrate miss-alignment (Supplemental Fig. 5C). Direct pixel-to-pixel matching yielded a near perfect ECC score of 0.95 (out of 1), while shifting pixels by 1 or 5 registers resulted in a score of 0.82 and 0.67, respectively (Supplemental Fig. 5D). Finally, we demonstrated the glycan signals overlay with the original tissue scan to show spatially unique regions and accurate co-registration (Supplemental Figure 6). These data support that direct pixel-to-pixel integration provides excellent alignment between different modalities.

Successful integration opens the opportunity for additional analyses such as correlation and network analyses across modalities. We found a number of features in different modalities shown high levels co-expression, their abundance and spatial distribution (Fig. 2B, C). For example, 256.995 m/z from metabolomics and 862.606 m/z from the lipidomics analysis exhibit high levels of spatial co-expression identified after multiomics integration (Fig. 2B). Finally, we demonstrated multiomics integration through inter and intra domain connectivity via network analysis (Fig. 2D). Network analysis reveals connectivity between metabolites across different modalities, indicating effective integration of pixels across the three omics runs. This integration will enable co-analysis of metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics datasets, providing a systems-level understanding of metabolic networks and allowing for downstream pathway analysis (Fig. 2D). Collectively, our data support the generation of a single robust, integrated, single spatially resolved dataset from three different omics modalities.

High-dimensionality reduction as part of the Sami framework serves as a powerful strategy to distill high dimensional MALDI MSI datasets to actionable and manageable information (Fig. 3). To this end, UMAP has the highest computational efficiency without sufficing dimensionality reduction clustering comparing to other methods37,38,39 and has been demonstrated to perform well in MALDI imaging datasets40. Therefore, we tested whether performing UMAP clustering on the integrated triple-omics dataset is beneficial over individual UMAP analysis of single modalities. Indeed, UMAP analysis of the triple-omics dataset (metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics) encompassed unique clusters present in individual UMAP analysis of individual modalities (Supplemental Figure. 7), highlighting the importance of combined triple-omics analysis. Further, we confirmed that combining all three modalities did not reduce clustering efficiency comparing to single modality using the Silhouette score41 (Supplemental Figure. 7E). Upon performing the spatial clustering of the coronal brain, we found that the spatial clusters correspond well with the anatomically distinct brain regions similar to previous finding42,43,44 (Fig. 3B). We manually annotated each spatial cluster using Mouse Brain Atlas from the Allen Institute as a guide42 (Fig. 3B, C). This comparison revealed a high degree of similarity between the spatial clusters and the recognized brain regions, offering evidence of the biological relevance of UMAP clustering that relates to the biochemistry of the brain. To confirm this finding, we performed similar UMAP clustering and spatial annotation in the sagittal brain section as well (Fig. 3D–F). Similar to the coronal brain section, UMAP spatial clustering revealed multiple brain anatomical regions (Fig. 3F). The number of clusters displayed by UMAP in Sami can be adjusted by modifying parameters such as the clustering resolution, number of nearest neighbors and minimum distance, which influence the number and size of clusters observed in the results (Supplemental Figure. 8).

A Application of high-dimensionality reduction via UMAP on a dataset derived from a coronal brain section that has been processed through a triple-omics workflow. The UMAP plot visualizes the clustering of multidimensional omics data into a two-dimensional space, facilitating the identification of distinct clusters within the brain tissue. B The subsequent spatial clustering map displays the localized distribution of these clusters based on the precise x and y coordinates captured by the MALDI imaging laser spots. Each color on the map corresponds to a specific cluster, with the legend on the right side denoting the cluster numbers. C The clusters are then manually annotated with their respective anatomical regions by a neuropathologist using the Allen Brain Atlas as a reference. D Similar to panel a, a UMAP plot presents the high-dimensionality reduction of omics data obtained from a sagittal brain section subjected to the same triple-omics workflow, delineating the diverse molecular landscapes across different brain structures. E The subsequent spatial clustering map displays the localized distribution of these clusters based on the precise x and y coordinates captured by the MALDI imaging laser spots. Each color on the map corresponds to a specific cluster, with the legend on the right side denoting the cluster numbers. F Each cluster number is again correlated with specific anatomical regions identified in the sagittal section, guided by manual annotation by a neuropathologist with the Allen Brain Atlas.

To further enhance the utility of the spatial multiomics map, we then established a reference multiomics feature set for the annotation of brain regions. Selected features for represented clusters are shown as Radial trees and density plots (Supplemental Figs. 9A, B). Annotated clusters can serve as a reference guide, aiding in the assignment and interpretation of multiomics features across different studies. To confirm the robustness of the annotations derived through Sami, we first performed spatial triple-omics in a separate coronal brain section (test brain) and performed unsupervised spatial clustering (Supplemental Figs. 10A–D). Each cluster in the test brain were matched to one cluster in the original reference brain section through feature matching (See “Methods”), resulting in a supervised cluster matching. Using this methodology, the annotation from the clusters in the reference brain section can be directly used for the test brain section (Supplemental Figs. 10A–G). We then further tested this method in four different sagittal mouse brain sections, and the method provided excellent matching for sagittal brain sections as well among all clusters. We were able to match 100% of all clusters to the reference brain (Supplemental Figure. 10E). Further we used Jaccard index to assess the degree of matching for each individual cluster, we found an average of 0.8 (max 1) Jaccard index score (range 0.55–0.89) for all clusters tested indicating high degree of similarity among matched clusters and high reproductivity in our methods (Supplemental Figs. 10G and Supplemental Dataset 2).

Subsequent to spatial clustering and annotation, Sami performs pathway analysis, a key step to distill down large omics datasets and to provide actionable next steps for hypothesis generating research. First, we tested whether there are metabolic differences between intra-brain regions highlighted by clustering analysis within the WT brain. We performed differential expression analysis by comparing each cluster against  the rest of the clusters as illustrated by volcano plots (Fig. 4A); Based on differential expression analysis, the top 50 annotated multiomics features of each cluster exhibiting significant alterations were selected for metabolic pathway enrichment analysis via the MetaboAnalyst 3.2 pipeline embedded in Sami. Specifically, we conducted enrichment analyses using the Small Molecule Pathway Database (SMPDB)45, within MetaboAnalyst 3.2 pipeline (Supplemental Figure. 11). An example of pathway enrichment analysis for the cluster corresponds to the CA3 region of the hippocampus, which predominantly consists of excitatory pyramidal neurons, highlights the Citric Acid Cycle and Glutamate Metabolism as the top two enriched pathways (Fig. 4B, C). In contrast, the top two enriched pathways for the Corpus Callosum showed unique enrichment for gluconeogenesis, Warburg effect, and glycolysis (Supplemental Figure. 11). These findings demonstrate that multi-omics integration combined with spatial clustering can reveals region-specific metabolic signatures within the brain. In addition, Sami can also export metabolites that are over or underrepresented in each pathway (see “methods”), as well calculating a score for overall directionality of each enriched pathway to facilitate data interpretation. For example, the metabolites enriched for the citric acid cycle are aconitate, malate, pyruvate, succinate, and ADP, and it is considered down regulated overall based on Sami output (supplemental Dataset 3).

A Spatial clustering map depicting anatomical regions in a normal mouse brain, with a focus on the CA3 region, compared to the rest of the brain. A corresponding volcano plot elucidates the significant metabolic differences between the CA3 area and the rest of the brain, using adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05 to denote significance (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for multiple comparison). Metabolomic features that are elevated in the CA3 region are indicated in red, while those that are decreased are shown in blue. B Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis, constructed using the MetaboAnalyst 3.2 R package integrated within the Sami, pinpoints the specific metabolic pathways that are significantly enriched in the CA3 region (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for multiple comparison). The analysis is complemented by a metabolic network visualization, which connects the metabolic pathways identified by pathway enrichment analysis with more than 25% share metabolites, enhancing our understanding of the metabolic interplays and diversity within the CA3 region. Nodes represent biochemical pathways. The size of the nodes and color correlate with the degree of enrichment. C relative abundance of metabolites changed in the citric acid cycle, bar graphs represent pixel by pixel data from CA3 (n = 527 pixels) and non-CA3 (n = 20,000 pixels) regions of the same brain (n = 1). (mean ± SEM; p-values indicated; two-tailed t-test). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

To further demonstrate the utility of the spatial pathway enrichment analysis by Sami, we performed spatial metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics and applied Sami to probe the metabolic dysfunction between WT and the mouse model of tauopathy (Ps19). The Ps19 Alzheimer's disease mouse model expresses the human MAPT (P301S) mutant tau gene under the prion promoter, leading to progressive tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and cognitive deficits resembling frontotemporal dementia46. This model is widely used to study tauopathies, therapeutic interventions, and mechanisms of tau-driven neurodegeneration47. We perform triple-omics following Sami analysis that include co-UMAP clustering followed by pathway mapping between 9-month-old female WT and Ps19 mice (Fig. 5A–C). All three omics modalities were used for UMAP clustering similar to above, and since both WT and Ps19 mouse brains were clustered together, both brains give rise to the same (20) non-overlapping clusters (Supplemental Figure. 12). In addition, similar brain regions can be matched to the same cluster (visualized by color). i.e., cerebellum, pink; cortex, blue; corpus callosum, brown. We performed metabolic pathway enrichment (Ps19/WT) using the cluster correspond to the isocortex and cerebellum of both WT and Ps19 mouse brains. In the isocortex and we identified changes in citric acid cycle, warburg effect, carnitine synthesis, and transfer of acetyl groups to mitochondria as major pathways altered in the cortex of mouse model of tauopathy (Fig. 5D–F). In contrast, cerebellum in the tauopathy model shown changes in Starch and sucrose metabolism, Glycerolipid metabolism, glycolysis, and triacylglycerol biosynthesis (Supplemental Figure. 13). It is worth noting that metabolites such as glucose-6-phosphate, glucose, and glycogen are classified as part of starch and sucrose metabolism by the Kegg pathway.

A UMAP plot displays the integration of data from Ps19 (brown) and matched WT (blue) sagittal mouse brains (n = 1 each). B Separate UMAP plots for Ps19 and WT brains are shown, detailing the full range of clusters within each brain type. C Spatial clustering maps overlay UMAP clusters onto the anatomical structures of both Ps19 and WT mouse brains. D Spatial UMAP plots highlight a specific cluster corresponding to the frontal cortex region in sagittal sections of both Ps19 and WT brains. E Pathway enrichment analysis, using the MetaboAnalyst 3.2 R package integrated within Sami, identifies metabolic pathways that are differentially enriched in the Ps19 brain as compared to WT (Hypergeometric test, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for multiple comparison). F A metabolic network diagram connects the enriched pathways, highlighting the relationships and potential dysregulation occurring in Ps19 brains relative to WT. Nodes represent biochemical pathways. The network graphically summarizes the interconnected pathways with more than 25% overlapping metabolites. G Relative abundance of metabolites changed in the Citric acid cycle, bar graphs represent pixel by pixel data from the isocortex region of the WT (n = 2043 pixels) and Ps19 (n = 2295 pixels) brains. H Representative immunofluorescence staining images show the localization of Citrate Synthase, Aconitase, Isocitrate Dehydrogenase, and Glycogen in brain sections from WT and Ps19 mice, scale bar = 400 µm. Whole brain image is in the insert on the top right. Each row displays the enzyme or glycogen marker in both WT (top) and Ps19 (bottom) sections, with the corresponding quantification bar graphs (% positive and positive area) presented on the right (mean ± SEM, n = 3 WT and Ps19 animals; p-values indicated; two-tailed t-test). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

While both the citric acid cycle and the Warburg effect were highlighted in both intra-brain (Fig. 4B) and inter-brain regional analyses (Fig. 5E). Similarly, aconitate, malate, pyruvate, succinate were all identified as altered in both analyses, however, directionality analysis suggests that citric acid cycle is down in intra-brain analysis, but is shown as up in the inter-brain regional analyses between WT and Ps19 mice (Supplemental Dataset 4). We further demonstrate this, we extracted pixel-by-pixel relative abundance data for metabolites associated with these pathways in the intra-brain analysis of the WT brain and the WT vs. Ps19 comparison in the isocortex. Notably, although both pathways were enriched, the changes at the metabolite level differed. For example, in the CA3 region, citrate and aconitate levels were increased, while malate, succinate, and GSH levels were decreased relative to the rest of the brain (Fig. 4C). In contrast, in the Ps19 isocortex, citrate and aconitate were decreased, and malate was increased compared to WT (Fig. 5G). Additionally, glycogen, identified through glycomics analysis, was significantly elevated in the Ps19 mouse isocortex. To validate these spatial multi-omics findings, we performed multiplexed immunofluorescence analysis targeting key enzymes in the citric acid cycle and the metabolite glycogen, which is part of the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway. This analysis revealed significant reductions in the protein levels of citrate synthase, aconitase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase in the Ps19 brain (Fig. 5H). Conversely, glycogen levels were significantly increased in the Ps19 cortex, as confirmed using a previously validated anti-glycogen antibody39,40. These results support the findings from spatial multi-omics analyses and highlight the utility of integrating spatially resolved multi-omics data with targeted validation approaches for mapping region-specific metabolic changes in both healthy and diseased brains.

Metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics are corner stone techniques driving biological discovery in the last several decades48,49,50. In this study, we present a roadmap to perform simultaneous assessments of the metabolome, lipidome, and glycome from a single tissue section. This represents a major advancement compared to traditional pooled omics analyses, providing a broad and comprehensive assessment of the metabolic landscape or network. Our approach overcomes several limitations of conventional pooled methods, offering insights into the spatial distributions of a wide array of biomolecules, multimodal and integrated analysis, thereby fostering a nuanced understanding of the metabolic processes within complex tissue microenvironments. In addition, by direct sampling of whole tissue sections, the triple-omics workflow minimizes sample handling (such as tissue pulverization) and fractionation steps (phase separation)51 of pooled omics methods. The entire pipeline can be completed within a span of 72 h when imaging at a resolution of 50 µm and Sami offers a promising platform for high-throughput omics studies for the future.

In addition, we also report the robust computational framework of Sami, a series of tools customized and designed specifically to optimize multimodal datasets produced by triple-omics MALDI imaging runs. Sami's ability to integrate three different modalities and reduce high-dimensional data into spatial clusters that correlate with brain anatomy. This is followed by metabolic pathway enrichment analyses for unique spatial clusters in both healthy and disease brain tissues. Collectively, the combination of triple-mics workflow and Sami represents a leap forward in the quest to understand metabolic diversity of different brain regions. It is worth noting that these data are by nature hypothesis generating in nature and can be further tested in human and genetic mouse models by targeting specific metabolic pathways. One finding from our study is the efficacy of metabolism as a classifier of brain regions, a concept that could drive our understanding of brain functionality and neurological disorders52,53,54. The differential metabolic profiles unveiled through our pathway enrichment analyses, demarcate specific brain regions, emphasizing the spatial heterogeneity of metabolic processes within the brain. For example, The CA3 region of the hippocampus is predominantly composed of excitatory pyramidal neurons. Our pathway enrichment and network analysis highlight multiple pathways converging to mitochondrial function, presumed to be associated with pyramidal neurons. e., citric acid cycle is a core component of mitochondrial metabolism, which is critical for providing the energy required to modulate pyramidal neuronal activity and excitability55,56. Notably, glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain57, is synthesized from the Citric Acid Cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate. This metabolic linkage emphasizes the dual role of mitochondrial metabolism in both supporting the energy demands of neurons and providing the substrates necessary for neurotransmitter synthesis. Similarly, the cluster corresponding to corpus callosum are enriched for gluconeogenesis, Warburg effects, and glycolysis. It has been demonstrated the preference of glycolysis (i.e Warburg effect) by different cell types within the corpus callosum, i.e., astrocytes58, oligodendrocytes59, and microglia60. Together, these pathway analyses highlighted the potential unique metabolic demands within different regions of the brain. These findings take the first step in improving understanding of brain metabolism, paving the way for novel research avenues into the complex interplay between brain function and metabolic activity.

Sami offers spatial pathway enrichment analysis for uncovering region-specific metabolic signatures within the brain or metabolic dysregulation between WT and disease mouse brains. However, the lack of directional information from pathway enrichment highlights the importance of metabolite-level analysis. For instance, while the citric acid cycle was highlighted in both intra-regional analysis within the WT brain and WT/Ps19 isocortex analyses, the specific metabolite changes were distinct, with opposing alterations observed in citrate, aconitate, and malate. These findings underscore the necessity of extracting and evaluating the most significantly altered metabolites driving pathway enrichment to pinpoint the exact metabolic alterations in each context. Detailed metabolite-level analyses are critical to planning hypothesis-driven experiments that will advance these observations into actionable insights, such as manipulating unique metabolic enzymes in the Ps19 mouse model to improve neurodegeneration.

The current study presents the Sami workflow, which integrates metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics from a single tissue section into a unified data analysis pipeline designed for hypothesis-generating research. Using WT and Ps19 mouse brains as examples, this pipeline focuses on exploring regional heterogeneities, including intra-regional differences within WT brains and inter-regional comparisons between WT and Ps19 brains. During the sequential MALDI scan, there will be a preferential loss of lower-abundance ions, which can be mitigated through additional targeted workflows by optimizing acquisition parameters and focusing on specific molecular features based on the users interest. Strategies to address this issue should include increasing laser energy, adjusting pixel sizes, or modify quadrupole settings to boost ion intensity in targeted analyses. One limitation of this workflow is that it does not yet provide cellular-level insights. Emerging multimodal imaging approaches, such as the integration of MALDI imaging with cellular functions through techniques like Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC)61, CODEX62, Xenium63, VISIUM (spatial transcriptomics)64, are beginning to bridge this gap. Additionally, the development of MALDI immunohistochemistry holds significant promise for advancing cellular annotation on a single tissue section65. Future methodological developments will aim to assign metabolomic, lipidomic, and glycomics data to specific cellular annotations, enabling deeper biological insights into tissue function and pathology. Additional future development will focus on expanding omics feature coverage such as extracellular matrix proteins, o-linked glycans, and other small molecule metabolites66 and improving laser raster size of 5 µm (required better co-registration algorithms), which is near single-cell level67,68. We anticipate 5 µm multiomics imaging coupled to cellular annotation would offer deeper insights into metabolic cross talk and heterogeneity at the single-cell level. Additionally, while our current annotations focus on the brain, future work should seek to identify metabolic classifiers for other tissues, such as liver, kidney, and lung, and extend these analyses to metabolic diseases such as cancers, neurological disorders, and inborn errors of metabolism. The Sami framework is designed to accommodate these updates, functioning as an expandable system that can be updated as new improvements emerge. In conclusion, our data show that Sami is a powerful tool for multiomics research; we envision an even brighter future as we continue to refine and expand this innovative platform.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade acetonitrile, ethanol, methanol, water, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), N-(1-Naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDC), and recombinant isoamylase were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix was purchased from Cayman Chemical. Histological-grade xylenes were purchased from Spectrum Chemical. Citraconic anhydride for antigen retrieval was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Recombinant PNGaseF Prime was obtained from N-Zyme Scientifics (Doylestown, PA, USA). Bruker IntelliSlides (Bruker Daltonics). The following antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-Citrate synthetase (1:200, Abcam, ab197488); Alexa Fluor® 647 anti-Aconitase 2 (1:200, Abcam, ab198050); Alexa Fluor® 594 anti-Isocitrate dehydrogenase (1:200, Abcam, ab311797); mouse anti-glycogen (IV58B6) (1:500, in-house hybridoma). Secondary antibody used are: Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-mouse (1:200, Invitrogen, A21238).

Mice were housed in a climate-controlled environment with a 14 (light)/10 (dark) hours light/dark cycle with temperature (18–23 °C) and humidity (50–60%) control. Water and solid diet provided ad libitum throughout the study (Tekad #2018). Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 J mice and Ps19 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. The University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee has approved all of the animal procedures under the protocol number IACUC202200000586.

Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and decapitation. Immediately following euthanasia, the brains were surgically resected within 30 s. Mouse brains were dissected into two hemispheres coronally to expose regions to be scanned by MALDI. The brain tissue was first rinsed in 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) and subsequently rinsed twice with deionized water. The rinsed tissues were blotted dry, then slow-frozen over isopentane chilled with dry-ice for seven minutes, according to previously established protocols69,70, to ensure tissue stability and optimal preservation of analytes. Post-freezing, the samples were stored at −80 °C until further processing.

The frozen tissues were sectioned by a cryostat at an ambient temperature of −15 °C, chilled to −20 °C to prepare for cutting. A Leica CM1860 cryostat was utilized to obtain coronal sections of 10 µm thickness. Tissues were mounted onto a frozen Leica chuck using Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound as a binding agent for sectioning. The brains were shaved until the target region was exposed. The sections were then thaw-mounted onto a Bruker IntelliSlides and stored at −80 °C for future use. Post-sectioning, the tissue samples were fixed by dehydration using a vacuum desiccator for one hour. The slides were processed sequentially for small molecules, lipids, glycans and glycogen for triple omics data acquisition by MALDI imaging.

Following an hour of vacuum desiccation, N-(1-Naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDC) matrix was applied and sprayed using an HTX M5 pneumatic sprayer, using a matrix solvent of HPLC-grade methanol and water in a 70:30 mix. Then slides were sprayed with 7 mg/mL NEDC matrix in 70% methanol solvent, using 14 passes at a rate of 0.06 mL/min, a 3 mm offset, and a velocity of 1200 mm/min. The conditions were maintained at 30 °C and 10 psi, with a heated tray set at 50 °C. Following this stage, metabolites and lipids were imaged on the slides using respective instrument methods and a standardized flexImaging (v7.2).mis file to ensure consistent pixel integration across all omic runs. After lipid imaging, the slides were removed from the instrument and the NEDC matrix was stripped off using an ice-cold, 100% methanol wash for 5 min, and fixed overnight with 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin (37% Formaldehyde and 1x PBS). The protocol for CHCA matrix and enzyme application for glycans and glycogen was previously described53,71,72. Briefly, the tissue sections were dehydrated and rehydrated through a sequence of immersions once in 70% ethanol (1 min) and twice in water (3 min each). Antigen retrieval at 95 °C for 25 min, with citraconic anhydride buffer prepared using 25 μL citraconic anhydride in 50 mL water, and pH adjusted to 3 using hydrochloric acid (HCl). An HTX spray station (HTX) was used to coat the slide with a 0.2 ml aqueous solution of isoamylase (3U/slide) and PNGase F (20 mg total/slide). The spray nozzle was heated to 45 °C with a spray velocity of 900 mm/min. Following enzyme application, slides were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in a humidified chamber, and dried in a vacuum desiccator prior to matrix application (0.04 g CHCA in 5.7 ml 50% acetonitrile/50% water and 5.7 µL 25%TFA) applied with HTX sprayer.

All MALDI MSI experiments were performed on a Bruker timsTOF fleX using a 46 μm × 46 μm laser raster to produce 50 μm × 50 μm pixels. All image acquisition and setup are performed through the autopilot feature with FlexImaging 6.0 to avoid human errors. All omic runs require a standardized flexImaging .mis file to be used as a consistent masked template denoting the regions for imaging. To generate this file, slides were scanned, and high-resolution .tif files were imported to flexImaging to manually mask the regions of tissue for imaging. To optimize post-run data processing and ensure consistent pixel integration, the same .mis file was employed for all runs, paired with the appropriate omic-specific method. The metabolomics run initiated the omics workflow, during which the first and only flexImaging.mis file was created. This file was subsequently used for all future runs, ensuring aligned pixel integration across conditions while modifying the method to suit the respective omic. Small molecule metabolite imaging was conducted in negative ion mode with the following detailed settings: MS1 scan, scan range from m/z 20–750, negative polarity, summation rate mode, and a rate value of 544. The laser configuration included 50 μm × 50 μm pixels from a 46 μm × 46 μm raster scan range, 90% laser power, 1 burst of 396 shots, a frequency of 10,000 Hz, and a transfer configuration of 30 V MALDI plate offset, −60 V deflection 1 delta, 200 Vpp Funnel 1 RF, 200 Vpp Funnel 2 RF, and 200 Vpp Multipole RF. Collision energy was set to 7 eV, with a collision RF of 700 Vpp. Lipidomic imaging was performed immediately after the metabolomics run, maintaining negative ion mode. The lipidomics MS1 scan parameters included a scan range of m/z 300–2000, negative polarity, and a similar summation rate mode. The laser was configured identically with 50 μm × 50 μm pixels from a 46 μm × 46 μm raster scan range, 80% laser power, 1 burst of 300 shots, a frequency of 10,000 Hz, and corresponding transfer settings. Collision energy and collision RF parameters mirrored those used in the metabolomics imaging. Glycomic imaging data were collected after preparing the slides as described and imaging in positive ion mode with these settings: MS1 scan, scan range from m/z 700–4000, positive polarity, summation rate mode, and a rate value of 210. The laser configuration featured 50 μm × 50 μm pixels from a 46 μm × 46 μm raster scan range, 37% laser power, 1 burst of 320 shots, a frequency of 10,000 Hz, and transfer parameters of 50 V MALDI plate offset, 70 V deflection 1 delta, 500 Vpp Funnel 1 RF, 500 Vpp Funnel 2 RF, and 500 Vpp Multipole RF. Collision energy was set to 10 eV, with a collision RF of 4000 Vpp.

MALDI imaging data analysis was conducted using MetaboScape® software for exporting MS data acquired in negative ion mode into the.srd format, followed by data upload from Bruker Scils ™ Software Solutions.T-ReX® 2D algorithm was applied, focusing exclusively on MS data. Subsequent analysis incorporated parameters such as an intensity threshold of 500, speckle width and height of 3, and a maximum of 200 speckles, with ion deconvolution targeting [M-H]⁻, [M+Cl]⁻, and [M-H2O]⁻ ions. Annotation employed a hierarchical approach, starting with a curated list of 7k MS1 mammalian endogenous metabolites, followed by lipid identification using the MCube spectral library integrated into MetaboScape. Further annotation utilized a combination of in-house and public spectral libraries, including an in-house library of over 50,000 endogenous metabolites (curated through standards), the latest HMDB Metabolite Library, MoNA, MassBank, FiehnLib LipidBlast library, MetaboBASE® Personal Library 2023, the Bruker Sumner MetaboBASE®, and NIST 2022. Annotation accuracy was ensured through stringent m/z tolerances (5–10 ppm), mSigma values (25–250), and comprehensive parallel library searches, with unannotated features explored via SmartFormula for molecular formula prediction. Results were exported in.mca format to Scils for peak width refinement and ion image quality assessment before final export in.csv format. Export to a pixel-by-pixel tabular format was performed using the SCiLS lab R package and corresponding API (available from Bruker). Peak area was used and no normalization method was applied at this stage. Exported tabular metadata for each omics MALDI imaging can be found as part of the submission files.

Immediately adjacent tissue section from the MALDI imaging analysis is used for immunofluorescent analysis. Fresh frozen tissue sections were fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 1% paraformaldehyde and were rehydrated in a series of graded ethanol (95%, 70%, 50%) until water was used. Subsequently antigen retrieval was performed by immersing sections in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in Water Bath for 1 h at 96 °C then cool at room temperature for 30 min. Sections were blocked for 1 h in 2% normal goat serum and 5% (w/v) Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in 0.05% TBS/Octyl β-D-Glucopyranoside. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C, while secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. All images are acquired using the Akoya PhenoImager slide scanner.

Untargeted spatial metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics datasets, derived from MALDI imaging, were first loaded into SCiLS Lab software to check image quality and assess overall data integrity. Features with an m/z count > 400 were exported for further analysis. These selected features were exported to a tabular format using the SCiLS Lab software's API. Exported individual tabular triple omics data files are accessible as supplementary materials. Following the export, each omics file was individually co-registered based on their X and Y coordinate information embedded within the tabular file type. For the actual data integration, the co-registered omics files were converted from tabular data files (.csv) to annotated data matrices (.h5ad), normalized by total ion count and log-transformation, and merged into a single annotated data matrix by csv2h5ad() and pooldata() functions in a custom script (preprocess.py) as part of the Spatial Augmented Multiomics Interface (Sami) framework (available at https://github.com/XinBiostats/SAMI). The final output was a comprehensive annotated data matrix containing the spatially aligned m/z features from the metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics datasets. Once the data integration was complete, we proceeded with further analyses including feature correlation analysis, high-dimensional clustering, spatial mapping, cluster marker identification, and pathway enrichment analysis. More detailed methods for each of these analyses follow in subsequent sections.

The correlation analysis was executed using the Pearson correlation coefficient, with a specific lipid m/z value serving as the reference variable. The calculate_corr() function was employed to compute the correlation coefficients between the reference lipid m/z feature and all the other metabolomic features in the integrated dataset across all available pixels. Following the acquisition of correlation coefficients, scatter plots were produced using corr_plot() to visually interpret these correlations. Each pair of features was plotted, with the m/z value of metabolite on the x-axis and the m/z value of lipid on the y-axis. Correlation coefficient (r) is calculated and presented on each graph. Both calculate_corr() and corr_plot() functions are available in custom Python script “correlation.py” in Sami.

The elucidation of interactions between and within each omics domain was achieved via a comprehensive network analysis. Firstly, the DataFrame.corr() function in the “pandas” Python library version 1.5.3 was used to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficients among all pairs of m/z features, both within and between each omics domain. This provided a comprehensive matrix of correlation values that capture the potential inter- and intra-omic associations. Next, Pearson correlation larger than 0.5 on a pixel scale was retained. The corr_network() function based on “networkX” Python library 3.0 was then utilized to transform the correlation matrix into a network graph, with m/z features represented as nodes and significant correlations as edges between them. Nodes were annotated to indicate the omics domain to which the feature belongs, providing a clear picture of the interplay among metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics features. Both DataFrame.corr() and corr_network() functions are available in custom Python script “correlation.py” in Sami.

High-dimensional clustering was performed in two steps: 1) dimension reduction and 2) clustering based on the reduced dimensions. To reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while preserving critical information, scanpy.pp.pca() in “scanpy” Python library 1.9.1 (n_comps = 20) was used to perform principal component analysis (PCA) to retain top 20 principal components (PCs). Subsequently, the Leiden algorithm was employed on the 20 PCs to assign cluster memberships to pixels by using scanpy.tl.leiden() function in “scanpy” Python library 1.9.1 (resolution = 1.4). The uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) from scanpy.tl.umap() in “scanpy” Python library 1.9.1 is used to visualize the clusters. Spatial mapping of these clusters was performed by linking the clusters back to their original spatial coordinates (X and Y) within the sample. This allowed us to visualize the spatial distribution of these omics clusters and for exploring their spatial relationships. Three functions perform high-dimensional clustering and spatial mapping are available in custom script clustering.py in Sami: plot_umap_cluster() function generates UMAP and spatial mapping in parallel: plot_cluster() function creates the spatial mapping only; plot_select_cluster() function selectively plots clusters of interest in the spatial mapping. To relate these spatial clusters with known anatomical structures, we annotated each spatial cluster against the brain regions presented in the Allen Institute Mouse Brain Atlas (Available from atlas.brain-map.org). This was accomplished by overlaying the coordinates of our clusters with the spatial coordinates of the brain regions in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. Any spatial cluster that coincided with the coordinates of a particular brain region in the Atlas was annotated with the name of that region.

To demonstrate the benefits of multi-omics integration for clustering, we evaluate the clustering results of single-omics and multi-omics data using the Silhouette Score. The Silhouette Score is a widely used metric to assess the quality of clustering by measuring the cohesion and separation within and between clusters. For each data point \(i\), the Silhouette Score s(i) is defined as:

where a(i) is the average distance of sample i to all other points in its own cluster and b(i) is the average distance of sample i to points in the nearest neighboring cluster. We calculated the average Silhouette Score across all data points as the final clustering evaluation score. The Silhouette Score ranges from −1 to 1, where a higher score indicates better clustering quality, as the data points are more compact within their clusters and better separated from other clusters. The Silhouette Score was computed using the silhouette_score() function from sklearn library in Python.

Volcano plot was implemented by volcano_plot() function. Specifically, each point represents an m/z feature with its log2 fold change on the x-axis and negative log10 p-value on the y-axis. Red points represent overrepresentation, blue points represent underrepresentation, and gray points indicate non-significant pixels. To visualize the distribution and relative abundance of each m/z feature across different clusters, we generated density plots using density_plot() function, which is similar to the ones utilized in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses. These plots depict the difference of pixel abundance of a particular m/z marker in a specific cluster compared to its pixel abundance in other clusters, providing an insight into the cluster-specific distribution of these omics entities. Furthermore, top 5 markers of selected clusters from three different omics were displayed as a circular tree. All three functions are available in custom Python script “marker.py” in Sami.

To validate that the protocol and computational pipeline was robust for different tissue sections, we generated a new triple omics dataset from MALDI imaging performed on a fresh brain section. Similar to the previous steps, spatial clusters and cluster-specific markers were delineated based on the new dataset. We denoted the previous tissue section as the “reference” and the new tissue section as the “validation section”. To evaluate if the two tissue sections share a similar clustering pattern for reproducible finding, we used the cluster-specific markers to align the clusters between the two sections as the cluster IDs were generated randomly. For each cluster in the validation section, we computed the number of shared markers (50 markers for each omics set, a total of 150 markers for triple omics) between the reference clustering and each cluster in the discovery/validation section. This process was completed by cluster_mapping() function in clustering.py in Sami. We defined the matched cluster in the discovery section as the cluster with the highest number of common markers.

A differential abundance analysis was conducted to identify cluster-specific m/z by contrasting the abundance of each m/z feature in a specific cluster to the abundance of the same m/z feature in the rest of the clusters combined. A Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test is performed to compare the abundance in the two groups. The resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple testing to control the false discovery rate (FDR). For each cluster, the top 50 statistically significant features ( Adjusted pvalue < 0.05) ranked by absolute log2 transformed fold change are selected as the cluster-specific markers. These markers constituted a unique signature for each cluster, serving as identifiers in subsequent analyses such as metabolic pathway enrichment analysis. Findmarkers() function for cluster marker identification is available in custom Python script “marker.py” in Sami.

Pathway enrichment analysis was done using top 50 features of each cluster, which can be annotated and exhibiting significant alterations (Adjusted pvalue < 0.05 and ranked by absolute fold change) were selected for metabolic pathway enrichment analysis. The pathway enrichment analysis was performed via the MetaboAnalystR 3.2 pipeline embedded in Sami. This pipeline employs a hypergeometric test for over-representation analysis. Due to the absence of a comprehensive database encompassing all three - metabolome, lipidome, and glycome—for pathway mapping, we conducted separate enrichment analyses: one for combined metabolomics and glycomics via the Small Molecule Pathway Database (SMPDB)45, and another for lipids using the lipid library integrated within MetaboAnalyst. After identifying significant pathways via selected markers, we assessed their regulation by computing the log₂ fold change (log₂FC) of all measured compounds within each pathway. A pathway is classified as up-regulated if log₂FC > threshold, down-regulated if log₂FC < -threshold, and neutral if it falls within [-threshold, threshold], where the threshold (e.g., 0.1) is predefined. The function plot_dot() was used to show the enriched pathways. The function plot_bar_for_direction() was utilized to display up-regulated and down-regulated pathways separately. We further explore and visualize the relationship of cluster-specific metabolic pathways by performing a pathway network analysis. In the pathway network, nodes represent metabolic pathways and two nodes are connected if the corresponding two pathways have more than 25% shared features among combined sets. The network was generated by pathway_network() function based on Networkx package. All functions are available in custom script pathway.py in Sami (available at https://github.com/XinBiostats/SAMI).

Intraterrestrials: Discovering the Strangest Life on Earth Karen G. Lloyd Princeton University Press (2025)

Is there such a thing as a ‘beach read on microbial thermodynamics'? That was how Karen Lloyd, the author of Intraterrestrials, informally billed her book when talking to her friends in science (including myself) — and at a beach-bag-friendly 200 pages or so, this lively and compulsively engaging book is an unusual page-turner. Lloyd, a geomicrobiologist, expertly guides readers who have a taste for biological adventures to ‘intraterrestrial' life: microorganisms that survive under the most extreme environmental conditions, such as in Earth's deep sediments, deep ocean crust, volcanoes and permafrost soil.

Glaciers are not just blocks of ice — plans to save them mustn't overlook their hidden life

Glaciers are not just blocks of ice — plans to save them mustn't overlook their hidden life

The encounters include microbes that have never been cultured before, or that can live on extremely limited energy supplies, or that persist in states of suspended animation, their biological functions slowed or paused for thousands of years. The intraterrestrials in the title echo the extraterrestrials that might populate other planets and moons. But there's no need to search far for alien-like life: surprising microbes thrive here on Earth. 

Lloyd reports on this research frontier and its big-picture implications from a front-row seat, as a seasoned geomicrobiologist who has made major contributions to the unfolding story of intraterrestrials.

Sampling and studying these micro-organisms is difficult — and sometimes dangerous. Dealing with the challenges and keeping reasonably safe requires teamwork, portrayed here with the right balance of light-hearted banter and ominous foreboding. Lloyd brings the reader along as she collects gas-rich sediments and microbial mats aboard a deep-sea submersible in the Gulf of Mexico; samples sulfurous gas fumaroles in Andean volcanoes; resurrects microbes by drilling Arctic permafrost soil on the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard; and experiences hypothermia on a part of the North Carolina coast she thought she knew well.

In one colourful episode, Lloyd and her collaborators descend into the Poás Volcano in Costa Rica to sample microbes in its picturesque turquoise-green crater lake, hoping that the volcano will not erupt there and then (it did so 54 days later, the blink of an eye in geological time). Falling into or even touching the lake ‘water' during sampling — while precariously standing on ground at a boot-melting 100 °C and leaning over with a syringe — is not advised: with a pH lower than 1, its concentrated mix of sulfuric and hydrochloric acid is acutely toxic. Lloyd's adventures are briskly paced and set the stage for tackling challenges such as the physiology of acid-adapted microbes and their mode of energy generation, which not only tolerates but often requires high acidity.

Largely out of sight, intraterrestrials have, over billions of years, diversified into a veritable forest of microbial evolutionary lineages that are gradually being explored and mapped. The principal tool for this is metagenomic analysis: sequencing DNA extracted from entire microbial communities, then sorting gazillions of gene snippets into reconstructed genomes and finally deciphering their enzymes and biochemical pathways to provide the metabolic blueprint of each organism's capabilities.

Physicists have developed an obsession for finding hints of physics ‘beyond' what we already know.Credit: Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis/VCG via Getty

Nature seems to have played us for a fool in the past few decades. Much theoretical research in fundamental physics during this time has focused on the search ‘beyond' our best theories: beyond the standard model of particle physics, beyond the general theory of relativity, beyond quantum theory. But an epochal sequence of experimental results has proved many such speculations unfounded, and confirmed physics that I learnt at school half a century ago. I think physicists are failing to heed the lessons — and that, in turn, is hindering progress in physics.

Take the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Europe's particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. Peter Higgs and François Englert, two of the theorists who had established the underlying theory almost 50 years earlier, shared the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics for this feat. The Higgs boson was the last particle of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered, and spectacularly confirmed that model, rather than the dozens of theories beyond it. Meanwhile, the apparent absence of evidence for ‘supersymmetric' particles in LHC data has disappointed a generation of theoretical physicists who had bet on such particles existing, motivated by speculative theories, including string theory.

The expanding Universe — do ongoing tensions leave room for new physics?

The expanding Universe — do ongoing tensions leave room for new physics?

Or take the first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015. This was a spectacular confirmation of Albert Einstein's century-old theory of gravity, general relativity. The 2017 physics Nobel went to three physicists who had made decisive theoretical and experimental contributions to the discovery.

That same year, the near-simultaneous detection of gravitational and electromagnetic signals from the fusion of two neutron stars (the event GW170817) improved scientists' knowledge of the ratio between the speeds of gravitational and electromagnetic waves (which general relativity implies should be the same) by some 14 orders of magnitude. In one fell swoop, this excluded a huge domain of theories beyond general relativity. In a similar vein, the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for work showing that the existence and phenomenology of black holes were in complete agreement with general relativity. 

And, finally, take the 2022 physics Nobel, awarded for experiments performed over decades that verified phenomena such as quantum entanglement over great distances, falsifying speculation about theories beyond quantum mechanics. These results are often presented as surprising, but in fact they just confirmed what I was taught in school.

And yet, for decades, every new data point in particle physics or astronomy that seemed to be in some slight tension with established ideas has been announced as a hint of physics ‘beyond' current theories. Large communities of physicists have used such hints as a springboard for speculations, producing a forest of papers in the process. But these new data have always turned out to be explicable by established physics, by statistical fluctuations — or even by experimental error.

You might think that this repeated ‘no' to wild speculations beyond our best theories would encourage a certain humility in our methodological attitude. Yet I see little evidence for that among many of my fellow theorists, who remain intent on pursuing the next big theory ‘beyond' those we have today. Why?

My hunch is that it is at least partly because physicists are bad philosophers. Scientists' opinions, whether they realize it or not (and whether they like it or not), are imbued with philosophy. And many of my colleagues — especially those who argue that philosophy is irrelevant — have an idea of what science should do that originates in badly digested versions of the work of two twentieth-century philosophers: Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn.

From Kuhn comes the idea that new scientific theories are not grounded in previous ones: progress instead comes about through ‘paradigm shifts', the scientific equivalents of revolutions. Popper, meanwhile, supplies the notion that a theory is scientific only if it is ‘falsifiable': if it can be proved wrong by empirical evidence. Superficial readings of Popper and Kuhn, I think, have encouraged several assumptions that have misled a good deal of research: one, that past knowledge is not a good guide for the future and that new theories must be fished from the sky; and two, that all theories that have not yet been falsified should be considered equally plausible and in equal need of being tested.

The history of science suggests that such attitudes are wrong-headed. It is difficult, if not impossible, to think of a major advance in fundamental physics that has emerged from arbitrary hypotheses. They have instead come from two sources, both empirical.

The first is new data. Johannes Kepler's insight in the early seventeenth century that the planets move in elliptical, rather than circular, orbits around the Sun, came from observations of anomalies in the movement of Mars. James Clerk Maxwell's nineteenth-century equations of classical electromagnetism stemmed from earlier experiments by Michael Faraday and others. The founding idea of quantum mechanics came in around 1900 from studies of atomic spectroscopy. Quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong nuclear force that is one of the underpinnings of the standard model of particle physics, emerged from attempts to bring order to a zoo of newly discovered ‘hadron' particles in the 1950s and 1960s. And so on.

The second source of advances is the study of apparent inconsistencies or incoherencies in established knowledge: taking this knowledge seriously, and trying to make it consistent. A celebrated example is Einstein's 1905 special theory of relativity. Special relativity was born from the observation that Maxwell's equations account very well for electromagnetic phenomena, but say that they travel at an absolute velocity: the speed of light. This seemed to be incompatible with a fact understood since investigations by Galileo Galilei in the seventeenth century: that velocity is a relative quantity.

Why even physicists still don't understand quantum theory 100 years on

Following the naive reading of Popper and Kuhn, Einstein should have explored modifications of Maxwell's equations or forgone the relativity of velocity. He did the opposite. He trusted past scientific knowledge, kept both Maxwell's equations and the relativity of velocity, and got rid of the apparent contradiction between the two by assuming that both were right and changing something else: the idea that time and simultaneity are absolute. Einstein made the idea that simultaneity depends on how an observer is moving the foundation of a new theory of relativity.

General relativity, which Einstein introduced in 1915, is a product of a similar strategy. It is based on confidence in fundamental knowledge that had already been acquired: special relativity; Newtonian gravity in the relatively weak fields in which it had so far been tested; and Maxwell's theory as a model for circumventing a problem with Newton's gravity, that it seemed to act instantaneously over distances. Gravity, like electromagnetism, could also be assumed to have an absolute speed: the speed of light.

In these and similar cases, progress was made mostly without new data. When, in the sixteenth century, Nicolaus Copernicus explored the possibility that Earth spins and moves around the Sun, rather than the Sun around Earth, he had practically nothing more to lean on than anyone else in astronomy had in the previous millennium. Einstein said that the result of the 1887 Michelson–Morley experiment, which did indeed seem to show that the speed of light is absolute, regardless of who is observing it, was not important to him in deriving special relativity. This assertion is credible, because the Michelson–Morley result is actually irrelevant for deriving special relativity (although it is a validation of the theory). Similarly, the ability of general relativity to explain the anomalous movement of Mercury's perihelion (its point of closest approach to the Sun), which Newtonian gravity could not, worked as a validation of the new theory, but not as a source.

The fabulous case of classical electromagnetism is a little different. Fresh data from Faraday and others were essential, but Maxwell constructed his final synthesis by looking for consistency with previously discovered laws. The new physics was again born from previous knowledge — from taking it seriously as reliable information about reality.

Before I was fully awake, still fog-headed and bleary-eyed after my alarm, I could already tell that something was wrong. It was 7:30 on a frosty February morning, and my phone was already lit up with notifications. As my eyes adjusted to the light, I started to read.

“Congratulations, you've just scammed the wrong person,” read one message delivered to my personal Telegram account by an anonymous sender. “You have 10 minutes to refund the $2.8K you stole from me.” They appended a cryptocurrency wallet address.

Bewildered, I rifled through my messages, emails, and social media accounts. The situation quickly became clear: Somebody had gained access to my X account and used it to promote a fraudulent WIRED-branded crypto coin. As people purchased the coin and the price began to rise, the scammer sold their stash, wiping out investors. The people who lost money were pissed.

On X, I discovered a barrage of colorful abuse directed at my account, including a variety of racial slurs lobbed by individuals with a limited grasp of world geography. “I'm surprised people don't come to your work and smash you up maggot,” one X user wrote. “You long nose, thin pussy lips lip having ass bitch,” another person called me. “I hope a car crashes n2 you,” said somebody else.

Other users tried to report my supposed misconduct to my employer: “Your man out here stealing money,” one person wrote on X, tagging the main WIRED account.

Though unpleasant, few of the messages were directly menacing, with the exception of those from the anonymous Telegram user. “im scraping extensive information on you, including your address, relatives, friends from UCL and more,” they said, referencing my alma mater. “I will make sure your life is hell if i dont receive my refund.”

By 9 am, I was still taking refuge in bed, my laptop resting on outstretched legs. I contacted my editor, managers, and security personnel at WIRED to explain what had happened—and to ask for help. I messaged my partner too. She responded, “Oh fuuuuuck!!!”

Commonly described as either rug pulls or pump-and-dumps, crypto investment scams of this sort take place all the time. I just never imagined that I might become ensnared in one myself.

“This is a very common attack. The purpose is to do a simple pump-and-dump—to get the cash out,” says Phil Larratt, director of investigations at Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics company that helped WIRED to analyze the mechanics of the scam. “To do that, they have to have some visibility; that's why they hacked your account.”

This year alone, the X accounts of various public figures have been compromised in aid of crypto pump-and-dump schemes. Profiles belonging to a BBC journalist, politicians from the UK and Argentina, and a former vice president of the Philippines have all been used to promote fraudulent coins. Previously, accounts belonging to Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Kanye West have all been hijacked for similar crypto-flavored scams.

In theory, the more prominent the X account, the greater the potential return on the pump-and-dump, because many more people are likely to buy into the coin the scammer promotes. I tweet infrequently—mostly links to my articles—and have fewer than 2,800 followers, making me somewhat of an unlikely target. But I was valuable to the scammer for the likelihood that I am considered a trusted authority in my capacity as a crypto reporter.

“The greater exposure during the pump, the more likely it is that multiple investors will buy into the messaging and buy into the eventual dump of the coin,” says John Powers, president at private investigation agency Hudson Intelligence.

X did not respond to a request for comment.

Though crypto coins have been used in pump-and-dump schemes for years, these maneuvers have become easier to execute with the arrival of memecoin launchpads, which allow anybody to create a coin instantly, at no cost. In my case, the scammer minted the WIRED-branded coin using Pump.Fun, by far the largest launchpad platform.

“A lot of coins are used for pump-and-dumps on Pump.Fun. And when [bad actors] combine a pump-and-dump with the hack of an X account, it's potentially lucrative for them if executed correctly,” says Larratt.

“We continue to invest in making the platform safe for users,” said Pump.Fun spokesperson Troy Gravitt in a statement to WIRED. “When we find allegations of fraud, such as hacked X accounts shilling token scams, we're able to delist those tokens from our front end to mitigate any threat they might pose to unsuspecting users.”

Despite the prevalence of memecoin rug pulls, investors continue to pile into coins. “A lot of the appreciation of value in memecoins occurs very early in the process, soon after launch,” says Powers. “There's this chance you might get in at the right moment and make a killing … Timing is everything. The legitimacy of the offering is a secondary concern to many people it seems.""

I realized that my X account had been taken over on February 17, the day before the fraudulent WIRED coin was released. Have I Been Pwned, a service that lets people check whether their information has been exposed in data breaches and hacks, indicates that my X credentials had previously been distributed on a hacking forum, providing one possible explanation for my account having been compromised. Fatally, I had not put in place two-factor authentication, which meant that my password was all somebody needed to seize control of the account.

Because the scammer had swapped out my recovery email, I had to go through a longer, more arduous recovery process with X, which meant that I did not immediately regain my account. By the following morning, it was already too late. An analysis of transaction data shows that the person or group who hacked my X account created the WIRED token at 1:20 am UTC that morning.

When somebody creates a coin on Pump.Fun, they release 1 billion units into circulation and typically purchase some themselves at a nominal rate. In this case, the scammer snapped up around 5 percent of the total supply with the same crypto wallet used to issue the coin, then acquired more using two separate wallets immediately after trading began, according to analysis by Powers and Chainalysis. They used these secondary wallets to conceal the extent of their holdings from the investing public. “You can buy a certain amount of your own token. But if you buy a lot, nobody is going to buy in, because it's very suspicious,” says Larratt.

In all, the scammer commanded roughly 12 percent of the total number of WIRED coins in circulation, a sufficiently large amount to obliterate the price if they were to sell.

By 1:23 am, the scammer had begun to promote the coin on my X account; posts by other X users suggest they even appeared live on Spaces. Though they later deleted the various posts, which were gone by the time I had woken up, screenshots captured by other X users reveal the pretense they concocted.

The previous weekend, Argentinian president Javier Milei had been embroiled in a scandal involving a coin called Libra. (Milei has denied any wrongdoing.) WIRED would be launching its own crypto coin, the scammer claimed on X, in connection with the story. “I spoke to the man behind $LIBRA … probably my most interesting piece yet. He goes into detail on the setup, process and extraction, and we even stated our own $WIRED coin to show how easy it is,” the scammer wrote in a post to my X account.

In the minutes that followed, a blend of human traders and bots programmed to snatch up newly released coins began to invest. As they bought in, the price of the coin began to rise. At 1:36 am, 16 minutes after trading began, the total value peaked at $300,000. Then the scammer began to sell.

In a quickfire series of transactions on Raydium, a peer-to-peer exchange, they dumped the coins onto the market, earning the equivalent of $8,000 to $10,000, analysts estimate. By 1:45 am, the WIRED coin had lost practically all of its value.

“The amount of money they made was not a lot by comparison to other pump-and-dumps we've seen. But in 20 minutes, analysis shows they may have gained up to five times the amount they deposited,” says Larratt.

By 2 am, the revenue earned through the sale of WIRED coins had been shuffled through a web of interconnected accounts into yet another wallet—possibly tied to a coin-swapping service, according to Chainalysis—where it was blended with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of crypto from other unknown sources.

On February 19 and 24, that wallet deposited a combined $110,000 worth of crypto with Binance, a centralized exchange typically used to convert crypto into regular currency.

There, the trail goes cold. Though crypto exchanges are required in most jurisdictions to record the identities of account holders, as a matter of policy they do not disclose that information unless they receive a request from the authorities.

“We do not disclose the identities of account holders to media out of respect for our colleagues in law enforcement, to ensure the integrity of any ongoing investigations, and to prevent misidentification of innocent users,” says Binance.

In any case, criminals frequently use money mules or stolen identity documentation to open accounts with exchanges, Larratt previously told WIRED, which means that identifying the account owner is not the same as identifying the scammer.

In the days after the WIRED memecoin rug pull, I continued to receive messages from people who believed that I had scammed them. As before, the most overtly threatening messages came from the anonymous Telegram user.

“If you think I'm joking you have a fucking serious problem,” they wrote in one message, threatening to report me to WIRED management. “You really thought you can [sic] get away with it?” they said in another.

Though I suspected the threats were hollow, they were nonetheless troubling. To limit the likelihood that somebody might locate me, I signed up for a service that promised to cleanse any scraps of my personal data from the web. I also contacted my friends and family members, who had been threatened indirectly, and reported the harassment to my local police force.

Within a week, after I had posted to my X account explaining what had happened, the abusive and threatening messages stopped.

Meanwhile, people continue to pile into unpromising memecoins. Pump.Fun, the memecoin launchpad, is generating revenue at a rate of between $1 million to $2 million a day as a 1 percent cut of trades, third-party calculations show.

On April 14, the anonymous Telegram user who had threatened me posted two screenshots to X advertising large profits they had supposedly made on recent memecoin trades. “We are so retarded,” they wrote, using the slur adopted by memecoin traders to celebrate the level of risk they take. They completed the post with an emoji with dollar signs for eyes.

These days, when Nicole Yelland receives a meeting request from someone she doesn't already know, she conducts a multistep background check before deciding whether to accept. Yelland, who works in public relations for a Detroit-based nonprofit, says she'll run the person's information through Spokeo, a personal data aggregator that she pays a monthly subscription fee to use. If the contact claims to speak Spanish, Yelland says, she will casually test their ability to understand and translate trickier phrases. If something doesn't quite seem right, she'll ask the person to join a Microsoft Teams call—with their camera on.

If Yelland sounds paranoid, that's because she is. In January, before she started her current nonprofit role, Yelland says, she got roped into an elaborate scam targeting job seekers. “Now, I do the whole verification rigamarole any time someone reaches out to me,” she tells WIRED.

Digital imposter scams aren't new; messaging platforms, social media sites, and dating apps have long been rife with fakery. In a time when remote work and distributed teams have become commonplace, professional communications channels are no longer safe, either. The same artificial intelligence tools that tech companies promise will boost worker productivity are also making it easier for criminals and fraudsters to construct fake personas in seconds.

On LinkedIn, it can be hard to distinguish a slightly touched-up headshot of a real person from a too-polished, AI-generated facsimile. Deepfake videos are getting so good that longtime email scammers are pivoting to impersonating people on live video calls. According to the US Federal Trade Commission, reports of job and employment related scams nearly tripled from 2020 to 2024, and actual losses from those scams have increased from $90 million to $500 million.

Yelland says the scammers that approached her back in January were impersonating a real company, one with a legitimate product. The “hiring manager” she corresponded with over email also seemed legit, even sharing a slide deck outlining the responsibilities of the role they were advertising. But during the first video interview, Yelland says, the scammers refused to turn their cameras on during a Microsoft Teams meeting and made unusual requests for detailed personal information, including her driver's license number. Realizing she'd been duped, Yelland slammed her laptop shut.

These kinds of schemes have become so widespread that AI startups have emerged promising to detect other AI-enabled deepfakes, including GetReal Labs and Reality Defender. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also runs an identity-verification startup called Tools for Humanity, which makes eye-scanning devices that capture a person's biometric data, create a unique identifier for their identity, and store that information on the blockchain. The whole idea behind it is proving “personhood,” or that someone is a real human. (Lots of people working on blockchain technology say that blockchain is the solution for identity verification.)

But some corporate professionals are turning instead to old-fashioned social engineering techniques to verify every fishy-seeming interaction they have. Welcome to the Age of Paranoia, when someone might ask you to send them an email while you're mid-conversation on the phone, slide into your Instagram DMs to ensure the LinkedIn message you sent was really from you, or request you text a selfie with a time stamp, proving you are who you claim to be. Some colleagues say they even share code words with each other, so they have a way to ensure they're not being misled if an encounter feels off.

“What's funny is, the lo-fi approach works,” says Daniel Goldman, a blockchain software engineer and former startup founder. Goldman says he began changing his own behavior after he heard a prominent figure in the crypto world had been convincingly deepfaked on a video call. “It put the fear of god in me,” he says. Afterward, he warned his family and friends that even if they hear what they believe is his voice or see him on a video call asking for something concrete—like money or an internet password—they should hang up and email him first before doing anything.

Ken Schumacher, founder of the recruitment verification service Ropes, says he's worked with hiring managers who ask job candidates rapid-fire questions about the city where they claim to live on their résumé, such as their favorite coffee shops and places to hang out. If the applicant is actually based in that geographic region, Schumacher says, they should be able to respond quickly with accurate details.

Another verification tactic some people use, Schumacher says, is what he calls the “phone camera trick.” If someone suspects the person they're talking to over video chat is being deceitful, they can ask them to hold up their phone camera to show their laptop. The idea is to verify whether the individual may be running deepfake technology on their computer, obscuring their true identity or surroundings. But it's safe to say this approach can also be off-putting: Honest job candidates may be hesitant to show off the inside of their homes or offices, or worry a hiring manager is trying to learn details about their personal lives.

“Everyone is on edge and wary of each other now,” Schumacher says.

While turning yourself into a human captcha may be a fairly effective approach to operational security, even the most paranoid admit these checks create an atmosphere of distrust before two parties have even had the chance to really connect. They can also be a huge time suck. “I feel like something's gotta give,” Yelland says. “I'm wasting so much time at work just trying to figure out if people are real.”

Jessica Eise, an assistant professor studying climate change and social behavior at Indiana University Bloomington, says her research team has been forced to essentially become digital forensics experts due to the amount of fraudsters who respond to ads for paid virtual surveys. (Scammers aren't as interested in the unpaid surveys, unsurprisingly.) If the research project is federally funded, all of the online participants have to be over the age of 18 and living in the US.

“My team would check time stamps for when participants answered emails, and if the timing was suspicious, we could guess they might be in a different time zone,” Eise says. “Then we'd look for other clues we came to recognize, like certain formats of email address or incoherent demographic data.”

Eise says the amount of time her team spent screening people was “exorbitant” and that they've now shrunk the size of the cohort for each study and have turned to “snowball sampling,” or recruiting people they know personally to join their studies. The researchers are also handing out more physical flyers to solicit participants in person. “We care a lot about making sure that our data has integrity, that we're studying who we say we're trying to study,” she says. “I don't think there's an easy solution to this.”

Barring any widespread technical solution, a little common sense can go a long way in spotting bad actors. Yelland shared with me the slide deck that she received as part of the fake job pitch. At first glance, it seemed legit, but when she looked at it again, a few details stood out. The job promised to pay substantially more than the average salary for a similar role in her location and offered unlimited vacation time, generous paid parental leave, and fully covered health care benefits. In today's job environment, that might have been the biggest tipoff of all that it was a scam.

When it comes to online dating, Giovanni Wolfram, a 25-year-old living in Santa Fe, New Mexico, isn't all too worried about whether his fellow dating app users will find him attractive. Rather, his biggest fear is that he might come off as “cringey.”

“You can get away with being ugly,” Wolfram says. “But being cringey is just like—that's a character that's imprinted on you.” Since he first joined Hinge at 18, he has worked hard to scrub his profile of sincerity. He's kept his responses to Hinge's prompts sarcastic and ironic, sort of as a litmus test. Some people take his snark seriously, but those people don't get a response from him.

“Intellectually, I'm really all about sincerity and earnestness,” says Wolfram, but he worries about “being perceived as one of those guys who is too earnest and too sincere.”

Sincerity, earnestness, irony-free declarations of contentment—these are all things many young adults edit out of their online personas. Much of what Gen Z considers “cringe” might strike others simply as directness and honesty, but one generation's authenticity is another's red flag. Young adults' tendencies toward lightheartedness and jokes in their online self-presentation may point to the way many of them are dealing with feelings of vulnerability and disillusionment.

Jordan Meisel, a New York psychologist whose clientele includes college students and twentysomethings, has noticed the demographic's reluctance toward sincerity. “I think there's just an awareness that it's far more vulnerable to create a persona that feels accurate to who you are as opposed to who you think you're supposed to be or who you'd like to be,” she says.

It's easier to make a joke, Meisel says, because when you present yourself seriously, you run the risk of there being laughter anyway—at your expense. “Emotionally speaking, you can't hurt me if I never show myself to you,” she says.

When Wolfram is messaging potential matches in the dating apps, it's humor or nothing. “A lot of times I will just not be able to think of something funny enough. And the idea of being sincere is so repulsive that I just won't answer,” he says.

Wolfram says he rarely matches with people whose profiles are “too earnest”—for example, if they share that they enjoy “lazy days in bed with a joint.”

I ask Lila Goodwillie, a 25-year-old New Yorker, whether “cringeyness” would repel her from someone's profile. “Unfortunately, yes,” she says. “I'm not proud of that, because I feel like when I meet people in person, I kind of like nerdy guys. I kind of like guys who are a little dorky and maybe a little bit cringe,” she says.

But on the apps, her taste is distorted. “People are getting more picky,” she says. “People are getting turned off by the cringe factor.”

To illustrate this, she points out some of the famously clichéd, tired tropes she sees in dating app profiles: the guy holding a fish he caught, the “military guy,” the guy who posts shirtless selfies from the gym. Over time, she has identified more archetypes she finds cringe: the guy who writes “ask me about the time I went motor biking across Vietnam,” the guy who uses the “two truths and a lie” prompt, the voice note guy, the guy whose profile includes videos of himself playing guitar. At this point, it's difficult to escape the fate of being slotted into one of many cringey categories.

To Goodwillie, earnestness also suggests an open-armed—and deeply uncool—embrace of dating apps as a mechanism for finding love. “My mom always says, ‘You're going to meet someone when you least expect it,'” she says. “I kind of feel like I always have that in the back of my mind when I'm looking at profiles. I'm like, ‘Oh, I'm not taking this very seriously. I'm just going to see what happens and maybe I'll meet someone, maybe I won't.' So I feel like I tend to gravitate toward the profiles that also seem like they have that same sort of casual attitude about it.”

Will Gray, 26, of Nashville is also put off by profiles he feels are too serious. He's seen responses to Hinge prompts he interprets as too sincere, like, “What I'm looking for: a man who will always support me through thick and thin no matter what.”

“I'm being very judgmental. I guess that's part of what the apps do—they make you judgmental,” he says.

He held his distaste for earnest responses in mind when creating his own profile. When it came time for him to answer the app's prompts, he wanted to come off as sarcastic and lighthearted, feeling the “the threat of being too serious.” He describes his profile “semi-serious” and “somewhat sarcastic.”

“That's partially just me not wanting to be vulnerable, or being insecure,” he says.

Gray admits that this self-consciousness can hinder young people's ability to get what they likely want out of the apps: love and companionship. “The people bringing that serious and earnest energy, frankly, probably have the most long-term success, because they're being open and vulnerable and earnest and clear about what they want.”

Anabelle Williams, 25 from Brooklyn, agrees with Gray that directness on the apps is probably a significant indicator of success. Her friend who indicated she was looking for a long-term relationship is now in one with someone who also clearly stated that same desire.

But in Williams' own online dating life, someone stating what they're looking for is “the biggest red flag I could have ever seen,” she says, describing it as “embarrassing.” “When I would see somebody saying ‘looking for a long-term relationship,' I was like, ‘OK, you're not looking for me. You're just looking for anyone.”

Similarly, Liam Katz, 24, also of Brooklyn, describes sincerity on dating apps as “unnatural.” He compared an earnest-seeming online dating profile to “a picture of someone alone in front of the Statue of Liberty.”

“When you're at a party with someone, very seldom are you going to be like, ‘Oh yeah, by the way, I don't smoke cigarettes very often, I'm looking for a short-term relationship, and this is my sign.' That's not how people start talking,” Katz says. He calls that level of immediate disclosure “ridiculous.”

“Usually it starts with you kind of joking around about something,” he says. “That's kind of lost a bit, where I think dating apps are so, like, ‘I'm looking for someone who's this, this, and this, perfect. This person fits my match, let's go out.' And I think that's kind of lame and sad.”

The culture of harsh judgment on dating apps makes users hyperaware of how they're perceived. In the same way Katz finds others' profiles cringe, he's conscious about not wanting to come off that way himself. “It's scary because you know how harshly you judge people on the app” Katz says. “We're all doing the same thing.”

Meisel, the psychologist, finds that young adults have plenty of pejorative terms to describe sincerity. “For people who are going to college and meeting a lot of new people for the first time, a huge fear is that they're going to come off as cringe, try-hard, pick-me. There's just all of these weaponized terms that really control the social landscape,” she says.

Her younger patients often struggle at first to identify that it's precisely this fear that's getting in the way of their happiness. “It's common that people come in feeling lonely, feeling disconnected, socially anxious, but they're not quite sure why. And then in our conversations it becomes clear that these fears are playing an integral role in maintaining this distance from other people.”

Meisel thinks this aversion to vulnerability is related to a larger sense of disillusionment with the world. “It is very vogue to be cynical, to be pessimistic, to be an end-days thinker,” she says. “I think taking a protective stance is in line with having a cynical view of the future.”

“Vulnerability, in the form of genuineness, is the opposite of that,” she says.

In some ways, Gen Z is following in the footsteps of their elders—millennial irony was a much-discussed phenomenon of the early 2010s. But that ironic distance has given way to more sincere norms as millennials have arrived in middle age.

Wolfram finds millennials' sincerity “revolting.” He points to how they respond to dating app prompts in the way they're intended to be responded to. If the prompt asks the user to share their likes, for example, he often sees millennials “write two paragraphs of lists of everything that they actually like,” he says. “It's very confusing.”

Gen Z's fear of cringeyness might be cut from a different cloth than millennial irony. Wolfram thinks his “slice of Gen Z” is “much, much more irony-poisoned” than those just slightly younger or older, in part because the looming threat of being judged online has haunted his cohort from an early age. “A lot of it is learned,” he says. “I remember when I was a kid, I posted on Facebook this really sad-boy meme, and I got made fun of for it.”

Fully escaping the accusation of cringeyness in online dating might be a lost cause, because another cringeworthy offense, apparently, is simply being on a dating app in the first place.

“I feel like dating apps in general are already a little cringe,” says 24-year-old Manhattanite Erica Dick. She wants the profile of a prospective partner to reflect her discomfort. “There's absolutely this idea of ‘Let us acknowledge that this is weird.' I guess I'm looking for someone else who is feeling the same way as me.”

Since dating apps are already a tacit admission of the desire for a relationship, a profile that suggests you're not taking the app too seriously may be part of an effort to offset the “cringe” inherent in just being there. Multiple people mentioned that, on Hinge, many list their “most irrational fear” or the “riskiest thing” they've ever done as “downloading this app.”

But Meisel thinks there's hope. She sees some of her younger clients rebelling against the fear of cringe. “They're seeing how that vulnerability and sincerity is necessary in order to create meaningful deep relationships.”

I never knew I needed a pet camera, but now I don't think I can ever go into the office (or on vacation) again without one. A security camera can give you extra peace of mind when you're out, and pet cameras specifically designed for our furry friends combine things like the ability to follow your pet around, engage in play, or dispense kibble for an added bonus. Connected to an app on your phone and with Cloud storage options, these pet cameras—including our top pick, the Tkenpro 2K Pet Camera Treat Dispenser ($70)—ensure you'll never miss a moment in your pet's life when you're away (or home).

For more peace of mind while you're away from your pet, be sure to check out our related guides, like the Best Automatic Feeders, Best Cat Water Fountains, Best Automatic Litter Boxes, Best Indoor Security Cameras, and Best Outdoor Security Cameras.

Regular Security Camera vs. Pet Camera

So, is there really a difference between security cameras and pet cameras? Sort of.

Security cameras enable you to watch your house (and pet) while you're away, but pet cameras often have a few more pet-specific features, like dispensing treats or abilities to interact with your pet via two-way speaker. These cameras with special features can help ease common issues like separation anxiety or boredom. The Enabot Rola PetPal Robot Pet Companion, for example, has attachments so you can remotely give your pet a treat or engage in “playtime” (more on that in the review below).

That's not to say that you can't use a security camera as a pet cam, but like any other smart home device that connects to Wi-Fi, there's a chance it can be hacked and compromise your privacy. Make sure your Wi-Fi password is strong, set up two-factor authentication with your camera's app, and it's not a bad idea to keep it turned off when you're home, as an extra precaution.

How I Tested

Keeping the criteria in mind above, I looked for security cameras that had extra pet-specific features. I set up each camera individually, noting any difficulty or issues with initial setup, configuration with Wi-Fi, and speed and reliability of the camera feed. I tested each camera for at least a week (most, much longer) in various spots around my house and rigorously tested the extra features available on most of the cameras, like scheduled feedings, food-dispensing, playtime, and scheduled recordings, and I noted any issues. Over the months of testing, I went out of town several times and completely relied on these cams to keep an eye on my two children—I mean, cats.

What Are We Testing Next?

I'm about to start testing the newest camera in Enabot's lineup, the EBO Air 2 Companion Robot. I also want to test the Furbo 360 Cat Camera (as if my cats don't have enough toys or snacks).

This smart pet camera uses pan rotation for an almost-360-degree viewing angle. It has a crystal clear, 2K HD live videofeed and intelligent infrared night vision. The bottom of the camera has suction cups, making it easy to move around the house without needing hardware. Through the app, you can pan the camera, take photos and record video, talk and listen to your pet through the microphone, schedule repeated regular feedings, or toss them a snack. This camera has motion, bark, and voice detection, and AI auto tracking—meaning when something out of the norm is detected, the app sends you a notification.

Its AI features create a minute-long video from motion-triggered recordings and automatically saves it for 30 days, and you can download and share on socials. You can opt for cloud storage (with the option to upgrade to a monthly subscription for 30 days of continuous recording) or you can buy a memory card (up to 128 G) for 24/7 recording. The video is always hi-def clear, never laggy or giving error messages, and I love that I can pan to see the whole room.

This camera from Petcube is great, but it suffers one of the pitfalls I have with the rest of the brand's lineup—the features are seriously limited if you don't want to pay for Petcube's upgraded Care plan (which starts at $4 a month) with video storage, pet detection, and automatic video recording capabilities. At a super-affordable price, this camera has 360 PTZ rotation capabilities, 1080p HD resolution, 8X digital zoom, 2-way audio, night vision—all the bells and whistles for under $50.

There's optional mounting that requires some tools, so setup is a bit tricky. The camera feed rotated pretty smoothly, and with the wide fish-eye-like lens and panning abilities, I was able to clearly see more of the room than I thought possible. Plus, with the new privacy mode, you can easily turn off the camera lens for more security. I was pleasantly surprised by this 360 PTZ camera and its seriously affordable price.

This food-dispensing camera from Petcube has HD 1080p live streaming video, night vision up to 30 feet, ability to zoom up to 8X, and two-way audio to talk to and hear your pets. There's also an easily detachable plastic treat dispenser that holds up to 1.5 pounds of kibble, and you can toss treats remotely from the app, where you can also control the amount and distance.

With the subscription service, the app alerts you when motion or sound is detected, and logs it with playback video stored in-app. I like the customization capabilities and clear videofeed, but like other Petcube devices, you sort of need the extra Care plan to unlock all of the best features.

This simple, compact camera from Petcube doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but it's a great price for being a reliable, basic pet camera. Like others in Petcube's lineup, it has a 1080p HD camera, night vision, and two-way audio. It sits on hinges and can angle upward and downward, with the option to flip the videofeed in-app if you want to lay it horizontally. Like other Petcube cameras, you need the brand's subscription Care plan to get any features beyond live feed.

You can set a “motion zone” to only get notifications in a specific area, and you connect your phone's location to the app, so that you're alerted more often when away. You can also share the camera feed with others so they can watch remotely and only specify certain times you want shared. This camera is basic, but it has a high-quality camera feed and advanced extras that make it a steal at this price.

This model from Petcube attempts to combine popular laser toys that cats go crazy for with a pet security cam, to mixed results. Like many other cameras from the brand's lineup, it has crystal clear color and night vision, an extrawide view, two-way audio, and fun features available with the paid Care plan, like video history, playback, and a 30-second compilation reel of highlights of the day.

The laser toy is supposed to auto-engage when motion is detected, but very often it didn't, and when it happened to catch my cats' attention, it stopped displaying the laser soon after. Plus, because the camera needed to sit high on a shelf to see the area, the laser was often too high for the cats to attempt to catch. You can manually play with the cat with the laser through the app, although it's often laggy, and my cats ended up being more perplexed than playful when the laser was on. It's a solid camera but the toy aspect falls a bit flat.

This rolling pet camera has the best of intentions, but the sometimes glitchy app makes the combo pet camera/toy/feeder a little unpredictable. Through the app, you can watch your cats on the security cam and drive the robot around, pressing buttons to do tricks and dispense treats. You can watch the camera feed live from the app, but you can also schedule recordings, which are viewable via Cloud Playback. The robot is also supposed to detect abnormal movement or sounds, like barking or broken glass, and send a smart alert to the owner with a timestamp to make anything out of the ordinary easier to monitor while away.

The bot also automatically compiles a 30-second “day-in-the-life”-type video of your pet so you can watch a recap while away, and through AI-powered pet recognition, the bot can also snap a picture of your pet. All of those AI features were unreliable. Although the promised AI capabilities fell flat, I liked being able to move the bot around my house to watch everything going on, since the camera was not just stationary in one spot.

Furbo

Furbo

This Furbo 360 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is marketed toward dogs, but like gender, it's a construct—both cats and dogs will like this treat-dispensing cam. Former WIRED reviewer Haley Sprankle praised it for its clear 1080p and color night-vision camera, two-way communication, noise notifications, 360-degree pan abilities, and treat dispensing. It also has Auto Tracking, which follows your pet to make it easier to find them without having to search your phone screen.

Like the majority of pet cams, there's an option to subscribe to Furbo's Nanny service, which snaps pics and sends safety alerts about things like smoke or fallen objects—even chewing alerts—and can spot intruders too. The video clips are stored in the cloud so you can review the footage at any time.

Chewy

This solid pet cam from Closer Pets (I've tested a few of the brand's automatic feeders with mixed reviews) features an HD camera, two-way communication, motion detection, a built-in memory card, and 1-cup storage for kibble or treats, which can be scheduled or given at random. The video feed was always crystal clear, although sound was a bit laggy and hard to hear well. The treat portions were huge, dispensing a heaping handful of kibble at even the lowest setting. The alert sound when dispensing is super jarring, and my pets were scared of it—there was no way to silence it.

Because of the placement of the hole for dispensing kibble, the camera is angled low, which made it hard to see the area I wanted while giving enough room for the treats to dispense downward. I ended up nixing the feedings after a while because of this problem. There's an option to wall mount, which would mitigate this problem, but I like being able to move the cam to different areas. This is a solid pet camera whose additional features become a burden rather than an asset.

Catit

Amazon

Catit

This cutie doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but if you prioritize having an adorable pet camera, look no further. It looks like a miniature mouse with oversized, magnetic feet that attach to a metal stand, and the mouse legs hinge so you can adjust the camera's height and angle. It's cute but expensive for what it is—the lens doesn't move and requires microSD to get video footage beyond a live feed. The videofeed auto-adjusts from color to night vision, and with the SD card, you can scroll through the video to see the goings-on from past days, record live footage, and save photos and videos to your smartphone's camera roll.

Two-way audio is also supported, and you can set the camera to only capture select motion detection. Although it was hard to pinpoint exactly which time you're looking at when reviewing footage, video feed can be laggy, and there were connectivity issues a few times. Overall, I still recommend this camera if it's on deep discount, but it's a tad expensive at this price point for its (lack of) capabilities.

Petlibro

Amazon

Chewy

Petlibro

While this is primarily an automatic cat feeder (and a damn good one at that), the Petlibro Granary Feeder shot to the top of my list because of its incredible camera surveillance capabilities. The feeder is connected to Wi-Fi and controlled via an app, dispensing food based on a feeding schedule you create. This features a 1080p HD camera in color and night vision, so you can watch and hear your pet eat at all hours when far away, and you can communicate with them via speaker. Through the Petlibro app (for Android and iOs), you set up a feeding schedule or feed snacks; plus, you can store and review pet videos in the cloud with a 30-day video history.

The app also alerts with real-time notifications when the motion and sound sensors are set off, and you can even customize sensitivity and detection range settings based on preference. The camera has a downward-facing 145-degree wide-angle lens, and that customizable range in small, medium, and large surveillance area lets you choose how much of the surrounding area you see. I love closely monitoring how much and often my pets are eating with the camera right on the feeder.

Petkit

The Petkit Purobot Ultra Automatic Cat Litter Box (8/10 WIRED Recommends) uses a camera and AI technology to monitor litter box usage and the goings-on around your automatic box, and actually lets you see your cat's stool to help more closely monitor their health. The camera's 210-degree-wide angle is attached to an arm in front of the opening, which swivels 180 degrees and follows your cat when it senses motion and records both the outside goings-on and the inside of the litter box. You can also manually move the camera through the app to pan to the outside or inside of the box. It records in both color and black-and-white, plus it has night vision.

Through the app, you can view the camera footage live or watch short clips of each time your cat—or anyone—walks near the litter box and when a cat uses it. You get a free trial of Premium Petkit Care+ for 30 days from setup, and there are three tiers of subscription plans, starting at $4 a month for Basic and going up to $12 a month for Premium+, so that you can watch any and all footage taken. The automatic litter box also uses AI to identify which cat used the box through the videos taken.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The EPA Will Likely Gut Team That Studies Health Risks From Chemicals","https://www.wired.com/story/epa-iris-health-risks-chemicals-nancy-beck/","Mon, 12 May 2025 15:29:32 GMT","

In early May, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would split up the agency's main arm devoted to scientific research. According to a report from NPR, scientists at the 1,500-person Office of Research and Development were told to apply to roughly 500 new scientific research positions that would be sprinkled into other areas of the agency—and to expect further cuts to their organization in the weeks to come.

This reorganization threatens the existence of a tiny but crucial program housed within this office: the Integrated Risk Information System Program, commonly referred to as IRIS. This program is responsible for providing independent research on the risks of chemicals, helping other offices within the agency set regulations for chemicals and compounds that could pose a danger to human health. The program's leader departed recently, ahead of the restructuring announcement.

The EPA's reorganization, experts say, will likely break up this crucial program—which has been targeted for decades by the chemical industry and right-wing interests.

“Unfortunately, right now, it looks like the polluters won,” says Thomas Burke, the founder and emeritus director of the Johns Hopkins Risk Sciences and Public Policy Institute and a former deputy assistant administrator of the EPA's Office of Research and Development.

“The May 2 announcement is all part of a larger, comprehensive effort to restructure the entire agency,” EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou told WIRED in an email. “EPA is working expeditiously through the reorganization process and will provide additional information when it's available.”

Formed in the mid-1980s, the IRIS program was designed to investigate the health impacts of chemicals, collating the best available research from across the world to provide analyses of potential hazards from new and existing substances. The program confers with other offices within the EPA to identify top chemicals of concern that merit further research and study.

Unlike other offices in the EPA, the IRIS program has no regulatory responsibilities; rather, it exists solely to provide science on which to base potential new regulations. Experts say this insulates IRIS-produced assessments from outside pressures that could influence research done in other areas of the agency.

“There's independence” in being in a centralized program like IRIS, says Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, also a former principal deputy assistant administrator of the Office of Research and Development and a former EPA science adviser. “They're not trying to evaluate risk for a specific purpose. They're just evaluating risk and providing fundamental information.”

Since its inception, IRIS has created a database of more than 570 chemicals and compounds with assessments of their potential human health effects. This body of research underpins not just federal policy, but helps guide state and international regulations as well.

The IRIS database is the “gold standard for health assessments for chemical pollutants,” says Burke. “Virtually all of our regulated pollutants, virtually all of our cleanups, virtually all of our major successes in regulating toxic chemicals were touched by IRIS or the IRIS staff.”

Yet IRIS has faced a significant uphill battle in recent years. For one, there's the sheer number of chemicals it has had to review with limited manpower. There are more than 80,000 chemicals that have been registered for use in the US, and chemical companies register hundreds more each year. Some of the chemicals IRIS is working to research have been substances of concern for years, while some have more recently drawn new scrutiny. For instance, forever chemicals—synthetic materials so named because of their persistence in the environment—have been in use for decades, but their recent prevalence in tests of water and soil prompted IRIS in 2019 to begin creating draft assessments for five common types of these chemicals.

Opposition from industry has also bogged down IRIS reviews. The very existence of the IRIS program, experts say, threatens many crucial chemicals used by a variety of industries. A new IRIS assessment finding that a specific chemical that's been in use for years is carcinogenic, for instance, could hamper industries that rely on that chemical if the EPA decides to pass new regulation. Chemical companies and lobbying groups have waged a long battle against the IRIS program, using various tactics—including introducing opposing research produced by paid consulting groups—to downplay the program's findings and delay assessments. In 2018, for instance, The Intercept reported that an environmental consulting company that counts chemical giants among its clients challenged an IRIS assessment of chloroprene, a chemical used in rubber production. The program was forced to use resources and staff time putting together an extensive response defending its analysis.

“‘Hate the policy, attack the science' became a strategy for many major industries,” says Burke. “They learned that the delay game of attacking the science led to the delay of implementing regulation.”

President Donald Trump's first administration also tried to attack IRIS. A 2018 Senate appropriations bill suggested eliminating IRIS's independence by folding it into another program within the EPA. IRIS also faced challenges from new leadership inside the EPA, including Nancy Beck, a former policy director at the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the main lobbying arm for the chemical industry, who oversaw the EPA's office of chemical regulation between 2017 and 2020. Yet Congress eventually chose to fund the program that year, and the general structure of IRIS survived past the first Trump administration.

But with such a long track record of opposition—and with Trump's second administration ripping up entire agencies—it's perhaps unsurprising that IRIS is on the chopping block now. The program was singled out twice in Project 2025. IRIS has also been attacked by legislation introduced in Congress this session, called the No IRIS Act. A press release for the House bill quotes the CEO of ACC, who also authored an op-ed in the Washington Examiner in March calling on the agency to eliminate the program.

In a separate press release issued last week, the ACC lauded EPA administrator Lee Zeldin's choice to reorganize the agency. While the EPA has made no public comment about the future of the IRIS program, the press release devotes two paragraphs to IRIS, claiming that the program's assessments “jeopardize access to critical chemistries, undercut national priorities, and harm American competitiveness,” while asserting the ACC's support for the No IRIS Act.

“The IRIS program has never been authorized by Congress, and since 2009 the program has remained on the [Government Accountability Office's] High-Risk List, which identifies government programs that are vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement,” the ACC press release states. But in the original High-Risk List addition in 2009, the GAO stated that it added IRIS not over concerns of fraud or abuse, but because the program was not working through analyses of harmful chemicals fast enough to protect the public. “Some of the IRIS assessments that have been in progress the longest cover key chemicals likely to cause cancer or other significant health effects,” the 2009 listing states. Several reforms since then, the GAO report states, have improved the program. GAO's current critiques of IRIS, updated in 2025, focus mainly around a lack of staff and budget needed to speed up reviews.

Tom Flanagin, a spokesperson from the American Chemistry Council, told WIRED in an email that the group believes “the IRIS program should be disbanded and the responsibilities of the program should be returned to the program offices” and that Congress should pass the No IRIS Act.

“IRIS assessments jeopardize access to critical chemistries, undercut national priorities, and harm American competitiveness,” Flanagin added.

If IRIS is eliminated, experts say, EPA research on toxic chemicals will continue—but the work will likely be siloed to offices dealing with specific aspects of the environment. Instead of a central body coordinating independent reviews, individual offices will have to do more targeted assessments of chemical impacts.

“If Office of Water wants to look at a chemical like arsenic, and the [Office of Air and Radiation] is also looking at arsenic, and Superfund is also looking at arsenic—they could come up with different numbers, and that could set up a vulnerability for the agency,” says Orme-Zavaleta.

Research on chemicals will now also be loaded onto a reduced workforce of scientists working under an administration with new priorities. While significantly slashing the agency's budget, Zeldin has said he intends to put EPA staff to work clearing the backlog of new industrial chemicals and pesticides awaiting approval in the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. That office is now headed, once again, by Beck, the former ACC policy director, who helped rewrite rules making it more difficult to track the health consequences of certain forever chemicals during her first tenure at the EPA.

“Your attack on Dr. Beck is insulting and unfounded,” Vaseliou, the EPA spokesperson, told WIRED. “This is yet another example of false accusations that left propaganda also known as media take as gospel. It's fascinating that the liberal media continues to mischaracterize Dr. Beck's time at ACC, fails to mention her time as a career civil servant (at both the state and federal level for over a decade) and fails to mention that she was a Science and Technology Policy Fellow with the American Association for the Advancement of Science for two years, a program that is typically considered to be highly competitive and highly regarded.”

“As she has done her entire career, Dr. Beck remains committed to being led by the science, unlike Biden EPA appointees with major ethical issues that were beholden to radical stakeholder groups,” Vaseliou added.

Regardless of how research is reorganized moving forward, experts say that the mass of scientists being forced out of the agency will slow down any future regulation of chemicals.

“Nothing is getting regulated right now,” says Orme-Zavaleta. “Reorganization takes a lot of time. They're here for a four-year stint, and not much is going to happen other than rollbacks. That's part of the strategy: Have people leave, and upend things so much that nothing is getting done.”

On Monday, Google announced the launch of its AI Futures Fund, a new initiative that seeks to invest in startups that are building with the latest AI tools from Google DeepMind, the company's AI R&D lab. 

The fund will back startups from seed to late stage and will offer varying degrees of support, including allowing founders to have early access to Google AI models from DeepMind, the ability to work with Google experts from DeepMind and Google Labs, and Google Cloud credits. Some startups will also have the opportunity to receive direct investment from Google. 

“The AI Futures Fund doesn't follow a batch or cohort model,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Instead, we consider opportunities on a rolling basis —there's no fixed application window or deadline. When we come across companies that align with the fund's thesis, we may choose to invest. We're not announcing a specific fund size at this time, and check sizes vary based on the company's stage and needs — typically early to mid-stage, with flexibility for later-stage opportunities as well.”

AI Futures Fund already has some case studies. Startups such as the meme-making platform Viggle and the webtoon app Toonsutra participated in the program. 

Startups can apply here starting May 12. 

Google has been making big commitments over the past few months to support the next generation of AI talent and scientific breakthroughs.

Last November, Google.org, the company's charitable wing, announced a $20 million cash commitment to researchers and scientists working in AI. Before that, in September, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company was creating a $120 million Global AI Opportunity fund to help bring AI education and training to more places across the world. Google.org also launched a $20 million generative AI accelerator program to cut checks to nonprofits developing AI tech.

Google also has its Google for Startups Founders Funds, which supports founders from an array of industries and backgrounds building companies, including AI companies. A spokesperson told TechCrunch in February that this year, the fund would start investing in AI-focused startups in the U.S., with more information to come at a later date.

Google's openly available Gemma collection of AI models has reached a milestone: over 150 million downloads. Omar Sanseviero, a developer relations engineer at Google DeepMind, announced the figure on X over the weekend, also revealing that developers have created more than 70,000 variants of Gemma on the AI dev platform Hugging Face.

Gemma just passed 150 million downloads and over 70k variants on Hugging Face🚀🚀🚀What would you like to see in the next Gemma versions?

Google launched Gemma in February 2024, aiming to compete with other “open” model families like Meta's Llama. The latest Gemma releases are multimodal, meaning that they can work with images as well as text, and support over 100 languages. Google has also created versions of Gemma fine-tuned for particular applications, like drug discovery.

While 140 million downloads in roughly a year is a head-turning metric, Gemma trails far behind Llama, perhaps its chief rival, which surpassed 1.2 billion downloads in late April. 

Worth noting is that Gemma, as well as Llama, has been criticized for custom, non-standard licensing terms, which some devs say have made using the models commercially a risky proposition.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is using his olive oil inefficiently in an “offense to horticulture,” the Financial Times humorously reports.

For its “Lunch with the FT” series, the paper joined Altman in his kitchen. He prepared a garlicky pasta and salad, taking a rare break from his demanding job of advocating for the disruption of American copyright law.

Altman uses Graza olive oil, which comes in beautifully-branded squeeze bottles that are popular on social media (he is a millennial, after all). But Altman's preference for over-priced, “trendy” oil is not the crime — the crime is that he appears to fundamentally misunderstand Graza's schtick. The company sells distinctly-marked “sizzle” and “drizzle” varieties of its olive oil for sautéeing and finishing dishes, respectively.

To be fair, Spanish olive cultivation isn't exactly common knowledge. But if you are so dedicated to the art of cooking that you stock two types of olive oil on your kitchen counter, you would probably know that one bottle is far pricier than the other because it's meant to be used as a post-cooking “drizzle,” not a frying oil.

Altman used the “drizzle” finishing oil in his sautée pan, even though the “sizzle” oil was just inches away. It's like taking fresh basil and cooking it down in a pan as though it's spinach: it's a waste of precious earthly material. At that rate, you might as well just throw some dollar bills in the pan… which is not not the playbook of Silicon Valley startups, incidentally.

OpenAI raised a record-setting $40 billion in a new funding round this year, yet it continues to bleed money, reportedly losing about $5 billion last year. It's not clear how the company will turn a profit with such monumental costs. OpenAI was at one point losing money on its $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro plan.

Altman's culinary faux pas probably can't shed much light on OpenAI's financials. But if you're the kind of person who wastes pricey cooking oil, it could be that you're burning VC money, too.

Apple is planning to increase the prices of its iPhone lineup set to launch this autumn, though it is trying not to make it seem as if the hikes are connected to the U.S. tariffs on imports from China, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing anonymous sources.

The company is considering instead linking the price hikes to other developments, which might include new features and designs, the report said, citing anonymous supply chain sources. 

Increased tariffs are expected to cost Apple $900 million in the third quarter, though the company has so far not confirmed if the U.S.-China trade war could impact the prices of its products. The company is also now importing a larger portion of its iPhones from India, rather than China, to mitigate tariffs. 

The U.S. and China on Monday, however, agreed to pause their respective reciprocal tariffs on each other for 90 days to allow time for further discussions. Trump's government has also announced major tariff exemptions for the tech industry, particularly for smartphones, laptops, hard drives, and machines that make semiconductors, though a previous 20% tariff on Chinese goods still applies.

Apple is set to debut an ultra-thin iPhone this year, multiple outlets have reported previously.

The company is also said to have more ambitious plans for 2027. Come 2027, we might see the company doing away with a cutout on iPhones altogether, per Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

The company plans to release a “mostly glass, curved iPhone” with no cutouts on the iPhone's 20th anniversary, Bloomberg reported. That would be fitting, given Apple began its last major redesign effort with the iPhone X in 2017, the smartphone's 10th anniversary.

General Motors has turned to Sterling Anderson, a veteran of the autonomous vehicle industry, to oversee its entire product line of gas-powered and electric vehicles, in a newly created job that will touch nearly every department at the U.S. automaker. The new VP of global product and chief product officer position will cover the entire lifecycle of GM's portfolio and include hardware, software, services, and user experience.

Anderson, who will report to GM President Mark Reuss, starts in the new position June 2. He will based in the company's Mountain View Tech Center in California. 

Anderson made headlines last week after announcing he was resigning from Aurora, the autonomous vehicle company he co-founded with two other pioneers in the AV sector. His resignation, which includes from the Aurora board, came just a week after the company launched its commercial self-driving truck service in Texas. 

Anderson told TechCrunch he had not anticipated leaving Aurora, but the more conversations he had with GM leadership, including Chair and CEO Mary Barra, the more he “appreciated the potential for what we could do there.”

“The scope of what we'll do at GM is expansive,” he noted in a recent interview. “It's an ability to affect millions of people's lives for the better, including with just magical experiences in their vehicles that also improve the safety and efficacy of our roadways.”

Anderson's role covers every nook and cranny at GM, which under Barra has pushed to modernize and electrify its portfolio of vehicles. He will lead vehicle and manufacturing engineering, battery, and software and services product management teams. That means Kurt Kelty, who heads battery, propulsion, and sustainability and also hailed from Tesla, will report to Anderson.

The automaker's heads of global manufacturing and product engineering, software and services, vehicle product programs, safety, and integration will also report to Anderson.

“Our customers are expecting more from our vehicles than ever before,” Reuss said in a statement. “We have an opportunity to evolve the way we build from the ground up, with tighter integration between software and hardware, shorter development cycles, and an unwavering focus on a seamless customer experience. Sterling brings decades of leadership in automotive engineering and transformative software innovation to his new role and is the right leader to help GM continue leading now and into the future.” 

Anderson said he would not have left Aurora, where he was chief product officer, if the company had not recently met its major driverless self-driving truck service milestone.

Anderson wouldn't say what was on his initial to-do list at GM, noting he would focus on understanding the company, its culture, and products. 

Anderson said there was “a pretty long list of things” that he is very interested in understanding better. However, GM shareholders, customers, and employees shouldn't expect extreme departures from the company's current path.

He noted that his areas of interest are all in line with the vision Barra has laid out, such as the need for rapid iteration and software-defined vehicle platforms that provide customers with services and updates for the vehicle through its lifetime.

Anderson was director of Tesla's Autopilot program when he left to co-found Aurora in 2017 alongside CEO Chris Urmson, the former head of the Google self-driving project, and Drew Bagnell, who was leading Uber's autonomy and perception team. The pedigree of the trio gave Aurora immediate buzz, helping it attract high-profile investors like Sequoia Capital, Amazon, and T. Rowe Price Associates, as well as a slew of partnerships.

Anderson holds master's and PhD degrees in robotics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

It sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but it actually comes from a lab in Maryland.

In 2018, Liangbing Hu, a materials scientist at the University of Maryland, devised a way to turn ordinary wood into a material stronger than steel. It seemed like yet another headline-grabbing discovery that wouldn't make it out of the lab.

“All these people came to him,” said Alex Lau, CEO of InventWood, “He's like, OK, this is amazing, but I'm a university professor. I don't know quite what to do about it.”

Rather than give up, Hu spent the next few years refining the technology, reducing the time it took to make the material from more than a week to a few hours. Soon, it was ready to commercialize, and he licensed the technology to InventWood.

Now, the startup's first batches of Superwood will be produced starting this summer.

“Right now, coming out of this first-of-a-kind commercial plant — so it's a smaller plant — we're focused on skin applications,” Lau said. “Eventually we want to get to the bones of the building. Ninety percent of the carbon impact from buildings is concrete and steel in the construction of the building.”

To build the factory, InventWood has raised $15 million in the first close of a Series A round. The round was led by the Grantham Foundation with participation from Baruch Future Ventures, Builders VC, and Muus Climate Partners, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. 

InventWood's Superwood product starts with regular timber, which is mostly composed of two compounds, cellulose and lignin. The goal is to strengthen the cellulose already present in the wood. “The cellulose nanocrystal is actually stronger than a carbon fiber,” Lau said. 

The company treats it with “food industry” chemicals to modify the lignin in the wood, he said, and then compresses the result to increase the hydrogen bonds between cellulose molecules. 

“We might densify the material by 4x and you might think, ‘Oh, it'll be four times strong, because it has four times the fiber.' But it's actually more like 10 times stronger because of all these extra bonds that get created,” Lau said.

The result is a material that has 50% more tensile strength than steel with a strength-to-weight ratio that's 10 times better, the company said. It's also Class A fire rated, or highly resistant to flame, and resistant to rot and pests. With some polymer impregnated, it can be stabilized for outdoor use like siding, decking, or roofing. InventWood's first products will be facade materials for commercial and high-end residential buildings, Lau said.

Compressing the material also concentrates the colors. “You end up with something that looks like these richer, tropical hardwoods,” he added.

Ultimately, InventWood is planning to use wood chips to create structural beams of any dimension that won't need finishing. “Imagine your I-beams look like this,” Lau said, holding up a sample of Superwood. “They're beautiful, like walnut, ipe. These are the natural colors. We haven't stained any of this.”

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

Police and federal agencies have found a controversial new way to skirt the growing patchwork of laws that curb how they use facial recognition: an AI model that can track people using attributes like body size, gender, hair color and style, clothing, and accessories. 

The tool, called Track and built by the video analytics company Veritone, is used by 400 customers, including state and local police departments and universities all over the US. It is also expanding federally: US attorneys at the Department of Justice began using Track for criminal investigations last August. Veritone's broader suite of AI tools, which includes bona fide facial recognition, is also used by the Department of Homeland Security—which houses immigration agencies—and the Department of Defense, according to the company. 

“The whole vision behind Track in the first place,” says Veritone CEO Ryan Steelberg, was “if we're not allowed to track people's faces, how do we assist in trying to potentially identify criminals or malicious behavior or activity?” In addition to tracking individuals where facial recognition isn't legally allowed, Steelberg says, it allows for tracking when faces are obscured or not visible. 

The product has drawn criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union, which—after learning of the tool through MIT Technology Review—said it was the first instance they'd seen of a nonbiometric tracking system used at scale in the US. They warned that it raises many of the same privacy concerns as facial recognition but also introduces new ones at a time when the Trump administration is pushing federal agencies to ramp up monitoring of protesters, immigrants, and students.

Veritone gave us a demonstration of Track in which it analyzed people in footage from different environments, ranging from the January 6 riots to subway stations. You can use it to find people by specifying body size, gender, hair color and style, shoes, clothing, and various accessories. The tool can then assemble timelines, tracking a person across different locations and video feeds. It can be accessed through Amazon and Microsoft cloud platforms.

In an interview, Steelberg said that the number of attributes Track uses to identify people will continue to grow. When asked if Track differentiates on the basis of skin tone, a company spokesperson said it's one of the attributes the algorithm uses to tell people apart but that the software does not currently allow users to search for people by skin color. Track currently operates only on recorded video, but Steelberg claims the company is less than a year from being able to run it on live video feeds.

Agencies using Track can add footage from police body cameras, drones, public videos on YouTube, or so-called citizen upload footage (from Ring cameras or cell phones, for example) in response to police requests. 

“We like to call this our Jason Bourne app,” Steelberg says. He expects the technology to come under scrutiny in court cases but says, “I hope we're exonerating people as much as we're helping police find the bad guys.” The public sector currently accounts for only 6% of Veritone's business (most of its clients are media and entertainment companies), but the company says that's its fastest-growing market, with clients in places including California, Washington, Colorado, New Jersey, and Illinois. 

That rapid expansion has started to cause alarm in certain quarters. Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, wrote in 2019 that artificial intelligence would someday expedite the tedious task of combing through surveillance footage, enabling automated analysis regardless of whether a crime has occurred. Since then, lots of police-tech companies have been building video analytics systems that can, for example, detect when a person enters a certain area. However, Stanley says, Track is the first product he's seen make broad tracking of particular people technologically feasible at scale.

Trump appointee Darren Beattie requested records regarding a large list of high-profile names, organizations, and right-wing buzzwords for a “Twitter files”-style document dump about alleged conservative censorship.

“This is a potentially authoritarian technology,” he says. “One that gives great powers to the police and the government that will make it easier for them, no doubt, to solve certain crimes, but will also make it easier for them to overuse this technology, and to potentially abuse it.”

Chances of such abusive surveillance, Stanley says, are particularly high right now in the federal agencies where Veritone has customers. The Department of Homeland Security said last month that it will monitor the social media activities of immigrants and use evidence it finds there to deny visas and green cards, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has detained activists following pro-Palestinian statements or appearances at protests. 

In an interview, Jon Gacek, general manager of Veritone's public-sector business, said that Track is a “culling tool” meant to speed up the task of identifying important parts of videos, not a general surveillance tool. Veritone did not specify which groups within the Department of Homeland Security or other federal agencies use Track. The Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. 

For police departments, the tool dramatically expands the amount of video that can be used in investigations. Whereas facial recognition requires footage in which faces are clearly visible, Track doesn't have that limitation. Nathan Wessler, an attorney for the ACLU, says this means police might comb through videos they had no interest in before. 

“It creates a categorically new scale and nature of privacy invasion and potential for abuse that was literally not possible any time before in human history,” Wessler says. “You're now talking about not speeding up what a cop could do, but creating a capability that no cop ever had before.”

Track's expansion comes as laws limiting the use of facial recognition have spread, sparked by wrongful arrests in which officers have been overly confident in the judgments of algorithms.  Numerous studies have shown that such algorithms are less accurate with nonwhite faces. Laws in Montana and Maine sharply limit when police can use it—it's not allowed in real time with live video—while San Francisco and Oakland, California have near-complete bans on facial recognition. Track provides an alternative. 

Though such laws often reference “biometric data,” Wessler says this phrase is far from clearly defined. It generally refers to immutable characteristics like faces, gait and fingerprints rather than things that change, like clothing. But certain attributes, such as body size, blur this distinction. 

Consider also, Wessler says, someone in winter who frequently wears the same boots, coat, and backpack. “Their profile is going to be the same day after day,” Wessler says. “The potential to track somebody over time based on how they're moving across a whole bunch of different saved video feeds is pretty equivalent to face recognition.”

In other words, Track might provide a way of following someone that raises many of the same concerns as facial recognition, but isn't subject to laws restricting use of facial recognition because it does not technically involve biometric data. Steelberg said there are several ongoing cases that include video evidence from Track, but that he couldn't name the cases or comment further. So for now, it's unclear whether it's being adopted in jurisdictions where facial recognition is banned.  

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

On a distant planet in a future where space travel through wormholes is routine—and corny soap operas are considered “premium entertainment”—surveyors make a discovery that would surely be deadly, if not for the Security Unit they've reluctantly brought with them. That's Murderbot, Apple TV+'s latest sci-fi venture, which layers that premise with many nuances, delights, shocks, and multidimensional characters, including the robot.

Especially the robot. Alexander Skarsgård, who also executive produces, stars as the sentient construct made partially of metal, partially of cloned organic materials. The humans on the survey team are initially unaware it's secretly named itself “Murderbot,” so they call it “SecUnit.” They're also initially unaware that SecUnit is curious enough to have hacked its own “governor module,” the part of its programming that makes it have to obey all human commands, and is therefore completely rogue.

However, Murderbot still takes direction, albeit while grumbling in sarcastic voice-overs about how very weird humans are. It would much rather spend its time binging the thousands of hours of media it's downloaded—the viewer is treated to frequent glimpses of its favorite show, the hilariously lurid Star Trek riff The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon—than doing its actual job. But it has realized, much to its surprise, that these particular humans are actually… not terrible.

As Murderbot shows us in a way that gently pokes fun (but is never mean-spirited), hippies find a way to persist even in an era where much of existence is beholden to the cold, greedy laws of “the Company.” Somehow, they're a beacon of feel-good vibes in a system that gets by on cynicism and cruelty. Though the group hails from Preservation Alliance, a rare independent planet, they still must comply with the all-powerful corporation that won't permit their survey mission unless they rent the required equipment. Since they're on a budget, they go for the most cost-efficient choices, including a recently refurbished older-model SecUnit.

To Murderbot's surprise, these “idiots” consider it to be a person, an actual member of the team. That belief is further justified once they see its rather human-looking face, and realize there's something resembling a personality lurking beneath all that awkwardness and disdain. As SecUnit gets to know them, and steps up to protect them again and again, Murderbot finds a way into exploring larger questions about the differences between humans and machines, and the idea that self-awareness can have quite the learning curve no matter what material you're made from.

Murderbot‘s casting is impeccable, so all praise to creators, writers, directors, and executive producers Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz and their team for assembling this group; along with Skarsgård, it's headed up by Noma Dumezweni as even-tempered (but prone to panic attacks) team leader Dr. Mensah and David Dastmalchian as augmented human Dr. Gurathin, who's distrustful of Murderbot from the start. The rest of the crew includes Sabrina Wu, Akshay Khanna, Tattiawna Jones, and Tamara Podemski, whose characters have palpably close relationships even before the mission begins.

Murderbot is based on Martha Wells' Hugo- and Nebula-winning Murderbot Diaries book series, but it specifically hews to the plot of All Systems Red, the 2017 novella that introduced Murderbot to the world. The adaptation is quite faithful though there are some understandable changes. The show obviously leans on voice-over to let the audience in on Murderbot's ongoing internal dialogue (his disgusted reactions help propel the series' wry sense of humor). A few characters are missing. And a few plot points are altered in ways that make the show's central mystery more visually dynamic.

Oh yeah, that's right: Murderbot is also a mystery. Very soon after they arrive, the team realizes all is not what it seems on that distant planet. The pieces come together in a suspenseful yet fast-paced way—most episodes hover around 25 minutes and end on cliffhangers—as Murderbot and the humans become determined to outwit a murky yet obviously powerful threat.

No plot spoilers here, but it's entirely worth pointing out that while the sci-fi thrills are a lot of fun, Murderbot‘s true pleasures come from its characters. Dumezweni is wonderful as the kind-hearted boss who treats everyone like family, but can and will step up to kick ass when needed; Dastmalchian has his best role since Late Night With the Devil, this time as a man who's overcome hell to find a safe place on Mensah's team, and isn't about to let a heavily armed and probably untrustworthy robot jeopardize that.

Best of all, though, is Skarsgård. He makes Murderbot both physically imposing and completely nerdy, balancing thoughtful internal monologues with deadpan reactions and swift, violent action. Murderbot's Sanctuary Moon addiction may be a source of comedy, but the show and the performer also tap into it very cleverly, showing how absorbing trashy TV has actually taught it a great deal of emotional maturity—not to mention providing crack solutions to real-world problems.

Murderbot‘s first two episodes arrive May 16 on Apple TV+, followed by a weekly rollout.

Boy, some people have all the genetic luck. In a recent study, scientists describe a newly discovered mutation that allows humans to naturally sleep much fewer hours a night without any negative health effects.

Researchers in China conducted the study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The mutation was found in a 70-year-old healthy woman who's lived her whole life barely sleeping. The findings could someday help us understand how to better treat sleep disorders that plague the rest of humanity, the researchers say.

Most people need around seven to nine hours of sleep a night for optimal health. But there are some out there who are so-called natural short sleepers, able to rest between four and six hours every night without experiencing the symptoms of sleep deprivation (not to be confused with the roughly one-third of people who sleep less than seven hours a night and suffer for it). Research has found that these individuals tend to carry unique genetic mutations.

Brains Scans Reveal What Really Happens When Your Mind Goes Blank

So far, scientists have found mutations in four different genes (DEC2, NPSR1, GRM1, and ADRB1) tied to natural short sleep. But the researchers behind this new study have now found another: the salt-inducible kinase 3, or SIK3, gene, named after the protein it makes. SIK3 is a protein kinase, a type of enzyme. It's thought to play a role in our metabolism, but past research (mostly in mice) has also suggested that it helps influence sleep duration.

The team analyzed the sleeping patterns and DNA of their volunteer. Though she reported usually only needing three hours of sleep a night, actigraphy recordings (movement at night typically captured via wristwatch) found that she actually slept a still very breezy 6.3 hours a night on average. The team's genetic exploration also identified a particular mutation in the SIK3 gene—dubbed N783Y—that seemed to explain her natural short sleep.

To confirm their discovery, they engineered mice with the same mutation, and found that they too slept less than normal mice did. The mutation appears to inhibit SIK3's ability to transfer certain molecules to other proteins as usual, particularly proteins important to the synapses, the connections that form between neurons.

“These findings underscore the conserved function of SIK3 as a critical gene in human sleep regulation,” the authors wrote.

Why Your Workouts Before Bedtime Need to Stop

Perhaps only around 1% of the world's population are natural short sleepers. But the lessons we learn from unraveling their unique genetic gift could help scientists find new drug targets for treating sleep disorders. The study researchers have already found some evidence that other protein kinases similar to SIK3 also play a part in affecting our sleep duration.

“These findings advance our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of sleep, highlight the broader implications of kinase activity in sleep regulation across species, and provide further support for potential therapeutic strategies to enhance sleep efficiency,” they wrote.

In any case, here's hoping scientists also discover the genetic reason why my cat has to wake me up at 6 in the morning rain or shine, despite knowing that breakfast is hours away.

While the possibility of life beyond Earth has long captivated the public, there are already tiny organisms on our own planet that are as alien to us as anything we've imagined.

These microbes are found in places once thought inhospitable to life, such as inside volcanoes, underneath the Earth's crust in the deep sea, or in the Arctic permafrost. Not only are they surviving in these harsh environments, they're doing so in ways that challenge basic principles of biology scientists thought were firmly established.

Karen Lloyd, a microbial biogeochemist at the University of Southern California, has been studying these subsurface organisms for much of her life. In her new book, Intraterrestrials: Discovering the Strangest Life on Earth, she takes readers on a guided tour of her own work and that of others, exploring what makes these microbes tick.

Gizmodo spoke to Lloyd about the discoveries scientists like her have made to date, the enduring mysteries about these earthly aliens, and why trying to understand them is so important. The following conversation may have been lightly edited for grammar and clarity.

Ed Cara, Gizmodo: What led you down this research path in the first place?

Karen Lloyd: I was really into chemistry as an undergraduate, and just the sort of mysteriousness of chemistry is honestly where I got my start. But then I was headed to chemistry grad school and it just felt too narrow. I just needed—I knew there was a way to do this science out in nature somewhere. And the way to do that was oceanography because that's a place, not a discipline. I chose oceanography so that I wouldn't have to choose between biology, physics, chemistry, and geology. I have to do them all.

Then just by happenstance, there was a lab that was looking at these microbes that were isolated from the deep sea. And I didn't know going into it that there was this world of deep life. Obviously, no one knows it until you're told. But when I found out it was there, I was like, ‘Okay, this is a place where I can use all these tools, these basic fundamental tools, to find out new discoveries about biology.' And from there, I was hooked.

Gizmodo: What makes these life forms stranger than the life we're used to seeing and studying up top?

Lloyd: One of the biggest things that immediately jumps out at you is that these things are on deep branches on the tree of life. So we might think that a slug is on a very different branch of the tree of life from like a kitty cat. But we're talking about the slug and the kitty cat collapsing into the same branch compared to all these new types of microbes. I mean there are things that we never could have guessed—that life was as varied on Earth as we now know that it is. They're just so different evolutionarily from everything that we see with our eyes.

Gizmodo: How are they reshaping some of the rules that we thought we had worked out about life?

Lloyd: We've always known that there's such a thing as life without oxygen. There are a lot of places that are free of oxygen, like life inside our guts. That's not new. But the idea that you can have an entire ecosystem that never needs oxygen and never needs the influence of plant matter, for instance; that can basically just exist solely on chemical reactions coming from inside the Earth—that's new. That's what we're learning with these guys.

Gizmodo: It feels like this field has only barely begun. What are some of the biggest questions left to solve about their biology?

Lloyd: The biggest questions left are still very basic fundamental questions.

I mean, a lot of what we know is inferred from these highly specialized techniques that we have to use to get at them. You know, it's not real. You can't just walk up to them like you can a tree and be like, ‘Okay, that's got roots. I know what it's doing.'

So we're still asking questions like, who all is there? And what are they doing? What are they eating? What role do they play on Earth? How do they interact with metals? What role do they play in the development of Earth's evolution over time?

Gizmodo: This is your life's work obviously. But what's the latest project or research that you're spearheading right now?

Lloyd: Yeah, I just got back from New Zealand. They have an amazing subduction zone. That's where two tectonic plates are overlapping each other. And that process creates volcanoes, but it also creates this sort of like alchemic mixture that enables these subsurface communities to take hold. So we drove all over New Zealand, sampled a lot of land and worked with local folks. It's just really fun to do this work, just on a human level as well.

Gizmodo: What would you like our readers to most take away from reading your book?

Lloyd: I hope that people feel a sense of hope and possibility. One can imagine that you could get stuck thinking that all science is known or that the questions are small because we've tackled all the big ones. That there's nothing left to explore. We know where all the continents are. We've pretty much got a handle on how many planetary bodies we have in the solar system. But that's just the beginning.

There's a whole world underneath our feet, for example. Not that there aren't mysteries in those other places too, but we are just tapping into this stuff. So I hope that people leave with a sense of hope and possibility at all the amazing things we have left to learn about life here.

Intraterrestrials: Discovering the Strangest Life on Earth is set to be released on May 13 by Princeton University Press.

Matthew LaBrot, a Tesla employee who created the website Tesla Employees Against Elon Musk, was fired from the company two weeks ago. LaBrot claimed in a LinkedIn post that he was terminated for having created the site, and because he was part of a larger group of employees who publicly asked Elon Musk to resign from the company. 

Tesla has faced several crises this year—major recalls, declining sales, litigation, and a volatile stock price, to name a few. Sales of the cars declined for the first time in more than a decade in 2024, and were down again by 13% in the first quarter of 2025. In Europe, the company's troubles are especially pronounced with a nearly 50 percent sales decline in Germany last month and France seeing a similar 59 percent drop in the same period. 

Tesla has blamed falling sales on the release of a new Model Y, the company's best-selling model. On their Q1 2025 earnings call last month, the company explained that there simply weren't “enough of the new Model Y available in most markets” at the beginning of the year to make a positive impact on sales. 

Not so, say the employees behind the letter, who signed off as “Tesla Employees for a New Chapter.” They argue that Tesla's troubles are not due to missteps in Model Y production, but rather to the public reputation of the company's polarizing CEO, Elon Musk. “Let's be clear: we are not the problem. Our products are not the problem. Our engineering, service, and delivery teams are not the problem. The problem is demand. The problem is Elon.” 

It's worth noting that Tesla itself made a similar statement on its earnings call last month, conceding somewhat hilariously that “unwanted hostility towards our brand and our people had an impact [on sales] in certain markets.”

This assessment jibes with expert analysis, much of which has blamed Tesla's struggling sales on its CEO's recent foray into right-wing politics. Last year, Musk donated at least $288 million to help elect Donald Trump and other republican candidates to office. And as a special advisor to President Trump, Musk has spent much of his 2025 at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), home to the administration's efforts to dramatically cut (and falsely boast about cutting) government spending. 

In early 2025, Musk's participation in politics sparked a grassroots protest movement called Tesla Takedown, which has rallied demonstrators at Tesla showrooms and charging stations around the country. And while it has since recovered some losses, the company's stock price plummeted at the beginning of the year. Through mid-March, the company's share price had dropped by 38% since the beginning of 2025. 

Amid pressure from investors, Musk announced on Tesla's Q1 earnings call that he'd be stepping back from his work in Washington to spend more time at the company. 

In their open letter, Tesla Employees for a New Chapter called Musk's decision “tone-deaf” and “insulting.” “It implies that the hardships of the past six months stem from a lack of his attention, not from his actions. It shifts the blame onto the very people who have held this company together,” they continued. 

According to his LinkedIn, LaBrot worked in “Sales and Delivery Training” at Tesla and had been with the company for more than five years before his dismissal.

What is Intel cooking for Computex?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Just days before Computex, the parent company of Maxsun has registered new Intel Arc B580 models with 24GB of VRAM with the EEC, via Olrak at X, further stoking existing rumors of a high-VRAM Battlemage card. Remember that EEC (Eurasian Economic Commission) submissions aren't definitive confirmations of any product. Manufacturers often register placeholder configurations to cover all future possibilities, many of which never end up seeing the light of day. Therefore, you should treat this leak with a healthy dose of skepticism.

Intel launched its Arc B580 and Arc B570 GPUs in December and January, respectively, bringing its Battlemage architecture to the desktop market just months after Lunar Lake debuted on mobile. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say these GPUs initially caused a stir in the market, offering an ample 12GB framebuffer, a capacity unheard of in the $250 GPU market. The cheapest B580s on Newegg and Best Buy are now in the $300 territory, which is a shame. That's a trend most new GPUs are facing, including AMD's RX 9000 GPUs and Nvidia's RTX 50 series.

We've been hearing rumors of a 24GB Battlemage Professional GPU since December. Recently, Sparkle accidentally alluded to the existence of an Arc B580 24GB, later retracting their comments, likely due to NDA concerns. Maxsun's parent company has registered several GPUs with the EEC, including the MAXSUN Intel Arc B580 iCraft 24G and its OC variant, matching the exact configuration Sparkle mentioned.



Officially speaking, Intel has so far only confirmed more professional GPUs (likely based on Battlemage) for Computex. There's a significant overlap here as sources are divided on whether the BMG-G21 variant with 24GB of memory is intended for workstations, likely the Arc Pro B60, or consumers, likely the Arc B580 24 GB. Assuming this 24GB model joins Intel's consumer-grade B580 lineup, it stands to reason Intel probably has something more powerful in the pipeline for its workstation offerings.

Intel's BMG-G21 die allows for 20 Xe cores (2,560) shaders, which is designed as a competitor to Nvidia's RTX 4060 (AD107). Pricing differences aside, despite more VRAM, it would still be eclipsed in raw compute by even the entry-level RTX PRO 4000 Blackwell, which has Nvidia's GB203 chip under the hood. Export data from NBD purports the existence of a larger BMG-G31 die. Most of these shipments are Vietnam-bound, which hosts several OSAT companies that have a history of packaging and assembling Intel products. So, will Intel bring any BMG-G31 GPUs to the table? We're pinning our hopes on Computex for the official word.

Talk about GPU inflation


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


If you thought standard RTX 5090 GPUs were expensive, brace yourself for a variant that's literally draped in gold. Listings for the Asus' premier ROG Astral RTX 5090 Dhahab Edition have surfaced at a handful of Middle Eastern retailers, which are commanding upwards of $10,600 for the GPU, via VideoCardz. Would you rather have the opulent gold-plated RTX 5090 from Asus, or a standard RTX 5090 plus a significant chunk of change left over for a nice vacation or a used car?

Asus took the wraps off this Middle-Eastern exclusive GPU in early February, notably without specifying any MSRPs. But let's be honest, which retailer adheres to MSRPs these days? Standing out as the flagship lineup, ROG Astral is a new GPU sub-brand that Asus introduced with the RTX 50 series. With a suite of added features such as the ability to monitor per-pin current to prevent connector meltdowns, Asus recommends a $3,099 MSRP for its Astral GPUs. It's pretty obvious the Dhahab Edition, which means Gold in Arabic, isn't going to be kind on your wallet.

Across various regions, the ROG Astral RTX 5090 Dhahab Edition has been listed ranging from $6,700 to $10,600. Design-wise, the GPU predominantly offers a gold aesthetic, featuring a quad-fan cooling solution. Even the markings on the fan are tinted in gold. Symbolizing the Arabic culture, the GPU includes subtle illustrations of skyscrapers, camels, and Arabic calligraphy. It comes in a massive 3.8-slot design, with OC boost clock speeds of 2.61 GHz, though based on our testing, real-world frequencies will likely be higher.

According to Asus, this GPU has 6.5g of pure 24K gold, which equates to almost $700, giving you the bragging rights of owning a graphics card that's literally made of gold. This GPU clearly targets a very niche market, considering that you can probably snag an RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell, with a massive 96GB framebuffer and a beefier AD102 chip for about the same price. It's certainly one for the collectors. Considering there may only be a limited number of these GPUs manufactured, its future value will be tied to collector demand, making it a prize for the highest bidder in the coming years.

Looks like inflated GPU prices are here to stay


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new report claims that Nvidia has recently raised the official prices of nearly all of its products to combat the impact of tariffs and surging manufacturing costs on its business, with gaming graphics cards receiving a 5 to 10% hike while AI GPUs see up to a 15% increase.

As reported by Digitimes Taiwan (translated), Nvidia is facing ""multiple crises,"" including a $5.5 billion hit to its quarterly earnings over export restrictions on AI chips, including a ban on sales of its H20 chips to China.

Digitimes reports that CEO Jensen Huang has been ""shuttling back and forth"" between the US and China to minimize the impact of tariffs, and that ""in order to maintain stable profitability,"" Nvidia has reportedly recently raised official prices for almost all its products, allowing its partners to increase prices accordingly.

Despite the hikes, Digitimes claims Nvidia's financial report at the end of the month ""should be within financial forecasts and deliver excellent profit results,"" driven by strong demand for AI chips outside of China and the expanding spending from cloud service providers.

The report states that Nvidia has applied official price hikes to numerous products to keep its earnings stable, with partners following suit. As an example, Digitimes cites the RTX 5090, bought at premium prices upon release without hesitation, such that channel pricing ""quickly doubled.""

The report notes that following the AI chip ban, RTX 5090 prices climbed further still, surging overnight from around NT$90,000 to NT$100,000, with other RTX 50 series cards also increasing by 5-10%. Digitimes notes Nvidia has also raised the price of its H200 and B200 chips, with server vendors increasing prices by up to 15% accordingly.

According to the publication's supply chain sources, price hikes have been exacerbated by the shift of Blackwell chip production to TSMC's US plant, which has driven a significant rise in the price of production, materials, and logistics.

There is some hope that the measures could be temporary; however, following the news that the US and China have agreed on a trade deal that should cut tariffs by 115%, thanks to a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. As with latent price increases being passed on to consumers, however, it could be some time before prices start to fall.

Senator Tom Cotton's legislation seeks to ""prevent advanced American chips from falling into the hands of adversaries like Communist China.""

Last week, a U.S. congressman announced a plan to introduce a bill that would mandate producers of high-performance AI processors to track them geographically in a bid to limit their usage by unauthorized foreign actors, such as China. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas then introduced a legislative measure later in the week. The bill covers hardware that goes way beyond just AI processors, and would give the Commerce Secretary power to verify the location of hardware, and put mandatory location controls on commercial companies. To make matters even more complicated, geo-tracking features would be required for high-performance graphics cards as well.

The bill covers a wide range of products classified as 3A090, 4A090, 4A003.z, and 3A001.z export control classification numbers (ECCNs), so advanced processors for AI, AI servers (including rack-scale solutions), HPC servers, and general-purpose electronics of strategic concern due to potential military utility or dual-use risk. It should be noted that many high-end graphics cards (such as Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 5090) are also classified as a 3A090 product, so it looks like such add-in-boards will also have to add geo-tracking capabilities.

The first and central provision of the bill is the requirement for tracking technology to be embedded in any high-end processor module or device that falls under the U.S. export restrictions. This condition would take effect six months after the legislation is enacted, which will make the lives of companies like AMD, Intel, and Nvidia harder, as adding a feature to already developed products is a tough task. The mechanism must allow verification of a chip's or device's physical location, enabling the U.S. government to confirm whether it remains at the approved endpoint. Yet, exporters would be obliged to keep track of their products.

The bill authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to verify the ownership and location of regulated processors and systems after export and maintain a centralized registry of current locations and end-users. Nvidia, as well as other exporters, would also be obligated to inform the Bureau of Industry and Security if there is evidence that a component has been redirected from its authorized destination. Additionally, any indications of tampering or manipulation must be reported.

The bill, if supported by lawmakers, will mandate a one-year study to be conducted jointly by the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense, which will identify additional protective measures that could be introduced in the future. Beyond the initial study, the same two departments are required to conduct yearly assessments for three consecutive years following the bill's enactment. These reviews must evaluate the most current advancements in security technologies applicable to products under export control. Based on these assessments, the departments may determine whether new requirements should be imposed. 

If the assessment concludes that additional mechanisms are appropriate, the Commerce Department must finalize rules within two years requiring covered chips and systems to incorporate these secondary features. A detailed implementation roadmap must also be submitted to the relevant congressional committees. All development and deployment of these mechanisms must preserve the confidentiality of sensitive commercial technologies. 

Finally, the legislation emphasizes confidentiality in all stages of developing and applying these new technical requirements. Any proposed safeguards or tracking features must be designed and implemented in a way that protects the proprietary information and trade secrets of American developers, such as AMD, Intel, and Nvidia. This condition ensures that while national security is strengthened, industrial competitiveness is not undermined.

Also, the senator takes into account the lengthy development cycle of AI and HPC processors. While the goal is to tighten security (which is why chip developers will be obliged to add location tracking to their products six months after the bill's enactment), the structure of the bill deliberately stretches out decision-making and compliance timelines to accommodate industry realities. The call for gradual adoption of future safeguards acknowledges the slow pace of chip development cycles, meaning that full compliance could take years depending on what mechanisms are eventually required. Meanwhile, annual export control reform recommendations may introduce further changes or exceptions over time, adding to the complexity.

Samsung has just announced the launch of its brand new Odyssey OLED G6, the world's first 500Hz gaming monitor.

First unveiled at CES 2025, the Samsung Odyssey OLED G6 joins the company's already-stacked roster of gaming panels and gives even the Asus ROG Swift PG27AQDP a run for its money as the best gaming monitor on the market when it comes to refresh rate.

As announced by Samsung, the Odyssey OLED G6 is launching in four countries, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia, with a phased rollout to additional global markets ""later this year.""

Of course, the headline feature is the 500Hz refresh rate, but there's also a 0.03ms response time (GTG) and QHD resolution, VESA Display HDR True Black 500 HDR, and HDR10+ Gaming.

The flat 27-inch panel comes with DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.1, and USB ports aplenty. You'll also find Samsung's Glare Free technology, which it says makes your screen 54% less glossy than conventional film.

Currently available in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, the Samsung Odyssey OLED G6 G60SF QHD can be bought from Samsung for around $1,300 US, althou there's currently a $200 saving in local currency according to its website. 

Users wary of OLED burn-in will be delighted to learn that the G6 features Samsung's Pulsating Heat Pipe technology to reduce panel heat, as well as a Thermal Modulation System to automatically control brightness, and logo and taskbar detection. Samsung's burn-in warranty contains the usual boilerplate mentions of normal usage being covered within warranty, but no commercial, abuse, or misuse.

Peak brightness is rated for 1,000 nits, and you'll also find Samsung's Glare Free Technology, a height-adjustable stand, tilt, swivel, and pivot adjustments. There's also support for NVIDIA G-Sync

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Gastrointestinal cancer: Can eating chicken shorten lifespan?","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/could-eating-chicken-heighten-cancer-risk-experts-weigh-in-on-latest-claims","Mon, 12 May 2025 12:33:04 GMT","

A recent study conducted in southern Italy presented some surprising findings that linked the regular consumption of poultry to potential increases in gastrointestinal cancers and all-cause mortality. This has caused one question to arise — is eating chicken really as healthy as we think it is?

The study's findings indicated that exceeding the weekly recommended amounts — that is, eating more than 300 grams (g) of poultry, such as chicken and turkey, per week — resulted in a 27% higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to eating moderate amounts.

Moreover, the research suggested that higher poultry intake was linked to a 2.3% increase in the risk of gastrointestinal cancers, with a higher observed risk among men at 2.6%. The findings were published in the journal Nutrients.

What has concerned consumers is that these findings contrast with current established dietary guidelines, such as the Mediterranean diet, of which poultry is an important component.

However, should such results make people reconsider their diets? Could the results be overestimated? What should consumers watch out for when interpreting the results of similar studies on nutrition? 

Medical News Today spoke to two experts — Wael Harb, MD, board certified hematologist and medical oncologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA, and Kristin Kirkpatrick, MS, RD, dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic Dept of Department of Wellness & Preventive Medicine in Cleveland, OH, and senior fellow at the Meadows Behavioral Healthcare in Wickenburg, AZ, to find out more.

Both experts reiterated that an association from an observational study is not enough to draw definitive conclusions about a dietary item and its links to cancer.

“The findings are interesting, but as this is an observational study, it doesn't prove causation. The broader body of evidence still supports moderate poultry consumption as part of a balanced diet,” Harb told MNT.

Harb underscored that poultry played an important role in healthy diets and advised caution when interpreting the results.

“This study raises important questions, but we need to interpret it with caution. Poultry has long been a core part of healthy eating patterns like the Mediterranean diet, which is associated with reduced cancer and heart disease risks.”— Wael Harb, MD

Another important point to consider is that cancer, as a disease, is very complex and multifactorial, meaning it is hard to pinpoint its causes to one factor.

“Studies show that the development of cancer from one person to another is complex and encompasses multiple factors, including but not limited to genetics, environment, diet, physical activity, exposure to toxins, and even age and inflammation. Therefore, we need to look at any study and try to assess how it can be translated to our lifestyle,” said Kirkpatrick. 

“If you smoke, for example, the first step before cutting chicken out may be quitting smoking. This is just one example of how we can assess data,” she added.

How food items are cooked or whether other additives such as oils and spices are added can change the ‘healthiness' of a food source. The two experts said the potential cancer risks associated with eating poultry could be more closely connected to those aspects, rather than the poultry itself.

“When poultry is grilled, fried, or cooked at high temperatures, it can form compounds like heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have been linked to cancer risk. However, these compounds also occur in red meat and processed meats, so the issue may lie more in cooking methods than the type of meat itself,” Harb explained, highlighting that how a good is cooked could result in the release of cancer-causing chemicals.

Kirkpatrick further explained how a food item is processed and cooked can impact the potential benefits or risks of consuming it.

“For example, a frozen chicken nugget may be considered ultra-processed, and breaded and fried chicken may pose risks from the process of high-heat frying as well. Both may differ in their impact on health when compared to a plain chicken breast that is baked,” she said.

The study has also fed into a long-standing debate about whether white meat is healthier than red meat.

Although white meat, such as chicken and turkey, has lower fat content and a higher protein-to-fat ratio than red meat, this does not necessarily translate into lower cholesterol levels.

In fact, a 2019 study found that white and red meat may both have similar effects on blood cholesterol levels, specifically LDL or “bad” cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apoB).

The current study also fails to identify the specific type of poultry consumed and its links to heightened cancer risk.

“The study was not able to identify the specific type of poultry (for example, was the consumed protein processed deli meat or was it a grilled chicken breast). The processing of meats in general may change their health risks. We would need more studies assessing various types of poultry and various types of red meat to truly assess significant differences between the two,” Kirkpatrick said.

The study did have several limitations, such as not accounting for the sources of the poultry consumed, the potential impacts of pesticides on plant and animal crops, antibiotic and hormone usage in industrially raised poultry, as well as cooking methods, meat preparation, and dietary patterns.

“Limitations the authors cited was lacking information on specifics of the poultry consumed/ cooking methods, as well as lack of data on physical activity — which shows positive impact to mortality from other studies,” Kirkpatrick said.

Harb said that the type of follow-up research needed would have to address multiple unanswered questions.

“We need well-designed prospective studies that account for cooking methods, levels of processing, and overall dietary habits. It would also help to examine biological markers of carcinogen exposure in people with high poultry intake. Given that the risk was higher in men, gender-specific research would be important too,” he said.

Kirkpatrick said that these results are not enough to change current recommendations for healthy eating.

“This study would not cause me to stop recommending poultry to my patients, especially in those patients that are making other beneficial lifestyle changes alongside poultry consumption — such as a dietary pattern high in fruits, vegetables, fiber, whole grains, healthy fats, and other forms of protein such as beans and lentils, or wild fatty fish,” she told us.

Regarding what is considered healthy and safe by the United States, Harb reminded that current guidelines recommend no more than 300 g per week as a limit.

“Based on what we know, the current guideline of 300 grams of poultry per week is reasonable — especially if the poultry is skinless, minimally processed, and not cooked at high temperatures.”— Wael Harb, MD

However, for those with certain health conditions or a family history of cancer, a lower intake may be more appropriate.

“For those who are particularly health-conscious or have a family history of cancer, staying closer to 200 grams per week and incorporating more fish, legumes, and plant proteins may be a prudent option,” Harb said.

 May 12, 2025  

AMSTERDAM — Norucholic acid (NCA), an investigational therapy, demonstrated significant superiority over placebo in halting disease progression in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), meeting the primary efficacy endpoint in a phase 3 trial presented on May 10 at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Congress 2025.

NCA was four times more effective in partially normalizing the liver enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (odds ratio [OR], 4.16), without worsening of the histologic Ludwig stage of PSC. Results held true with and without concomitant ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). 

The interim 96-week efficacy and safety results were presented by Michael Trauner, MD, professor of gastroenterology and hepatology at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria, who first developed the compound two decades ago.

“In this study, NCA hit the primary and key secondary endpoint in this clinical trial that included liver histology and biochemical features,” said Trauner. “There were higher response rates for NCA than placebo both with and without concomitant UDCA, as well as improvement and less worsening of histological disease stages with NCA compared with placebo.” 

PSC is a rare, progressive cholangiopathy characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts, with no current medical therapy proven to alter its course. NCA works by inducing bicarbonate-rich hypercholeresis and promoting cholangiocyte protection, with additional anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. 

The multicenter, international, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 study builds on earlier phase 2 findings in which NCA improved cholestasis markers in a dose-dependent manner and was well tolerated.

Patients (n = 301) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either NCA 1500 mg once daily (n = 205) or placebo (n = 96), stratified by concomitant UDCA use. Biopsies were done 4-8 weeks prior to randomization and again at week 96 and will be repeated at week 192. The study remains ongoing, with 2 additional years of blinded treatment planned.

The combined primary endpoint was defined as partial normalization of ALP to less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and no worsening of Ludwig histologic stage. Secondary endpoints included modified Nakanuma staging, liver stiffness measurement (FibroScan), enhanced liver fibrosis and Amsterdam-Oxford scores, patient-reported pruritus and fatigue, and overall quality of life.

“The population was typical of PSC, with men in their 40s making up 74% of participants, and around 70% had inflammatory bowel disease,” reported Trauner. Baseline ALP was approximately 300 U/L, and liver stiffness and enhanced liver fibrosis scores were around 10. Most patients presented with Ludwig stage 2 or 3 disease.

By week 96, 27.3% of patients in the NCA group and 37.5% in the placebo group had discontinued the trial. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the combined primary endpoint was achieved by 15.1% of patients in the NCA group vs 4.2% in the placebo group, a difference of 10.96% (95% CI, 4.6%-17.3%) and an OR of 4.16 (95% CI, 1.42-12.22; P = .0048). Patients without a second biopsy were considered nonresponders.

In the per-protocol analysis, which included only participants who completed both biopsies, the benefit remained significant: 18.2% for NCA vs 6.6% for placebo, with a difference of 11.7% (95% CI, 3.0%-20.3%) and an OR of 3.36 (95% CI, 1.12-10.11; P = .0155).

The key secondary endpoint of ALP less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and no worsening according to modified Nakanuma staging was also met. NCA again outperformed placebo: 15.1% vs 5.2%, a difference of 9.9% (95% CI, 3.3%-16.5%).

Trauner noted that NCA demonstrated greater efficacy than placebo in both subgroups, with and without concomitant UDCA. The treatment difference with UDCA was 7.5% (95% CI, 0.4%-14.7%), whereas without UDCA, the difference increased to 23.4% (95% CI, 11.3%-35.5%).

“Those not receiving UDCA had a much higher response rate at 23% with NCA,” he said. 

Histologic improvement by at least one Ludwig stage occurred in 25.2% of patients in the NCA group compared with 10.5% in the placebo group (P = .0217). Notably, progression to cirrhosis (Ludwig stage 4) occurred less frequently in the NCA group (5.9% vs 10.7%).

Significant improvements were also seen in liver enzymes, including ALP, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase, with greater reductions in the NCA group at week 96. The Amsterdam-Oxford prognostic score increased significantly more in the placebo group, indicating greater disease progression.

NCA was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to that of placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 97.6% of the NCA group and 92.7% of the placebo group. The most common adverse events included diarrhea, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and nasopharyngitis.

Ahmed Elsharkawy, MD, consultant hepatologist at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom, who co-moderated the session, underscored the importance of these findings.

“There is a desperate need for patients with PSC to have access to treatments that slow down the progression of their condition, as we currently do not have any available drugs to treat them,” he explained. 

Reflecting on the study's impact, he added, “This study provides the first-ever data that offers some hope that norucholic acid can help reduce progression of the disease for some but unfortunately not yet all patients with the condition. This is hopefully the first step towards developing a cure for this devastating condition that disproportionately affects young individuals.” 

The clinical trial is funded by Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH. Trauner reported no other relevant financial relationships. Elsharkawy reported no relevant financial relationships.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello. I'm Dr Maurie Markman, from City of Hope. I'd like to present a very interesting analysis. I think it's open to interpretation, and follow up of what I'm going to discuss is necessary, but I think it makes a number of important points relative to the question of optimal utilization o f multi-panel molecular testing as we move forward in this very exciting world of targeted therapy. 

The paper is entitled, “Utilization and outcomes of multigene panel testing in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.” This analysis was looking specifically at pancreas cancer and data that come from a Mayo Clinic analysis, from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Arizona, and Florida.

They were looking at the utilization of multi-panel testing in a population of 533 patients with pancreas cancer before and after guideline recommendations from NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) that suggested such testing.

One of the advantages of the Mayo Clinic system is that the groups work very closely together.They have a really robust database. One would not know if the information in this report is comparable to other organizations, but I think it's very provocative to look at and for organizations that ask themselves, “How are we doing with such testing?” 

Of these 533 patients, 60% (321 patients) that they looked at in terms of the question of testing were before the NCCN recommendations, and 40% (212 patients) they looked at whether the testing was performed or whether a discussion was held with the patients and then testing performed. Again, they were looking at the electronic medical record after the recommendations. 

Here's what they found: Prior to the NCCN recommendations — where doctors made their decisions based upon their knowledge of t he field, what they had read, meeting information, and CME programs — 34% of the patients had had a documented discussion regarding this testing. Of these, 81% — that's 81% of the population that had the discussion — had the test actually performed. 

Post NCCN recommendations for the testing, that number increased minimally to 39%, of whom 75% of that population had the testing. WithNCCN recommendations, still only 40% of the patients had a discussion of the testing at the Mayo Clinic. 

They noted that among the patients who did have testing, 17% had pathologic variants identified, of whom 11%, so 1 out of 10, had documented prostate cancer-related abnormalities that are potentially quite relevant for their treatment and also for discussions with their family.

This is a very important paper. It's a very important baseline, you might say. One must ask, how are we doing today? The implications of such testing are only greater compared to a year or two ago , both in terms of therapy and of course discussions with the family. 

It's an interesting analysis and an important analysis.One can conclude that this is not so bad, considering it's new. You could say that we wished it would've been higher. I'd love to see a follow-up from Mayo Clinic. Where are they in 2024 or 2025?

Th ank you for your attention.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Use of psychotherapy without medications increased among US outpatients between 2018 and 2021, while psychotropic medication–only treatment declined, new research showed. In addition, social workers and counselors assumed a larger role in mental health care as involvement of psychiatrists decreased.

“After years of American mental health care moving toward greater use of psychiatric medications, the pendulum has started swinging back toward psychotherapy....Americans are becoming more willing to seek out and stick with psychotherapy,” lead author Mark Olfson, MD, MPH, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York City, said in a press release.

The study was published online on May 1 in The American Journal of Psychiatry.

The study was limited by reliance on self-reported data, lack of diagnostic precision, and exclusion of important populations residing in institutional settings. It could not determine whether psychotherapy trends reflected changes in patients or practice. Additional limitations were the broad survey definition of psychotherapy, unmeasured treatment effectiveness, and lack of adjustment for multiple comparisons.

The investigators reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Adult patients with metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and moderate or advanced liver fibrosis showed improved liver histology with a once-weekly dose of semaglutide (Wegovy), an ongoing randomized placebo-controlled trial reported.

The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) is currently a candidate for treating MASH.

Preliminary results of the two-part phase 3, double-blind ESSENCE trial, conducted in at 253 clinical sites in 37 countries, were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. 

A previous phase 2 study by Loomba et al suggested semaglutide was effective in reducing liver injury. “That study, however, did not show improvement in liver fibrosis, which this study has done,” study co-lead Philip Newsome, PhD, professor in the Department of Immunology and Immunotherapy and Honorary Professor of Experimental Hepatology at the University of Birmingham in Birmingham, England, told Medscape Medical News.

“The results aligned with expectations in that that the impact on liver fibrosis was anticipated — but with some uncertainty, so this study is important in that regard.” 

From May 2020 to April 2023, researchers led by Newsome and Arun J. Sanyal, MBBS, MD, of Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in Richmond, Virginia, randomized 1197 patients with a mean age of 56 years. Of these, 57% were women and 67.5% were White individuals. Mean body mass index was 34.6, and 55.9% had type 2 diabetes.

All had biopsy-defined MASH and fibrosis stage 2 or 3 according to the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network classification and a Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Activity Score ≥ 4.

Rates of fibrosis were 31.3% for stage 2 fibrosis and 68.8% for stage 3. Diverse geographic site locations included Asia (25.1%), Europe (25.3%), North America (35.0%), and South America (7.9%), and others (6.8%).

In a 2:1 ratio, they were assigned to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg or placebo for 240 weeks. A planned interim analysis of the first 800 patients was done at week 72, with primary endpoints being resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of liver fibrosis and reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis.

Resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fibrosis occurred in 62.9% of the 534 patients in the semaglutide group and in 34.3% of the 266 patients in the placebo group (estimated difference, 28.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 21.1-36.2, P < .001).

A reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis was reported in 36.8% of semaglutide recipients and 22.4% of placebo recipients (estimated difference, 14.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.5-21.3, P < .001). 

In secondary findings, the combined resolution of steatohepatitis and reduction in liver fibrosis was reported in 32.7% in the semaglutide group vs 16.1% in the placebo group (estimated difference, 16.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 10.2-22.8; P < .001). 

The mean change in body weight was −10.5% with semaglutide and −2.0% with placebo (estimated difference, −8.5 percentage points; 95% CI, −9.6 to −7.4, P < .001). Mean changes in bodily pain scores did not differ significantly between arms. 

The histologic benefits of semaglutide also emerged in improvements on all prespecified noninvasive tests — including aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels and liver stiffness. Emerging evidence has suggested an association between reductions in liver stiffness and clinical benefit. 

Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the semaglutide group.

Commenting on the study from a nonparticipant's perspective, Naga P. Chalasani, MD, professor of gastroenterology and hepatology at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said results from the ESSENCE trial were “long awaited and they certainly advance the field of MASH clinical trials substantially.”

Furthermore, he added, the results are well aligned with those of a phase 2B trial of semaglutide by Newsome and colleagues for what was then termed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and they also align with what is known about the positive role of incretins, digestive hormones imitated by GLP-1s to improve liver health in patients with MASLD and MASH.” 

“The results from this study certainly make a case for semaglutide to be the backbone therapy for diabetic or obese patients with MASH and fibrosis,” Chalasani said. “More than 80% of patients with MASH and fibrosis have either diabetes and/or obesity.” 

He added that a better understanding is needed of how semaglutide works in patients with MASH cirrhosis since the previous small study was unsuccessful. “But this may need to be repeated as the published study was underpowered. Outcomes in the ESSENCE trial will help to clarify whether semaglutide will improve clinical outcomes beyond improving liver histology.”

According to Newsome, GLP-1s will become the backbone of therapy in MASH given their range of metabolic and liver benefit. But questions remain, he said. “Will there be further improvements with longer treatment with semaglutide? What noninvasive tests should we use to determine treatment success? Which patients will benefit from combination treatment?”

This study was supported by Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Wegovy.

Sanyal reported having various financial relationships with multiple private-sector companies, including Novo Nordisk. Newsome reported consulting for Novo Nordisk and Boehringer Ingelheim.

Several study coauthors reported having similar relationships with pharmaceutical companies or employment with Novo Nordisk.

Chalasani declared being involved in several MASH clinical trials conducted by other pharmaceutical companies.

SAN DIEGO — In tough-to-treat chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a precision-medicine strategy based on patients' molecular profiles showed efficacy in guiding anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy treatment decisions to improve outcomes.

“This is the first study implementing multi-biomarker signatures in informed decisions instead of single biomarker–based trial algorithms [in IBD],” said first author Florian Tran, MD, in presenting the late-breaking study at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2025.

“We have now been able to demonstrate for the first time that precision medicine can be successfully applied in the context of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, leading to improved long-term outcomes,” said Tran, a professor of pathophysiology of chronic inflammation at the Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology and Department of Internal Medicine, Kiel University and University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Kiel, Germany.

Anti-TNF therapies can be highly effective in a range of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including IBD, but not all patients respond. Key singular candidates of biomarkers that could better predict a response show relatively low predictive power or a failure to replicate in independent studies.

In previous research, Tran and colleagues reported identification of early dynamic molecular changes in the blood that are more robustly predictive of responses to anti-TNF therapy.

“We have generated compelling evidence that therapy-induced changes in inflammatory pathways can reliably predict patient outcomes,” he said.

Among them are dynamic transcriptome changes that emerge early during treatment and can predict response to anti-TNF therapy, as well as clinical response trajectories that differ based on subgroups.

To further investigate the benefits of the multi-biomarker signatures collectively, as opposed to single biomarker–based algorithms, Tran and colleagues conducted the phase 3, open-label GUIDE-IBD trial, enrolling 102 adults with a confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) at three German university hospitals between February 2021 and January 2024.

All patients had been assigned the anti-TNF drug infliximab for the first time.

Study participants were randomized to receive either the molecular-guided care or standard medical care, with stratifications based on diagnosis, recruiting center, and baseline corticosteroid use.

Those in the molecular group received real-time molecular assessments at baseline and weeks 2, 6, 14, and 26, which included peripheral blood samples and biopsies of known messenger ribonucleic acid–based biomarkers.

The assessments also looked at infliximab and anti-drug antibody levels.

Molecular reports were then provided through molecular medicine boards for patients in the molecular-guidance group at weeks 2, 14, 26, and 52, whereas data from the standard care group was not communicated.

Based on the biomarker data, therapy decisions were made such as adjustments to dosing, intervals, comedication, and switches in therapy.

The primary endpoint was the combined end point of disease control, defined as clinical remission (CD Activity Index < 150, partial Mayo score < 2), endoscopic remission (simplified endoscopic score for CD ≤ 4 [≤ 2 for isolated ileal disease], endoscopic Mayo score ≤ 1), or biochemical remission (CRP < 5 mg/L, fecal calprotectin < 250 mg/g).

A total of 87 patients completed the study with available primary endpoint data to week 52; there were 38 in the molecular care group and 49 in the standard care group. In each group, approximately half of the patients had CD and half had UC.

For the primary endpoint, comprehensive disease control was significantly more frequent in the molecular care group at week 52 (55.3%) than in the standard care group (26.5%), with an absolute difference of 29% (P = .0072).

Furthermore, the secondary endpoint of the combined rate of endoscopic and clinical remission at week 52 was also higher in the molecular group (60.5%) than in the standard care group (32.7%; P = .0163).

An exploratory analysis further showed therapy switches were more common in the molecular group (47%) than in the standard care group (29%), with an increased rate of drug switching between 14 weeks and 26 weeks.

More patients in the molecular guidance group achieved comprehensive disease control (deep remission) at week 52 (P = .0135).

“The [molecular guidance] group was more likely to switch therapies after the induction period, reducing the number of patients who are suboptimally treated under infliximab,” Tran noted.

The results underscore that “even in the absence of a single ‘magic' biomarker, precision medicine can materially improve patient outcomes by integrating complex molecular data into everyday clinical decisions, enabling more effective therapy choices and reducing unnecessary drug side effects,” he said.

Tran noted that the collaboration necessary for the approach was based on strategies pioneered in cancer centers, which have resulted in significant improvements in cancer therapy outcomes.

“For the first time in IBD, we have now integrated multidimensional molecular data and innovative drug-dosing models into these inflammation boards,” he said.

Key components of the intervention include a highly structured patient care process with fixed assessment timepoints, as well as “a multidisciplinary, quality-controlled decision-making process that is meticulously documented,” he explained.

The results underscore that “we must move away from sole physician-driven treatment decisions in IBD towards a structured expert-board model for therapy decision-making.” 

Commenting on the study, Ashwin N. Ananthakrishnan, MD, an associate professor of medicine with Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, noted that “this approach may help optimize existing treatment early and ensure that ineffective treatments don't get dragged on.”

Importantly, however, a key limitation is that “this does not tell you upfront whether a treatment is likely to work or what the best treatment is,” Ananthakrishnan told Medscape Medical News. “That is a critically important unmet need in IBD.”

While doses are escalated, if needed, with infliximab and other biologic drugs, that may not be the case with other therapies, he explained.

“For other agents, such as JAK [Janus kinase] inhibitors, we actually start at a higher dose and then reduce for maintenance,” said Ananthakrishnan.

How this approach would work for these drugs or “for drugs where blood levels are not reflective of efficacy is also not clear,” he said.

Tran's disclosures included relationships with AbbVie, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, CED Service GmbH, Celltrion Healthcare, Eli Lilly, Ferring Pharmaceutical, Janssen, J&J, Takeda, LEK Consulting, and Sanofi/Regeneron. Ananthakrishnan had no disclosures to report.

Headache and fatigue were the most commonly reported incident adverse events of the AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) COVID-19 vaccine in real-world settings across the United Kingdom; anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) were the most frequently reported adverse events of special interest.

""This study highlights the requirement for pandemic preparedness, including the ongoing focus on standardising case definitions and producing background rates for AESIs [adverse events of special interest], thereby facilitating the rapid identification of safety signals via Observed versus Expected analysis,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Alison Evans, Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, England. It was published online on May 02, 2025, in BMJ Open.

The study population showed demographic imbalances, with the underrepresentation of older adults and ethnic minorities. A significant loss to follow-up occurred at each timepoint, potentially leading to underreporting of longer-term outcomes.

This study was supported by AstraZeneca UK Limited. The authors reported having no competing interests.

Early rituximab monotherapy led to a substantial delay in the need for new treatment in patients with advanced stage, asymptomatic, low tumour burden follicular lymphoma. After a median follow-up duration of 14.7 years, researchers found no detrimental effect on the time to initiation of second new treatment or overall survival.

""Early rituximab monotherapy could therefore be considered a standard treatment option for patients with advanced stage, asymptomatic low tumour burden follicular lymphoma and the optimal approach should be considered on an individual patient basis,"" the authors concluded.

This study was led by Michael Northend, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, England. It was published online in The Lancet Haematology.

This study was limited by the lack of long-term toxicity data, especially for patients receiving rituximab maintenance, and the early closure of the rituximab induction group, which limited the power of any comparisons with the four-dose rituximab induction regimen.

This study received funding from Cancer Research UK, the Lymphoma Research Trust, Lymphoma Action, and Roche. Roche provided rituximab free of charge. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article. Several authors reported receiving honoraria and consultancy fees and having other ties with various sources.

LAS VEGAS — Since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2015, transurethral water-vapor therapy has been gaining traction as an in-office procedure for reducing the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

But how long the benefits of the treatment, marketed as Rezūm by Boston Scientific, last is less clear.

That part of the picture is coming into focus, thanks to a collection of posters about the approach at American Urological Association (AUA) 2025 Annual Meeting. In addition to exploring Rezūm's durability, researchers detailed when the procedure is more likely to fail.

Researchers in the United Kingdom, where Rezūm was approved in 2018, cataloged how often men with large prostates (at least 80 g) who underwent the procedure required additional treatment to reduce the size of the gland within 5 years.

Their study of 48 men (average age, 69 years) found 10 needed another treatment within 5 years of undergoing the water-vapor therapy. Nine men had surgery to remove excess prostate tissue, while one had another course of Rezūm. The median time to retreatment was 2.7 years.

“Approximately 1 in 4 patients needed retreatment within 5 years of Rezūm, and most patients expressed satisfaction with their decision to undergo Rezūm,” according to the group, led by Lap Yan Yeung, MD, a urologist with the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, England.

Researchers at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) reported on 179 men who underwent Rezūm at their institution. Within 5 years, more than half of these men (n = 92, 51.4%) had resumed medications for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and 11 surgeries (6.1%) were reported within 2 years of the procedure. No men reported new cases of retrograde ejaculation.

“There was a high rate of medication resumption after the procedure in our single-institution cohort. This information may be important when counseling patients on BPH treatment options, especially preoperatively,” according to Seth Bechis, MD, a urologist at UCSD and his colleagues.

Clinicians in Qatar treated 325 men (mean age, 75 years) with Rezūm, of whom 34 had acute urinary retention linked to BPH.

After the procedure, 29 of the 34 (85%) patients reported being able to urinate again. The 5 men who could not urinate had lower prostate volumes (50.4 ± 19.4 cc vs 88 ± 52.9 cc; P = .011) and had received fewer vapor injections (5 ± 1 vs 7.7 ± 2.8; P = .045), and all had coronary artery disease (CAD; 100% vs 24.1%; P = .003).

“The study identifies prostate volume, total number of vapor injections, and presence of CAD as factors associated with treatment failure. These findings suggest that careful patient selection and optimization of procedural parameters may enhance the success of Rezūm” in men with acute urinary retention, according to the researchers.

“With each passing year we have gained a greater understanding of [Rezūm's] different uses, and we're also getting real-world experience over the long term,” said Dean Elterman, MD, a urologist at the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, who spoke at several sessions of the conference and helped select posters.

The real-world data are important, Elterman said, because the largest prostates in the pivotal Rezūm trials were around 80 g. But in his practice, he treats men with larger prostates, perhaps up to 150 g, with Rezūm. At the meeting, he presented 3-year data showing the technique works in such patients.

But prostate size is not the only selection criteria.

“We really recommend not doing Rezūm in anyone who's had previous radiation,” he said, because in this case the prostate tissue will not respond to the treatment.

Another concern some men might have is if they will still be able to ejaculate after taking Rezūm. While limited ejaculation is a rare side effect, clinicians should discuss the possibility with men, Elterman said. “A whole part of this comes down to patient preference,” he added.

Elterman said future studies should try to determine the upper limit of the prostate size at which Rezūm remains effective; some prostates may simply be too big to respond well to the therapy. Another open question is whether some people can undergo Rezūm without needing a catheter during the recovery phase, which typically lasts 3-5 days, he said.

Elterman reported consulting for Boston Scientific, PROCEPT BioRobotics Corporation, and the Olympus Corporation. The presenters of the posters reported no financial conflicts of interest.

Posters IP03-26, IP03-24, and IPO3-22 were presented in April (26-29) at American Urological Association (AUA) 2025 Annual Meeting, in Las Vegas.

Prophylactic treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) significantly reduced the risk for serious infections by approximately 50% in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitis, with the greatest benefits observed during the first 180 days of treatment.

“Our results strongly suggest that prophylactic TMP-SMX provides additional benefits in patients with AAV [ANCA-associated vasculitis] beyond reducing the risk of PJP [Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia],” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Yun Kyu Kim, MD, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea, and was published online on April 14, 2025, in Arthritis & Rheumatology.

Unmeasured confounders, such as compliance with prophylactic TMP-SMX, may have influenced the findings. The varied duration of TMP-SMX use in the prophylaxis group, with many patients discontinuing within 180 days, may have led to biased estimates. Additionally, the impact of TMP-SMX on COVID-19 incidence and related infectious complications could not be estimated for patients with an index date prior to 2018.

MÁLAGA, Spain — In the first head-to-head trial of its kind, tirzepatide (Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for obesity; Eli Lilly) produced significantly greater weight loss, and reduction in waist circumference, than semaglutide (Ozempic for type 2 diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss; Novo Nordisk) in adults with obesity but without type 2 diabetes over 72 weeks in the SURMOUNT-5 trial.

The phase 3b open-label, randomized controlled trial showed that patients treated with tirzepatide vs semaglutide lost an average of 20.2% vs 13.7% of their baseline weight over the 72 weeks. Nearly twice as many participants achieved a target of ≥ 25% weight reduction on tirzepatide vs semaglutide.

“We've learnt over the past 20 years or so that you can overcome the plateau effect with obesity drugs if you can add in drugs with mechanisms that are completely different, often leading to additional weight loss. This is exactly what we see here,” said Louis J. Aronne, MD, principal investigator of the trial and director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.

The findings were presented at European Congress on Obesity (ECO) 2025 and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The trial was sponsored by Eli Lilly & Company, the manufacturer of tirzepatide.

While both drugs have demonstrated significant weight-loss effects in previous trials, this is the first study directly comparing the dual agonist glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP)/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) tirzepatide with GLP-1 semaglutide. The results suggest tirzepatide's dual action on both GIP and GLP-1 receptors yields superior outcomes in weight reduction and waist circumference. Both tirzepatide and semaglutide are approved for chronic weight management, although clinicians have lacked comparative data to guide prescribing choices between them.

The trial enrolled 751 adults with obesity (mean body mass index [BMI], 39.4; mean body weight, 113.0 kg; mean waist circumference, 118.3 cm) but without type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either the maximum tolerated dose of tirzepatide (10 or 15 mg; n = 374) or semaglutide (1.7 or 2.4 mg; n = 376) once weekly for 72 weeks.

Most participants were women (64.7%) and White (76.1%), with a mean age of 44.7 years. All had at least one obesity-related condition and a history of at least one unsuccessful dietary effort to lose weight. Median self-reported obesity duration was 16 years.

At week 72, the mean percent change in weight was −20.2% (95% CI, −21.4 to −19.1) with tirzepatide and −13.7% (95% CI, −14.9 to −12.6) with semaglutide (P < .001), while waist circumference dropped by a mean of 18.4 cm with tirzepatide and 13.0 cm with semaglutide (P < .001).

Aronne noted the sex-based differences: Women vs men lost a mean of 18% vs 11% on semaglutide and 17.8% vs 11% on tirzepatide. “The waist circumference difference mirrors the weight-loss results [−15.7 cm and −20 cm in semaglutide and tirzepatide, respectively],” he said, pointing out that, “The 5.4 cm greater reduction in waist circumference with tirzepatide compared with semaglutide was statistically superior and clinically meaningful and has been shown to reduce blood pressure and other metabolic parameters — remembering that waist circumference is a surrogate for visceral fat.”

More participants on tirzepatide than on semaglutide achieved weight reduction targets of 10% (81.6 vs 60.5%),15% (64.6 vs 40.1%), 20% (48.4 vs 27.3%), and 25% (31.6 vs 16.1%).

At week 72, tirzepatide was associated with greater improvements in cardiometabolic parameters than semaglutide, including greater mean reductions in BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, glycemia, fasting insulin, triglycerides, and very low–density lipoprotein cholesterol. It was also associated with a greater mean increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Mean reductions in non-HDL and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were similar in both groups. With both treatments, as weight reduction increased, there were greater improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors.

“In general, the more weight someone loses, then the better the metabolic parameters will be,” Aronne explained.

Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most common for both drugs and occurred primarily during dose escalation. These events were generally mild to moderate in severity. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 76.7% of patients on tirzepatide and 79.0% of those on semaglutide. Serious adverse events occurred in 3.5% and 4.8% of patients, respectively.

“The side effects of these medicines keep getting reported, but if you look at the people who discontinue in the trial, then the rate was very low,” Aronne said. Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 6.1% of the tirzepatide group and 8.0% of the semaglutide group.

Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, David Horner, MD, of the University of Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark, noted, “They're both very good medications. One is not in doubt that tirzepatide has a greater weight-loss benefit from the data. We're comparing a very good drug with a very good drug.”

Horner, who has worked extensively in endocrinology and cardiovascular medicine in both the United Kingdom and Denmark, said clinical application will depend heavily on availability, country-specific guidelines, and healthcare system factors. “Much will depend on availability of the medication…and many clinical decisions will be based on that,” he added.

“There are around 150 medications currently in trial, and it is the golden age of these medicines. These two mechanisms in tirzepatide do seem to have an additive effect.”

Aronne and co-authors' disclosures are available on the NEJM website. Horner reported having no conflicts of interest. The study was sponsored by Eli Lilly & Company.

It's hard to accept that babies born in the year 2000 now have kids of their own. It's even harder to accept that there never was much evidence for 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after coronary stenting. 

In a recent commentary, lead author Marco Valgimigli, MD, PhD, likened the routine use of 1 year of DAPT to a myth that has become entrenched in our collective culture. Though recent trials suggest shorter durations are feasible and possibly better, untangling truth from myth is proving to be a Gordian knot.

The era of DAPT began with the publication of the CURE study in 2001. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction were randomized to aspirin plus clopidogrel or aspirin plus placebo. Despite the increased bleeding seen with the addition of clopidogrel, the trial's positive primary outcome prompted many, myself included, to start putting patients on both drugs. 

As more potent anti-platelets such as prasugrel and ticagrelor came to market, on the basis of TRITON-TIMI 38 and PLATO, respectively, the idea of yearlong double therapy was reinforced. But in TRITON-TIMI 38, median treatment duration was 14.5 months and in PLATO it was just over 9 months. Neither study provided 12 months of DAPT nor tested a specific duration of therapy.

The subject grew more complicated as the field evolved. Bare metal stents improved and then gave way to drug eluting stents which in turn evolved to newer iterations with better scaffolds, polymers, and anti-proliferative agents. In the early 2000's, the risk of stent thrombosis with the first generation of drug-eluting stents prompted a science advisory stressing the importance of 12 months of DAPT. Even though the risk of late stent thrombosis is much reduced with the newer generation of drug eluting stents, a confluence of factors made 12 months of DAPT the standard of care.

But a blanket 1-year recommendation ignores the past quarter century's dizzying evolution in stents, angiography techniques, and background medical therapy. We can justifiably question if studies from 20 or even 10 years ago are still relevant and if the particular risk and medication profile of the patient sitting in front of you has been adequately represented in the clinical trials. 

Multiple trials have tested alternatives to 12 months of DAPT. The DAPT trial tested 12 months vs 30 months of DAPT and found fewer stent thromboses and cardiovascular events with longer treatment but at the cost of more bleeding. This trade-off has been replicated many times and a meta-analysis of five trials of longer term DAPT showed that extending treatment beyond 12 months reduced cardiovascular events but resulted in more bleeds.

This balance between cardiovascular benefit and bleeding risk prompted the question of shorter durations than 12 months. A summary of this body of evidence suggests that 3-6 months had no major impact on either stent thrombosis and paradoxically bleeding risk compared with 12 months.

While those de-escalation trials usually left patients on aspirin alone, an alternative would be to stop the aspirin and leave them on a P2Y12 inhibitor. 

Multiple trials have tested a variety of permutations. The SMART-CHOICE trial de-escalated to clopidogrel in most patients after 3 months of DAPT, STOPDAPT-2 de-escalated to clopidogrel after 1 month of DAPT, while TWILIGHT tested ticagrelor monotherapy after 3 months of DAPT in a high-risk population. Keeping this heterogeneity in mind, meta-analyzing these trials suggests that ticagrelor alone after 1-3 months of DAPT reduces the bleeding risk without increasing cardiovascular events. Whether we can say the same for prasugrel is less clear. The STOPDAPT-3 trial tried an “aspirin free” strategy with prasugrel monotherapy at 3.75 mg daily rather than the standard 10 mg dose. This strategy did not improve bleeding rates or worsen the primary endpoint, suggesting that prasugrel monotherapy may be feasible. But the atypical dosing and general unpopularity of prasugrel does make it a challenging trial to put into practice.

At the recent American College of Cardiology scientific sessions in Chicago, there were even more data to add to the mix. The HOST-BR trial tested two different regimens based on the patient's bleeding risk. High risk patients were randomized to 1 vs 3 months of DAPT and low risk patients were randomized to 3 vs 12 months, with clopidogrel being the most common second anti-platelet. In high bleeding risk patients, limiting DAPT to 1 month increased major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MAACE) at 1 year by 4.0% on the absolute scale with a non-significant trend towards less bleeding. By contrast, in the low-bleeding-risk patients, limiting DAPT to 3 months instead of 1 year had no major effect on MAACE but reduced bleeding by 9.5% on the absolute scale. In both the high and low risk patients, 3 months of DAPT seemed to be the sweet spot.

SMART-CHOICE 3 took a different tack and evaluated patients that had already completed their “standard” duration DAPT (12 months post myocardial infarction and 6 months overwise) and randomized them to monotherapy with aspirin vs clopidogrel. At 3 years, clopidogrel reduced MAACE by 2.2% with no effect on bleeding. 

Both of these Korean trials were open label studies. In East Asian populations, differences in bleeding risk suggest that clopidogrel might be superior to ticagrelor, hence the decision to use it in the study. However, in other ethnic groups the same might not hold true, and whether the results would replicate with ticagrelor is anyone's guess.

Depending on your point of view, the accumulated data is either dizzyingly complex and impossible to parse through or too limited to make any firm recommendations. Admittedly, we have to consider not just length of DAPT but also which anti-platelets to use as monotherapy and the clinical context of the patient. A high-ischemic-risk cardiac patient at low bleeding risk is very different from a high bleeding risk patient going for an elective PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention). We shouldn't blithely assume that what's true for clopidogrel is true for ticagrelor or that one antiplatelet is universally better in all populations. Also, most trials fail to consider one important consideration: cost.

Given all the new data from the last few years, you might think that clinical guidelines have evolved to incorporate or at least acknowledge the growing equipoise of how and when to inhibit platelets in cardiac patients. But the recent 2025 ACS guidelines still suggest a minimum 12 months of DAPT and give it a class 1A indication if the patient isn't at high bleeding risk. If they are, bleeding reduction strategies include transitioning to ticagrelor monotherapy after 1 month (Class 1A) and switching from ticagrelor or prasugrel to clopidogrel as part of the DAPT regimen (Class 2B). Monotherapy with any agent after 1 month also gets a 2b recommendation.

Although the guidelines are starting to budge on the issue, we seem to be perpetually locked into a 12-month DAPT mindset. The why is a fascinating question. It's partly because we are often more tolerant of bleeding than of cardiovascular events. We think we can manage bleeds whereas a stent thrombosis or a recurrent myocardial infarction feels like a failure. 

Who follows up on the patient will also affect the duration of antiplatelet therapy. It's asking a lot of primary care providers to overrule the angiographer's recommendation of 12 months of DAPT post stent on the cath report. 

A combination of uncertainty and inertia is keeping 12 months of DAPT alive. I'm as guilty as everyone else of falling into long established patterns. Habits are hard to break, but 24 years after CURE, we should acknowledge that 1 year of DAPT was never shown to be clinically superior to any other interval. Most of the contemporary data suggests that shorter durations are just as good if not better.

 May 12, 2025  

As cases of long COVID — often defined as symptoms that weren't present before persisting for 3 or more months after the infection — became more prevalent and alarming, researchers began to zero in on the commonly reported cardiovascular symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations, among others.

Long-COVID patients, much research has found, have significantly higher odds of developing cardiac complications than those without long COVID.

Now, some researchers recommend that severe COVID, such as cases requiring hospitalization, be viewed as an independent cardiovascular risk factor, regardless of the patient's cardiac health history, and that aggressive measures be initiated.

Others say there's not yet enough evidence to recognize severe COVID as an independent risk factor.

Statistics about how widespread long COVID is vary, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimating in 2022 that more than 40% of US adults reported having COVID, and 1 in 5 were still reporting symptoms. At any one time, according to the National Institutes of Health, a million people are out of work due to long COVID, and as many as 23 million Americans may have long-COVID symptoms.

“Severe COVID is a coronary artery disease risk equivalent,” Stanley Hazen, MD, PhD, co–section head of Preventive Cardiology and Cardiac Rehabilitation and department chair of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences at Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, told Medscape Medical News.

He bases that statement on a study his team did, using data from the UK Biobank to identify 10,005 people who were positive for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based tests for COVID-19 or who were hospitalized for COVID-19 between February 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. The researchers also looked at 217,730 population control individuals and 38,860 propensity-matched control individuals during the same time. They used proportional hazard models to evaluate COVID-19 for its association with long-term risks (> 1000 days) for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and as a coronary artery disease risk equivalent.

The risk for MACEs was elevated in those with COVID-19 at all levels of severity (hazard ratio [HR], 2.09; P < .0005) and to a greater extent in those hospitalized for COVID-19 (HR, 3.85; P < .0005). Hospitalization for COVID-19, they found, was a coronary artery disease risk equivalent because the risk for incident MACEs in those with severe COVID without a history of cardiovascular disease was even higher than that found in patients with cardiovascular disease without COVID-19 (HR, 1.21; P < .005).

“We had a 3-year period of follow-up,” Hazen said. “That risk seems to be persistent. If you look at all comers, all with a positive PCR test, we found about a doubling of the risk for heart attack, stroke, and death.”

“We only looked at people who were 50 and older, but it was over 200,000 subjects,” Hazen said. “The other thing that was clear is that the more severe the infection, the higher the risk of post-COVID cardiac events.”

Over the 3-year follow-up, he said, the risk for a cardiac event was the same in patients with severe COVID and in those with a history of heart attack.

In clinical practice, he pointed out, “a coronary artery disease risk equivalent has been used as the threshold for escalating preventive efforts in the community.”

Having diabetes, for example, is a coronary artery disease risk equivalent, he said. Based on the research, “we are arguing that if you had severe COVID, we should be treating these patients as if they have coronary artery disease and really escalate their preventive care.”

For these patients, he recommended a more aggressive lowering of cholesterol levels, such as aiming for a low-density lipoprotein level of below 70 or even lower and to be more aggressive with antiplatelet therapy, such as low-dose aspirin. “It looks like the degree of infection somehow ‘rewires' a person and makes them more proinflammatory long term,” Hazen said.

“We weren't able to look at the effect of vaccination [on the degree of infection or the MACE risk],” he said, as the study was launched before vaccines were available. “There is every reason to believe vaccines will attenuate this risk because they reduce the likelihood of serious infection.”

In Hazen's view, the most important take-home is that “we should be looking at COVID as a risk factor” for heart disease, “and we don't yet.”

Other research has produced similar links between severe COVID and cardiac issues. For instance, long COVID more than doubles the risk for new cardiac symptoms, researchers conducting a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of 11 studies with 5.8 million people found.

As the definition of long COVID varies, these researchers termed it as symptoms lasting for at least 4 weeks and occurring at least 2 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Those with a history of long COVID had a 2.3-2.5 times higher rate of cardiac complications than those without (P = .01).

Kieran Quinn, MD, PhD, a clinician-scientist at Sinai Health System and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, does not agree that a history of severe COVID can be termed a coronary artery disease risk equivalent at this point.

“I don't believe we have sufficient evidence to recognize is as an independent risk factor that is comparable to more conventional risk factors like smoking, diabetes, and hypertension,” he told Medscape Medical News.

He does agree the cardiac implications are associated with severe and long COVID. With his colleagues, Quinn set out to provide guidance to clinicians on the workup and management of adults with suspected long COVID and unexplained cardiac symptoms, retrieving 260 articles from an extensive databases and examining closely the five studies that met their criteria.

The researchers noted that about 15% of adult Canadians with SARS-CoV-2 infection develop post-COVID condition or long COVID. Among the cardiovascular symptoms are fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations.

Among the recommendations are to conduct routine tests such as baseline ECGs, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and blood glucose levels but against the routine use of other tests, such as cardiac MRIs, reserving it for those with symptoms suggestive of cardiac involvement.

Quinn pointed, too, to what he calls “a growing body of literature demonstrating that multiple different types of acute infections can lead to the development of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions.”

He cited his own study, asking if the risk of newly developing medical and mental health conditions are greater within a year of hospitalization for severe COVID vs influenza or sepsis.

The population-based cohort study in Ontario included all adults who were hospitalized for COVID-19 between April 1, 2020, and October 31, 2021, with historical comparator groups hospitalized for influenza or sepsis and a contemporary comparator group hospitalized for sepsis.

The researchers looked for a new occurrence of 13 conditions, including cardiovascular, neurological, and mental health conditions and rheumatoid arthritis within 1 year of hospitalization. Of the 379,366 adults included, 26,499 survived hospitalizations for COVID, 299,989 were historical control individuals hospitalized for influenza or sepsis, and 52,878 were hospitalized for sepsis.

Hospitalization for COVID-19 vs influenza was associated with an increased 1-year risk for venous thromboembolic disease (adjusted HR, 1.77) but with no increased risk for selected ischemic and nonischemic cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disorders, neurological disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, or mental health conditions compared with influenza or sepsis cohorts.

According to Quinn, it showed that “apart from an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism within 1 year, the burden of post-acute medical and mental health conditions among those who survived hospitalization for COVID-19 was comparable with other acute infectious illnesses, including the development of chronic cardiovascular conditions like heart failure.”

The take-home point, he suggested, is that “many of the post-acute consequences of COVID-19 may be related to the severity of infectious illness necessitating hospitalization rather than being the direct consequence of infection with SARS-CoV-2.”

Quinn is also a co-chair of the Canadian Guidelines for Post COVID-19 Condition and pointed to 80 evidence-informed recommendations released recently for the care of people with long COVID, with more guidelines expected in the coming months. “My advice to all physicians caring for people living with long COVID is to use these guidelines to guide shared decision-making around testing and treatments.”

The CDC also offers clinical guidance for managing long COVID.

Hazen and Quinn had no relevant disclosures.

 May 12, 2025  

A study has revealed that regular exercise can improve erectile dysfunction after treatment for prostate cancer, highlighting the importance of physical activity in sexual rehabilitation, particularly in men who have undergone radiotherapy or antiandrogen treatment.

Sexual dysfunction is often present after treatment for prostate cancer. Erectile function declines progressively for up to 15 years after prostatectomy and prostate radiotherapy and is often associated with a decrease in libido, alterations in ejaculatory and orgasmic function, and changes in relationships with sexual partners.

The pathogenesis of these disorders is complex and involves physical, psychological, and iatrogenic factors. However, most affected men do not receive targeted interventions for sexual dysfunction after prostate cancer.

Engaging in physical activity is one potential treatment owing to its somatic effects that counteract the bodily feminization and muscle wasting associated with androgen deprivation treatments, as well as their psychological effects (by preserving libido and improving a person's sense of masculinity).

A research team led by Daniel A. Galvão, PhD, from Edith Cowan University in Perth, Australia, studied the effects of resistance and aerobic exercise, alone or combined with a brief intervention on psychosexual education and self-management (PESM), vs standard care in men diagnosed with prostate cancer. They conducted a single-center, parallel-group randomized trial, consisting of three arms. Patient recruitment took place in Perth between July 2014 and December 2018.

The study participants had to present with sexual dysfunction with a global satisfaction score less than 8 on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) scale (range, 2-10); have undergone treatment with radiotherapy, prostatectomy, or antiandrogens; and have the consent of their physician.

Patients were excluded if their prostatectomy did not preserve the pelvic nerves, if more than 12 months had passed since the end of oncologic treatment, or if they were already regularly engaging in physical activity.

Of 394 eligible men, 112 (mean age, 66.3 years) were randomly assigned to three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: physical exercise (n = 39), exercise plus PESM (n = 36), or a control group (n = 37). Stratification was based on age, current sexual activity, and type of oncologic treatment.

Aerobic and resistance-based exercises were performed three times a week for 6 months, under strict supervision, in groups of 10-12 people. They included 20-30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise at 60%-85% of maximum heart rate and, if possible, exercises performed at home up to 150 minutes weekly.

Participants in the PESM group also received an intervention for stress management and assistance in resolving issues related to their treatments and defined their goals for sexual rehabilitation. Control group participants maintained their usual physical activity during the 6 months of the trial.

The primary evaluation criterion was sexual function, measured using the IIEF. Secondary criteria included changes in body composition, physical activity, and muscle strength. Additionally, prostate-specific antigen, testosterone, and C-reactive protein were measured. All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.

No notable side effects related to physical exercise were reported. The adjusted mean difference in IIEF scores at 6 months between the physical exercise group and the standard care group was approximately 3.5 points (P =.04).

In contrast, the PESM program did not appear to provide additional benefits, with the difference in IIEF scores calculated at -0.2 (P =.60).

Compared with standard care, engaging in physical exercise was associated with a significant improvement in fat mass and performance in standing up from a chair. There was also a noted gain in both upper-body and lower-body muscle strength.

In subgroup analysis, the benefit of muscle exercises over 6 months on erectile function was more pronounced in patients who underwent radiotherapy and those treated with antiandrogens compared with the prostatectomy subgroup.

When variations in IIEF by tertiles were analyzed, patients with the lowest tertile values before the trial were those who benefited the most from the exercises, both in terms of libido improvement and overall satisfaction.

Overall, this randomized trial confirms the value of a muscle exercise program on sexual function within 12 months of treatment for prostate cancer. A brief PESM program did not provide addition gains.

Of note, the impact of such measures was smaller after radical prostatectomy and in patients with advanced-stage cancer. Furthermore, regular physical exercise contributed to improvement in patients' self-perception of body image, with a potentially beneficial effect on their sexual function.

The strengths of this study are its highly significant results regarding sexual function and excellent participant adherence. Conversely, this was a single-center trial that included only 112 patients owing to problems with recruitment, and it may not necessarily be representative of all men treated for prostate cancer.

Thus, engaging in physical exercises should be considered an integral part of therapeutic measures aimed at improving sexual function after treatment for prostate cancer.

Women who consumed nuts, seeds, or corn had no increased risk for diverticulitis, contrary to historical data suggesting these foods may trigger the condition.

“Our findings refute the widely held belief that dietary intake of particulate matter should be avoided to prevent diverticulitis,” the authors wrote. “Diets with widely documented health benefits are also associated with a reduced risk for incident diverticulitis.”

The study, with first author Trevor Barlowe, MD, Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was study published online in Annals of Internal Medicine.

The study was observational and could not establish causality. Diverticulitis diagnoses were self-reported, introducing risk for misclassification. Although the analyses were adjusted for multiple confounders, the presence of bias from unmeasured confounders is possible.

Study funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health. The authors disclosed having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Although remission rates of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remained stable between 2018 and 2024 in England and Wales, regional differences were noted. Factors influencing the achievement of remission at 3 months included sex, timing of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD) initiation, and symptom duration before referral.

""Importantly, a major impact of the pandemic has been increasing delays between symptom onset and presentation to primary care for individuals with RA, which needs to be addressed if remission rates are to be improved going forwards,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Edward Alveyn, BMBCh, Centre for Rheumatic Diseases, King's College London, London, England. It was published online on May 05, 2025, in Rheumatology.

Additional factors influencing remission, such as the dosage of DMARDs and other medications, could not be captured. This study could not definitively determine the extent to which treatment delays affected the achievement of remission. Remission outcomes at different timepoints may not have been captured.

One author was supported by funding from the British Society for Rheumatology and another by a National Institute for Health and Care Research Clinical Lectureship.

Trilobio, the Company building the fully automated robotic lab-in-a-box for biologists, today announced it has raised $8 million USD Seed investment. The oversubscribed round was led by Initialized Capital, including participation from Argon Ventures and Lowercarbon Capital.

Trilobio was founded in 2021 to address the established data quality and reproducibility challenges limiting research efficiency; it is estimated that 77% of biologists cannot reproduce their own or other's research, despite latest advances in laboratory automation tools. Trilobio's co-founders, Roya Amini-Naieni and Maximilian Schommer, were named on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list for their contributions to advances in Manufacturing & Industry. To date, the Company has raised over $11 million, including support from Julian Capital, Juniper, Future Labs Capital, 1517 Fund, Alumni Ventures, Angel Squad, Sequel, Nucleus Capital, Gaingels and others, and has deployed its whole laboratory automation platform at leading biology labs across the United States.

This investment will support the expansion of the Trilobio Platform's robotics capabilities and no-code software features, enabling a growing portfolio of purpose-built lab devices and protocols to be integrated into a single, fully automated platform. Leveraging continual advancement and expansion of the Platform, Trilobio is providing an accessible and scalable solution to transform genetic engineering, synthetic biology and life science research processes, enabling scientists at the cutting-edge to execute research reproducibly, rapidly, and accurately.

Roya Amini-Naieni, CEO and Co-Founder at Trilobio, commented: ""Today's research is more collaborative, innovative, and insightful than ever before, and yet has not reached its full potential because of our inability to reliably reproduce, share, and collectively improve experiments. The future of the field depends on affordable new technologies that empower scientists to overcome these obstacles.""

Our mission at Trilobio is to redefine the relationship between scientists and the technologies that power their work every single day, enabling new scientific heights to be reached. We are thankful to have the support of a fantastic portfolio of investors who share our vision. It's time for true automation-connecting and fully automating all processes in the modern biology lab and making the dream of walk-away capabilities a reality.""

Roya Amini-Naieni, CEO and Co-Founder at Trilobio

The Trilobio Platform consists of the foundational robot, the Trilobot, which is fully programmable through Trilobio OS, the intelligent no-code protocol design software. Each Trilobot houses up to eight different interchangeable lab device tools, effectively creating a self-contained lab in a single device, for example grippers, various pipette tools, and a tube cap/de-capper. The Trilobots, which automatically calibrate themselves and plasticware, can be instantly linked together and work collaboratively, enabling a fleet to be adjusted to individual research requirements and scale capacity instantly.

A user's research protocol is entered into Trilobio OS just like writing a lab notebook entry, initiating the software engine to plan and execute all details without further action required and eliminating hours of coding and research design. Trilobio OS determines the optimal execution of the protocol which can be automatically adjusted for speed, cost, or accuracy. In total, the Trilobio Platform is purpose-built to ensure each step of the workflow is reproducible in any other Trilobio-enabled lab, without the need for hardware recalibration or rewrite of protocols. By providing a reliable and standardized approach, the technology streamlines research design and execution time down to minutes from days or even weeks.

""Roya and Max are uniquely qualified to build the future of lab automation given their interdisciplinary expertise in biology and robotics. I've never seen another founding team with this skillset,"" said Andrew Sather, Partner at Initialized Capital. ""Trilobio is a force-multiplier for the Bio Age, empowering scientists to improve our quality of life and move our species forward.""

Refeyn, the company behind pioneering mass photometry technology, has announced the installation of the 500th system based on its novel single-particle bioanalytical technology - notably, within just seven years of its spin out from Oxford University in 2018. This key milestone is marked as a 'game changer' by the Ploug Group at the University of Copenhagen's Biotech Research & Innovation Centre, where their new TwoMP mass photometer and MassFluidix HC system are now installed to further studies of proteins involved in disease relevant pathways.

The ever-increasing momentum for this unique technology, used in 30+ countries around the world, is also concurrently demonstrated by the scientific community with over 1,000 publications now citing mass photometry. In addition to academic labs like the Ploug Group, mass photometers are used by biopharma companies, CDMOs and CROs - for scientific discovery, drug development and manufacturing.

The Ploug Group is currently using mass photometry to study intravascular lipid metabolism, already citing it in a new research article investigating the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a key enzyme for the lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in capillaries. ""We anticipate that the acquisition of mass photometry in our laboratory is going to be a game changer in our studies on purified proteins involved in intravascular lipolysis,"" said Group Leader, Dr. Michael Ploug. ""We've already shown by mass photometry that the LPL inhibitor ANGPTL3/8 is not an oligomeric complex composed of three ANGPTL3 protomers and one ANGPTL8 protomer as was reported previously, but is actually a trimeric complex composed of only two ANGPTL3 protomers and one ANGPTL8 protomer. This information is self-evidently important for future studies on the regulation of LPL activity in capillaries.""

Mass photometry now provides a valuable orthogonal tool to those already available to the group for its functional and structural protein studies, proving ideal for studying proteins in low concentrations where SEC-MALS is challenged.

Since our proteins generally operate in the lower nanomolar range, we need to determine their oligomeric states at these low concentrations and we found that our studies using SEC-MALS often lead to misleading conclusions as it requires higher protein concentrations. We also chose the MassFluidix HC as an add-on to the TwoMP, as some of our biophysical analyses do need to be conducted at higher concentrations. Compared to SEC-MALS, mass photometry is fast and provides robust and reliable data. We're also very much impressed by the software used to control the mass photometer and evaluate the data — it's very intuitive and easy to operate.""

Dr. Ploug, Group Leader

With 1,000+ scientific citations highlighting the unique bioanalytical workflow capabilities of its mass photometry and macro mass photometry systems, Refeyn's technology—which enables the label-free characterization of single biomolecules and viral particles in solution in their native state—is proving invaluable for a wide variety of applications. In addition to protein analysis, other published application examples include characterization of bispecific antibody byproducts (including aggregates), lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), direct measurement of mRNA length, and also quantification of empty, partially filled and full adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector capsids.

Chemotherapy is one of the most popular ways to treat breast cancer. Even though it has proven to be effective, it also has downsides, such as a higher risk of side effects, as it doesn't only attack the cancer cells but can also affect normal cells. Chemotherapy-related side effects such as fatigue, weakness, and proneness to infections can influence treatment adherence and undermine the effectiveness of the therapy and the patients' quality of life.

Probiotics are among the emerging alternative supplements being studied for their potential benefit in cancer treatment. A new study published in the open-access journal Pharmacia explored the effects of multi-strain probiotics on chemotherapy-related side effects using Karnofsky performance score, complete blood count, and blood biochemistry.

The findings show that probiotics with 7 strains have a potential effect in patients with breast cancer, especially in the improvement of common chemotherapy-related side effects such as fatigue and nausea. Alleviation of these symptom can be seen before and after the probiotic supplementation. Another potential effect of multi-strain probiotics is improving blood urea nitrogen levels. Significant improvement was observed in the ability to perform activities of daily living, which means patients can go about their lives more independently and reduce their reliance on others. This might also be related to the improvement of nausea and fatigue symptoms.

In conclusion, multi-strain probiotics have been shown to have potential benefits in chemotherapy-related side effects for patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Further, larger study is needed to explore these effects and to confirm the benefits of multi-strain probiotics before they are used in clinical practice.

Older adults with vision problems face a heightened risk of falls and premature death, according to a new University of Michigan study.

The findings highlight a dangerous link between untreated vision impairment, repeated falls and increased mortality—and point to practical ways to intervene.

The study, published in Innovation in Aging, uses longitudinal data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study to investigate the association between self-reported visual difficulty and mortality risk among older adults, as well as the role of falls in this relationship, over a six-year period.

Vision loss isn't just an isolated health issue—it may be part of a broader chain of risks. Each fall compounds the danger, which may help explain why people with vision difficulties face greater health risks.""

Shu Xu, postdoctoral fellow at U-M's Institute for Social Research

Xu and colleagues note that previous research shows vision loss can make it harder to get around safely—raising the importance of targeted strategies, such as vision care and fall prevention programs, to help stop this downward spiral.

The researchers highlight several promising strategies, such as regular eye exams, better home lighting, removing tripping hazards, and strength or balance training, that deserve further testing.

Co-author Joshua Ehrlich, U-M associate professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, stressed the importance of proactive care.

“A fall shouldn't be dismissed as just bad luck—it's often a sign of unmet health needs,” said Ehrlich, who is also a research associate professor at ISR. “By addressing vision problems and building physical resilience, we can help older adults stay safer and even live longer.”

The authors say their study underscores the importance of future research into how vision care and fall prevention strategies could help improve health outcomes in aging populations.

Other co-authors included Jeffrey Burr and Qian Song of the University of Massachusetts Boston.

A flexible approach to eating less meat is delivering big wins for heart health, weight control, cancer prevention, and the planet, without forcing you to go vegan.

The flexitarian diet is gaining popularity among health-conscious and environmentally aware consumers. Unlike strict vegetarian or vegan diets, flexitarianism promotes meat reduction without complete abstinence.

Over the past several decades, scientific evidence has highlighted the benefits of less meat intake, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and a lower risk of many chronic diseases. As populations in high-income countries slowly begin to reduce animal-source foods, flexitarianism offers a practical approach for those unwilling to completely eliminate meat from their diet.1

The flexitarian diet, a combination of the words “flexible” and “vegetarian,” describes a primarily plant-based eating pattern that occasionally includes meat, fish, or other animal products. Unlike strict vegetarian or vegan diets, the flexitarian diet allows for the moderate consumption of animal-based foods based on individual preferences.

A typical flexitarian diet includes whole and minimally processed foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts, with the degree of restriction varying between individuals. For example, some individuals may exclude red meat but still consume poultry or fish, whereas others may consume all types of meat in limited amounts, such as once or twice a week.

Many people are adopting the flexitarian diet to support their health while simultaneously reducing their environmental footprint. As it does not impose strict rules, flexitarianism offers a practical and inclusive path toward healthier, more mindful eating.2

Several studies support the cardiovascular benefits of plant-forward diets, especially flexitarian and vegan dietary patterns. In a recent cross-sectional study in Germany comparing 94 adults following flexitarian, vegan, and omnivorous diets, both flexitarians and vegans had significantly lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels as compared to omnivores. Flexitarians also exhibited the most favorable metabolic syndrome (MetS) scores, along with reduced arterial stiffness measured through pulse wave velocity. The flexitarian diet may also reduce body fat percentages, particularly among women, while also contributing to the increased consumption of vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, and plant-based milk alternatives.1,3,4

Supporting evidence from a broader literature review similarly reported that semi-vegetarians who reduce meat intake multiple days every week have lower blood pressure levels and improved metabolic markers. One large cohort study also found that individuals who reduced their meat intake were less likely to develop ischemic heart disease than regular meat-eaters.1,3,4

Flexitarian or semi-vegetarian diets (SVDs) have been associated with positive outcomes in weight management and metabolic health.

Numerous studies have reported that individuals following flexitarian or semi-vegetarian diets (SVDs) often have lower body mass index (BMI) values and body fat as compared to non-vegetarians. Postmenopausal women consuming an SVD for over two decades also exhibited significantly lower blood glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance levels than non-vegetarian women.2

Large population studies, such as the Adventist Health Study-2 and India's National Family Health Survey, reported a lower incidence of diabetes among those following SVDs, lacto-ovo-vegetarian, or lacto-vegetarian diets. These diets typically include high fiber intake and reduced saturated fat consumption, both of which can improve glycemic control and insulin sensitivity.

SVDs may support a healthier gut microbiome due to the fiber-rich nature of plant-based foods.

A flexitarian diet appears to be protective against several types of cancer. For example, findings from the Adventist Health Study-2 indicate that individuals following vegan diets were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with cancer, including breast and prostate cancers

Pesco-vegetarians are the least likely to develop colorectal cancer, followed by lacto-ovo vegetarians, vegans, and semi-vegetarians, thus indicating that dietary patterns focused on whole foods may reduce cancer risk. Although additional research is needed to confirm these associations and clarify the mechanisms involved in the anti-cancer effects of these dietary patterns, semi-vegetarian diets are a safe and health-enhancing approach to cancer prevention.2

Flexitarian diets may also offer nutritional advantages over strict vegan diets by reducing the risk of common deficiencies associated with this more restrictive eating pattern. Research indicates that while vegan diets often fall short in nutrients like vitamin B12, iron, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids, semi-vegetarian diets can help bridge these gaps.

For example, a cross-sectional study conducted in Austria reported significantly lower levels of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in vegans and vegetarians as compared to semi-omnivores. Similarly, research involving over 9,000 Australian women reported that iron deficiency rates were highest in vegetarians (42.6%), followed by semi-vegetarians (38.6%), and lowest in non-vegetarians (25.5%).

Taken together, these findings suggest that the occasional inclusion of fish, eggs, or meat can enhance nutrient status. The flexibility of this diet may also improve long-term adherence as compared to more restrictive approaches.2

A primarily plant-based diet can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the consumption of water and land resources. In fact, the exclusion of all animal-based products from an individual's diet is associated with an 82% reduction in food-related emissions, thus highlighting the ecological potential of vegetarian and vegan diets.

Countries that integrate more plant-based options into their dietary guidelines often demonstrate stronger environmental performance. These results have led global frameworks like the EAT-Lancet Commission's Planetary Health Diet to advocate for reduced consumption of animal products to safeguard both human health and planetary sustainability.

National food-based dietary guidelines are also increasingly encouraged to align with these principles by promoting whole grains, legumes, nuts, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, while moderating animal-based food intake. These dietary shifts are essential for achieving long-term environmental goals and supporting sustainable food systems worldwide.5,6

A key strength of the flexitarian diet is its adaptability, which makes it easier for individuals to reduce their meat consumption without the rigidity of vegetarian or vegan regimens. This flexible approach allows people to gradually reduce meat intake at their own pace, thereby improving the likelihood of long-term adherence.

Fexitarian diets promote consuming a wide variety of food, which supports a more diverse and balanced nutrient intake. Unlike strict dietary plans that may feel limiting, the non-binding nature of flexitarianism empowers individuals to make choices based on personal values, preferences, and evolving health goals, leading to sustainable change over time.7

Although reducing meat intake is associated with numerous benefits, not all flexitarian diets are created equal, as health outcomes will vary widely depending on food choices. Prioritizing whole, nutrient-dense foods like legumes, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts is essential to avoid deficiencies.

Furthermore, to maintain a balanced intake of iron, vitamin B12, and omega-3 fatty acids, flexitarians must be intentional about dietary variety. Thus, careful planning ensures long-term health and nutritional adequacy.1

By emphasizing whole, nutrient-dense foods and reducing reliance on animal products and processed items, individuals can support heart health, manage weight, prevent cancer, and reduce their ecological footprint. Flexitarianism does not demand perfection, as small, consistent shifts toward eating more plants and fewer processed foods can yield measurable results.

The flexitarian diet's adaptability makes it easier to sustain long-term, thereby offering a realistic path for people seeking to improve their health without strict restrictions.

Researchers have developed EVE-Vax, a computational design tool that creates synthetic SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins mimicking future immune-evading variants. These designed proteins enable early assessment of vaccine efficacy before such variants naturally emerge.

A recent study in the journal Immunity reports on a novel computational method (EVE-Vax), which utilizes the EVEscape framework, to design antigens that foreshadow immune escape noted in future viral variants.

Rapid viral evolution constantly challenges the efficacy of medical interventions and vaccines. We currently evaluate interventions by assessing past or circulating variants. This is exemplified by recurrent breakthrough infections observed during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. This underlines the need for more proactive strategies to counter viral evolution.

Frameworks predicting immune-evasive mutations could facilitate the development of viral proteins and evaluate the potency of vaccine-elicited antibodies. Both experimental and computational methods have been used to achieve this aim, but experimental methods have limitations, including often relying on patient sera that may be unavailable early in an outbreak, being limited to a subdomain of the antigen, and so on. However, these methods aid the generation of antigens comprising novel mutational combinations that evade neutralization.

Computational models help overcome some of the above-mentioned limitations, as evidenced by EVEscape, a computational deep learning model, which accurately predicted immune-evading mutations across influenza, Lassa virus, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. However, whether computational methods generate functional antigens that foreshadow immune escape has yet to be demonstrated.



Graphical abstract

This study computationally generates and experimentally tests SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins with novel mutational combinations using the EVE-Vax design pipeline. The assessed mutations were representative of future antigenic evolution. Eighty-three novel versions of the “spike” protein on SARS-CoV-2 were designed using EVE-Vax. Each new version comprised a different combination of up to ten novel mutations relative to its background variant of concern (VOC), and some constructs contained up to 46 mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 strain. The receptor binding domain (RBD) had 57% of the mutations, while 40% were in the N-terminal domain (NTD).

Five variants of concern (VOC) backgrounds were used to develop the 83 multi-mutant full-length spike constructs, namely, B.1, BA.4/5, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, and XBB. These were engineered as single-cycle infection pseudotypes, a method that allows for safe laboratory evaluation as the pseudoviruses are non-replicative. Computational and experimental researchers teamed up to evaluate neutralization susceptibility against polyclonal immune sera. The sera were derived from nine diverse human serum panels representing varied COVID-19 exposure histories. The spikes that EVE-Vax designed mimicked the emerging VOCs' immune-escape profiles. EVE-Vax scored the probability of antibody escape by considering three biologically relevant constraints: impact on fitness, accessibility to antibodies, and disruption potential on antibody binding.

Ninety percent of the designed constructs were infectious. The eight non-infectious constructs were attributed to two main reasons: four contained a triplet of mutations (L452R, F490R, and Q493S) closer in 3-D structure than pandemic triplets, and the other four were designed using a model trained exclusively on pre-pandemic sequences. However, the 90% success rate is commendable and exceeds expected rates for randomly introduced mutations, offering insights for refining the EVE-Vax design algorithm.

Spikes designed on early SARS-CoV-2 variants showed neutralization resistance like subsequent variants, with the highest resistance among actual variants relative to their parent being shown by CH.1.1 and XBB. Most variants showed higher antibody escape relative to their parental variant. The exceptions were XBB.1, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1.5 variants. The emerging variants showed an almost fourfold (3.9-fold) reduction in geometric mean ID50 titers compared to their parent variant, on average. Furthermore, variants with higher antibody escape were noted to have reduced infectivity relative to the parent variants.



(A) Schematic overview of EVE-Vax for designing antigenic proteins. Single mutants within the top 1% of highest-predicted escape scores were combined to generate all possible double mutants. Double mutants were scored and further combined to create multi-mutant constructs. Designed constructs were subsequently evaluated for infectivity and neutralization sensitivity using pseudotyped virus assays. Parts of the figure were created with BioRender. (B) Cladogram depicting VOCs and computationally designed constructs (red triangles). Branch lengths are proportional to the temporal order of variant emergence. (C) Mutations across the 83 designed spike constructs mapped onto a representative 3D structure (PDB: 7BNN). Coloring indicates the frequency with which a given residue was mutated across all designed constructs.

On average, EVE-vax-designed spikes exhibited a 1.9-fold reduction (with a range of 0.5 to 5.31-fold) in geometric mean ID50 titer relative to the parent variant. EVE-vax-designed constructs on particular backgrounds showed similar neutralization resistance or antibody escape when compared to SARS-CoV-2 variants that evolved naturally from the same backgrounds. Therefore, these constructs can serve as useful proxies for future SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

EVE-Vax constructs were able to recapitulate antigenic profiles similar to future variants using only data available at the time of the emergence of VOCs. Earlier variant constructs showed antigenic resemblance to later emerging variants during the pandemic. For example, one B.1-background design (B.1-4a) showed a 3.9-fold reduction in neutralization sensitivity relative to B.1, exceeding the resistance of Alpha, Delta, and Gamma variants. Furthermore, the BA.2.12.1-5a designed construct mimicked the neutralizability of BA.2.75, which emerged later, and XBB designs containing the L452R or S494R mutations resembled the neutralization profile of HV.1 containing L452R.

The constructs were used to evaluate the B.1-BA.4/5 bivalent booster vaccine and high titers against the BA.2.75, BQ.1, BQ.1.1, and XBB variants were indicative of ample protection. A range of antibody escape was noted concerning constructs designed on BA.2.75 and XBB. When assessing nanoparticle vaccines, they elicited higher neutralizing titers against future SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to bivalent mRNA boosters.

Finally, experimental and computational approaches to predicting pandemic mutations and generating immune escape constructs were compared. Both approaches were able to detect positions that were frequently mutated at greater rates during the pandemic than random selection. Computational methods could identify most escape mutations found in experimental designs by adjusting EVE-Vax's detection threshold. On the contrary, experimental data would not likely have identified the unique mutations present in EVE-Vax constructs, proving the potential of EVE-Vax to be an alternative or complementary approach to high-throughput experimental methods.

While these findings are promising, the researchers highlighted in the paper that the EVE-Vax method, in its current form, primarily focuses on antibody neutralization. Crucial aspects like T-cell-mediated immunity, which is important for long-term protection, have not yet been incorporated. Additionally, the success of these computational approaches hinges on sufficient evolutionary sequence data for effective model training. The generalizability of this method to all viral antigens and the potential for misuse of predictive technologies also warrant careful consideration and further exploration.

In sum, the AI tool EVE-Vax has demonstrated its capability to predict and design viral proteins that could emerge in the future. These designed constructs triggered similar immune responses concerning the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as noted in actual viral proteins that emerged during the pandemic. EVE-Vax could facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics to guard against future variants of viruses that are evolving rapidly.

New research reveals that UPFs may be consumed more out of emotional distress and addiction than pleasure, challenging assumptions about why we reach for processed snacks.

Study: Factors Affecting Ultra-Processed Food Consumption: Hedonic Hunger, Food Addiction, and Mood. Image Credit: beauty-box / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Food Science & Nutrition, researchers examined the relationship between ultra-processed food (UPF) intake and food addiction, hedonic hunger, and mood.

Food processing has become widespread, especially with the advent of technology. The degree of food processing and the purpose of processing are crucial determinants of population health. The NOVA classification system stratifies foods into four categories. One of these categories, UPFs, is defined as foods that contain many additives, undergo intensive industrial processing, and have deteriorated natural structures.

Anti-humectants, flavor enhancers, and emulsifiers are commonly used in UPF production, allowing UPFs to have low production costs, longer shelf lives, and intensified flavors. The benefits of UPFs, aggressive advertising, rapid urbanization, and increased female participation in business have contributed significantly to the widespread consumption of UPFs. However, their low nutritional value, addictive properties, and high fat and energy content pose a threat to public health.

In the present study, researchers examined the relationship between UPF intake and food addiction, mood, and hedonic hunger. The study was conducted among adults aged 18–65 in Ankara, Turkey, using a web-based survey between September 2024 and January 2025. Individuals with incomplete responses, psychiatric disorders, and eating disorders were excluded from the analysis.

Anthropometrics and demographics were self-reported. Food intake was assessed using the Screening Questionnaire of Highly Processed Food Consumption (sQ-HPF). Hedonic hunger was evaluated using the Power of Food Scale (PFS), and food addiction status was examined using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to evaluate the emotional states of participants.

Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the data. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, kurtosis, skewness, histograms, and the coefficient of variation were used to assess the data distribution. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to examine relationships between variables. An independent t-test was performed to evaluate between-group differences in mean values. A linear regression analysis was used to predict UPF intake.

The study included 3,997 adults, on average, aged 31.7. Most participants were female (63%) and unemployed (52.9%). The mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.5 kg/m2. More than 55% of subjects had normal weight, 11.7% were obese, 27.5% were overweight, and 5.6% were underweight. The mean scores on the sQ-HPF, PFS, and YFAS were 5.1, 2.8, and 2.9, respectively.

The average stress, depression, and anxiety scores on the DASS-21 were 5.9, 5.6, and 5.0, respectively. Over 55% of subjects had a low UPF intake, and nearly 45% had a high UPF intake. A notably high proportion—86.7%—of subjects were classified as having food addiction according to the YFAS. The authors note that this elevated rate may reflect sample or scale characteristics and should be interpreted with caution. There was a significant, positive relationship between YFAS and sQ-HPF scores. Likewise, sQ-HPF showed significant, positive relationships with DASS-21 subdimension scores.

On average, individuals with high UPF intake were younger (28.8 years) than those with low UPF intake (34.1 years). Moreover, single and unemployed participants had significantly higher intake of UPFs than married and employed individuals. No significant differences in UPF intake were observed between groups based on PFS score, BMI category, and the number of main meals and snacks.

Notably, YFAS and DASS-21 scores were significantly higher among individuals with high UPF intake. The linear regression model found that age, gender, and YFAS and DASS-21 scores significantly affected the sQ-HPF score. Specifically, UPF intake was positively associated with food addiction and mood symptoms, and inversely associated with age and gender.

The authors also noted that the study did not assess participants' nutrition knowledge or awareness, which could be a factor influencing the observed lack of association between UPF intake and hedonic hunger. This limitation may have impacted the findings related to hedonic hunger.

In sum, the findings indicate that people with increased consumption of UPFs had significantly elevated food addiction and negative mood scores. Further, the consumption of UPFs was more common among female, younger, unemployed, and single participants, and mood symptoms and food addiction were more intense in these participants. Notably, there was no relationship between UPF intake and hedonic hunger. The authors suggest that the absence of an observed association between UPF intake and hedonic hunger may be influenced by unmeasured factors such as nutrition awareness, as well as the cross-sectional nature of the study.

The study's limitations include the snowball sampling method, which leads to selection bias and affects the generalizability of the results; the cross-sectional design, which precludes causal inference; and the use of self-reported data, which may yield unreliable results. Additionally, the high prevalence of food addiction observed in this sample may be influenced by the assessment tool or sample characteristics.

Overall, the findings underscore the impact of mood and food addiction on UPF intake. Thus, interventions and policies aimed at psychosocial processes are needed to promote healthy and conscious eating behaviors.

Researchers uncover how pasta taps into deep emotional roots, evoking joy, family, and comfort, while highlighting its surprising psychological benefits when consumed mindfully and in company.

Study: Pasta, What a Feeling! A Multi-Method Study on the Relationship Between Pasta Consumption and Happiness. Image Credit: Aline Ponce / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal Food Science & Nutrition, researchers explored the emotional responses associated with the consumption of pasta, specifically whether eating pasta makes people happier and how individual traits predict these emotional responses.

Based on two studies with over 1,500 Italian participants, they consistently found links between consuming pasta and experiencing positive emotions, specifically happiness, which was enhanced in social settings, and more pronounced in those with a better quality of life, higher mindfulness, and lower stress. Respondents associated pasta with family, tradition, and comfort. Importantly, the study also found that other carbohydrate-rich foods—such as rice, bread, and pizza—did not show a similar boost in happiness, particularly in social eating contexts.

The brain's “pasta bias” is stronger than expected. Implicit tests revealed a subconscious preference for pasta 1.5 times stronger than typical food-related biases.

Food and emotions are closely connected, with eating behaviors influenced by emotional states and vice versa. Factors such as hunger, age, and personal values shape these experiences. For instance, sad people may crave carbohydrates, while those who align with healthy eating values feel better when consuming nutritious foods.

The Mediterranean diet, celebrated for both health and social benefits, has been linked to psychological and physical well-being. However, little is known about how elements like pasta affect emotional states.

Though some studies suggest pasta evokes pleasant feelings, these findings are limited by small sample sizes and artificial settings. There's also a distinction between “experienced” emotions (felt in the moment) and “remembered” emotions (recalled afterward), with the latter being prone to bias.

Additionally, emerging research highlights the role of “implicit” emotional responses that are not consciously reported. Therefore, a well-rounded understanding of pasta's emotional impact must consider both direct and indirect responses and immediate and remembered responses.

Pasta's joy isn't about quantity – Happiness spikes occurred regardless of portion size, suggesting satisfaction stems from the experience rather than fullness.

Researchers assessed how pasta consumption relates to emotional well-being through a comprehensive, multi-method approach. They conducted two interconnected studies that used both survey and real-time data collection approaches to examine the emotional associations with pasta consumption.

The first study used a mixed-method approach with a representative sample of 1,532 Italian adults. To reflect demographic diversity, participants were recruited via a stratified national online panel.

Data collection included a quantitative survey on pasta consumption frequency and preferences for other carbohydrate sources, open-ended questions exploring emotional imagery and feelings associated with pasta, an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to assess unconscious emotional links to pasta, and several psychological questionnaires to evaluate personality traits, mindfulness, stress, quality of life, and emotional experiences.

Qualitative data were analyzed thematically, while quantitative data were assessed using descriptive statistics and Spearman's rho correlations.

The second study used an experience sampling method (EMA) over two weeks with 83 people from the first study who consumed pasta three or more times a week. Participants used a smartphone app to report emotions and contextual factors before and after meals. Variables included anger, tiredness, sadness, hunger, and happiness. Post-meal entries also recorded food intake, enjoyment, and meal setting.

A Gaussian Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) linked the impact of consuming pasta to differences in happiness levels. The model included fixed effects (pasta vs. no pasta) and random effects (individual variability), with robustness checks for covariates like income and education. The researchers also conducted sensitivity analyses, but including these covariates did not alter the main findings.

Nostalgia plays a hidden role – 41% of participants' pasta memories involved childhood or family meals, with descriptors like “Sunday lunches” recurring in open responses.

The first study revealed widespread appreciation for pasta: nearly half of the participants consumed it daily. Thematic analysis of emotional associations showed that pasta evoked strong imagery of family (41%), positive emotions (21%), and taste or pleasure (10%), followed by themes like comfort, tradition, and well-being. Emotional responses to pasta consumption included satiety (34%), satisfaction (29%), and happiness (10%).

The IAT showed a significant positive cognitive bias, meaning participants unconsciously linked pasta with positive emotions. Correlational analyses indicated that stronger pasta appreciation was associated with fewer negative emotions, higher well-being, lower stress, greater mindfulness, and more positive implicit associations. For instance, liking pasta was positively correlated with quality of life and mindful eating, and negatively correlated with alexithymia (also known as emotional blindness).

The second study confirmed that pasta meals significantly increased happiness levels. Across 1,843 valid meal entries, the GLMM found that pasta consumption predicted greater post-meal happiness. This effect remained robust across sensitivity checks. The model revealed individual variation in baseline happiness, but overall, the impact of pasta was significant, suggesting a consistent positive emotional impact of pasta consumption. Notably, this increase in happiness was particularly marked when pasta was consumed in social settings, such as eating together with others, rather than alone or at work. In contrast, similar effects were not observed for other carbohydrate-based foods.

The researchers also noted that their observational design cannot confirm causality. It remains possible that people who are already happier or more mindful are more likely to enjoy or choose pasta, rather than pasta itself directly causing increased happiness (a possibility known as reverse causality).

Some methodological limitations were acknowledged, such as the smaller, self-selected sample in the EMA study, which could introduce selection bias, and the potential for participant fatigue due to frequent in-the-moment data collection. The study was conducted solely in Italy, where pasta holds strong cultural significance, possibly limiting the generalizability of the findings to other countries or cultures.

Even rushed meals help – Quick weekday pasta lunches at home still boosted mood, defying assumptions that emotional benefits require leisurely dining.

Both studies demonstrate a strong, positive emotional association with pasta, both implicit and experienced in real-life settings. Researchers found that pasta consumption is consistently linked to positive emotions, especially happiness, across self-reports, real-time assessments, and implicit tests.

Pasta evoked strong associations with family, comfort, and cultural traditions, particularly in Italy. Social settings enhanced its emotional impact, highlighting the importance of shared meals. Mindfulness also appeared to strengthen the positive experience of eating pasta.

However, the study's observational design means causality cannot be confirmed, and cultural specificity limits generalizability. Reverse causality is also a possibility—that is, people who are happier or more mindful may simply be more inclined to enjoy pasta. The research suggests pasta's emotional resonance may stem from its symbolic role in Italian culture. In addition, the lack of a similar happiness boost for other carbohydrate-rich foods suggests a unique emotional status for pasta within this cultural context.

Future studies should test these associations cross-culturally and explore the impact of different pasta types and meal contexts. Further research with experimental or longitudinal designs may help clarify causality and underlying mechanisms. Overall, pasta's emotional value goes beyond nutrition, offering insights for health promotion and marketing focused on well-being and social eating.

New research being presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Malaga, Spain (11-14 May) and published in the journal eClinicalMedicine finds that first generation weight-loss medications like liraglutide and exenatide appear to show anti-cancer benefits beyond weight loss.

Our study found a similar incidence of obesity-related cancer among patients treated with first-generation glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) and with bariatric surgery over an average of 8 years follow-up, despite the relative advantage of surgery in maximizing weight loss. But accounting for this advantage revealed the direct effect of GLP-1RAs beyond weight-loss to be 41% more effective at preventing obesity-related cancer.""

Dr. Yael Wolff Sagy, co-lead author from Clalit Health Services, Tel-Aviv, Israel

She adds: ""We do not yet fully understand how GLP-1s work, but this study adds to the growing evidence showing that weight loss alone cannot completely account for the metabolic, anti-cancer, and many other benefits that these medications provide.""

GLP-1RA medications are best known for helping control type 2 diabetes and treat obesity. They mimic a hormone in the body, GLP-1, that lowers blood sugar levels and makes people feel fuller for longer.

Both obesity and diabetes are linked with an increased risk for many types of cancer, referred as obesity related cancer, including post-menopausal breast cancer, colorectal cancer, corpus uteri cancer, meningioma, renal-cell kidney, liver or bile duct, pancreatic, thyroid, stomach, and ovarian cancer, as well as multiple myeloma.

First generation GLP-1s and bariatric surgery are well established weight loss treatments, but their comparative effectiveness for the prevention of obesity-related cancers is not known.

To find out more, researchers analysed electronic health record data for patients (aged 24 years or older) with obesity (BMI of 35 kg/m2 or higher) and type 2 diabetes (with no prior history of cancer), who were treated with first-generation GLP-1s (i.e., for a minimum of six monthly purchases of liraglutide, exenatide, or dulaglutide within 12 consecutive months) or with bariatric surgery between 2010 and 2018 from Clalit health services-which insures over half of the Israeli population (approximately 4.8 million patients).

In total, 6,356 participants (61% females; average age 52 years; mean BMI 41.5 kg/m²) were matched 1:1 based on sex, age, BMI at the start of the study, time of treatment initiation, and smoking status. They were followed-up until December 2023 for a diagnosis of obesity-related cancer.

Over a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 298 patients were diagnosed with obesity-related cancer. The most common cancer was postmenopausal breast cancer (77; 26%), followed by colorectal cancer (49; 16%), and cancer of the uterus (45; 15%).

The analysis found that obesity-related cancer occurred in 150 of 3,178 surgery patients (5.76 cases per 1,000 person-years) and in 148 of 3,178 patients taking GLP-1s (5.64 cases per 1,000 person-years), despite the relative advantage of bariatric surgery in weight reduction, that is known to reduce cancer risk.

To assess the comparative effect beyond the extent of weight-loss (which mediates the reduction in cancer risk following treatment), the researchers further adjusted the analysis for the percent of maximal BMI change during follow-up (i.e., how much an individual's BMI changed).

They found that GLP1-RAs had a direct effect on reducing obesity-related cancer beyond weight-loss, with a 41% lower relative risk compared to bariatric surgery.

""The protective effects of GLP1-RAs against obesity-related cancers likely arise from multiple mechanisms, including reducing inflammation,"" said co-lead author Professor Dror Dicker from Hasharon Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel. ""Our study is unique in that the long-term follow-up allowed us to compare the effects of GLP1-RAs and surgery with potential long latency periods of cancer. New generation, highly potent GLP1-RAs with higher efficacy in weight reduction may convey an even greater advantage in reducing the risk of obesity-related cancers, but future research is needed to make sure that these drugs do not increase the risk for non–obesity-related cancers.""Despite the important findings, the authors note that this is an observational study and that future randomised trials and larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the effects and explore the underlying mechanisms.

A powerful simulation of H5N1 transmission across 35,974 US herds shows that the virus is far more widespread than reported, raising urgent calls for better farm surveillance and stronger disease control.

Study: A mathematical model of H5N1 influenza transmission in US dairy cattle. Image Credit: Clara Bastian / Shutterstock

In a recent study in the journal Nature Communications, researchers developed and tested a novel stochastic metapopulation transmission model to predict the scale, the most important epidemiological data, and the states at highest risk in the ongoing H5N1 avian influenza epidemic in US dairy cattle. The model simulates H5N1 transmission between 35,974 herds in the US, with cattle movement informed by probabilistic outputs from the US Animal Movement Model (USAMM) and verified using Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection data.

Model findings predict that the West Coast states have the highest disease burden, with Arizona and Wisconsin at the highest risk of future outbreaks. The study highlights gaps in current biosecurity surveillance systems and suggests that dairy outbreaks are in the 2025 forecast, necessitating urgent interventions addressing these gaps.

The United States (US) dairy industry represents a significant portion of the nation's GDP (3%). For its routine functioning, the industry requires frequent movement of the 9 million milk cows. Unfortunately, this practice often contributes to transmitting communicable diseases (such as avian influenza) between otherwise isolated cattle herds.

The US dairy industry is currently facing a severe threat - highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1. The outbreak brought the disease into the limelight from farms in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico (February 2024). By December 2024, this outbreak had spilled over to 720 cattle herd infections and 35 human infections across the US. Recent phylogenetic research and structural analyses on the responsible H5N1 strain suggest that a specific single mutation could be sufficient to allow for human receptor binding, sparking concerns about the dairy viral reservoir in the country and increasing the risk of viral adaptation to humans.

Unfortunately, no research estimates of the H5N1 epidemic's size or predictions of future hotspots exist.

“In previous bovine disease outbreaks, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and foot-and-mouth disease in the UK, public health responses have been significantly aided by modeling studies to estimate rates of under-reporting, estimating key epidemiological mechanisms, and quantifying the impact of control policies. Such efforts have not yet been applied to the current bovine H5N1 epidemic in the US.”

The present study addresses these knowledge gaps by designing and developing a stochastic metapopulation transmission model (SEIR) to simulate H5N1 transmission in 9,308,707 milk cows (35,974 herds) across the continental US (48 states; 2022 census data). It uses a Bayesian evidence synthesis approach to estimate epidemiological parameters matching reported outbreaks.

The model simulation was initiated by infecting five cows in Texas based on phylogenetic analyses suggesting an initial spillover in December 2023, with additional seeding reflecting early reported outbreaks. Migration of cattle between herds was estimated using a probability function computed using data from the US Animal Movement Model (USAMM). Model parameters were fit using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations.

Model objectives were to assess the proper size of the H5N1 epidemic, evaluate the impacts of current mitigation measures on future outbreaks, identify critical epidemiological data required to prepare for future outbreaks, and predict future outbreak hotspots.

Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) infection dynamics models (20,000 stochastic simulations) revealed that most current H5N1 infections in dairy cattle are concentrated along the country's West Coast. While the model was observed to overestimate case densities in some predicted outbreaks (Texas, Ohio, and New Mexico), the model successfully simulated outbreaks for states with frequent reporting like California, though it overestimated reported outbreaks in some other states (Texas, Ohio, and New Mexico), which the researchers interpret as potential under-reporting in those states relative to California's baseline.

Alarmingly, only 16 of the 26 states where the model indicated a majority of simulations would see an H5N1 outbreak by December 2nd, 2024, had actually reported one, suggesting a high degree of under-reporting. Arizona and Wisconsin are expected to become future hotspots of H5N1 outbreaks. Indiana and Florida are also at significant risk of H5N1 outbreaks.

Investigations of current mitigation measures reveal that they are insufficient to control, much less reverse, the prevalence of H5N1 in the country. Notably, the only current mitigation measure enforced across states is testing exported cattle (screening up to 30 cows/herd for H5N1). Model predictions revealed that increasing this screening to even 100 cows/herd would result in only a slight reduction in mean outbreaks and would not fundamentally alter the epidemic's trajectory.

Notably, the SEIR infection model does not account for other zoonotic viral reservoirs in model predictions. The ongoing avian influenza epidemic and the possibility of these birds infecting cattle may exacerbate model predictions.

The present study and the SEIR model it presents suggest that current reports on the prevalence of H5N1 dairy cattle infections are an underrepresentation of the true concentration of the disease within the United States. Current anti-H5N1 transmission interventions are insufficient to prevent additional outbreaks throughout 2025. At the highest risk of future outbreaks, Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida, and Indiana require additional surveillance efforts.

“Significant increases in testing are urgently required to reduce the uncertainty of model projections and provide decision-makers with a more accurate picture of the true scale of the national epidemic.”

Boccia's appeal and rising popularity comes from its showcase as a Paralympic sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and abilities. An Osaka Metropolitan University team has developed an extended reality version of the game as a rehabilitation program, showing how the game that requires accuracy and strategy can aid motor and cognitive skills.

Graduate School of Rehabilitation Science Associate Professor Masataka Kataoka's research group developed Boccia XR so that the program can be introduced even in environments with limited space. The researchers investigated changes in mood among participants over 65 before and after experiencing Boccia XR, traditional boccia, and treadmill walking, as well as lower limb muscle activity during exercise.

Participants reported better moods, vitality, and energy after experiencing both Boccia XR and traditional boccia. There was no significant difference in lower limb muscle activity during any of the programs, though muscle activity of the rectus femoris, which helps extend the knee, increased during both types of boccia compared to the treadmill.

Boccia XR could be effective as a rehabilitation exercise for older adults in terms of both physical and emotional effects, and since it does not require a large court, it is practical for indoor environments such as hospitals and nursing care facilities. Since this research was designed to verify immediate effects, we plan to conduct further studies to investigate long-term results in a larger population of older adults and to continue updating Boccia XR.""

It's the business end of the season for many of Europe's USMNT stars with trophies, qualification for UEFA competition and pride at stake in a high-pressure week of finals and fights to the end.

We've been keeping track of all the U.S. emigres as they ply their trade across Europe's elite leagues and give national coach Mauricio Pochettino plenty to think about ahead of the USMNT's summer fixtures. With that, let's dive into this week's roundup.

Grab the popcorn because Christian Pulisic and Milan's season has reached peak box office.

As they head into the final stretch of a tumultuous campaign, they are somehow still clinging onto hopes of Champions League qualification through their Serie A placing, and could also bag a major domestic trophy this midweek that would guarantee Europa League participation next term.

That's because the Rossoneri, with the help of another Pulisic goal, won the first of a major double-header of games against Bologna ahead of a pivotal final two league outings of the campaign.

Sergio Conceicao's men can't afford to slip up if they're to do the (still) improbable and drag themselves above Bologna, Roma, Lazio and Juventus and into fourth place in the table.

And they did not falter on Friday, beating Bologna 3-1 at San Siro courtesy of a Santiago Gimenez brace and Pulisic's quick reactions to convert Joao Felix's blocked shot — a come-from-behind win that will pep belief for the weeks to come.

So now it's another match-up with the same opponents on Wednesday in the Coppa Italia final before Sunday's journey to Rome, where victory would put them level with Claudio Ranieri's men. They will also require the rest to continue to falter before the final-day game against already relegated Monza.

It would be a remarkable comeback if Milan did it, but at the very least a win on Wednesday would also see this up-and-down season conclude with both domestic trophies in the cabinet.

Perhaps they are not what clubs with Milan's ambitions covet most when compared to the money-spinning, profile-boosting Champions League, but they are something to savour at least for the fans.

There does seem to be some much-needed momentum behind Pulisic & Co. In contrast, at Juventus, who are clinging onto fourth spot currently, Weston McKennie and Tim Weah find themselves on the other end of the traction train.

Both Americans started as Igor Tudor's side faltered in their own Roman test on Saturday, having to settle for a point after Lazio secured a 1-1 draw with a 96th-minute equaliser.

McKennie did at least contribute. The midfielder's movement was smart and he sent over the cross from which Randal Kolo Muani scored from on 51 minutes.

It will be fascinating to see what Pulisic and McKennie can do during their respective team's dramatic run-ins. The Turin club face mid-table Udinese before a tricky final day trip to confront a Venezia team who might still be fighting for survival.

Meanwhile, over in the Netherlands, PSV's American contingent are in the mix of another nail-biter.

The defending Eredivisie champions looked set to lose their crown to Ajax this season after results waned over the winter and the Amsterdam giants claimed top spot.

But speaking of magical momentum, Malik Tillman and PSV's other USMNT boys have it aplenty with two games left in the league.

On Sunday, they came from behind at Feyenoord to prevail 3-2 with a 99th-minute winner, and now sit just a solitary point behind Ajax with two games remaining. PSV have also won their past five league games since their last defeat, by Ajax on March 30.

— PSV (@PSV) May 11, 2025



For their part, Ajax have won just twice in the same period and now appear to have the jitters at being hunted down — on Sunday, they lost 3-0 at home to 13th-placed NEC Nijmegen.

PSV called on Tillman, who had a strong game against Feyenoord, and Richy Ledezma, with the latter forced off through injury on 26 minutes to be replaced by compatriot Sergino Dest.

Of both clubs' remaining games, Ajax arguably have the slightly harder run-in, facing fifth-placed Twente on the final day.

It's going to be interesting.

Antonee Robinson was not in Fulham's squad for their 3-1 home defeat against Everton on Saturday because of sickness.

The USMNT key man missed the win over Southampton at the end of April before returning to play in the tight loss to Aston Villa. But his absence was keenly felt against Everton, with the 1-3 defeat a setback for Fulham's hopes of qualifying for some form of European football next season.

Still, Robinson has had an excellent individual season and his form has been lost on nobody — particularly Premier League attackers.

Speaking on John Mikel Obi's The Obi One Podcast, Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo revealed that the left-back is the toughest opponent he has faced.

“I would say Antonee Robinson from Fulham,” he said. “I used to play against him when he was at Wigan and he has changed completely. When he arrived, he was quick but not so good with his feet.

“Throughout the years he has proven a lot and he can now do everything — he can attack, he can defend, he's strong, he's good with his feet. He's really, really hard to play against.”



Name: Chris Richards
Club: Crystal Palace
Position: Defender
Appearances (all competitions): 29

Richards and his team-mates will head to Wembley for this weekend's FA Cup final on a high after beating Tottenham 2-0 on Sunday.

That solid Palace back three, of which Richards is a key part, were robust against the Europa League finalists and bagged their first win at Tottenham's new stadium to provide some much-needed momentum ahead of the weekend.

Name: John Tolkin
Club: Holstein Kiel
Position: Defender
Appearances: 10

The 22-year-old American, who joined his Bundesliga club from NY Red Bulls in January, suffered the pain of relegation on Saturday.

Holstein Kiel's 2-1 home defeat by Freiburg ensured their demotion from the German top flight along with bottom club Bochum. It was Tolkin's eighth start for Kiel and he has contributed two assists.



Name: Haji Wright
Club: Coventry City
Position: Striker
Appearances: 30

Wright didn't manage to get on the scoresheet as Coventry lost the first leg of their Championship play-off semi-final to Sunderland 2-1 on Friday. He was involved in a shoving match with Sunderland's Trai Hume as things got scrappy in the high-pressure game, though.

The two sides meet again on Tuesday.

(All Eastern Time)

So, if you've been paying attention, you'll already know there are some massive games coming up featuring USMNT players this week.

In the first of the finals, Pulisic and Yunus Musah are bidding to lift the Coppa Italia as they face Bologna on Wednesday at the Stadio Olimpico. Catch that game on Paramount+ with kick off at 1pm.

Then on Saturday, it's all eyes on Richards in the FA Cup final as Crystal Palace search for their first major domestic honour against Manchester City. Even amid a poor season by their standards, Pep Guardiola's side are dangerous and Richards & Co will have their hands full if they want to get their hands on the trophy (ESPN +, 11am).

Those of you who are hooked on Serie A and whether Juventus can ward off Milan's challenge and hold onto fourth can see McKennie and Weah in action against Udinese on Sunday (9am, Paramount+).

Don't forget that Real Betis are still in the thick of their own fight to qualify for Europe again in La Liga, where Johnny Cardoso came on as a sub in Sunday's 1-1 draw with Osasuna.

On Thursday, they go up against Rayo Vallecano (1pm, ESPN +).

Xabi Alonso won the Bundesliga last season but his side will finish second behind Bayern Munich this campaign

Real Madrid want Xabi Alonso in place as their new manager in time for the start of next month's Club World Cup.

Sources say the plan is for Alonso, 43, to travel to Madrid on 1 June to prepare the team for their first game of the inaugural Fifa tournament on 18 June against Saudi side Al-Hilal in Miami.

Former Real, Liverpool and Spain midfielder Alonso announced on Friday he was leaving German side Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the season.

It was not Alonso's intention to join up with Real this early but conversations took place last week and the club felt it did not make sense to use an interim before the Basque manager took over.

Current Real manager Carlo Ancelotti will leave the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to take over as the national team coach of Brazil.

The 65-year-old Italian is set to be given a send-off in Los Blancos' final home game of the campaign against Real Sociedad on 25 May.

Real's La Liga defence was dealt a decisive blow on Saturday as they lost 4-3 to league leaders Barcelona to leave them seven points adrift with three games remaining.

Conversations with Real started months ago when they let Alonso know he would be the replacement if Ancelotti did not continue next season. 

By March a verbal agreement was in place and in the last two weeks negotiations started to focus on the details.

Right now, nothing has been finalised about the timing of his arrival, but Real have let him know that he should take over in the USA as they consider the Club World Cup a very important competition.

The Spanish side are also hoping to complete the signing of Liverpool full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold before the start of the Club World Cup.

Leverkusen had a gentlemen's agreement with Alonso by which he could leave if one of this former clubs came calling, a door open to Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Real. His original idea has always been to manage Liverpool at some point in his career.

Last year the former Liverpool star led Leverkusen to the double of a Bundesliga title - without losing a game - and the German Cup in his first full season as a senior club manager.

Alonso played for Real between 2009 and 2014 following a five-year spell at Liverpool, before ending his playing career after three years at Bayern Munich in 2017.

BBC Sport reported last month that Ancelotti is set for further talks about taking over as Brazil coach before the 2026 World Cup qualifiers in June.

Ancelotti took charge of Real for a second spell in 2021 and has won the Champions League three times with the club.

But the Italian's side failed to reach the Champions League semi-finals for only the third time in 12 seasons this campaign.

According to MARCA.

Real Madrid have decided that Xabi Alonso will coach the team during the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup, moving away from the initial plan of appointing an interim coach for that tournament. That's according to a report from MARCA, which also indicates that Alonso will work hard to implement his coaching philosophy and new ideas in the weeks leading to the World Cup.

It would seem reasonable to expect some growing pains during Alonso's first few games as the coach, especially when he will have a depleted roster to work with. Alonso's system and coaching style is very different from Ancelotti's, so while the Club World Cup could seem like a fairly manageable tournament for Los Blancos, the Spanish coach will have to work really hard if he wants his team to perform at a high level.

The FIFA Club World Cup kicks off on June 14th, with Alonso expected to take over his new role on June 1st.

Xabi Alonso is set to replace Carlo Ancelotti as Real Madrid boss, according to Sky in Germany; outgoing Bayern Leverkusen boss Alonso is expected to take over as Real boss ahead of the Club World Cup;  Ancelotti is to take charge of the Brazil national team from May 26

Monday 12 May 2025 18:30, UK

Xabi Alonso will become the new Real Madrid head coach ahead of the Club World Cup, according to Sky in Germany.

The Spaniard will replace Carlo Ancelotti, who is to take charge of the Brazil national team from May 26 after finishing the season at Real Madrid.

Alonso announced his Bayer Leverkusen exit on Friday after a successful two-and-a-half years at the German club, having won a league and cup double last season and falling just short of a remarkable unbeaten treble with defeat to Atalanta in the Europa League final.

The 43-year-old won nearly everything as a player at Real Madrid and is set to try to win more silverware as a manager at the Bernabeu.

Sky in Germany understands that Leverkusen have agreed to release him a year early from his contract, initially due to run until the summer of 2026, which would allow the ex-Liverpool midfielder to join Real Madrid for free.

Alonso's first game in charge of the Spanish giants is set to be on June 18 for Real's Club World Cup opener against Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal in Miami.

""I know we shouldn't jump the gun, but everybody in football knows.

""Alonso, on Friday, announced he'd be leaving Bayer Leverkusen. He won the double there last season. A lot of people thought he'd go to Liverpool, but he decided to stay an extra season.

""He's got a gentleman's agreement with Leverkusen that if one of the clubs that he played for came in for him, then he'd be allowed to leave. So we're talking Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid.

""Sky Germany this afternoon reported they think he will definitely be the Real Madrid manager - and also he will be in place for the Club World Cup next month.

""Their first game is on June 18 against Al Hilal in Miami, so he's somebody else who's not really going to be getting much of a summer holiday, but then Real Madrid don't come calling very often.

""He'll have his work cut out because, make no mistake, Carlo Ancelotti is a very tough act to follow.

""We've seen how good Barcelona have been under Hansi Flick this season, so he needs to really hit the ground running because you don't get much time at Real Madrid. Of course, he has some credit in the bank because he was such a fantastic player, not only in Madrid, but everywhere else he played.""

Alonso's imminent arrival comes after the news current Real boss, Ancelotti, will become Brazil head coach at the end of the season.

The 65-year-old will become the nation's first permanent foreign head coach, and will be in charge for Brazil's World Cup qualifiers against Paraguay and Ecuador next month.

In a statement, the Brazilian FA (CBF) hailed the ""landmark moment of the coming together of two icons"", highlighting their unrivalled five World Cup wins and Ancelotti's historic record in European football.

This will be Ancelotti's first international role, but he will take over Brazil as one of the most decorated managers in club football and the only coach to win each of Europe's top-five leagues.

The world's most successful international team have been on the lookout for their fifth head coach in two-and-a-half years since the dismissal of Dorival Junior at the end of March.

Since his return for his second spell in the Spanish capital in 2021, Ancelotti has led Real Madrid to a pair of LaLiga and Champions League doubles, but following Sunday's El Clasico defeat to Barcelona is all-but certain to miss out on any silverware in his final season.

He will leave the Bernabeu for the final time the day after their last game of the LaLiga season against Real Sociedad.

Despite the disappointment of another Clasico defeat, Real Madrid fans finally have a reason to look ahead with optimism. 

This is because, according to MARCA, the club has taken a decisive step towards its future by confirming that Xabi Alonso will take charge of the team at the FIFA Club World Cup. There will be no interim solution. No waiting. The new project begins now.

The decision, reportedly made during an internal meeting last week, signals a shift in tone and urgency from Florentino Perez and his board. 

Rather than having Alonso wait on the sidelines while an interim coach like Santiago Solari leads the squad in a crucial tournament, the club chose to thrust the former midfield maestro directly into the action. 

The message from the board was crystal clear: “This starts at the World Cup.”

The Club World Cup, taking place in the summer on American soil, is seen as a vital tournament by the Madrid hierarchy. 

It is not just another trophy to win, it is an opportunity to reassert Real Madrid's authority ahead of a new era. 

Perez, for that matter, understands that the momentum of this new cycle begins with the way it is introduced, and there's no better platform than a high-profile competition where Madrid are expected to perform.

Alonso's appointment will mean there is no transitional period between Carlo Ancelotti's departure and the start of the new regime. 

The Italian manager will head straight to take charge of Brazil, perhaps the most demanding national team job in the world, while Alonso steps into one of the most scrutinised roles in club football.

It is a bold decision, and not without its challenges. Alonso will be expected to make tactical and selection decisions in a competitive environment almost immediately. 

But Real Madrid are betting on his ability to adapt quickly, something he has already shown at Bayer Leverkusen, where he transformed the German club into a title-winning side playing exciting, modern football.

The trip to Barcelona on Sunday one proved to one to forget for Real Madrid as they not only lost the game 4-3 and kissed goodbye to the La Liga title, they have also suffered some injury casualties.

Vinicius Jr. was one of the players who had to be taken off with a knock and now Real Madrid have officially confirmed that he has suffered an ankle injury.

“Following tests carried out today on our player Vinicius Jr. by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with a sprained left ankle. Pending evolution,” the statement from the club read.

This effectively rules Vinicius out of Wednesday night's La Liga encounter against RCD Mallorca while his availability for the weekend game vs. Sevilla is also unlikely. 

The Brazilian could come back for the final game of the season against Real Sociedad.

Meanwhile, Los Blancos have also announced that right-back Lucas Vazquez has also suffered an injury and is sidelined.

“Following tests carried out today on our player Lucas Vazquez by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with an injury to the left pectineus pectoris muscle. Pending evolution,” the statement from the club confirmed.

Like with Vinicius, Vazquez is also set to miss the Mallorca and Sevilla clashes but could come back for the final game of the league season vs Real Sociedad.

This leaves Real Madrid without yet another defender as they have already lost Antonio Rudiger, David Alaba, Ferland Mendy to injuries while Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao are also still not ready to return after lengthy layoffs.

With Aurelien Tchouameni suspended as well, it leaves outgoing manager Carlo Ancelotti with very few options in the defensive department to face Mallorca on Wednesday.

Xabi Alonso will begin work with Real Madrid in time for this summer's Club World Cup, several reports have claimed.

A three-year contract is on the table for Alonso, who confirmed his imminent departure from Bayer Leverkusen last week after Madrid agreed a compensation fee of between €5m-€10m (£4.2m-£8.4m). He will replace Carlo Ancelotti, who is expected to take charge of the Brazil national team.

It was initially expected that Alonso would only join Madrid after this summer's Club World Cup, with former manager Santiago Solari lined up to return to the dugout for the tournament, but Cadena COPE were the first to reveal that Alonso's arrival has now been brought forwards.

Tax issues were believed to be behind his delayed appointment but Madrid have pushed to bring Alonso over to Spain as soon as possible, and the former midfielder has now agreed to the club's demands.

MARCA state that the Madrid board are giving real importance to his summer's Club World Cup. The prestige of being the first-ever winner, coupled with the €150m (£126.3m) prize pot, have left Madrid determined to do whatever they can to take home the trophy, and it is accepted that they will have a better chance of winning under Alonso than Solari.

Alonso, for his part, is said to have preferred to watch the Club World Cup from a distance, wary of beginning his Madrid tenure with disappointment given the limited turnaround between this season's bitterly underwhelming campaign and this summer's tournament. However, he has agreed to join earlier than desired.

There is an international window at the start of June, after which Alonso will arrive in Spain and immediately get to work preparing for the tournament.

The Club World Cup starts on June 14, just four days after the international window closes. Madrid's tournament is due to kick off on June 18 in a group-stage clash with Al Hilal.

Xabi Alonso

José Luis Artús

Periodista

It appears there will be no interim coach for Real Madrid during the FIFA Club World Cup, which will be held in the United States from June 14 to July 13.

In recent days, amid growing speculation about the likely departure of Carlo Ancelotti, reports suggested that Santiago Solari would take charge of the team for the tournament, beating out fellow candidate Raúl González Blanco. 

However, new information has emerged indicating that Xabi Alonso, who recently bid farewell to Bayer Leverkusen, will instead assume the role.

Xabi Alonso

According to the Spanish newspaper Marca, “the decision for Alonso to lead the team in the U.S. tournament was made last week during a conversation in which the club gave the coach virtually no choice. ‘It all starts with the Club World Cup,' they told him.” 

Real Madrid reportedly believes it makes little sense to hire a new manager only to leave him sidelined while someone like Solari—with a minimal track record—takes charge of such a high-profile competition.

Journalist Siro López echoed this sentiment on Tiempo de Juego (Cadena COPE), stating: “On Friday, I was told there was a potential issue related to tax residency that might delay his official start until July 1. It had to do with the length of stay in Germany and related tax declarations.

Manchester City will take a blue kit to the Club World Cup, rebutting claims earlier this year that they would not wear the colours of their home shirt. City are known around the world for their sky blue shirts, yet reports indicated that Pep Guardiola and his side would instead wear different colours at the Club World Cup.

Ahead of the release of their new home kit on Tuesday, the club have now confirmed that it will be worn in the summer tournament before its use next season in all competitions. The Club World Cup is expected to mark the debut of the shirt for Guardiola's players ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.

While it is unclear which other shirts will be used at the Club World Cup, confirmation that City will have a blue shirt for at least some of the games should ease concerns sparked by the earlier controversial rumours.

With the revamping of the tournament, FIFA hope the eyes of the world will be on the United States for the tournament this summer and Blues were keen for the club to represent themselves in the colours that they are known for.

The club drew criticism earlier this season when Guardiola's team lined up for their Champions League game with Inter - the first of the new campaign and a rematch of the 2023 final - wearing the fourth kit.

Taking influence from an iconic Oasis album and designed with help by Noel Gallagher, use of the kit that wasn't predominantly blue for a home game at the Etihad did not go down well with many.

This is the first time in five years that a City home kit has not been worn to lift the Premier League title. For the first time since 2020, Liverpool have dethroned the Blues as champions.

City can still lift more silverware this season if they beat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup, but if Palace are the designated home team it is unlikely that the Blues will wear their blue shirts.

For the trip to Selhurst Park earlier this season, they wore the yellow-and-black kit inspired by their third-division play-off triumph in 1999.

City are in their third FA Cup Final in a row and are looking to put a disappointing season behind them by winning another FA Cup. That would also give them momentum for the Premier League as they look to clinch a top-five finish in their final two matches.

Brazil's soccer confederation said on Monday it has a deal with Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti eyeing the 2026 World Cup. 

The 65-year-old Ancelotti, who will be Brazil's first full-time foreign coach in a century, is still under contract with Madrid. The last round of the Spanish league will be on May 25 and the CBF said in a statement that he will officially take over Brazil the following day.

""Bringing Carlo Ancelotti to coach Brazil is more than a strategic movement. It is a statement to the world that we are determined to recover the top of the podium,"" CBF President Ednaldo Rodrigues said in a statement. ""He is the greatest coach in history and, now, he will be with the greatest national team on the planet. Together, we will write new glorious chapters of Brazilian soccer.""

Rodrigues said Ancelotti will take charge of Brazil's next two fixtures in South American World Cup qualifiying, with his debut at Ecuador on June 5th and five days later in front of home fans against Paraguay in Sao Paulo.

Ancelotti's contract with Madrid ends next year but is expected to be terminated early.

He will replace Dorival Júnior, who held the job for 14 months and was fired in March after a 4-1 defeat at Argentina. Brazil lags in 4th position in World Cup qualifying after 14 matches and has its 33-year-old star Neymar still in difficulties to return to top form after an ACL injury in 2023. The top six teams will secure direct spots in next year's tournament.

Bayer Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso, who'll be leaving the German club after this season, has been linked with the imminent opening at Madrid.

""This is the right moment to announce it,"" the 43-year-old Spanish coach said last week about his depature from Leverkusen. ""Clarity is good for everyone.""

Alonso, a former Madrid player, led Leverkusen to an unprecedented league and cup double last season after taking over the team when it was in the Bundesliga's relegation zone in October 2022.

The drinks giant will activate a portfolio of brands including Casamigos, Don Julio and Johnnie Walker across all 16 American host cities during the tournament. 



Diageo has been named the Official Spirits Supporter in North, Central and South America for the FIFA World Cup 2026, marking the first time the global drinks company has partnered with the tournament.

The agreement, announced on 8 May, covers the 16 host cities across Canada, Mexico and the United States where the competition will take place. Diageo will promote a selection of its flagship brands – including Casamigos, Don Julio, Buchanan's, Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff – as part of its tournament activation.

The move will see Diageo engage fans through a variety of marketing channels, with plans for on-the-ground activations and retail campaigns focused on what the company described as “responsible drinking and community celebration”.

Cristina Diezhandino, Diageo's chief marketing officer, said the company is “proud to deepen our partnership with sports by bringing our unmatched portfolio to toast the FIFA World Cup 26.”

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“Football is the world's biggest sport and with this tournament set to be the biggest in its history, we see this as a unique opportunity to celebrate with fans in new and meaningful ways,” she added. 

The partnership will focus on enhancing the fan experience while promoting responsible consumption. According to FIFA, the collaboration will involve “unparalleled experiences” for fans, though specifics around activations have yet to be disclosed.

Romy Gai, chief business officer at FIFA, said: “It's great to be teaming up with the global leader in spirits for the biggest celebration of football ever. Through this agreement, Diageo will create unparalleled experiences for the fans that promote responsible celebration on the world's biggest stage.”

Diageo's involvement in the World Cup continues its broader investment in sports marketing and live event engagement. The company has long supported sporting events globally, and this latest move extends its footprint across the Americas in what is expected to be the most commercially significant World Cup to date.

The World Cup 2026 will be the first edition of the tournament to feature 48 teams and be jointly hosted across three nations. Diageo will promote its partnership across the region throughout the build-up and duration of the event.

The Women's World Cup will expand from 32 to 48 teams from 2031 in the latest move by Fifa to extract extra revenue from the growth of the global women's game.

Qatar made history when they hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup, becoming the first Middle Eastern nation to stage the global showpiece. Saudi Arabia will follow in their footsteps in 2034. The Kingdom was confirmed as the next Gulf State to host the World Cup and the reaction has been mixed.

Since the World Cup in Qatar, there have been widespread conversations about ‘Growing the Game (GTG)'. The core of GTG is about expanding the footprint of the sport across the globe and making the football experience more enjoyable for everyone.

FIFA's decision to expand the World Cup format from 32 to 48 teams falls under the purview of the GTG initiative, and there are plans for further expansion in the future.

Not everyone is sold on the concept, and for good reason. But the initiative has made an impact across several facets of the sport, including the betting industry.

The 2034 edition in Saudi Arabia will open the door for more teams to prove they belong on the big stage, which paves the way for fresh betting markets to be introduced.

As evidenced by this 1xBet review for Arab players, wagering on football is hugely popular. When the World Cup is staged, sportsbooks are inundated with bets.

The idea behind GTG is to make football more inclusive, and it has the potential to draw an unprecedented number of new fans and bettors to the sport.

Expansion often comes with unpredictability. For many people in the betting community, that's gold. Read on as we discuss the long-term impact of GTG on football.

Taking the global showpiece to the Middle East did not go down well across all quarters. 

The tournament in Qatar was shrouded in controversy about several key issues, including alleged human rights violations – especially the treatment of migrant workers – and alcohol restrictions.

Despite the criticism, Qatar delivered an outstanding event. It had everything – smooth in execution, logistically sound and wildly unpredictable on the pitch.

Morocco made history by becoming the first African team to reach the World Cup semi-finals. Asian duo Japan and South Korea picked up famous wins against global powerhouses. 

Even though Argentina ended up winning the title, the 2022 World Cup was a breath of fresh air.

Saudi Arabia wants to be recognised as a football powerhouse, and hosting the most prestigious event in world football puts them one step closer to realising their ambitions.

They are pushing for FIFA to expand the tournament again. Saudi Arabia have made it clear they have what it takes to handle a 64-team tournament, and FIFA have not dismissed the idea.

South America's CONMEBOL has submitted an official proposal to FIFA, requesting to stage the 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal and Morocco with 64 teams rather than the newly implemented 48.

That idea has been strongly opposed by some other continental confederations, but FIFA are still mulling it over. 

It could expedite the GTG initiative, but it would not be the smartest move, especially at a time when the increasing workload on players is a hot topic.

Saudi Arabia will welcome a 64-team tournament. Minister of Sports Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal has already given the green light, but FIFA will make the final decision.

Meanwhile, the Kingdom is already in the crosshairs of rights organisations. When their hosting right for 2034 was confirmed, the decision was met with plenty of criticism.

The Saudis have invested heavily in sports over the last few years, but critics accuse the country of ‘sportswashing' its human rights record and using football to cover up social and political flaws.

The 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico will feature 48 teams. That is a substantial leap from the 32 that competed in Qatar. 

For FIFA, more teams mean more representation, more opportunity for smaller nations to participate and a greater chance to energise local development.

There is some truth to that. But there are other facets of the game that are getting lost. For one, the psychological effect of even more games on the fans and the players.

Players are already complaining about a jam-packed schedule that has increased the rate of injuries.

Allowing more nations into the party is great for the growth and numbers, but what happens after the music stops should also be considered in equal measure.

A 64-team tournament introduces logistical, environmental and scheduling challenges that could undercut the spirit of the event.

The Blaugrana all-but secured the title with Sunday's thrilling win as they exposed the gap between Spain's two biggest teams

Sure you fancy this, Xabi? After 90-plus minutes of breathless, controversial and utterly gripping football between Real Madrid and Barcelona, one thing is clear: whoever manages this Madrid team next has either got to be a madman, miracle-worker or masochist - and possibly a bit of all three.

Los Blancos and La Blaugrana played out a fourth wonderful contest of the campaign as Barca battered Madrid again and showed why they will run away with this La Liga title. With three games remaining after Sunday's 4-3 win, their lead stands at seven points. It is not inconceivable, then, that they win the league by double digits. That would hurt Madrid immensely, but it would be by no means an unfair reflection of the gap in quality between these two teams.

You just had to look at it. For 15 minutes, Madrid were in dreamland. Kylian Mbappe, who scored a hat-trick despite not playing that well bagged two early on, and the title race was back on. And then, reality set in, Barca started to play football, and it turned into something of a bloodbath.

Hansi Flick's side scored four goals in the first half without really breaking a sweat. Eric Garcia got the first off a set piece, Lamine Yamal added the next with another wonderful curled effort for his ever-growing catalogue of stunning goals, and Raphinha came up clutch again by netting two more incisive strikes off deadly counter-attacks.

Still, Madrid hung around. Mbappe completed his hat-trick in the second half while Vinicius Jr pulled off the magnificent feat of assisting his strike partner twice while also being totally anonymous in the scope of the game. Barca, though, had a fifth goal of their own VAR-d off and a decent penalty shout turned down; never has a one-goal win seemed so comprehensive.

Madrid cannot feel hard done by what is now almost certain to be a trophy-less campaign (unless you count the UEFA Super Cup or FIFA's Intercontinental Cup). Carlo Ancelotti is on the way out, and while it's not quite clear if he's jumping or being pushed, all parties seem pretty content with their parting of ways. Xabi Alonso, meanwhile, is the next man up, and he will walk into a club that has become pretty unstable.

Alonso will be able to call upon the most gifted attacking footballer in the world and others of varying degrees of brilliant who have no apparent connection to each other. Ancelotti - the coach with perhaps more gravitas than anyone in world football - could not manage this team in the end, so what makes Alonso think he can do the same? After all, the task in Madrid will not only be to catch this Barca team; he will also be expected to beat them, batter them, and establish supremacy in Spanish football once more.

As Sunday showed, not even three goals from one of the world's best can truly make that happen.

Álvaro Guillen Meza of Ecuador emerged victorious at the Santos Brasil Tennis Cup, an ATP Challenger 50 event, overcoming both bad weather and a determined Matheus Pucinelli in a rain-delayed final that had to be moved indoors. The tournament, played in Santos, Brazil, concluded late on Mother's Day Sunday after both semifinals and the championship match were played in a single day due to weather disruptions.The first semifinal saw Brazil's Matheus Pucinelli rally from behind in both sets to defeat experienced Argentine Nicolas Kicker, 7-5, 7-5. In the second semi, top-seeded Guillen Meza beat Uruguay's Franco Rocadelli 6-2, 7-6 (4). Gutillen Meza, ranked No. 216, had lost all three previous matches against Pucinelli, including one just the week before.Despite injuring his right thigh late in the semifinal, Pucinelli contested the final but struggled with mobility. Meza claimed the first set 6-3. In the second, the Brazilian showed heart and pushed the match into a tense tiebreak, where Meza missed four match points before finally sealing the victory 14-12 on his fifth.

Cerundolo – Ofner: 12.05.2025 14:00 CEST
H2H: 2-0

Francisco Cerundolo has won four of his last five matches. Last week in Madrid, Cerundolo lost in the semifinals against Ruud in tight straight sets. This week in Rome, Cerundolo won the opening match against Jarry in straight sets. Last season in Rome, Khachanov stopped him in the third round.

Sebastian Ofner has won four of his last five matches. This week in Rome, Ofner qualified for the main draw tournament by winning both qualifying matches in straight sets. The Austrian upset Tiafoe in three tight sets in the second main draw round.

According to the bookies, Cerundolo is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. The Argentine is in great form and one of the most consistent clay court players. On the other hand, Ofner is a Challenger Tour-level player, so we expect Cerundolo to win easily.

That being said, Cerundolo covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Francisco Cerundolo -4.5 games handicap @1.83 @bet365

Sinner – De Jong: 12.05.2025 15:00 CEST
H2H: 1-0

Jannik Sinner has won 25 straight matches. He is returning to competitive tennis after serving a three-month suspension related to anti-doping procedures. This week in Rome, Sinner easily won his opening-round match against Navone in straight sets.

Jesper de Jong has won three of his last five matches. This week in Rome, de Jong failed to qualify for the main draw tournament, losing against Seyboth Wild in the final. However, with several players withdrawing from the tournament, de Jong entered the main draw as a lucky loser. In the second main draw round, de Jong demolished Davidovich Fokina 6-0 6-2.

According to the bookies, Sinner is the big favourite in this matchup, and we partially agree. However, de Jong played incredibly well against Davidovich Fokina. We expect him to fight hard and keep this match tight.

That said, de Jong covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jesper de Jong +5.5 games handicap @1.91 @bet365

Munar – Korda: 12.05.2025 16:30 CEST
H2H: 0-1

Jaume Munar has lost three of his last five matches. This week in Rome, Munar demolished Shelton in the second round. The Spaniard lost against Norrie in the second round last season in Rome.

Sebastian Korda has won three of his last five matches. This week in Rome, the American defeated Vukic in the opening round in straight sets. Korda was great under pressure, saving seven out of seven breakpoints.

According to the bookies, Munar is the slight underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. He is a clay-court specialist and performed well against Shelton in the second round. On the other hand, Korda struggled with his form for the last couple of months. We expect Munar to be a better player and win.

That being said, Munar winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jaume Munar winning @2.20 @bet365

Four sets played, four sets won for Jannik Sinner on his return to Tour this week at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome.

The Italian earned victory in his first match for more than three months on Saturday against Mariano Navone and backed that up on Monday with another stable display against Dutch lucky loser Jesper de Jong, advancing 6-4, 6-2.



In front of a vocal Italian crowd on Campo Centrale, Sinner let slip a break advantage in the first set but responded quickly to move ahead. The World No. 1 then moved through the gears in the second set against De Jong, who injured his right wrist when slipping at 1-3, 40/15 in the second set.

Sinner helped De Jong to his feet before he passed the 24-year-old a towel. The World No. 93 received a medical timeout at 2-3, with his wrist heavily strapped. The Dutchman, who beat Joao Fonseca in Estoril last month, could continue but was heavily hampered, frequently shaking out his wrist between points.

""It was a completely different match from the first one, different conditions,"" Sinner said. ""I felt like I started the match very well and then I had a drop and he played a bit better. I tried to understand what was going on and fortunately I broke him at 4-4 again, which gave me confidence to continue. The second set went how it went. He injured himself. He is an amazing player and more of an amazing person and I wish him all the best and I hope it is nothing too serious.""






With his one-hour, 35-minute win, Sinner extended his winning streak to 23 matches and improved to 61-0 against players ranked outside the Top 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings since the start of the 2023 US Open.
Sinner moved fairly freely and struck the ball with clean timing in just his second match since winning his third major at the Australian Open in January. The top seed was aggressive on return, winning 71 per cent of points on De Jong's second serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats. He stood close to the baseline to dictate the key points and sealed victory on his first match point.
Into the fourth round in Rome for the fourth time, Sinner will next meet Francisco Cerundolo. The Argentine, a recent semi-finalist in Madrid, defeated Sebastian Ofner 6-2, 6-4. Cerundolo beat Sinner in the pair's previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting in Rome in 2023, with the series tied at 2-2 overall.

Jannik Sinner is one of the game's most ruthless competitors.

But the World No. 1 put his steely resolve to one side in the blink of an eye Monday in Rome when opponent Jesper de Jong took a heavy tumble on Campo Centrale midway through the second set of their third-round match at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.

Approaching the net on Sinner's backhand, de Jong tumbled heavily after appearing to lose his footing after stepping on the centre service line. His right wrist absorbed part of the impact.

 

Sinner immediately crossed the net to comfort the Dutchman as umpire Greg Allensworth quickly called for the phyiso. After a medical timeout, during which he had his wrist heavily strapped, De Jong returned to the court to play out the match.

De Jong received generous applause from Italian fans as he rose to his feet and headed to his courtside chair for treatment. The full extent of the injury is unknown at this time.

Alvaro Guillen Meza battled through adversity to capture his third ATP Challenger Tour title on Sunday at the Santos Brasil Tennis Cup.


Rain forced the Ecuadorian to play both his semi-final and final matches on the same day, which included a move to indoor clay courts. Undeterred, Guillen Meza held firm to defeat Brazilian Matheus Pucinelli De Almeida 6-3, 7-6(12) in the championship match.

Having saved six set points in the second set, Guillen Meza avenged last week's loss to Pucinelli De Almeida at the Porto Alegre Challenger.

ROME, Italy—Naomi Osaka's eight-match winning streak—her longest ever on clay courts—ended Monday at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, the former world No. 1 enduring a narrow loss to Peyton Stearns,6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (4).“I think Peyton played very well,” Osaka said in an interview given through the WTA Tour's communications team. “It was a physical match and maybe the consecutive matches caught up to me a bit. Going to rest for a bit and reset for Roland Garros.”Osaka, who won her first title since becoming a mother eight days ago at a WTA 125K in Saint-Malo, led Stearns a mini-break in the final-set tiebreaker before losing the final five points of the match.

Osaka won back-to-back three-setters earlier this week in Rome, coming up just short against an in-form Stearns on Monday.

“I feel much more confident on clay,” said Osaka, who reached the fourth round at the Foro Italico for a second consecutive year. “Winning my first clay title and winning some tough matches helps instill some confidence ahead of Roland Garros.”The four-time Grand Slam champion, who won back-to-back three-setters earlier this week against Viktorija Golubic and Marie Bouzkova, will next head to Roland Garros, where she played one of the best matches of the 2024 season last year against then-No. 1 Iga Swiatek.Osaka held a match point on Swiatek in the second-round of what became a thrilling three-set clash before Swiatek came back, going on to win a third straight title on the terre battue.“I won the most consecutive matches on clay in my entire career so that's definitely something to be proud of.

The world's finest players have rolled into Rome, hoping to gain momentum and glory ahead of a trip to Paris.

The Road to Roland-Garros 2025 has taken a picturesque stop in The Eternal City.

That's right, the Italian capital Rome is the stunning setting for the latest action with the Parisian Grand Slam's main draw launching into action on May 25. Here are the key talking points so far…

By her own ultra-dominant, steamrolling standards, reigning Roland-Garros champion Iga Swiatek is well below her majestic best on her cherished clay.

The shot-making has appeared erratic at times, the serve is off kilter, the five-time major winner posted a Stuttgart quarter-final, prior to a 6-1, 6-1 Madrid semi-final defeat at the hands of Coco Gauff.

On Saturday, three-time Rome winner Swiatek's undulating season took another turn in a 6-1, 7-5 dismissal at the hands of No.29 seed Danielle Collins. The American was simply fearless, striking 32 winners to snatch away six breaks of serve to book an enticing Last 16 duel with Elina Svitolina.

For Swiatek, an astonishing run of 26 consecutive Round of 16s at this WTA 1000 level came to a halt, going all the way back to Cincinnati 2021.

A ninth loss of the season equalled the total defeats of Swiatek's whole 2024. Something isn't clicking for this supreme force.

“This year I feel like I'm struggling a bit more with my perfectionism,” admitted Swiatek. “I want to for sure focus on being disciplined on the court and making right choices, not the choices that sometimes pop out in my head, but being really solid.""

The 23-year-old appeared downbeat on her chances to land a fifth Roland-Garros triumph next month. 

“Obviously it would be stupid to expect a lot because I'm not able to play my game right now,” suggested Swiatek, following her loss to Collins.

“I think I just wasn't present to fight and to compete,” she said. “I focused on mistakes and it's my mistake and I'm not doing things right. The focus is on the wrong things from my side and I'll try to change it.”

'Ole, ole, ole, ole, Sinner, Sinner' chants are booming out once again.

The Italian talisman enjoyed a hero's welcome on home soil at the Foro Italico, slotting back into devastating form with a 6-3, 6-4 victory against Mariano Navone for his 22nd successive win on tour.

The world No.1 is competing for the first time since lifting the Australian Open in January.

“It's an amazing feeling,” said Jannik Sinner. “I waited quite long for this moment. I'm very happy to be back. It's very difficult to have the right feedback when you don't have any matches, and that's exactly what I need.

“The whole match, even when it seemed quite comfortable, it was a rollercoaster.

“Especially inside we felt that. I would say especially the beginning of the match having, again, the nerves of serving for the first time, trying to move in the best possible way you can… I love the competition. That's what I was looking for. Today I felt quite good on court. I'm happy about that, so hopefully of course we are aiming for small improvements which are the small details that can make the difference.""

The top seed advances to tackle Dutchman Jesper de Jong on Campo Centrale on Monday afternoon.

With the defending champion Swiatek out, world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff lead the charge for five Top 10 talents still involved in the WTA ranks.

Sabalenka bounced back for 6-3 in the decider against Sofia Kenin to chalk up a blockbuster bout with Marta Kostyuk. A few weeks ago in Madrid, the world No.1 edged Kostyuk 7-6(4), 7-6(7) in a pulsating match en route to the trophy lift.

As for Gauff, the No.4 seed has the challenge presented by Emma Raducanu, who overcome Veronika Kudermetova 5-7, 6-0, 6-1.

Home hero Jasmine Paolini is enjoying her finest Rome run and will be wary of Roland-Garros 2017 champion Jelena Ostapenko's firepower.

Also in a packed Monday schedule, world No.7 Mirra Andreeva and Clara Tauson will meet for the third time this year. Andreeva prevailed in two WTA 1000 encounters on the way to lifting the title at both Dubai and Indian Wells. However, Tauson is seriously dangerous, having sent out a signal of intent with a 3-6, 6-0, 6-4 comeback over world No.10 Emma Navarro.

It's a welcome sign to see US Open 2019 champion Bianca Andreescu back in the mix. Can she topple No.8 seed Zheng Qinwen?

Roland-Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz is well within the trophy hunt in Rome. The world No.3 dazzled with some human highlight reel tennis on Sunday during a 7-6(2), 6-2 passage past Laslo Djere.

The Spaniard seemed to be moving freely after an abductor injury prevented his participation in Madrid.

Into the Rome Last 16 for the first time, Alcaraz can complete the set of the nine Masters 1000 quarter-finals should he remain undefeated versus Karen Khachanov (4-0).  

Reigning Rome champion Alexander Zverev raced into the Last 16 by taking out qualifier Vilius Gaubus 6-4, 6-0 and will go toe-to-toe with France's Arthur Fils in a box office battle.

In Monday's night session, expect a raucous home crowd to cheer on Matteo Berrettini against Madrid winner Casper Ruud.

French No.1 Fils is proving his credentials at the very top once again in the Italian capital.

The 20-year-old, competing at a career-high world No.14, extended his record to 4-0 facing Stefanos Tsitsipas with a compelling 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 scoreboard on Sunday. In doing so, Fils adds to his Masters 1000 quarter-finals ventures at Indian Wells, Miami and Monte-Carlo. Can he add a fourth facing Zverev to truly lay down a marker for Roland-Garros?

It took three hours and 45 minutes, on his fourth match point, but Corentin Moutet bolstered the French contingent in Rome with an absorbing 7-5, 5-7, 7-6(4) triumph over Holger Rune for a maiden Top 10 victory.

Moutet will need to whip up another electric atmosphere up against world No.5 Jack Draper in the Last 16.","{'href': 'https://www.rolandgarros.com', 'title': 'Roland-Garros'}","tennis"

Former US Open champion Emma Raducanu is has gained direct entry to the Roland Garros qualifying list, which is based on the WTA rankings as of 29 April.

Raducanu's quarterfinal run in Stuttgart two weeks ago boosted the Briton to her current No.221 position, making her the last direct entrant to the qualifying competition, which starts on 20 May.

Raducanu has also used her special ranking of No.103, granted after she was sidelined for eight months due to injury, to enter the main draw list as an alternate. She is currently five places outside direct entry. 

No.94-ranked Julia Riera, the 2023 Rabat semifinalist, tops the qualifying list. Also entered are 2012 finalist Sara Errani and fast-rising teenagers Sara Bejlek and Robin Montgomery, who both delivered eye-catching results in Madrid this week. Bejlek reached the fourth round as a qualifier, while Montgomery pushed defending champion Aryna Sabalenka to a tight third set in the third round.

Five players have used special rankings to enter the qualifying draw: Mirjam Bjorklund (No.145), Tara Wurth (No.174), 2021 girls' doubles champion Oksana Selekhmeteva (No.190), Paula Ormaechea (No.193) and 2021 Wimbledon girls' finalist Nastasja Schunk (No.210).

Six players currently ranked between Riera and Raducanu have already gained entry to the main draw via either their rankings as of 15 April, or special rankings: Paula Badosa, Emina Bektas, Irina-Camelia Begu, Julia Grabher, Naomi Osaka and Bianca Andreescu.

Four more players have not entered the qualifying draw and will thus not compete at Roland Garros unless awarded a wild card: former World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki, Camila Giorgi, Storm Hunter and Alina Korneeva. Former doubles No.1 Hunter suffered an Achilles injury last month, while last year's junior champion Korneeva recently underwent wrist surgery.

The next 15 alternates in case of withdrawals are as follows:

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has finished serving a three-month suspension after testing positive for a trace amount of the banned substance Clostebol, quickly winning the Italian Open in his return. But the French Open will mark the tennis superstar's first Grand Slam event since returning to action. We aggregated the best French Open results of top players who faced public drug suspensions to see how their careers changed after the time away from the court. 

As of today, no tennis player has come back from it and won the French Open. Will Sinner be the first?

Relative to players who have previously served drug suspensions, Sinner is uniquely well positioned to win a French Open title at some point in his post-suspension career. Sinner's only 23 years old and had a firm enough grasp on the No. 1 ranking at the time of his suspension that the three-month ban didn't knock him out of the top spot. All three of his Grand Slam titles to date have come on hard courts, but the big-hitting Italian's style works well on all surfaces, and he reached the French Open semifinals last year.

Martina Hingis, Maria Sharapova and Simona Halep were all multi-time Grand Slam champions and former world No. 1 women's tennis players who were handed drug suspensions, but they were past their respective primes when suspended. Sharapova reached the quarterfinals in her lone subsequent French Open appearance, while neither Hingis nor Halep played Roland-Garros again post-suspension. Halep, who was suspended in 2023, won the French Open in 2018 while being coached by Darren Cahill, who currently coaches Sinner.

The player that has come the closest to winning the French Open after serving a drug suspension was Guillermo Coria, who tested positive for the steroid nandrolone in 2001 and subsequently reached the 2004 French Open final. He was heavily favored in that match but choked away a two-set lead against Argentinian compatriot Gaston Gaudio. Rafael Nadal then began his stretch of 14 French Open titles in 18 years in 2005, blocking Coria and most of the ATP Tour.

Reigning French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz could become this generation's Nadal, but Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka still managed to sneak in Roland Garros titles during the King of Clay's reign, so Sinner certainly seems more likely than not to get one eventually. 

He may not have to wait long as the oddsmakers' second-favorite at the 2025 French Open behind Alcaraz, but there's actually a player with a higher likelihood than Sinner of becoming the first player to win Roland-Garros post-suspension this year. Iga Swiatek, who served a one-month suspension in November 2024 after a positive test for the banned substance trimetazidine, is the clear favorite on the women's side as she angles for a French Open four-peat.

For almost two decades, Roland Garros has been Rafael Nadal's kingdom. The Spaniard's name has become synonymous with the clay courts of Paris, where year after year, he delivered some of the most awe-inspiring performances in tennis history. But with Nadal's retirement from the sport in 2024, a sense of finality has settled over the tournament. Roland Garros will go on—but it will never be the same.

The King of Clay's Unmatched Reign

Nadal's achievements at the French Open are unmatched in tennis and arguably in all of sport. He lifted the Coupe des Mousquetaires 14 times, boasting an almost surreal record of 112 wins and just 3 losses at the tournament. These numbers aren't just records—they are monuments to sustained brilliance, built year by year on the back of physical intensity, mental strength, and pure willpower.

No other player has dominated a single Grand Slam the way Nadal has at Roland Garros. His first win in 2005, as a 19-year-old, was just the beginning of a love affair between the Spaniard and the red clay of Paris. Whether it was outlasting Novak Djokovic in brutal five-setters or dismantling top seeds in straight sets, Nadal always found a way to rise, no matter the challenge.

For this year's Roland Garros, you will be able to keep up to date with all the upcoming tennis matches  on the stevegtennis site, so you don't miss any action when it comes to the big showdowns.

More Than a Champion

What made Nadal's presence so special wasn't just the titles—it was how he won them. With every forehand winner, every sliding backhand, and every fist-pump to the roaring crowd, he brought drama, grit, and heart to the court. He played each point like it was his last, turning even routine matches into emotional epics.

The crowd responded in kind. French fans, known for being passionate and demanding, embraced Nadal as one of their own. His humility, sportsmanship, and relentless determination endeared him to Parisians. It was not just about a Spaniard winning in France—it was about a warrior who gave everything to the sport, every single time he stepped onto Court Philippe-Chatrier.

A Farewell That Hit Hard

When Nadal walked onto the court for his first-round match against Alexander Zverev in the 2024 edition of Roland Garros, there was a palpable sense that history was turning a page. Despite his best efforts, Nadal fell in straight sets. For the first time, he exited in the opening round of a tournament he once ruled.

That match marked not just the end of a run—it marked the end of an era. Fans and players alike were emotional, understanding the weight of what they had just witnessed. The King of Clay had played his final match at the place he ruled for 19 unforgettable years.

Rafael Nadal's Unbreakable Records at Roland Garros

Rafael Nadal's reign at Roland Garros is not just impressive—it's historic. His legacy on the clay courts of Paris stands unmatched, and these records are a testament to his sheer dominance:

The Void He Leaves Behind

Nadal's absence from Roland Garros is not merely the loss of a tennis legend—it's the loss of a heartbeat. His annual presence provided a sense of rhythm to the clay season, a narrative thread that tied each year's tournament together. Without him, the tournament may feel unfamiliar, even to the most seasoned followers of the game.

The draw will still be filled with stars. The courts will still see dramatic battles. New champions will rise. But that unique electricity that came with “Nadal on Chatrier” will be missing. The chants of “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” echoing across the court will live on only in memory. 

However, there will still be big match-ups between the current and upcoming stars of the game like Sinner, Alcaraz, Zverev, Ruud, Draper and you will be able to follow all the daily matchstat tennis predictions that will help you to determine the outcome of each match.

Legacy Beyond Numbers

While others will continue to chase trophies and records, Nadal's impact goes far beyond statistics. He has redefined what it means to fight, to persevere, and to compete with honor. His influence will be seen in the playing styles, attitudes, and mindsets of the next generation of tennis players—many of whom grew up idolizing him.

Future champions will emerge, and they may even break records. But what Nadal brought to Roland Garros—a sense of history, of gladiatorial struggle, of poetic triumph—cannot be replicated.

The End of an Era, But Not the End of a Legacy

Roland Garros will go on without Rafael Nadal. The tournament will adapt, evolve, and continue to thrill. But it will never feel quite the same. The court he made his own, the battles he fought, the tears he shed—they are now part of the soul of the tournament.

As the years go by, new stories will be written on the Parisian clay. But Nadal's chapter will remain the most enduring. Not just as a record-holder, but as the heart and soul of Roland Garros.

And for fans, no matter who lifts the trophy in the future, there will always be a quiet whisper among the crowds: This is where Rafa once reigned.

Emma Raducanu's improving form has continued this week as she now takes on world No. 2 Coco Gauff in the last 16 of the Italian Open on Monday.

Raducanu's career on the court has been beset by problems since becoming an overnight superstar in 2021 with a stunning US Open title win from nowhere. Numerous coaches have come and gone, while she has also been a victim of unwanted attention from a fan and has faced criticism for losing focus on the sport after becoming a big celebrity.

Her personal life, romantic relationships, and a Wimbledon controversy have all been under the spotlight, but she has someone close to her to support her through it all.

There has been speculation surrounding Raducanu's connections with tennis peers, such as a possible romance with Carlos Alcaraz, but it is her close bond with fellow Brit Jack Draper that has caught the eye.

Their connection is said to be purely platonic but there's no doubt they care for each other greatly, given what they have both said.

The British duo were born just a year apart and have come through the ranks together and formed a close friendship over the years, supporting each other away from the court.

Draper has said of Raducanu: ""She has always been there for me and I have always been there for her. She's very kind, very thoughtful, always giggling, really smart. A really, really good girl.""

He added of her famous US Open triumph: ""What Emma did was obviously incredibly inspiring. I've known her from a young age, and to see what she did was incredible.

“I was very proud of her, very excited. Obviously, we've watched the likes of Andy Murray winning a Grand Slam from Great Britain, but her winning, it was just really a fairy-tale run.

“I definitely think as a competitor, it fuelled my fire. I really wanted to achieve what she'd done, winning a Grand Slam. At the same time I do understand that the men's and the women's, it is different. We're playing five sets. It's a different physical challenge and all these types of things. [But] I learned a lot from watching Emma win, that run, and how amazing she was.”

Following Draper's recent move into the world's top five, Raducanu returned the compliment, saying: “It's amazing to see what he's achieved and how much he's done. I know he's a great tennis player and he [has] such a big stature that he can take the game out of anyone's hands. For him to kind of dominate like he has been is really cool to see.”



The tennis circuit was abuzz with rumours last year after Romeo Beckham was spotted at Wimbledon watching Raducanu, sparking speculation about their relationship following her recent split from her boyfriend.

As Emma Raducanu glided to a straight-sets triumph over Elise Mertens in round two, the glare of the spotlight wasn't reserved solely for her. Romeo Beckham, David and Victoria's second son, caught the attention of many, with the company of friends and ex-Germany player Sami Khedira in the stands.

The 22 year old former Brentford footballer, whose passion for tennis is well-known – marked notably by his training stint with Andy Murray – unwittingly turned heads at the match. The Beckhams' fondness for Raducanu isn't hushed news; indeed, David Beckham was glimpsed alongside his mum, Sandra, ensconced in Wimbledon's prestigious Royal Box, as they cheered on the burgeoning tennis sensation.

While Romeo's attendance could simply stem from admiration for Raducanu, it did stir up chatter and speculative buzz, especially after he posted an Instagram snap of Raducanu mid-game, adorned with heart emojis.

But for Raducanu, Romeo's presence was taken in stride. She commented: ""I mean, I think he's, yeah, he's really cool,"" recognising her esteem for the Beckham name and the influence David Beckham has had on British sport.

The tennis star previously parted ways with Carlo Agostinelli, an aspiring footballer who briefly played for Tottenham Hotspur before joining Stanford University's team. He is the son of billionaire Robert Agostinelli.

Raducanu and Agostinelli's split came after the pair started dating around May 2023, appearing together at several events such as the Dior 2024 Cruise show in Mexico. They were last spotted together at Paris Fashion Week.

The breakup seemed confirmed when Raducanu unfollowed her ex on social media ahead of Wimbledon.

The young tennis star reportedly caused a stir at Wimbledon's All England Club last year by allegedly breaking a dress code that has been in place for 150 years. She was accused of ""arrogance"" for reportedly ignoring the club's strict all-white attire rule, which applies to both matches and practice sessions at SW19, as well as the main Grand Slam event in the summer.

According to the Daily Mail, Raducanu was practising on the courts in ""whatever she wants"", much to the annoyance of some club members.

The All England Club's strict dress code, dating back to the 1880s, demands players don ""suitable tennis attire that is almost entirely white"" upon entering the court. Despite a 2023 amendment allowing women to wear dark undershorts for menstrual concerns, the rules are still tight, reports Wales Online.

White attire must not be off-white or cream, and only a trim of a single colour up to 10mm is allowed on necklines or sleeve cuffs.

Yet, Raducanu reportedly turned heads by arriving in a pink outfit, leading to a member's complaint to the Mail: ""It's so unfair. Who does she think she is? Just because she's won the US Open doesn't mean she can wear whatever she wants.""

Raducanu isn't alone in causing a stir over dress code; Nick Kyrgios made waves in 2022 with his red Nike Jordan shoes and cap, although he switched to white gear later.

Even Roger Federer faced criticism for sporting orange-soled shoes at the prestigious venue.

The 22 year old's remarkable triumph at the 2021 US Open propelled her to global stardom, turning her from an unknown teenage qualifier into the fresh face of British tennis overnight. Her historic victory shattered several records as she became the first ever qualifier to clinch a Grand Slam title and the first British woman to do so since Virginia Wade's Wimbledon success in 1977.

At a tender age of 18, she was also the youngest Grand Slam champion since Maria Sharapova in 2004. Naturally, securing that title dramatically altered Raducanu's life, as she swiftly graced the cover of every newspaper and magazine, was crowned the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year and even received an MBE for her contributions to tennis.

Endorsement deals rapidly followed, and she soon became a brand ambassador for luxury brands such as Dior, Tiffany and Porsche, as well as corporations like HSBC, Vodafone and British Airways. Raducanu has also inked contracts with Nike, Wilson and Evian, while she has starred in adverts for Sports Direct too.

All of this means that, besides her career earnings which currently sit at just over £3 million, Raducanu is reported to have an impressive net worth. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, it is estimated to be around £10 million, with Forbes last year ranking her as the sixth highest-paid tennis player globally.

The British sensation is teetering on the edge of an even more lucrative horizon, as insiders project that with a repeat of her 2021 triumphs, she might surpass an eye-watering £100 million in wealth. A prominent sports agent conveyed to MailOnline, ""She can easily earn £100 million or more. The sky's the limit.""

Coco Gauff and Emma Raducanu share one important thing. 

They are both US Open champions and importantly they were both major winners as teenagers so it comes as no surprise that the pair have a lot of advice to give each other.

Back when Raducanu was the freshly crowned US Open champion in 2021, Gauff was quick to warn the Brit that the best thing she can do is ignore the hype. 

""The best thing I could [say], and I'm sure she's probably heard it, is to set time aside from the phone,"" Gauff said at the time.

""Because it is exciting when you get all the retweets, all the follows and all of that, but it can be a bit overwhelming. At least in my experience. That's probably what I wish I would've known, not to focus on social media.

""I put a time limit on my phone because I thought I was spending too much time on it,"" she said. ""From 8.30 am to 9.30 pm I have limited access to apps.""

Since then, Gauff has joined Raducanu as a US Open winner, when she won her first major in 2023. 

Fast forward to 2025, despite the pair having their crowning moments in New York that's about it when it comes to the similarities in their tennis journeys. 

Gauff is ranked 46 spots higher then Raducanu and  has enjoyed a steady and stable progress on the tour, the American was just recently the World No.2 and now sits third. 

Raducanu's US Open championship is her only title, with her time on tour since that being savaged by injuries with very little momentum being established. 

Meanwhile, Gauff has won ten titles, her most recent one came at the WTA Finals in Riyadh in November.

Gauff's successful career so far has meant she has earned $23.8 million on tour so far while Raducanu has picked up just $4.9 million, a big difference which demonstrates little competition the Brit has played in recent years.

So much so that despite the two young stars have only met once on tour, a 2023 Australian Open clash which Gauff came out victorious. 

It was a game that Raducanu had an ample opportunity to win, with a 5-4 lead in the first set.

However, she failed to see her out two set points and Gauff rallied to make a comeback, winning the tie break before winning the second set and match. 

Ahead of just their second match at the Rome Open, fourth seed Gauff was full of praise for an opponent she has barely played.

“She's obviously a great player and the last time we played, it was a tough match,” the world No 3 told Tennis Channel.

“It's going to be a different matchup on clay here, but I think she has the game to be a great clay-court player.

“Obviously, a great player in general, but especially on clay. So it's going to be a tough match and I'm looking forward to it and hopefully I can come out with the win.”

Raducanu returned the complaints, pointing out how good she is on clay. 

“She is a great competitor. I think I'm playing pretty good tennis right now and she is going to be a great test,” the 22-year-old Brit told Sky Sports.

“She's made the final of the French Open and so she's great on this surface. I'm just going to keep focused but savour this one for now.”

Should Raducanu play at her very best, her clean-hitting and pace from both sides of the court should make Gauff uncomfortable. 

However, even then Gauff is a very good defender and incredibly quick on this surface, something Raducanu may struggle to cope with.

It would be a huge upset, should Raducanu eliminate Gauff.

The US Open winner and Philippines rising star did not know each other personally before the Italian Open, but one message on Instagram changed that.

Looking for a way to team up with USA's tennis ace Coco Gauff? Try sending her a direct message on Instagram.

That is what the Philippines' rising star Alexandra Eala did to pin Gauff as her doubles partner at the Italian Open in Rome.

“She slid in my DMs and asked me to play. And I was like, 'Sure. Why not?'” Gauff said while speaking to the media in the mixed zone.

Gauff had not met Eala before teaming up with the 19-year-old in the Italian capital. The two previously only exchanged a passing greeting at the Madrid Open in late April. World No. 3 Gauff advanced to the final of that tournament while Eala fell to Poland's Iga Swiatek in the Round of 64.

""We did not know each other at all, really,"" Gauff said. ""Before in Madrid, I said ‘Hi' to her for the first time.""

While Gauff did not know Eala well, the Filipina player's impressive junior record in doubles spoke for itself and the USA star was eager to team up with her.

“She's a killer in doubles — two junior slams, and probably future ones too,” Gauff said. “I'm super happy to play with her.”

The duo secured a two-set victory over Alexandra Panova and Fanny Stollar in the Round of 32 (6-3, 6-1) at the Italian Open and will next face a home pair, Tyra Grant and Lisa Pigato on Tuesday (13 May).

Gauff advanced to the women's singles quarter-final after beating Great Britain's Emma Raducanu on Monday, while Eala exited the singles tournament in the first round following a defeat to Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk.

Destanee Aiava or Victoria and Tristan Schoolkate or Western Australia have been awarded wildcards into the main draw of Roland Garros, recognising their promising performances over the past year and their potential to make their mark on the clay courts of Paris, writes Tennis Australia.

Aiava, currently ranked world No.157, qualified for the 2024 US Open and Australian Open 2025 – two Grand Slam breakthroughs that showcased her growing confidence and composure on the big stage.

In New York she faced world No.4 Elena Rybakina in the first round, gaining valuable experience at the elite level, and backing up her qualifying feats at the AO where she defeated Belgium's Greet Minnen in the opening round.

“I'm so happy, honestly. I was not expecting it at all,” Aiava said on this week's episode of The Sit-Down podcast.

“I literally had just lost my match last week; it was a really tight match and I was crying. And I was just like laying down, you know, wallowing in my sadness, and then I got a call from Sam [Stosur], and I was like, oh, why is she calling me? (laughter).

“She said ‘I hope this cheers you up, to offer you the French wildcard'. And I was like, excuse me? I had to look around to make sure like this was real life.

“I was just really happy, I was over the moon. Honestly it's so special and I don't think it's sunk in yet, but I'm training on the clay and trying to prepare as best I can.

“There's always something good around the corner, I guess, in this sport.”

At 24 years old and ranked No.129, Schoolkate has enjoyed a career-best 12 months.

He captured his first ATP Challenger title at the 2024 Guangzhou International Challenger, defeating fellow Australian Adam Walton in a hard-fought final.

Schoolkate later made headlines at Australian Open 2025 by taking the first set against No.1 Jannik Sinner, demonstrating his potential to challenge top-tier players.

“Thank you to Tennis Australia for this incredible opportunity,” Schoolkate said. “My team and I have been putting in the work every day, always striving to reach new heights.

“I'm excited for the chance to compete against the world's best on the clay in Paris.”

Aiava and Schoolkate bring the Australian contingent in Roland Garros singles to 15, all aiming to make a significant impact at the second Grand Slam of the season.

Main-draw action begins in Paris on Sunday 25 May.

Nine's Wide World of Sports

Up-and-coming Australian tennis players Destanee Aiava and Tristan Schoolkate have been awarded wildcard entries into the main draw of Roland-Garros.

The pair are among eight wildcards awarded on each side of the singles draw through a reciprocal wildcard exchange with the French Tennis Federation, United States Tennis Association (USTA) and Tennis Australia.

Rising stars Iva Jovic and Emilio Nava received wildcard entries from the USTA last week after winning the governing body's wildcard challenge.

Aiava, ranked world No.157 and Schoolkate, ranked world No.129, will now have the opportunity to make their mark on the clay courts of Paris after winning their respective first main draw matches at the Australian Open earlier this year.

Schoolkate was also awarded a wildcard entry from Tennis Australia for his home slam.

Aiava progressed through the qualifying rounds to contest the 2024 US Open and 2025 Australian Open, building a following around her vintage tennis outfits.

The Melbourne product defeated Belgian Greet Minnen before succumbing to the 10th-seeded American Daniel Collins in the next round.

Having played in qualifying at Roland-Garros last year after six years of not making the cut, Aiava will make her debut at the year's second grand slam tournament.

""I'm so happy, honestly. I was not expecting it at all,"" Aiava told Tennis Australia's The Sit-Down podcast.

""I literally had just lost my match last week; it was a really tight match and I was crying. And I was just like lying down, you know, wallowing in my sadness, and then I got a call from Sam [Stosur], and I was like, 'oh, why is she calling me?'.

""There's always something good around the corner, I guess, in this sport.""

For Schoolkate, the invitation is recognition for his career-best 12 months.

The 24-year-old won his first ATP Challenger Tour title at the 2024 Guangzhou International Challenger last May, defeating countryman Adam Walton in the final.

At Melbourne Park, Schoolkate made headlines when he took the first set off reigning Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner before going down in four sets.

He earlier toppled Japanese player Taro Daniel in the first round for a second career grand slam victory. Remarkably, his maiden win at the 2024 US Open was also against Daniel.

""My team and I have been putting in the work every day, always striving to reach new heights,"" Schoolkate said in a statement.

""I'm excited for the chance to compete against the world's best on the clay in Paris.""

Aiava and Schoolkate's announcement as wildcards brings the Aussie singles contingent to 15.

Eight men and five women will represent Australia, headlined by top-ranked national men's player Alex de Minaur and fresh Australian patriot Daria Kasatkina.

A further 12 Australians — four men and eight women —are also entered into the qualifying events with the hope of winning through to the main draw.

Main draw action begins on Sunday, May 25 at Stade Roland Garros.

Alvaro Guillen Meza battled through adversity to capture his third ATP Challenger Tour title on Sunday at the Santos Brasil Tennis Cup.


Rain forced the Ecuadorian to play both his semi-final and final matches on the same day, which included a move to indoor clay courts. Undeterred, Guillen Meza held firm to defeat Brazilian Matheus Pucinelli De Almeida 6-3, 7-6(12) in the championship match.

Having saved six set points in the second set, Guillen Meza avenged last week's loss to Pucinelli De Almeida at the Porto Alegre Challenger.


Following his title run, the 22-year-old is up to No. 175 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, setting him up for a new career high.




In other Challenger action, Francesco Maestrelli and Sun Fajing lifted trophies on home soil. 


Maestrelli, a wild card at the Abruzzo Open Francavilla Al Mare, saved two match points in the quarter-finals against Dominic Stricker before the Swiss retired due to injury. The 22-year-old Maestrelli rode that comeback momentum to the finish line, defeating Valentin Vacherot 6-4, 6-4 in the final to secure his second Challenger title and first since July 2022.

Jasmine Paolini vs. Jelena OstapenkoThe Italian and the Latvian bring very different energies to the court, and to their games. Paolini is the smiling speedster with the whippy topspin strokes. Ostapenko is the woman of many expressions who never saw a call she couldn't question, and who crunches every ball she sees as hard and flat as possible.They've played twice at the WTA level, and Ostapenko has won both times; earlier this year in Doha, she beat her handily, 6-2, 6-2. If Ostapenko's shots are clicking, she'll have the advantage over Paolini when it comes to pace every time. But as her 13-10 record on the season shows, her shots are not always clicking.Both of these players have been in form of late. Ostapenko beat Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka back to back to win Stuttgart, while Paolini has reached a couple of significant semifinals. Ostapenko is a Roland Garros champion, but this time the surface, and the pro-Italian crowd, may be to Paolini's advantage. Winner: Paolini

Coco Gauff vs. Emma RaducanuGauff and Raducanu are former US Open champions who are still surprisingly young—the Brit is 22, the American 21. They're also the best-known tennis players from their respective nations. But they've only met once, at the Australian Open in 2023, and Gauff came away a winner in two competitive sets.While Gauff is ranked 46 spots higher, both are playing promising tennis at the moment. Coco just made the Madrid final; Raducanu was a quarterfinalist in Miami, and has three wins on the week in Rome. On a good day, Raducanu's clean hitting and easy pace from both sides could make life difficult for Gauff.

Casper Ruud vs. Matteo BerrettiniThree or four years ago, Ruud and Berrettini looked like they might be meeting in Grand Slam finals by now. Ruud reached three of them in 2022 and 2023, while Berrettini made one in 2021. But their progress has stalled since, Berrettini from injury, Ruud from surprising inconsistency and burnout. They haven't faced off in any round since 2023. Now Berrettini is (relatively) healthy physically, Ruud is healthy mentally, and they'll open the night session on Monday. If their 2020 clash in Rome, which went to a third-set tiebreaker, is any indication, this could be a good one.

Ruud won that match, and he leads Berrettini 4-3 overall, and 3-1 on clay. Ruud will have momentum from his recent title in Madrid, while Berrettini will use the crowd to create his own positive energy. Ruud is the better clay-courter, but will he be tired from Madrid, and from a three-set win over Alexander Bublik in his opener? Berrettini has the skills to take advantage of a letdown, and he'll surely want to make his first appearance in front of the home folks in Rome since 2021 last as long as it can.

Racquet: Yonex VCORE 100 ($279)The VCORE 100 fuses easy spin production with ready power. With its thick, variable beam it's the type of racquet that energizes strokes without the need for a lot of extra work. For this latest update—the seventh generation of the franchise—the upper hoop has been widened at the 2- and 10-o'clock positions to increase the sweet spot and forgiveness, which also results in more spacing of the main strings. Along with the new silicone-infused grommets, this affords added string movement and snapback for increased spin potential. A softer flex than previous versions gives the frame a plusher response and improved command, and yet, it still maintains respectable stability for its weight.While probably most effective on the baseline, it has enough feel for specialty and touch shots and all-court play, making it more versatile than the typical grip-and-rip model.

In the second semi, top-seeded Guillen Meza beat Uruguay's Franco Rocadelli 6-2, 7-6 (4). Gutillen Meza, ranked No. 216, had lost all three previous matches against Pucinelli, including one just the week before.Despite injuring his right thigh late in the semifinal, Pucinelli contested the final but struggled with mobility. Meza claimed the first set 6-3. In the second, the Brazilian showed heart and pushed the match into a tense tiebreak, where Meza missed four match points before finally sealing the victory 14-12 on his fifth.

“I'm very happy – even before coming here I was excited about playing this tournament,” said Guillen Meza. “I came last year—the beach, the hotel nearby, the great food—it all motivates me. It was an excellent week.“I knew I had to do something different today. Matheus had beaten me very easily, even last week. Today I pushed harder, stayed more focused, and I came out as the champion.”With the win, Meza secured 50 ATP Ranking points and $8,350 in prize money. He is projected to reach a career-high ranking of No. 176.Pucinelli, who received $4,910 and 25 points said, “It was a good match, even though I couldn't really play my game in the first set. I even thought about retiring in the first game of the second, but I felt I could push a bit more and almost took it to a third set. It was a good week overall and I'm happy to have reached a final in Brazil.”

IT'S RACE WEEK: 5 storylines we're excited about ahead of the 2025 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix

Sweary outbursts, emotional celebrations and cheeky jokes – 12 of the most memorable team radio messages

Esteban Ocon has been reflecting on the first time that he met Haas Team Principal Ayao Komatsu, with the Frenchman having once raced alongside his now boss – who he has called “probably the most competitive guy I've ever met” – many years ago.

Ocon is embarking on a new chapter of his career with Haas, having agreed last summer to join the squad in 2025 on a multi-year deal. The move has reunited the 28-year-old with Komatsu, who was present as an engineer at Ocon's first F1 test for Lotus back in 2014, as well as his debut Free Practice 1 outing for the squad at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in the same year.

However, the two go back even further than this, as Ocon explained during an appearance on the Beyond The Grid podcast.

“2011 or 2010, I remember we were with Gwen Lagrue, who is in charge of the Mercedes young driver programme,” Ocon recalled. “I went there with him and there was like a 12-hour endurance race with F1 teams just taking part.

“Ayao was there and racing, and I was part of the Lotus team. That was the first time we met. We were team mates. I was probably 35 kilos at the time, so I was very fast in the go-kart.

“I remember he was the only one who came to me and said: ‘Esteban, how do you take this corner? Do you take a little bit the kerb to prepare the next one?‘

“And that will stick forever because I was much quicker than everyone in that corner, and no one really asked me how they could do it. But he was the one coming and asking me to try and gain something out of it.”

Pushed on whether Komatsu has changed much in the years since, Ocon responded: “I see the same competitive person I've seen. He's probably the most competitive guy I've ever met. I think we share that together.”

Ocon has credited Komatsu with influencing the progress displayed by Haas since taking over as Team Principal in 2024

After a tricky opening weekend to the season, Haas have experienced some stronger outings in the races that have followed, with a particular highlight being a double-points finish for Ocon and team mate Ollie Bearman in China.

Reflecting on the turnaround, Ocon praised the efforts of the team – as well as hailing Komatsu's leadership – for contributing to the step forward.

“The response to some of the difficulties that we faced and how quickly the people have been able to react, it's something I've never seen before,” the one-time race winner said.

“To come up with an update after two races, from something that we've had the diagnostic [for] after the first race, it's incredible as a turnaround. Even Ayao has been very impressed with how we've managed to be able to do that. He's a clear leader of this team. It's been very impressive.

“Also the technical side, he still has an eye on it and has a very good view on where we should move forward. It's exactly what we need at the moment. This team has clearly shown huge progress since Ayao has joined at the lead and it's great to see.”

Sweary outbursts, emotional celebrations and cheeky jokes – 12 of the most memorable team radio messages

Two Sprints and four regular Grand Prix weekends are out of the way, and it's finally time to get the European season started with Formula 1's second triple header of the year. There is no shortage of talking points after driver changes and team principal departures since the last round, and with teams expected to bring plenty of upgrades to Imola...

Six races into the new Formula 1 season and we already have our third driver change of the year. Granted, two were triggered by the same move when Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson swapped seats ahead of Japan, but in this case it's the promotion of Franco Colapinto back into a race drive at Alpine.

ANALYSIS: Why Alpine chose to promote Colapinto and bench Doohan – concluding a dramatic 12 hours after Oakes' resignation

Jack Doohan is demoted to reserve driver once again after a tough start to the year, during which he showed flashes of potential but ultimately did not yield a point in those opening six rounds.

Colapinto has been waiting in the wings ever since being picked up by Alpine off the back of his impressive Williams stint at the end of last season, and the team has now confirmed he will take over Doohan's seat for the next five races at least.

Colapinto will return to a race seat with Alpine at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix

With another driver evaluation currently scheduled for between the races in Austria and Great Britain, the situation does mean the pressure stays on Colapinto to prove himself a better choice behind the wheel for Alpine, both this season but also with an eye on who will partner Pierre Gasly in 2026.

Five months after his last race start, Colapinto will be keen to hit the ground running at Imola and build up some momentum, particularly with three race weekends in a row that also include the challenge of Monaco.

While there is a swap taking place on the driver front at Alpine, the team are now one significant figure down heading to Imola following the departure of Team Principal Oliver Oakes.

The change to the drive line-up was widely expected, with plenty of speculation circulating during the Miami Grand Prix weekend. But Oakes' resignation came very much as a surprise, with the team announcing he was leaving with immediate effect just 48 hours after the last race.

Briatore is taking on a number of Oakes' responsibilities moving forward, and that may well include facing the media in Imola.

Oakes resigned from his Alpine team boss role following the Miami weekend

In Miami, a few teams brought some specific new parts to their cars, but the structure of the Sprint weekend – with just one Free Practice session on the Friday before competitive running gets underway – limited how many took that risk.

For the majority of the grid, the focus has been on delivering more significant upgrade packages for Imola. That's because it's a race with the full complement of three practice sessions, but it's also logistically far easier to get the updates to a European venue given the shorter distance from the respective factories.

TECH WEEKLY: Has Red Bull's new Miami floor paved the way for them to get back in the fight with McLaren in 2025?

Add in the fact that Imola marks the first race of a triple header, and teams can hope to see the benefit of those new parts across three race weekends in such a short space of time, with just 15 days covering the race days in Imola, Monaco and Barcelona.

McLaren's advantage appeared particularly substantial in Miami, but they know only too well how last year changed when major packages were introduced. Could there be an impact on the pecking order in Italy?

TECH TALK – All the Miami updates

One team that could really do with their upgrade package delivering a clear step forward compared to their rivals is Ferrari.

The Miami Grand Prix was one of the low points of a season that has yielded just one podium and one Sprint victory so far, but also seen a double-disqualification in China and fewer than 100 points scored as a team so far.

PALMER: Why isn't it clicking yet for Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari this year?

That total leaves Ferrari fourth in the Teams' Championship and 152 adrift of leaders McLaren, and in severe danger of their title hopes disappearing before the summer break. In Miami, they finished seventh and eighth through Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton respectively, and were comfortably beaten by the Williams of Alex Albon who was fifth.

Having the fifth-fastest car during a race weekend is not what Ferrari were expecting this season, but Hamilton is confident there are clear weaknesses that are being addressed and that they could soon see a performance improvement. Imola would be the perfect time to take those first steps, in front of the Tifosi on a track that carries the Ferrari name.

Six races down already, and we are gearing up for our first European race of the year.

After the opening flyaway races, the recognisable team motorhomes – with a few new additions – will be back in action as the paddock takes on a familiar form for the majority of the summer, with the trucks lining up on the banks of the Santerno river in Emilia Romagna.

Imola has been back on the calendar since 2020 – although the 2023 edition of the race had to be cancelled due to the terrible flooding that impacted the region – and is a hit with the drivers and teams alike due to its layout, backdrop and special atmosphere.

Overtaking is possible courtesy of the long flat-out stretch across the finish line to the Tamburello chicane at the start of the lap, and last year delivered a thrilling finish as Lando Norris hunted down Max Verstappen but just ran out of time to pass the defending champion, crossing the line a mere 0.7s behind his rival.

It provided brilliant entertainment in the closing stages for the tens of thousands of fans crammed into this iconic circuit. Here's hoping for more of the same this year.

IT'S RACE WEEK: 5 storylines we're excited about ahead of the 2025 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix

Ferrari may not have had their most successful weekend at the Miami Grand Prix, but the squad certainly caught the attention as a team orders debate played out across the radio late in the race, with Lewis Hamilton querying whether he would be allowed to pass Charles Leclerc in an attempt to chase down Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli up ahead.

A back-and-forth exchange ensued as the team assessed the decision, leading to an increasingly frustrated Hamilton sarcastically commenting: “Have a tea break while you're at it.”

The remark seems to have earned its place on the list of memorable radio messages sent out over the years – and, in honour of that, we've been taking a look back at some of the other iconic lines that have lit up the F1 airwaves in seasons gone by….

We start with a soundbite that has already become one of the sport's most iconic a mere six years on from being uttered. Valtteri Bottas had endured a challenging season at Mercedes in 2018, a year in which he failed to take a victory and ended the campaign down in fifth – some way off his championship-winning team mate Lewis Hamilton.

Fast forward to the start of 2019 and Bottas returned to action as a seemingly revitalised driver. During the season opener in Australia, the Finn overtook Hamilton for the lead on Lap 1 and went on to seal an impressive win – leading to the famous moment where, after crossing the line, Bottas took aim at his critics as he commented: “To whom it may concern – f*** you.”

SISU: How Bottas fought back

The 2019 campaign was also responsible for another unforgettable moment on the team radio over at Ferrari – though, unlike the race-winning Bottas, it came about from an unhappy occurrence rather than a positive one.

In his debut season for the Scuderia, Charles Leclerc had already underlined his Qualifying prowess by securing a maiden pole position at Round 2 in Bahrain. However, a few weeks later in Azerbaijan, the Monegasque dramatically crashed into the wall at the tight and twisting Baku City Circuit in Q2. His response was to point the finger at himself, ruefully stating: “I am stupid.”

After arriving at Ferrari in 1996 with two titles under his belt from a successful run with Benetton, Michael Schumacher had to be patient in his search for a third World Championship as a driver for the Scuderia.

The years that followed brought near-misses, controversies and even a broken leg – but when the partnership clinched both Drivers' and Teams' Championships at the 2000 Japanese Grand Prix, Schumacher emotionally hailed their teamwork. Giving a shoutout to then-Technical Director Ross Brawn, the German radioed in: “You are great, Ross! All of you guys! We did it, we did it!”

To pick out one iconic radio soundbite from Daniel Ricciardo would be near on impossible. During his extensive career in F1 from 2011 to 2024, the Australian proved to be an entertaining character, a feature that showed itself both on and off the track.

There was no shortage of comedic quotes along the way, from “pizza pizza pizza” after a season-best result at Monza in 2019, through to “holy mac ‘n' cheese balls” following a second podium of the campaign for Renault in 2020. But Ricciardo also used the radio to voice his determination, which included a memorable message in the aftermath of his last victory with McLaren at the 2021 Italian Grand Prix: “And for anyone who thought I left… I never left. Just moved aside for a while.”

Prior to the 1991 season, Ayrton Senna had already achieved two World Championships, 26 wins and 52 pole positions – but a feat that had eluded the Brazilian was to take victory at his home event.

This was a statistic that Senna finally rectified during F1's visit to Interlagos that season, the McLaren driver winning from pole position in front of his adoring fans. The moment proved highly emotional for the man from Sao Paulo, who famously screamed as he crossed the line, seemingly a mixture of joy, relief and the pain he had felt owing to crippling shoulder cramps in the final laps.

The prospect of a win has not only sparked memorable radio moments from the drivers, but also from those on the other end of the line. Just ask Toto Wolff, who could not hide his excitement when George Russell suddenly found himself on course for victory at the 2024 Austrian Grand Prix following a late-race collision between Max Verstappen and Lando Norris.

“You can win this, George!” Wolff shouted to his driver, prompting a focused Russell to respond: “Just let me f***ing drive!” The Team Principal later apologised after Russell crossed the line, adding, “My bad speaking through your braking, it just… got me.” Fortunately the Briton saw the funny side, replying to his boss: “You got very excited there, Toto, very excited!”

For another case of a famous soundbite (or two) coming from the pit wall rather than the driver, look no further than Rob Smedley, the Briton who is best known for acting as Felipe Massa's race engineer at Ferrari from 2006 to 2013.

The amiable relationship between the pair shone through in their communications; when Massa complained of visor issues at Malaysia in 2009, Smedley famously responded: “Felipe, baby, stay cool.” But there were also trickier calls to make, with Smedley having to deliver a team orders request for Massa to allow Fernando Alonso through at the 2010 German Grand Prix with the statement: “Fernando is faster than you. Can you confirm you understood that message?”

Speaking of Alonso, the two-time World Champion is no stranger to making some well-known comments over team radio, from the joy of singing We Are the Champions after winning his first title with Renault in 2005, through to his angry remark that “all the time you have to leave a space” during a battle with Mercedes' Nico Rosberg at the 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix.

But perhaps his most famous quote came during his challenging return to McLaren in 2015. As the Honda-powered team saw their pace struggles continue at Suzuka, a frustrated Alonso made his feelings about the power unit clear as he simply commented: “GP2 engine! GP2… Argh!”

Like Alonso, Sebastian Vettel shared the highs and lows of Formula 1 through his radio communications. Whether it was voicing his unhappiness at others' tactics – remember “What are we doing? Racing or ping pong?” – or emotionally celebrating his achievements through song, the German went through it all.

Vettel was particularly known for his witty sense of humour, a factor that often shone through even in the heat of a race. Possibly one of the most memorable examples of this was when the four-time World Champion flagged an unusual problem to his engineer at the 2018 Brazilian Grand Prix as he stated: “There's something loose between my legs... apart from the obvious!”

While there were lots of funny soundbites courtesy of Vettel's radio over the years, his Red Bull era also brought with it some tense moments between himself and team mate Mark Webber. This had already come to the fore at the 2010 British Grand Prix, when Webber was unhappy at the team for moving an updated front wing from his car to Vettel's ahead of Qualifying.

After going on to win the race on Sunday, the Australian still seemed aggrieved by the situation as he radioed in: “Not bad for a number two driver.” This was not the last time that such tensions arose, either, with the infamous Multi 21 situation witnessing further fallout at Malaysia in 2013.

Since making his F1 debut in 2019, Lando Norris has built up a sizeable fanbase – and the Briton has certainly kept his followers entertained along the way with some classic radio moments. Case in point, when asked about track conditions at a damp Hockenheim in 2019, Norris simply answered: “Er, ******* wet! Can't see a thing!”

One of our personal favourites, though, came at the 2022 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, when Norris' race engineer, Will Joseph, explained that his mother was celebrating her birthday and would make the podium-bound Norris a cake as a dual celebration – prompting Norris to sing: “Happy birthday to Will's mum!”

And now we arrive at the inevitable Kimi Raikkonen entry in this list. The driver known as ‘the Iceman' is perhaps responsible for some of the most iconic radio quotes in the sport's history, meaning that there are countless offerings to choose from here.

Perhaps you remember the “you will not have the drink” discussion with his engineer in Hungary back in 2018, or the Finn shouting for his “gloves and steering wheel” as he was wheeled out of the garage at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

But the award for most memorable Raikkonen radio message goes back to Abu Dhabi in 2012 where, as he fought to take victory for Lotus, the 2007 World Champion was informed by his race engineer of the gap back to Alonso, prompting the response: “Just leave me alone, I know what to do!”

The ""Turkish Jason Momoa,"" who already has a cult following in many parts of the world, is ready to conquer the rest of the planet: ""My objective is to find new challenges in life.""


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	“I found out today that I have British fans as well. I didn't know that yet,” Can Yaman says as he overlooks London's Leicester Square from its Odeon cinema, where he just gave potential buyers and other TV industry folks a first taste of the epic pirate adventure series Sandokan, a new adaptation of Emilio Salgari's popular late 19th century book series from Lux Vide, a Fremantle company, in collaboration with RAI Fiction. 


	A group of fans waiting outside the cinema is waving up to him, and Yaman waves back, to the delight of the crowd.

	The Sandokan saga will air on RAI 1 in Italy, with Fremantle International distributing the show internationally, except for Spain, where Mediterráneo Mediaset España Group is handling it. And Turkish star Yaman (Dolunay, Violet Like the Sea), who has by some been called “the Turkish Jason Momoa” and has a cult-like following in such places as Italy, Spain, Portugal, India, the Arabic world, and Latin America, is setting sail to conquer an even bigger global fan base as the legendary pirate.

	He has been enjoying his visit to the British capital. “I feel like a London guy now. Because I was born in Istanbul, I need chaos a little bit, and London is perfect,” Yaman tells THR, speaking fast and with confidence. “So, I should be popular here. I need my entourage around – I can't live alone.”


	Looking out at Leicester Square, it is clear that this won't be a problem at all. In fact, the star recognizes at least one of the women in the group. “This Spanish lady follows me,” he explains. “When I go to Brazil or somewhere, she will be at the airport.” 


	He smiles as he expresses his gratitude and pride. “I'm proud of my fans because they're loyal. They never leave me alone anywhere I go,” Yaman shares before highlighting his focus and ambition. “But now with Sandokan, I hope that I will also reach another level of fandom and fans in other countries, maybe in the United States and in Northern countries.”


	How does his family react to Yaman's ever-growing fan base? “My mom is always crying,” with pride, he says, adding with a laugh: “And my father is keeping it cool. He's like: ‘I knew it. I always knew it'.”


	The original 1976 TV series, which landed in more than 85 countries, made Sandokan a household name in many parts of the globe and turned actor Kabir Bedi into a Bollywood superstar. The new version, based on an idea by Lux Vide CEO Luca Bernabei and developed for TV by Alessandro Sermoneta (Devils), Scott Rosenbaum (The Shield), and Davide Lantieri (Monterossi), with Jan Maria Michelini (Devils) and Nicola Abbatangelo (Doc) serving as directors, could well catapult Yaman to universal star status.

	











	But Yaman also praises the creative team and his fellow cast members, who include British newcomer Alanah Bloor (Waves) as Lady Marianne, the spirited daughter of the British consul x, Ed Westwick (Gossip Girl, Children of Men) as the villainous Lord James Brooke, Alessandro Preziosi (The Doctors, Black Out), John Hannah (The Last of Us, Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Mummy), Madeleine Price, Gilberto Gliozzi (Them, I delitti del Barlume), Mark Grosy (Zero Zero Zero), and Samuele Segreto (Stranizza d'amuri, The Hour).


	“Action adventure at its best, built on a fantastic pirate franchise, it's a premium series full of fun and escapism, brought to life by our spectacular ensemble cast,” promises Bernabei.


	And Jens Richter, CEO, commercial and international, at Fremantle, says: “Sandokan is not just a story about pirates, or about history, or adventures in exotic lands… Sandokan is all of these and more. It's a story about love: one of the first multicultural romances of our times, and, never more so than today, a symbol of a passionate and peaceful answer to hate and division.”


	A show synopsis reads: “In Borneo, a tropical paradise inhabited by the native Dayak tribes, but dominated by the ruthless law of the colonialist British, Sandokan is a pirate who lives by the day: he fights only for himself and his crew. … But his life changes when during a raid he meets Marianne, the beautiful daughter of the British consul in Labuan. It is the beginning of an impossible love affair between two similar souls: Marianne, of European and noble blood, but with the wild spirit of someone who grew up in a tropical paradise, and Sandokan, a pirate and adventurer, who unknowingly carries in him the blood of ancient warrior kings. On their trail will be the legendary pirate hunter Lord James Brooke, who will stop at nothing to capture Sandokan and win Marianne's heart.”

	











	As the saga unfolds, Sandokan will have to evolve and become the legendary “Tiger of Malaya.” 


	That mirrors the path of Yaman, who is clearly ready for global superstardom and showed as much in getting ready for Sandokan over the course of several months, including the loss of more than 10 kilos, physical training, and working with an English dialect coach. “Thanks to that preparation and thanks to the harmony on set, my acting parts were not that hard, because I was ready,” he tells THR. “The most grueling parts were all physical scenes. Because when you see a two-minute scene, you know it took us maybe 10 hours to film.”


	Yaman, 35, clearly believes that his life so far has prepared him for this next career step. 


	After choosing to learn English before high school, “my mother wanted me to learn Italian as a second foreign language, so I did Italian high school,” he explains. During his last year of high school, he traveled to the U.S. as an exchange student. “I went to Athens, Ohio and stayed with a family to do American high school.”


	Once he finished high school, he went to law school and ended up working for PricewaterhouseCoopers. Did he always want to ultimately become an actor? “No, I did not want to go into acting,” he tells THR. “I always wanted to be an international maritime lawyer because I knew languages. And then I met my agent.”


	The agent wanted to launch his own practice with a partner who knew men's fashion. “They were intending to create a star out of a no-name in Turkey back then,” Yaman explains. “Nobody did that back then. They were not working with established stars but exploring and creating a new style. I was one of the first guys that they met, and then they started giving me lessons and taking care of my style.”

	











	Within months, Yaman secured an acting role in a series. And he kept going from there.


	Turkey's tradition of long-running dramas and soap operas got Yaman, who sounds full of energy as is, used to putting the pedal to the metal when it comes to production work.


	“In Turkey, when you start a series, it goes on forever,” he says with a smile. “We are producing a lot because there are a lot of channels and a lot of rivalry. So, Turkish series go on forever, and the actors get to train a lot by working.”


	Obsessed with languages, the actor has already starred as the lead in Turkish, Italian, and English series, the latter thanks to El Turco and, now, the premium international show Sandokan. 


	But Yaman is not one to rest on his laurels. With production on season 1 completed, he is learning Spanish for his next step towards global domination.


	“I have been taking Spanish classes for several months,” Yaman tells THR. “A teacher is coming to my house every day, and it's four hours of studying together every day. Now we are done with the grammar. I know the grammar. So, all I do is speak, read and watch Spanish movies and series. I feel I have reached a level where I can communicate in Spanish, and I know that I can act in Spanish.”


	Have I mentioned that the Turkish star is driven, focused and ambitious? “My objective is to find new challenges in life,” he says. “I played the lead role in an Italian series. Then, I had the lead role in an English-language series. Now I intend to do the same in Spanish.”

	











	That sounds like a really rare feat, someone notes. “Probably, I'm going be the first guy who will be in a lead role in four different languages – Turkish, Italian, English and Spanish,” Yaman says. 


	Fans of his can bet on one thing – that he will keep carving a swashbuckling path across the entertainment world. In Sandokan, he shows off his action and athletic chops, in addition striking romantic and comedic tones. That was another challenge the actor enjoyed taking on. And for those who were treated to episode 1 of Sandokan, he vows that they won't be disappointed with the seven following episodes. “It's getting even more fun, even more action-packed, even more everything,” he says. 


	If you are curious if he prefers any genre, he wants to be able to do it all but may gravitate to the funny side of life. “I love comedy,” he shares with THR. “In Turkey, I did rom-coms. With that background, I have a comedy inclination. And I recently did a funny commercial in Egypt.” 


	Where will Sandokan take him? The adventurous Yaman, showing the spirit of Sandokan, is open to wherever opportunities open up. “I will see what's going to happen and where it's going to bring me,” he shares. “Maybe it's going to bring me to the United States. Maybe it's going to bring me to London. We'll see! And in the meantime, I will do something in Spanish.”


	Wherever Yaman's rising star goes from here, he wants Sandokan to entertain audiences with a popcorn series and make them feel good at a time when conflict dominates the headlines. “Generally, Sandokan has this smile on his face, giving hope to everybody,” while overcoming various challenges through heroic feats, the Turkish star says. “So, he is a very positive character.”

The pop music icon will also be involved in the project. 


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	After stops and starts on a biopic about her life and career, Madonna is turning to the limited series format to tell her story.


	The music icon is teaming with producer and director Shawn Levy on a series project at Netflix. The limited series in the early stages of development at the streamer, where Levy's 21 Laps company has an overall deal.




	Netflix declined comment. 


	The Netflix project is not related to previous efforts to mount a feature film about Madonna. Julia Garner was considered the frontrunner to play Madonna in the film, which was set up at Universal Pictures but was scuttled in early 2023. Madonna hinted last year, via a social media post, that she was again at work on the film.

	Since the development process is in its early days, it's not clear whether the potential Netflix series would span Madonna's entire life and career or a specific period within it. No writer is attached; Madonna wrote drafts of the feature script about her with Diablo Cody and Cressida Wilson.


	Levy's portfolio at Netflix includes Stranger Things, The Perfect Couple, All the Light We Cannot See and The Adam Project, among other titles. He directed and produced last year's box office hit Deadpool & Wolverine.  


	Madonna is repped by CAA, Maverick Management, Untitled Entertainment and Grubman Shire. Levy and 21 Laps are repped by WME and Johnson Shapiro.


Deadline first reported the news.

Chris and Paul Weitz have adapted the first of Martha Wells' 'Murderbot Diaries' books as a 10-episode comedy.


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	Although it's a science-fiction series with evil corporate villains, murderous robots and hungry alien creatures, Martha Wells' The Murderbot Diaries represents a tricky piece of adaptation.


	The genre trappings are all there for a blockbuster, but the brand, which includes novels, novellas and short stories, is thin on plot, light on description and only a few of its supporting characters are memorable.







	
	
		
					Murderbot		
	


The Bottom Line

	
	The tone is never quite right, but Skarsgard is.
	



Airdate: Friday, May 16 (Apple TV+)Cast: Alexander Skarsgard, David Dastmalchian, Noma Dumezweni, Sabrina Wu, Tattiawna Jones, Akshay Khanna, Tamara PodemskiCreators: Paul and Chris Weitz, from the books by Martha Wells			
			







	What it has going for it is an utterly singular, wholly relatable central voice — that of the title character, a cyborg Security Unit assigned to protect research missions, but much more interested in streaming “premium quality entertainment.” For various reasons, this SecUnit has taken the self-applied name of “Murderbot,” reflective of their life's sole stated purpose, an activity they were made for but do not feel especially invested in.

	Murderbot is weary, disaffected and generally hates people, though that's changing. And Murderbot isn't good with change. They struggle with eye contact, can't read social cues, have no demonstrable gender and their memories and personality traits are subject to occasional rebooting or modification.


The Murderbot Diaries as a series is, then, anchored not by Wells' storytelling, but by her creation of a vibe built around a main character who is, themself, an open text. Fans have interpreted Murderbot as asexual, gender-fluid and on the autism spectrum.


	Adaptation is always a form of locking down a text, of making the choices that define what was previously left up to the discretion of the reader. It's a process that's expansive and restrictive at once.


Alexander Skarsgard is not the Murderbot I imagined when I read the books. I'm sure I won't be the only reader who thinks he doesn't look or sound like what was in my head. But after 10 episodes of the new Apple TV+ series, Skarsgard's interpretation of the character became one I appreciated tremendously.


	Creators Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz's grasp on the property's tone and world-building is less effective for me and, unlike with Skarsgard's performance, I never came around to fully embracing its validity.


	Still, I like Skarsgard more than I dislike the bland overall approach, and there's a lot to be said for a show that just charges forward with most of its episodes coming in at under 25 minutes apiece.

	











	The first season is based on the first Murderbot novella, All Systems Red.


	The PreservationAux survey team, a group of hippies in a corner of the galaxy ruled by corporate interests, arrives on an alien planet for… research-based reasons (lots of the plot is really, really, really fuzzy). In order to get insurance for their mission, PreservationAux has been forced to bring along a security unit, but to save money, they've accepted a slightly outdated, refurbished model.


	Skarsgard's Murderbot has recently discovered the ability to disable its “governor module,” the device that forces SecUnits to follow orders, prevents them from harming their human overlords and requires that they focus their energies on the mission at hand rather than downloading thousands of hours of streaming television instead. So Murderbot, generally confused by human behavior, is much more invested in 2,797 episodes of a serial called The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon — a show featuring Clark Gregg, John Cho, DeWanda Wise and Jack McBrayer in brief snippets — than his clients, though he still reluctantly saves them from carnivorous centipede creatures and whatnot.


	However dyspeptic Murderbot may be, they do their job, which quickly earns unexpected warmth from the PreservationAux team, which is led by Noma Dumezweni's Mensah and includes married couple Pin-Lee (Sabrina Wu) and Arada (Tattiawna Jones); scientists Ratthi (Akshay Khanna) and Bharadwaj (Tamara Podemski); and Gurathin (David Dastmalchian), an augmented human who instantly distrusts Murderbot.

	











	It soon becomes clear that everything on this alien planet is not as it seems and that there's some sort of potentially dangerous conspiracy afoot, which forces Murderbot to set aside their digital streaming queue and become a hero.


The Murderbot Diaries is a comedy on the page, but it's a strange comedy. The story is a dull, genre-standard drama that gets passed through the withering gaze of an entity with no sense of humor, who is therefore hilarious. The humor is in the lack of effort to be humorous, as cleverly devised by Wells.


	The writing for the TV show— the Brothers Weitz collaborated on all 10 episodes — has a solid sense of Wells' voice. The direction — Paul Weitz helmed the first two episodes and several additional, but not the whole thing — is less sure.


	The books are comedies that don't try to be comedies. The TV series is just an overt comedy and it's trying very hard. Murderbot's voice is intended to generate laughs, but much of the rest of the series, generally overlit and visually flat (albeit with decent special effects), wants to be funny as well. Unfortunately, almost nothing else is. There's an added subplot involving a throuple with Arada, Pin-Lee and Ratthi that's excruciating. All of the footage from The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon makes the show-within-a-show look silly, which the series confuses with humorousness. Anna Konkle makes a multi-episode appearance as a mysterious woman with a funny name and ample punchlines that mostly fall flat, despite Konkle's game efforts.

	











	Skarsgard isn't hugely logical casting on a textual level. Making Murderbot, who mostly would prefer to wear a mask, an undeniable hunk raises questions. Giving a killer robot killer cheekbones and killer abs, but repeatedly showing us his Ken doll-style absence of genitals, becomes a peculiar piece of world-building that even supplemental dialogue can't fix.


	But with Skarsgard and our awareness of his career choices it almost makes sense. He comes from a family of siblings blessed and cursed to have the appearance of male models with the souls of a bunch of weirdos. Bill Skarsgard (It) gravitates toward roles in which makeup or prosthetics cover his face entirely. Gustaf Skarsgard (Vikings) is drawn to wild-eyed eccentrics so thoroughly that when he pops up on-screen I say, “It's Floki!” even when he's playing a normie.


	Alexander Skarsgard's tendency is toward characters who maintain the unavoidable aspect of beauty, but are uncomfortable looking like Alexander Skarsgard, or work to hide their beauty under buckets of blood or threats of abuse. In a resumé driven by performative dysmorphia, Murderbot fits. Though the elements of the character that point toward autism or asexuality remain, Skarsgard foregrounds something more child-like — an innocent who is unencumbered by a socially mandated version of morality, only to begin to recognize that on a ledger divided between “good” and “bad,” his actions might have been bad. And even then, he'd still choose screen time over doing the right thing.

	











	He's not cruel. He's candid (at least in his own head). He isn't disgusted by sexuality, just innocent and uninterested. For an actor who has often tended toward parts that let him be feral and animalistic, the absence of those attributes becomes poignant in addition to being funny; Skarsgard's inherently sad eyes take on, perhaps for the first time, a Buster Keaton quality.


	Murderbot's past, at this moment in the story, is just one data point, an awful thing he begins to realize he did without understanding how or why he did it. Few of the other characters have more than that. Dastmalchian, an actor easily capable of matching Skarsgard's sad eyes, keeps Gurathin from ever feeling like a simple adversary, underlining an insecurity or an inferiority complex born from a rare situation in which his own cybernetic augmentation is outstripped. He and Dumezweni, the show's primary source of warmth, give the best of the supporting performances, but that leaves a lot of members of the PreservationAux team who are either annoying or just underserved.


	The show, though, isn't called Murderbot & Friends, and given how the next few seasons should go if Apple sticks to the books, the most important thing in the first season is developing affection for its title character and not a deep ensemble or rich sci-fi universe. In that respect, Skarsgard makes Murderbot a success, even if some readers will lament that he isn't the Murderbot they extrapolated from the page.

Five random people agreed to 90 days of complete isolation for a 20 percent chance of winning $25,000.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	Standup comics organize a set like this: their strongest joke is the closer, the second-strongest is the opener, the third-strongest is the penultimate joke, the fourth-strongest is the second overall joke, and so on. In my standup days, an early closer was a joke about a family winning like $1,200 on Family Feud, and then having to split it five ways. The punchline: “Why didn't you just go to work that day?”


	Though he does not do standup, Greg Gutfeld fancies himself a comic (and he's certainly a more-successful one than I ever was). He's got a hit late-night-adjacent Fox News talk show — Gutfeld! is technically in primetime now — and a new game show on sister streaming service Fox Nation. The gimmick of the game show is interesting, though the prize money is a joke. Like my old closer advises, the contestants just should have just kept their day jobs.

Greg Gutfeld's What Did I Miss? placed five people “in complete isolation in upstate New York, with no contact to the outside world — no phones, internet, television or social media,” per the logline. One of the five dropped out early. A scant 90 days (January 20 through April 13 of this year) later, the four remaining contestants are transported to Gutfeld's Fox News studio to play an elongated game of True or False about the events of Donald Trump's first three months back in the White House. It's actually a funny and surprisingly self-aware premise considering Trump's volatility and the conservative audience Fox News and Nation serve. The actual show itself isn't especially watchable — but consider the budget.


	The premise and payoff of What Did I Miss? goes like this: five contestants, 90 days, no contact, one winner, $25,000. We did not leave any zeroes off.


	Upon apparently first learning of the prize money during a visit midway through the contestants' isolation period, Gutfeld exclaims, “This is the cheapest game show in modern history! These people are in a house for 90 fucking days for 25 grand — they could have made that on OnlyFans!”


	In the 1970s, which is not considered modern history, the grand prize on CBS' primetime Pyramid game show was up to $25,000. In the ‘80s, the daytime version matched it and the syndicated nighttime show jumped to $50,000 and then again to $100,000.

	











	The Fox broadcast network, part of the same company as Fox News and Fox Nation, currently airs game shows with cash prizes like $250,000 (The Floor) and $1 million (Beat Shazam).


	“The contestants were compensated daily for their time,” a spokesperson for Fox News Media told The Hollywood Reporter for this story.


	Visiting the contestants' holding cell farmhouse, Gutfeld heads to the off-limits (for the cast) control room to try to scrounge up a bit more scratch. He's only semi-successful: Lauren Peterson, the president of Fox Nation, ups the prize money to $30,000.


	“I tried,” Gutfeld says. ”I got them an extra 5k — it'll pay for the Uber back home.”


	To be fair, as every cable news channel except maybe Fox News will tell you, we're likely headed for a recession.


	Back in the studio following the full 90-day isolation period, Gutfeld shared “some pretty good news” with the contestants.


	“You probably know that I'm a pretty big deal around here, and sometimes I do keep my word,” the host says. “Not only did we get your prize raised from an insulting 25 grand to 30 grand, but I managed to go further. After more than one strongly-worded email…and two or three yelled phone calls, I got you a total prize fund tonight of $50,000.”


	The reaction from the contestant podiums was a collective, “well, that's something,” basically.


	Gutfeld then quips that it's “pennies” to someone like him, after which one contestant suggests he “add another zero.” Pass. Gutfeld makes millions of dollars a year as one of Fox News Media's biggest stars.

	











	Unfortunately, the very contestant who suggested pushing the prize to $500,000 was eliminated first. You do not bite the hand that feeds you (ramen noodles). But the “higher-ups” at Fox added a parting gift: one final question for $1,000. So there's that.


	And here's some math contextualizing the opportunity. Ninety days is a bit less than 13 weeks. Putting in 40 hours per week at the New York (state) minimum wage of $15.50 per hour (New York City is $16.50/hour), any full-time worker walks away from the same three-month period with $8,000 — and that's not even considering the other 128 hours each week that nine-to-fivers do not monetize but the isolationists must live out in, well, isolation. It may very well have been worth it to the contestant who eventually wins the (eventual) $50,000 prize, but probably not the other folks — especially the ones with kids. And several of them have kids.


	“I feel terrible. I feel like I just spent 90 days of my life for no reason at all,” the first departing contestant says in an exit interview at the end of the first episode. “For a thousand dollars, which for in New York you could get a slice of pizza and maybe a Diet Coke.”


	We told you the show was self-aware.


“Greg Gutfeld's What Did I Miss?” premiered on Fox Nation today, May 12. Episodes two and three will premiere May 13 and May 14, respectively.

The temporary venue will only be open for a few months.

	Hannah Dailey



	This summer, a number of DJs will be taking the phrase “raise the roof” literally. As announced Monday (May 12), Tao Group Hospitality is partnering with the Edge at Hudson Yards — aka the highest outdoor sky deck in the Western Hemisphere — to install a pop-up nightclub 1,100 feet in the air, setting up shop in Manhattan for a limited time only.


	Opening May 31, the Marquee Skydeck will feature a lineup of events taking place Friday and Saturday nights through September, corresponding with the closure of the original Marquee New York for renovations this summer. Namely, attendees can expect a number of high-energy sets from various DJs — who hopefully aren't afraid of heights — throughout the temporary venue's run, starting with a sneak peek performance by Carlita on May 16.

	











	The kickoff show on May 31 will be headlined by Maceo Plex.

	“With Marquee Skydeck, we're merging nightlife and spectacle,” says Tao Group Co-CEO Noah Tepperberg in a statement. “There's nowhere else in the world where you can party at this altitude, with this view, and with the Marquee energy our guests love.”


	More details on programming will be announced soon. Ticket information for the pop-up is available on Marquee's website.


	Opening its doors in 2020, the Edge at Hudson Yards has quickly become one of NYC's most thrilling attractions. The angular terrace is surrounded by clear panoramic glass, giving visitors the feeling of floating freely in the sky while looking out across city's buildings and streets.


	The exact height of the deck is 1,131 feet, branching out 65 feet from the 100th floor of Hudson Yards.


	“As one of the most recognizable features of the New York City skyline, Edge is proud to partner with Tao Group to bring an entirely new after-hours experience to the city that never sleeps,” adds Andrew Lustgarten, executive chairman at Hudson Yards Experience. “Marquee Skydeck at Edge is for the most discerning New Yorkers—you haven't seen it all until you've seen how Edge does nightlife.”

The country icon last served as a coach during season 26 of the NBC reality show.


													By
												

	Glenn Rowley



	She's back, y'all! NBC announced Monday morning (May 12) that Reba McEntire will make her way back to the spinning red chairs of The Voice as a coach for season 28. And she's not alone. She'll be joined by her season 27 cohorts, Michael Bublé, Snoop Dogg and Niall Horan.


	Set to premiere this fall, the upcoming season marks the superstar's fourth go-round on the popular reality singing competition after joining the fun as a first-time coach for season 24 alongside Horan, Gwen Stefani and John Legend back in 2023.

	











	The following season, McEntire took home her first win when Asher HaVon beat out fellow Team Reba member Josh Sanders; Bryan Olesen and Nathan Chester of Team Legend; and Karen Waldrup, who was representing freshman coaches Dan+ Shay, in the season 25 finale.




			Trending on Billboard		







	This fall, the “I Can't” singer will be joined by fellow returning coach Snoop Dogg, whom she last competed against during season 26. Meanwhile, she'll also pull double-duty as the star and executive producer of her NBC sitcom Happy's Place, which already earned a season 2 renewal back in February.


	During her brief hiatus from The Voice since season 26 ended, McEntire has certainly kept busy, collaborating with Lainey Wilson and Miranda Lambert on the new single “Trailblazer” and hosting the 2025 Academy of Country Music Awards — her 18th time hosting or co-hosting the annual awards show since 1985.


	As for the current iteration of The Voice, season 27 — which saw OG coach Adam Levine make his own highly anticipated return to the show for the first time in 11 seasons — will kick off its live semifinals on Monday night, with each team already whittled down to just two singers ahead of the finals.

The moment quickly earned the nickname ""Metallica Quake"" across social media.

	When Metallica hit the stage at Lane Stadium on May 7, it wasn't just another stadium show, it became a scientifically confirmed minor seismic event.


	As the opening chords of “Enter Sandman” rang out at the show, more than 60,000 fans jumped together, creating enough force to register ground movement. The Virginia Tech Seismological Observatory, located a mile away, detected tremors during the set and later confirmed that the crowd had, quite literally, shaken the earth.

	“Metallica saved ‘Enter Sandman' for the final song of the night. It did not disappoint, shaking Lane Stadium so hard it registered on the Virginia Tech Seismological Observatory's helicorder. Nothing compares to experiencing it live, but this multi-camera video shared by the band comes pretty close,” Virginia Tech's website reported.

	While the tremors posed no danger to the public, the moment quickly earned the nickname “Metallica Quake” across social media. According to the FOX Forecast Center, the seismic activity was too minor to be rated on the Richter scale. 


	“The magnitude would have been less than 1.0,” said Virginia Tech Seismological Observatory research associate Martin Chapman. “Too small to be felt even a mile away.”


	 For locals, the track holds deeper meaning. “Enter Sandman” has soundtracked Virginia Tech Hokies football team entrances for years, blasting through the stadium speakers to fire up the crowd. 


Virginia Tech Athletics shared the moment online, saying, “Thanks for jumping with us, Metallica! Come back anytime.”


	The concert was part of Metallica's M72 World Tour, which supports their eleventh studio album 72 Seasons. The tour features two-night stops in each city, with no repeated songs across either set. Support acts on this leg include Pantera, Limp Bizkit, Suicidal Tendencies, and Ice Nine Kills.


72 Seasons debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 following its release in April 2023. The set debuted with 146,000 units earned, achieving the largest week by units for any rock or hard rock album in over three-and-a-half years. It also marked the band's 12th top 10 charting album, of which nine have reached the top two. 72 Seasons also marked the band's first original album in seven years.

	











	Last month, Metallica also dropped the first trailer for their upcoming fan-focused documentary, Metallica Saved My Life, directed by the band's longtime collaborator, Grammy-winner Jonas Åkerlund, which will be screened in select cities on the band's ongoing M72 world tour. 


	In a statement on April 8, the group wrote, “As a few of you may know, we've been working behind the scenes the last couple of years on a new film that will be released later this year starring you guys! Metallica Saved My Life explores our world through the lives of fans who have supported each other through highs, lows, trials and triumphs for over four decades. And yeah, we're in it a little bit too.”

The singer famously skedaddled in the middle of the traditional cast hang-out/hugathon at the end of the show in March.

	It was the quick exit heard 'round the world. Back on March 29 when he was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live, Morgan Wallen famously beat what some saw as a hasty retreat from the stage during the traditional end-of-show credit segment where the week's guest and the cast hang out trading hugs and goodbyes. 


	After performing two songs on the Mikey Madison-hosted episode, Wallen briefly joined the cast on stage at the end of the episode, then abruptly walked off, sharing a photo on his Instagram Stories a short time later from his private plane with the caption, “Get me to God's country” over the image of a runway; he later capitalized on the controversy by selling “Get Me to God's Country” merch.

	











	A week later, the show had some fun with the incident in a cold-open bit in which James Austin Johnson's Donald Trump took a shot at Wallen while discussing the president's “Liberation Day” tariffs. “I even put tariffs on an island uninhabited by humans. It's called Heard and McDonald Island,” Johnson's Trump said, holding a poster featuring a hula skirt-wearing hamburger. “I would love to visit there. Can you imagine that? Big Mac and a hula skirt. Get me to God's country, right? Remember that?”




			Trending on Billboard		







	On Sunday (May 11), Wallen appeared on comedian Caleb Pressley's podcast and the host, in a bid to show how normal the country star is noted that Wallen still cuts his own grass and takes out his trash. “Not true,” Wallen smiled. Teasing out the joke, Pressley asked if former landscaper Wallen is good around the house fixing stuff. 


	“Could you fix a TV, if it was on SNL?,” Pressley asked. Wallen laughed and said, “I could change it for sure.” 


	“Seriously, SNL, did they make you mad?” Pressley pressed, as the camera zoomed in faux dramatically. “No, no, I was just ready to go home. I been there all week.”


	While Wallen seems to have had his fill, SNL wasn't done with the jokes. During that same April 5 episode, Weekend Update's Colin Jost poked fun at the singer in a bit about the economy. “This was the worst week for the stock market since the summer of 2020. But you have to remember — back then, the president was also Trump,” Jost said. “Just in the past two days, investors have lost over $6 trillion. Money is leaving the stock market faster than Morgan Wallen at goodnights.” 

	











	Long-time cast member Kenan Thompson also had thoughts about it, saying the Wallen quickstep was unusual at best. “We're so used to everybody just turning around and high-fiving us, everybody's saying, ‘Good job, good job, good job.' So when there's a departure from that, it's like, hmm, I wonder what that's about?” Thompson said, noting that Prince had pulled a similar move during his appearance on the show years ago.


	“I'm not saying Morgan Wallen is Prince, but we weren't surprised because Prince was notoriously kind of standoffish,” Thompson said. “It's just how he was. So we just thought like, ‘Okay, now he's gone back into fantasyland.” 


	Wallen's upcoming 37-track album, I'm the Problem, is due out on Friday (May 16).

On Friday, the office noted its support of licensing copyrighted material for ""commercial"" AI models. The next day, the head of the Copyright Office was fired by President Trump.


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


On Friday afternoon, the U.S. Copyright Office released a report examining copyrights and generative AI training, which supported the idea of licensing copyrights when they are used in commercial AI training.


	On Saturday (May 10), the nation's top copyright official – Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter – was terminated by President Donald Trump. Her dismissal shortly follows the firing of the Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden, who appointed and supervised Perlmutter. In response, Rep. Joe Morelle (D-NY) of the House Administration Committee, which oversees the Copyright Office and the Library of Congress, said that he feels it is “no coincidence [Trump] acted less than a day after [Perlmutter] refused to rubber-stamp Elon Musk's efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works to train AI models.”


	This report was largely seen as a win among copyright owners in the music industry, and it noted three key stances: the Office's support for licensing copyrighted material when a “commercial” AI model uses it for training, its dismissal of compulsory licensing as the correct framework for a future licensing model, and its rejection of “the idea of any opt-out approach.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The Office affirms that in “commercial” cases, licensing copyrights for training is a “practical solution” and that using copyrights without a license “[go] beyond established fair use boundaries.” It also notes that some commercial AI models “compete with [copyright owners] in existing markets.” However, if an AI model has been created for “purposes such as analysis or research – the types of uses that are critical to international competitiveness,” the Office says “the outputs are unlikely to substitute” for the works by which they were trained, and the model's training methods are more likely to be considered a form of fair use.


	“In our view, American leadership in the AI space would best be furthered by supporting both of these world-class industries that contribute so much to our economic and cultural advancement. Effective licensing options can ensure that innovation continues to advance without undermining intellectual property rights,” the report reads. 


	The report is supportive of licensing efforts between copyright owners and AI firms, and it recognizes that most stakeholders do not hold support “for any statutory change” or “government intervention” in this area. “The Office believes…[that] would be premature at this time,” the report reads. Later, it adds “we agree with commenters that a compulsory licensing regime for AI training would have significant disadvantages. A compulsory license establishes fixed royalty rates and terms and can set practices in stone; they can become inextricably embedded in an industry and become difficult to undo. Premature adoption also risks stifling the development of flexible and creative market-based solutions. Moreover, compulsory licenses can take years to develop, often requiring painstaking negotiation of numerous operational details.”


	The Office notes the perspectives of music-related organizations, like the National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA), American Association of Independent Music (A2IM), and Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which all hold a shared distaste for the idea of a future compulsory or government-controlled license for AI training. Already, the music industry deals with a compulsory license for mechanical royalties, allowing the government to control rates for one of the types of royalties earned from streaming and sales.


	“Most commenters who addressed this issue opposed or raised concerns about the prospect of compulsory licensing,” the report says. “Those representing copyright owners and creators argued that the compulsory licensing of works for use in AI training would be detrimental to their ability to control uses of their works, and asserted that there is no market failure that would justify it. A2IM and RIAA described compulsory licensing as entailing ‘below-market royalty rates, additional administrative costs, and… restrictions on innovation'… and NMPA saw it as ‘an extreme remedy that deprives copyright owners of their right to contract freely in the market, and takes away their ability to choose whom they do business with, how their works are used, and how much they are paid.'”


	Bearing all of this in mind, the Office leaves it up to the copyright owners and AI companies to figure out the right way to license and compensate for training data, but it does explore a few options. This includes “compensation structures based on a percentage of revenue or profits,” but if the free market fails to find the right licensing solution, the report suggested “targeted intervention such as [Extended Collective Licensing] ECL should be considered.”


	ECL, which is employed in some European countries, would allow a collective management organization (CMO) to issue and administer blanket licenses for “all copyrighted works within a particular class,” much like the music industry is already accustomed to with organizations like The MLC (The Mechanical Licensing Collective) and performing rights organizations (PROs) like ASCAP and BMI. The difference between an ECL and a traditional CMO, however, is that under an ECL system, the CMO can license for those who have not affirmatively joined it yet. Though these ECL licenses are still negotiated in a “free market,” the government would “regulat[e] the overall system and excercis[e] some degree of oversight.”


	While some AI firms have expressed concerns that blanket licensing by copyright holders would lead to antitrust issues, the Copyright Office sided with copyright holders on this matter too, saying “[the] courts have found that there is nothing intrinsically anticompetitive about the collective, or even blanket, licensing of copyrighted works, as long as certain safeguards are incorporated— such as ensuring that licensees can still obtain direct licenses from copyright owners as an alternative.”


	This is a “pre-publication” version of a forthcoming final report, which will be published in the “near future without any substantive changes expected,” according to the Copyright Office. The Office noted that this “pre-publication” was pushed out early in an attempt to address inquiries from Congress and key stakeholders.


	It marks the Office's third report about generative AI and its impact on copyrights since it launched an initiative on the matter in 2023. The first report, released July 31, 2024, focused on the topic of digital replicas. The second, from Jan. 29, 2025, addressed the copyright-ability of outputs created with generative AI.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Global music superstar Madonna has partnered with global streamer Netflix to tell her story. A limited series about her life and music is in early development at Netflix, with Madonna and Shawn Levy, whose 21 Laps has an exclusive TV overall deal at the platform, executive producing, Deadline has learned. A rep for Netflix declined comment.


	The duo, who had been discussing the project for awhile, are starting from scratch: the biographical limited series is not related to the Madonna feature biopic which was previously in development at Universal with three-time Emmy winner Julia Garner as the choice to play the Queen of Pop.

	It is early days of development on the TV series, so it is unclear yet which period in Madonna's decades-spanning career it will focus on. Still, Garner has remained engaged — she famously appeared alongside Madonna on stage at the singer's Celebration Tour in December 2023 — and I hear the Ozark star would most likely play Madonna, subject of availability as she doesn't have a deal. (Garner would also feel right at home at Netflix where she just signed on her for her third series, an FTX limited series, following her turns on Inventing Anna and Ozark.)




			Watch on Deadline		







	It is also too early to tell whether Madonna would be involved in the writing; she co-wrote the proposed feature.  


	Teaming with Netflix and one of the streamer's most prolific TV producers, Levy, who is behind such Netflix shows as mega hit Stranger Things and limited series The Perfect Couple and All the Light We Cannot See, represents a major step in bringing Madonna's story to the screen, something she has been passionate about for years.


	“I want to convey the incredible journey that life has taken me on as an artist, a musician, a dancer – a human being, trying to make her way in this world,” she said at the time of the Universal feature announcement in 2020.


	Madonna had remained committed to the idea and last November hinted on Instagram that she may be pivoting from a feature biopic to a TV series about her life.  


	Since she dropped out of college and got on a plane for the first time in her life to pursue a career in music and dance in New York with $35 in her pocket, Michigan native Madonna has defied expectations at every turn.

	











	Certified the best-selling female music artist in history, Madonna has sold 400 million records worldwide and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008.


	Her impact on society and pop culture have gone beyond her influence in the music industry as a revolutionary pop star who challenged sexism to redefine what it means to be a powerful woman in the field. Fearless and provocative, the “Like a Virgin” singer has been outspoken on women's rights and sexuality, pushing boundaries and challenging societal norms, and a strong advocate of the LGBTQ community.


	Madonna is repped by CAA, Maverick Management, Untitled Entertainment and Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks. Levy and 21 Laps are repped by WME and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE:  Skydance won a weekend auction for Drift, an unpublished short story by Ben Queen & Jason Shuman that has It! helmer Andy Muschietti attached to direct. Deadline hears that the project sold for around $2 million against higher if the movie gets made. Andy & Barbara Muschietti's Double Dream and Scott Glassgold's 12:01 Film's will produce.


	The 38-page short story has all the makings of a big sci-fi mission film, and numerous other bids came in with other creative attachments. When his estranged son vanishes during a space mission, a once-legendary, now fallen from grace shuttle commander is pulled into a high-stakes hostage exchange in space to get his boy back from captors who are not from Earth. The comp is Gravity meets Arrival.

	Queen & Shuman will be adapting their own short story which was on the market for less than 24 hours before selling. Skydance jumped into action quickly when Muschietti was emphatic about directing the grounded science fiction project.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Queen & Shuman made a splash last year with the sale of their Cola Wars pitch to Sony with Steven Spielberg's Amblin producing alongside Judd Apatow, who is on board to direct.


	This sale marks Glassgold's 12:01 Films and Verve-brokered second short story sale in the span of  week, after 20th Century Studios acquired Ripped, with Dwayne Johnson attached.


	These proof of concept short stories have emerged as something akin to the dizzying deals made for spec scripts decades ago. This sale also marks 12:01 Films and Verve's 25th short story overall on their current run.


	Other projects include Caretaker at Universal with Sydney Sweeney, Long Lost at Universal with Steven Spielberg producing, Dwelling at Amazon with Michael B Jordan starring and My Wife and I Bought a Ranch with Drew Hancock writing and directing, also at Amazon. Glassgold also produced last year's Sony horror hit, Tarot.


	Several of the stories have been adapted and published as novels through a Simon & Schuster label called 1201 Books. The real proof of life for these short stories will be the success of the movies made from them. About four of them are moving close to production starts.  


	Shuman & Queen are repped by Verve and Fourth Wall. 12:01 Films is repped by Verve and Jeff Frankel. Muschiettis are repped by WME and Matt Johnson.

Senior TV Writer


Rescue HI-Surf may have developed a loyal following but it didn't warrant enough of an audience to help it earn a second season.


	When talking up its new lineup Sunday during a press conference, Fox Entertainment President Michael Thorn said Fox “went all in on two shows last season, HI-Surf and Doc” but the latter show from John Wells “just didn't catch on like we had hoped.” The series that follows the personal and professional lives of the heavy-water lifeguards who patrol and protect the North Shore of O'ahu averaged 2.98M this season.


	“We love our partnership with John Wells and Warner Brothers and hope to do more with John and are doing more with Warner Brothers, but it just didn't resonate with our audience the way we needed to be able to return it,” he continued.

	While the drama fit in Fox's $3M-$4M-an-episode model, Rescue HI-Surf was at the high end of the range and among the network's more expensive drama series because it films in Hawaii. But CEO Rob Wade told reporters that the cost isn't what prompted the network to cancel the show. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“It certainly wasn't the locale or the budget. It just didn't quite grab the audience,” he said. 


	There are no plans for the show to be shopped by WBTV.


	Fortunately for fans, Rescue HI-Surf did not end its first season on a cliffhanger. The finale saw Will (Adam Demos) heading back to Australia, though he did tell Em (Arielle Kebbel) he would be back.


	In addition to Demos and Kebbel, the series starred Robbie Magasiva, Kekoa Kekumano, Alex Aiono and Zoe Cipres.


	Kester created the series and served as executive producer and showrunner. Wells, who directed the first two episodes, executive produced through John Wells Productions along with JWP's Erin Jontow. Daniele Nathanson also served as an executive producer.

He also praised her for putting their family “before everything” and said she deserved all the love she got on Mother's Day. Ribeiro's post has attracted attention from fans and also his DWTS family. Witney Carson commented with a message celebrating Unkrich. “She's an amazing mom! Love you @mrsangelaribeiro1 happy Mother's Day,” she wrote.

Other reactions include, “Alfonso your wife Angela is best thing that's ever happened to you,” and “Amazing couple and amazing kids! Happy mother's day to her and to all the moms around the world!”

Ribeiro and Unkrich married on October 13, 2012, at the Lakeside Golf Club in Burbank, California. When they celebrated ten years of marriage, the actor documented the milestone achievement with a sweet Instagram post. He posted a throwback photo of them on their wedding day and got emotional in his caption, dedicating the message to his “best friend.”

“You've made me the happiest man in the world,” he wrote in the caption. “We made an incredible life together.” He thanked Unkrich for their achievements and concluded that “the best is yet to come.” Ribeiro's followers praised him and Unkrich for being a “beautiful couple” and congratulated them on their wedding anniversary.

Fans of love can always look forward to Ribeiro's anniversary posts. In 2021, he posted a close-up photo of his beautiful wife from their wedding day. In the caption, he commented on how “lucky” he was to be in a relationship with her.

When Ryan Seacrest revealed which contestants had made it into the top 5 of “American Idol” season 23 fans weren't the only ones stunned by the results. At the end of the two-hour live show on May 11, 2025, Seacrest said that with 20 million votes cast, the two contestants going home were Mattie Pruitt and Gabby Samone. When cameras panned to judges Luke Bryan, Carrie Underwood, and Lionel Richie, all three looked shell-shocked. 

Although 16-year-old Pruitt was already vulnerable, saved by the judges the previous week when viewers voted her out, Samone has consistently blown the panel away with her soulful performances. After she was cut, fans immediately flooded social media, with some so upset to see Samone go that they insisted they'll stop watching the final episodes of season 23. 

But Samone held her head high, posting online within 20 minutes of her elimination that after an “amazing experience” on the show, she's trusting “this is only the beginning” of her music career. 

A post shared by Gabby Samone (@gabbysamonemusic)

In her post-show Instagram share, Samone wrote, “Thank you all so much for the love and support!!! I am soo grateful to have made it this far! I love you all! Please continue to support my friends On their journey! This was an amazing experience!! THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!! #TEAMGABBY”

During her journey on “American Idol,” the Baltimore native repeatedly said how wild it was to keep advancing in the competition when she had arrived feeling unsure of herself and her gift, despite having videos of her singing go viral online. Even alum Jennifer Hudson took notice and invited Samone on her show in 2022, later encouraging her to audition for “American Idol.”

Ironically, Hudson also placed in the top 7 back in 2004, but went on to become a rare EGOT winner — earning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony since competing on “American Idol.” Many fans pointed that out to Samone after the show, including one who wrote, “You are our American Idol… Your gift is unmatched. That EGOT will be yours for sure.”

Some of Samone's fellow contestants also weighed in, including top 5 contender Slater Nalley, who wrote, “I love you more than words can describe. You are a legend, Gabby Samone. Keep crushing it and this is NOT THE END for you WHATSOEVER. Gods more than got you”

Platinum ticket winner Filo, who made it to the top 12, commented, “GABBY!!! You are so special!!! In awe of your voice, your personality, and your humanity. Just wait, God has something so special waiting around the corner for you. Love you so much❤️”

Top 14 contestant Desmond Roberts also weighed in, writing, “Love you SO much Gabby❤️ You're a phenomenal vocalist and I'm so happy to have gotten to know you on this journey💕💕💕”

Samone, like her fellow contestants, sang two songs during the live May 11 episode. First, she worked with Broadway star and composer Lin-Manuel Miranda on mastering a song he wrote, “How Far I'll Go” from the movie “Moana.” Miranda noted that it was a very difficult song to sing with tricky lyrics, but the judges loved her delivery, with Underwood telling her, “Your voice was made for songs like that.”

For the portion of the show dedicated to Mother's Day, Samone got teary-eyed talking about how her mom Charoletta raised eight kids and still had room in her heart to help anyone else who needed it. Samone performed “Home” from “The Wiz” in honor of her mom, a song that Bryan said “may be my favorite performance you've done of the year,” blown away by her confidence. Richie said, “You were singing that song like you were closing the show.” Underwood told her, “Your talent is just ridiculous and week to week, you just deliver with ease.” 

It was clear the judges thought she was safe, and viewers did too — with many so shocked by her elimination that they declared a boycott after the show. 

One wrote on an “American Idol” Instagram post, “Gabbys gone …so am I ….won't be watching anymore” while another declared, “Done with idol 🙄🙄🙄”

The top 5 will perform again on another two-hour live show on May 12, starting at 8 p.m. Eastern time, to determine the top 3 who will get to go visit their hometowns.

“Vanderpump Rules” alum Ariana Madix is opening up about her love life like never before. The Bravo star has been in a relationship with Daniel Wai for two years, and she's clearing up their dating timeline and rumors about how they got together. 

Madix recently appeared on the “Disrespectfully” podcast, and she couldn't stop talking about her long-distance relationship with Wai. He's a fitness trainer and bartender who lives in New York, and Madix admits that she doesn't “love the idea” of staying in a long-distance relationship long-term. It looks like she is ready to take things to the next level.

“I feel like two years is…it's getting to a point where it's like, ‘OK, now we're really going to [move in together],'” she said. “Then I'm in Fiji for two months, or I'm in New York for four or five months. It's like, well… we might as well wait to talk about that.”

A post shared by 🌙 Ariana Madix 🌙 (@arianamadix)

Madix admitted that long distance has some benefits because it forces better communication in relationships.

“You can't just hang out and watch a movie or go to a bar and make out. You have to have conversations. I think that's really helped us build our communication from the beginning. What he's terrific about is making sure that there's always a date.” 

The Bravo star went on to say that she doesn't feel like people know much about Wai, especially when it comes to his work. She says he's “really smart” and earned a computer science degree from Virginia Tech. After college, he worked as a software engineer, but didn't feel fulfilled. That's when he turned to fitness, and realized that's what he wants to do with his life. Now, he's a “really successful trainer.”

“It's incredible because when we first started dating… I mean, he's still super successful, but I was not. And so now I feel we've evened out, and it's nice because he's super supportive of my endeavors. And I'm very supportive [of his],” Madix said.

“He's just really hardworking and super dedicated to whatever it is that he does: our relationship, his job, all the stuff. And when he comes in town, he fixes things in my house.”

A post shared by @disrespectfullypod

Despite claims that Madix started dating Wai 10 days after they met, the VPR alum says that's simply not true. They met at a mutual friend's wedding in Oaxaca — one that she expected to attend with her ex, Tom Sandoval. But he cheated on her with Rachel Leviss, and they called it quits. Which meant Madix had to attend her friend's wedding alone.

“[Daniel and I] met actually the night before the wedding. The night before, they had like a welcome party, and a bunch of us went out for drinks afterwards … We sat sort of catty-cornered from each other, but we were all in this big, long table chatting … [Later on] I was like, oh, he is hot,” Madix recalled.

She and Wai stayed up all night talking, and then they “just kept texting and flirting.” Later, she invited him to Coachella, and that's when things started to get serious.

“Vanderpump Rules” is now streaming on Peacock.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘The Voice' Fans ‘Screaming' & ‘Crying' Over Season 28 Coach Lineup Reveal: ‘Iconic'","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/season-28-coaches-fans-react/","Mon, 12 May 2025 16:31:16 GMT","

As fans of “The Voice” prepare to vote for their favorites on the first live shows of season 27, they got an unexpected extra dose of excitement on May 12, 2025, as NBC announced the coaching lineup for season 28. 

Snoop Dogg, whose return was announced in early May, will be joined this fall by three more of the most popular coaches in recent history: Reba McEntire, Michael Bublé, and Niall Horan. The morning announcement had fans flipping out on social media. 

Snoop, Bublé, and McEntire had incredible chemistry during season 26, with Gwen Stefani rounding out their foursome. On May 12, fans were thrilled to see three of the four returning, but the addition of Horan — who was a coach during seasons 23 and 24 — took the excitement to a fever pitch.

A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice)

NBC dropped the news of its season 28 coaches with two social media posts featuring all four returning coaches. The first had over 100,000 likes within a couple of hours, and the comment sections were immediately flooded with responses from over-the-moon fans. 

One exclaimed in all caps, “SCREAMING BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST ICONIC GROUP YET!!!! 😍😍😍”

Another excitedly commented, “Snoop 🔥 Reba 🔥 Niall 🔥 YAAS ❤️ YAAS ❤️YAAS ❤️ So Hyped 😍”

“LETS FREAKING GOOOOOOOO,” someone else wrote, while another chimed in, “Niall Horan & Micheal Buble on THE SAME season was notttt on my 2025 bingo card!!! Eek! This is very yay!!!🙌🏼✨👏🏼🤩”

Horan's return had fans particularly pumped. The former One Direction star was a popular addition to the show and won both seasons he coached, with Gina Miles in season 23 and Huntley in season 24, but left in 2024 for his world tour. He's also been mourning the loss of One Direction bandmate Liam Payne, who died tragically in October. 

Even Bublé, left a funny comment about Horan's return, writing, “My favourite Horan is back!! It's the return of the Irish king! The world is healing”

A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice)

Bublé, 49, previously said he turned down “The Voice” producers at least 15 times before finally agreeing to join the show for season 26. He quickly fell in love with the format, his fellow coaches and the contestants — including his season 26 winner Sofronio Vasquez.

“This is the best job I've ever had,” he told People on May 12. “Going to work every day is a joy, and I'm so thrilled to be back for Season 28. I remember being just like these contestants. I know how badly they want it and how hard it is to get there. I've had my dream come true, and the fact that I get to be a part of helping someone else in their journey to do that same thing, there's nothing better. It is really fulfilling.”

Returning for season 28 in the fall makes the Canadian crooner one of the only coaches to appear three seasons in a row in recent years, per People. 

He told the outlet, “There's a reason why ‘The Voice' remains such a success after so many years, and it's because it really is about the artists. The talent on this show is incredible, and it's been such a beautiful experience to be a part of the process.”

Season 28 will air in the fall on NBC. Meanwhile, season 27 kicks off its live shows on May 12 at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

[Editor's Note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Last of Us” Season 2, Episode 5. For previous coverage, check out last week's review.]

“I know.” 

Who knew two little words could evoke so many questions? From the second Season 2 began, “The Last of Us” has kept audiences in the dark over how much Ellie (Bella Ramsey) knows about what Joel (Pedro Pascal) did for her (or, more accurately, what he did for himself). The opening moments (which revisit the final scene from Season 1) see Ellie asking Joel to “swear” that the story he told her is true; that what he said happened with the Fireflies in the Salt Lake City hospital was what really happened. He swears, promising her there was no other choice, but the expression on her face doesn't reflect a person who's convinced; it's more like a person who's resolved.

Five years after that vow, when Season 2's story picks up, Joel and Ellie are in a silent feud. He doesn't know why, and she won't explain it to him (or anyone), but the implication — brought about by Joel's guilty conscience as much as writer/director Craig Mazin's choice to frame their fight as the very first thing that happens in Season 2 — is that she's mad at him for lying to her, or hiding something from her, or killing dozens of innocent people to “save her” from giving up her own life in order to save the rest of humanity. We don't know if that's why Ellie's mad. We don't even know if she knows Joel lied to her. But it's all we have to go on, and very purposefully so. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Then, Joel dies. Gail (Catherine O'Hara) tries to ask Ellie about their fight, months after her recovery, but Ellie isn't talking. She's still in the “anger” phase of her grief, which means she's not ready to talk about regrets or guilt. She's not ready to talk about anything, really. She's only ready for revenge.

In that same episode, Gail raises another point about Ellie — she says Ellie is a liar. “There's a difference between lying and being a liar,” Tommy (Gabriel Luna) says, trying to defend Ellie. But Gail doesn't soften. “Oh, I know,” she says. “And that one? Liar.” At the time, Gail was calling bullshit on Ellie's speech to the council, when she plead with the powers that going to Seattle to find and kill Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) was in everyone's best interest. Was Ellie lying? Absolutely. Is she a liar? That's harder to say. 

 










The same questions linger after Episode 5, when Ellie claims to already know what Joel did. Is she lying or not? Did she really know what Joel did before Nora (Tati Gabrielle) tells her? Or is she only saying she knew what he did so she can keep playing the righteous avenger? So she can stick with her mission to kill Abby? So she can prove to herself that nothing will stop her, because nothing is more important than getting revenge?

Is Ellie lying or is she a liar? Does Ellie lie sometimes, like kids do to avoid trouble or get what they want, or is she a perpetual liar who can't stop lying, even to herself? If it's the latter, Gail might be right: Ellie may already be beyond saving. 

Episode 5 gives Ellie plenty of reasons and opportunities to reconsider her plan. At times, it even seems like her doubts may overwhelm her resolve. The ending proves it's too strong to ignore — staring death in the face makes some people run the other way, but it has a hardening effect on Ellie, who's seen it too many times, with too many loved ones, to back down over a stranger's disembowelment or fungal entombment — but getting there may have still seeded enough doubt to save her… eventually.

Take Ellie and Dina's first moment of hesitation. After Dina (Isabela Merced) charts a “safe” course to where they think Abby is hiding, they stumble across a mural on the side of a building. It's a portrait of a woman with the words “Feel Her Love” written underneath. But directly under that are a pile of dead bodies — all Scars (or “Seraphites,” as they're labeled in the credits) — with another message written in graffiti just above them: “feel this bitch.” 

 










It's enough to make Dina throw up and Ellie reconsider the plan. She tells Dina they don't have to keep going; that it's crazy to send a pregnant woman on a mission this dangerous; that Dina can go back, and Ellie will finish the job without her. That, of course, doesn't fly with Dina, who shares with Ellie the brutal story of what happened to her family when she was eight years old. Telling the story, remembering her anguish, steels Dina again, and it reassures Ellie that the two of them should keep going.

But the doubt doesn't disappear. It shifts, back and forth, between two stubborn parties reluctant to waver — in front of each other and to their own beliefs. After their failed attempt to cut through the big not-so-empty building (gee, I wonder why the W.L.F. isn't patrolling in there?), Jesse (Young Mazino) says the new plan is to head back to Dina and Ellie's hideout at the theater, meet up with Tommy, and get the heck out of dodge. “No,” Ellie says, almost instinctively. This time, it's Dina whose doubts prevail, if only for an instant. She looks at Ellie and says her name, wordlessly implying that what Jesse says makes sense. It's too hard to get to Abby. Seattle is too dangerous to survive on their own.

But before they can hash it out, the danger catches up to them. Dina gets shot in the leg, and Ellie splits from the trio. She ends up in the Seattle hospital, where she surprises Nora (as she tends to injured patients, no less) and then chases her into the contaminated basement. There, she gets a taste of vengeance for what the wolves did to Joel.

 










“Don't you know what he did?” Nora says, before Ellie starts beating her (presumably to death) with a pipe. “He killed every person in that hospital, including the only fucking person alive that could make a cure from you. That was Abby's father. And Joel, Joel shot him in the head. That's what he did.”

“I know,” Ellie says.

Did she? Did she really? What does it mean if she did? If she didn't? If she knew and sought vengeance anyway, might that help her see the cycle of violence she's continuing? If she didn't know and she's lying to Nora, is there still a chance Ellie wakes up to what she's doing? If learning what Joel did wasn't enough to shake her convictions, what could? 

Before Joel died, when Ellie was getting ready to go on patrol with Jesse, she told him, “My shit with Joel is complicated. I know that. From the outside, it probably looks really bad. It has been really bad. But I'm still me, he's still Joel […] and nothing's ever going to change that. Ever.”

Whether or not Ellie knew then what she certainly knows now, the fact remains: Something needs to change in Ellie's relationship with Joel. If it's not this, then… what?

“The Last of Us” releases new episodes Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.

• Episode 5's closing tease — a momentary flashback to when Ellie was still living with Joel (before she moved into the garage, so before the events in the Season 2 premiere) — implies there's still something to be learned from Joel and Ellie's time together. We'll find out more in Episode 6, but for now, I gotta say, it felt really good to see Joel again. Even for a second, even in flashback, I welled up.

 










• Last week's opening scene introduced Isaac (Jeffrey Wright). This week's opening scene spent more time with the wolves, and it sure seems like Season 2 is threading in their story as more than just an explanation of what Ellie and Dina are up against. 

Hanrahan (Alanna Ubach) questions Sgt. Park (Hettienne Park) about what went down with her unit in the hospital basement. Turns out, the lower levels were where the first infected patients were brought for treatment back in 2003. Now, it's grown into a hotbed of unprecedented cordyceps activity. Sgt. Park says things seemed fine on the first floor, although the emptiness was its own eerie warning. But when she sent her best team to clear the second floor, Leon — Park's son — never came back. (It seems safe to assume the second body Ellie finds down there later on, an Asian man attached to a wall of fungus, is Leon.)

“He said it's in the air,” Park tells Hanrahan, by way of explaining why they sealed off the exits and left valuable soldiers to die. Hanrahan commends her for bravery and quick thinking, but the real message of the scene — besides the terrifying evolution of the cordyceps infection — is that Sgt. Park did what Joel couldn't: She let her child die to protect the rest of humanity. Maybe it makes a difference that Leon was older than Ellie. Maybe it makes a difference that there was no actual way to save him. Or maybe none of that matters, when it comes to choosing the nameless masses over your own loved ones.

 










•“Why because I'm stupid?”“That's not the word I would use.”“What word would you use?”“Non-school oriented.”– Dina's got jokes!

• “Haunted and empty.”“Aw, just like us.”– Dina's got jokes! (Though this one was a groaner.)

• Horror sequels sometimes have a hard time upping the ante when it comes to their scary monsters, but I gotta say, the “smart” infected in Season 2 are messed up. The way they kind of dance around in the distance, waiting for who knows what before they attack, is deranged. Their speed and ferocity is just as rabid as their more mindless brethren, and their warehouse attack this episode is shot so well, it feels like they're roaring in from every direction. (Kudos to Emmy-winning episode director Stephen Williams.)

• Another savvy directorial design: framing Jesse's heroic entrance. Not only does all hope seem lost by the time Jesse blasts the first infected off of Ellie, but there's zero indication as to who could possibly have shown up to save them. Is it a wolf, killing off the infected clickeres before interrogating the uninfected intruders? Is it someone from Jackson with miraculously good timing? Is it… Joel? 

No, of course it's not Joel, but don't blame yourself for thinking it might be, if only for a second. He is, after all, the hero we've come to expect will save the day. Keeping Jesse at a distance, his face and other distinguishing features out of frame, allows the viewer to remember when Joel was able to come to Ellie's aid, and seeing Jesse's entrance from her vantage point provides a little pang of grief-tinged nostalgia. Not only are we hoping against hope for Joel's return, but so is she. Has somehow, someway, her hero returned? No. Of course not. But Jesse may just be the hero she needs, if not the one she wants.

Auteur Francis Ford Coppola has landed his second making-of documentary and, despite its pun-ny title, “Megadoc” is billed as a serious look into the controversial and convoluted production of Coppola's recent feature “Megalopolis.” 

The $120 million self-funded (and Coppola-described Roman epic) premiered at Cannes 2024. The long-gestating film went on to “win” two Razzie awards, inspire a slew of GIFs with Adam Driver demanding to “go back to the club,” launch a questionable ad campaign that was rumored to be created by artificial intelligence, and arguably help usher in the era of Jon Voight being a Trump-appointed ambassador to Hollywood.

While there were claims of inappropriate behavior on set by Coppola (who has refuted all of the allegations) and a loose style of filming, with Plaza comparing it to being part of a theater troupe, it's clear that “Megalopolis” might have had some shades of Eleanor Coppola's seminal “Hearts of Darkness” to it. Thankfully, “Leaving Las Vegas” director Mike Figgis was there to capture the making-of process on film, turning it into “Megadoc,” which may sound like a “Sharknado” crocodile spinoff but is, in fact, a Coppola-sanctioned feature. Coppola is keeping the distribution of the film all in the family, as his nephew Robert Schwartzman's company Utopia has acquired the North American rights for the film.

Utopia also helped release “Megalopolis” in the U.S. with Coppola's American Zoetrope and Lionsgate; “Megadoc” will be in theaters this fall. Variety first announced the acquisition, with a source claiming that “Megadoc” will not “put a glossy shine on ‘Megalopolis' and Coppola, [and will] dig into the good/bad of it all as well.” 

“Eleanor Coppola's iconic feature documentary, ‘Hearts of Darkness,' gave audiences an incredible look and access to the making of ‘Apocalypse Now'; a film that, in time, became highly regarded as one of the finest cinematic experiences of the era and beyond,” Schwartzman said in an official statement. “Mike Figgis' ‘Megadoc' will be that to ‘Megalopolis,' opening up to audiences a behind-the-scenes journey spanning 40 years, where we will watch one of the greatest filmmakers at work.”

 










According to Coppola, “Megadoc” will showcase the many versions of the truth about what it really was like to film “Megalopolis” in Georgia. “The great filmmaker Mike Figgis shot the making of ‘Megalopolis' as he saw it,” Coppola said. “Interestingly, there are many interpretations of what really happened and it's all in the documentary although the documentary doesn't always say which is what. It is for the viewer to behold and interpret.” 

“Megadoc” is produced by Tara Li-An and James Mockoski. The documentary first started after Coppola invited Figgis to the “Megalopolis” set prior to the first day of principal photography. Figgis went on to have unrestricted access to the production; the feature is described as having a “unique look into the creative process of one of the most revered directors of all time, and behind the curtain of the most ambitious film of his career,” with Coppola “granting [Figgis] permission to document whatever he wished.” 

Figgis said in a press statement, “Francis gave me access to everything, including the amazing archive material he's accumulated of the many readings of the script as it went from one version to another. I was more or less free to go where I wanted. The cast were open about the working situation and how they were dealing with the idiosyncrasies of Francis and his very individual working methods. What a privilege to be a witness to such a moment in film history.”

The “many hats” ethos he brought to the early days of the Austin Film Society — funding it with money earned on an offshore oil rig, and later as a bellhop — still reflects the kind of “get ‘er done” scrappiness that filmmaking demands today. With Linklater's new film debuting at Cannes, “Nouvelle Vague,” he looks back to the start of the French New Wave, the legendary movement that reenergized cinema at another inflection point in the medium's history. He'll speak to why he's more excited about the future of film than he's been in years and why he believes that the Austin Film Society model can be exported to other cities to expand the film-culture footprint.

The arc of the golliwog almost comically aligns with billy woods' fascination with world history. The racist British caricature was invented in the late 1800s by an American cartoonist working in London, who based it on an old minstrel doll. She co-wrote a dozen children's books using the figure, which became a hit among English kids and a popular toy. But when she failed to trademark the golliwog, enterprising Brits turned it into a global icon and multiple racial slurs. These days, original versions of the dolls are collectibles that can sell for thousands of dollars. The woods zingers practically write themselves.

But GOLLIWOG, the Brooklyn rapper's first solo-billed album since Terror Management in 2019, isn't the Backwoodz Bamboozled. It's a visionary horrorcore record about the infinite ways people feel and respond to fear. Melding jazz, noise, and ambient, woods uses dread for groggy trips through time and space. The record's vision of horrorcore, a subgenre enamored with transgressive sex and violence, is psychedelic and dissociative. The new mode intensifies the power of woods' oration, which has grown more stentorian and dynamic. As he catalogs terrors mundane and extreme, these off-keel songs sway like shadows from a campfire.

Old collaborators like Steel Tipped Dove, the Alchemist, Messiah Musik, and Kenny Segal man the boards, but woods gravitates toward their haziest and loopiest beats. Melodies smother more than they smoothen. Drums patter and fizzle as often as they strike. And there's rarely drama to the frequent beat switches; the arrangements dissolve rather than combust like those on the similarly atmospheric BRASS. Although many of the songs are built around jagged samples, rhythm is often generated by the interplay between woods' winding flows and the various layers of instruments and vocal loops. As in a horror flick, the mood is deliberately unsteady.

woods has long included bits of fables and fantasies in his music, and GOLLIWOG pushes further into the surreal. The album's frequent mentions of dreams and fantastical creatures make his imagistic writing even more evocative. “Waterproof Mascara,” set to creeping bass strums and a vocal sample that sounds like a weeping ghost, percolates with unease. “Watched my mother cry from the top of the stairs/Scared when it came through the walls/I covered my ears, half hoping you-know-who would die/Then he did (Surprise!)/Careful what you wish for, you might just get that shit/Moms showed us where she kept the passports hid,” woods raps, repurposing the chorus of 2019's “Houthi” for the last couplet. He delivers each line with a quiet but building disbelief, as if the narrator too is unsure what is transpiring. The ambiguity of the story, which could be about a haunting or domestic violence, ups the tension.

The songwriting is delightfully twisty and textured. “STAR87” is feverish, its looped ringtone and whirring drone heightening the paranoia of the narrator. But when the ghost of a presumably betrayed friend knocks on the door, the character has no regrets: “Had to do 'em greasy like cold spare ribs in the sallow glow of an open fridge,” woods says matter-of-factly. Over the sax blasts of “Misery,” woods plays a vampire's willing victim, his delivery enthused despite the “ragged holes” in his neck. woods has little interest in shock; he's more interested in angst, delusion, and devotion—feelings that unfold slowly and warp the psyche.

To that end, these songs move more languidly than those on the punchy Maps, which brought places and scenes to life with snappy one-liners. But woods' cadences and wording are captivating as ever. He perfectly captures the hallucinogenic feel of modern life on “Golgotha”: “Everything buffering, reality lag and jump/Sometimes barely recognize the people I love.” He spends the morose “Maquiladoras” unspooling his thoughts on the foundational anticolonial book Black Skin, White Masks by Frantz Fanon. “He had the wrong answer to the right fucking question/Amputation how you survive,” woods says in response to a passage comparing being colonized to losing a limb.

But woods doesn't romanticize this survival, describing these dismemberments in exquisitely macabre detail: “Some took it on the arm, caught in a trap/Some came of their own accord, a piece already cut and neatly wrapped/In butcher paper/Had to cut 'em off, I ain't have no option/They the type to come back with the choppers chopping.” woods' winding flows and enjambed writing become even craftier when his storytelling is longform. Instead of stressing the first notes or the downbeat, he pauses at the start of bars and softens his words on last syllables—moves that sharpen his transitions and imagery. His rapping is deceptively conversational and loose.

His newest trick is repetition. He'll take a word or image and wring emotion from it with each utterance. “Niggas tried to yap me/I left town, I'm not tough/I came back when niggas got locked up/I know them niggas, niggas is dumb,” he says on “A Doll Fulla Pins,” the recurring word smugger each time. On “Cold Sweat,” he repeats “wake up in a cold sweat” as he cycles through darkly funny dreams of dancing on a desk for record execs like Bobby Shmurda and having kids with an “old old old old old ex.” But those scenes are the prelude to him actually waking up in his apartment and effectively haunting his landlord, who desperately wants him to move out so the building can be flipped. The repetition enables the twist.

Song-length rap stories can sound overly schematic compared to the spontaneity of punched-in and freestyled verses, but woods' extended yarns never sacrifice style. Even though he prioritizes immersion over jokes and flexes, there's still plenty of both tucked into these narratives, from woods and guests like Despot and Bruiser Wolf. “Doctor read the X-rays while you read the doctor's face,” woods raps on “Born Alone,” finding black humor in the existential suspense of a check-up. “My people fled to the mountains, but it's nowhere the white man won't go,” he deadpans on opener “Jumpscare.” True.

He takes the idea further on “Corinthians,” mocking space-obsessed billionaires with a drawling “Them crackers won't make it to Mars.” woods understands that delivery and content are inextricable, and has learned to play to the ear as much as the intellect. Even if you've never read Fanon, been called a wog, or seen Dune and It, you can feel the charge and weight of his words. For woods, the phantom weight that clings to language and locations is history. “Way I see it, it ain't no past tense,” he asserts on the same track, accepting the omnipresence of things unseen.

GOLLIWOG masterfully uses that spooky proximity for self-reflection and thrills. Like the late MF DOOM, who he interpolates twice here, woods is perfectly intelligible despite his layered lyrics and elusive public profile. He is a blunt writer as much as a tacit one, and he finds a vessel for both approaches in horrorcore. “Sometimes you gotta pop in 'em and remind 'em,” he taunts at one point, tweaking the “Not Like Us” lyric. He's speaking as a ghost and as himself, one of the best rappers alive.

“Dumb Feeling,” the opening track from Mei Semones' debut album Animaru, is the only song I've ever heard about New York that is rooted, firmly, in ambivalence. “This is a special place/But how many days do I/Really feel/I think I'm special, too?” the 24-year-old Berklee College of Music grad sings without a whiff of pity-party. “If you have nothing to say/No need to try so hard… It's more fun to listen to/Other's words.”

In high school, Semones cut her teeth as a guitarist playing in jazz combos, which perhaps accounts for her attitude of attunement to being super-present. Its impact is certainly evident in the dexterity of her guitar-playing and the cleanliness with which she and her band—Noah Leong (viola), Claudius Agrippa (violin), Noam Tanzer (bass), and Ransom McCafferty (drums)—hybridize bossa nova, indie, and J-pop. (Semones sings in both English and Japanese.) There is no muddied meandering through genre on Animaru. Everything is measured and mannered. To put it plainly: It's very, very nice.

There's nothing wrong with that! The musicianship is undeniably tight, and the band makes use of the most velvety bits of its source genres. Semones herself has said she wants her music to be a soft landing place: “The music that I love makes me feel less alone,” she told a radio host in 2024. She looks for music to give her “something to relate to,” and aims for her songs to do the same for other listeners. On the math-ed out room-filler “I can do what I want,” Semones sings about rejecting conformity (“I don't mind if you look at me/I am going to do this the way I want to do it”), while the breathy and sweet “Norwegian Shag” finds her lamenting a past version of her life: “I wonder is there/A part of me still with you,” she sings, “Things I told myself to make it hurt a little bit less.” The video for “Zarigani,” an ode to her twin sister, is a squad-goals fantasy: Semones imagines herself crewed up when she is, in fact, on her own—alone but not lonely, invoking summers with her sibling catching crayfish in their native Michigan.

The album is named after the Japanese pronunciation of the word “animal,” and its lyrics are often attuned to encounters with the non-human. The stripped-back “Donguri” is full of forest-friend surrealist non-sequiturs, replete with a hair-pulling squirrel and a hide-and-seek-playing snake. Although Semones doesn't anthropomorphize her creatures, I found myself thinking about the narrator of Leonora Carrington's “The Debutante,” a girl whose only friend is a hyena at the zoo. “Rat with Wings,” Animaru's epic, sounds like it's about a break-up (“My mind is with you still/But I'll never want you back”) but is actually a paean to a pigeon waddling after cloud shadows and resting alongside trash—a funny, strange subversion of heartbreak clichés.

Stranger still is the echo of the titular character in the album art: an angel-winged rodent with a creepy tail and a Mickey Mouse-shaped head, drawn by Semones' mom. It's bizarre, but retains Semones' penchant for cuteness, and it made me wonder if Semones' sound would benefit from pushing toward oddness. Animaru has no duds but also no true stand-outs, shining most when Semones takes on the unexpected—suggesting a more idiosyncratic artist underneath all the virtuosity and polish.

There's a scene at the start of Game of Thrones that lingers in the back of my mind. Two knights are jousting for an audience of royals, aristocrats, and commonfolk. One of them, the brolic, seemingly unstoppable “The Mountain,” suffers a shocking loss to Ser Loras, the effeminate Knight of the Flowers. Embarrassed and incredibly pissed off, the Mountain decapitates his horse with a massive sword. Spectators can't do anything but gasp. This is the nature of medieval bloodsport; unless you're willing to put your life on the line, you accept it for what it is. This is also the lay of the land according to Zukenee, the latest in Atlanta's lineage of rap-game world-builders.

If you're sufficiently entrenched in this underground rap scene, you already know the character archetypes: the androgynous vamp, the bloodthirsty demon, the nonchalant bag-chaser. It's all just role-playing, foreal. But this sense of predictability makes it interesting when someone presents something half-original, like using dungeons and dragons as metaphors for what goes on in the trenches. Zukenee's latest full-length, SLAYTANIC, transposes gold-grilled bravado and block-level anecdotes to medieval theatre, solidifying his role as rap's newest knight in shining armor. SLAYTANIC builds on the motifs of last year's BIRTH OF ST. SLAY, a well-rounded breakout that brought The Legend of Zelda to the Dirty South (peep “Flannels”). A month after its release, Zukenee performed “Mary Kate” at Rolling Loud with silver gauntlets on his wrists and a hype man wearing chainmail; in the music video, he lights a spliff with a wax candle. Sometimes you'll catch him and his “slayers” toting swords like Jon Snow. You get the point.

SLAYTANIC is bookended by its two strongest tracks. “Cut Ya Hand” begins with a scrappy fiddle loop that works way better than it should over classic trap drums, as if the court jester was too goofy to realize he's playing off key. “Cut ya hand, shake my hand,” Zukenee raps, setting the scene with a blood pact. By virtue of natural charisma, he threads between myth and reality. The production, helmed by Cade and Desmos, helps blur those lines: Pay attention as the lush flutes and tip-toeing keys on “Nun” drop out and hooves clop past. Left with nowhere to go on outro “In the Woods,” Zukenee seduces a girl in nature's embrace. SLAYTANIC is full of tongue-in-cheek, braggadocious lyricism, but occasionally a cogent metaphor veils Zukenee's vulnerability. Sex is the first thing on his mind, but when he laments, “The village burned down/I miss my neighborhood,” it's real-life gentrification that lies within sight.

Still, there's plenty of fun to be had. SLAYTANIC bustles with anthemic, call-and-response-type refrains like the ones on “Cut Ya Hand” and “Bromance”; a big part of the appeal is Zukenee's proclivity for earworms. Trunk-rattlers like “Gimme Gimme Interlude” and “Sticks and Swords” deserve to go platinum on I-75 just off the strength of their drums, but Zukenee's larger-than-life presence makes rap-alongs feel compulsory. He really is Southern through and through, from the verve in his cadence to his out-of-pocket, Thug-adjacent word association. I chuckle when he says “Money longer than a Sudanese slim dude,” and then I think, “Damn, Bol Bol is pretty tall.”

Zukenee clearly likes classic trap; he channels vintage T.I. on “Stoopid Fool” and both “Spontaneous Slay” and “Yoga” sound like MTV Cribs montage music. In theory, it's cool to see him call back to a bygone era (especially one most rappers aren't pulling from right now), but the best parts of SLAYTANIC don't revolve around 2000s nostalgia. “Hot Ass Greece” is a return to theme that plays with pitch-shifting strings and vocal effects, even if the production is too stagnant to totally work. That willingness to experiment with scene-setting sets Zukenee apart, though. In the record's final moments, as quivering violin and double bass echo in negative space, the curtains close in front of a space no one else inhabits. It's just him and King Arthur.

Follow all our Sean Combs trial coverage


	Sean “Diddy” Combs strode into court today morning to a packed courtroom filled with his children and anxious family members, as the hip-hop mogul faces charges of sex trafficking and racketeering that could put him behind bars for life.


	The 55-year-old, who is now fully gray, has pleaded not guilty to the five felony counts against him. During jury selection last week, the larger-than-life music executive who is known for commanding a spotlight and has previously faced a 15-year prison sentence and beat the case admitted he was a “little nervous” ahead of the trial's commencement. 


	Yet this morning, his publicist, Holly Baird, described Combs as “upbeat” and “ready to have his side told in court.” Combs' mother, Janice, and children Christian, Justin, Quincy, D'Lila, Jessie, and Chance appeared in court to support the mogul.


	Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Johnson began opening statements by conceding the jury members might be familiar with Combs by multiple names, his multi-million-dollar businesses and his “larger-than-life” persona, but she said, “there is another side to him”: a dangerous and violent figure, whose “inner circle” of bodyguards, personal assistants and a chief of staff worked tirelessly to deliver on his every whim and to safeguard his reputation. At the heart of his alleged “criminal enterprise” was Combs' insatiable sexual appetite where he required two girlfriends, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura and an anonymous woman identified as “Jane,” to have sex with male escorts, in what he called “freak-offs” or “Wild King Nights.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In the coming days, Johnson said, Ventura will testify about the “dark hotel rooms” that Combs kept her in for days at a time, where she was allegedly forced to have sex with hired male sex workers. During these days-long “freak-offs,” Ventura was allegedly kept compliant and awake through a variety of drugs, including Ecstasy. Johnson said Ventura once overdosed during a freak-off and said it felt like she was “choking” when Combs directed a sex worker to urinate in her mouth.

	











	Jane is expected to testify that Combs physically abused her too, Johnson said. The prosecutor said jurors will hear that Combs once chased Jane around a house and lifted her off the ground in a chokehold before he kicked her to the ground.

	Johnson said the evidence will show Combs ran an enterprise with the help of co-conspirators. One employee allegedly helped Combs break into a romantic rival's residence in December 2011. Johnson said Combs' chief of staff helped him “broker a deal” with a hotel security guard in 2016 to cover up the video showing Combs beating Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel. Combs allegedly bought the surveillance video by paying a hotel security guard $100,000 stuffed in a brown paper bag, Johnson told jurors.

	











	Meanwhile, Combs' attorney Teny Geragos argued that the case is not about sex trafficking, but about people's motivations for coming forward after all these years. She argued that Ventura and “Jane” were fully capable women who made choices because they had something to gain from being in a relationship with Combs. She admitted Combs engaged in domestic violence in both relationships, but she said it was the product of romantic quarrels linked to jealousy. She claimed the hotel beating caught on tape was not the product of Ventura trying to escape alleged sex trafficking, but by something found on a cellphone that led to a dispute over alleged infidelity. When combined with drug use, the fight led to regrettable actions — but in no way did it constitute sex trafficking, she told jurors.


	Earlier Monday morning, the line outside the Manhattan federal courthouse stretched down the block, as members of the press, enthusiastic supporters, curious spectators, podcasters, and content creators — including Myron Gaines from Fresh and Fit and Jaguar Wright — waited upward of 12 hours in hopes of securing a seat in the courtroom and catching a glimpse of the embattled Bad Boy Entertainment founder. Music producer Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones, who sued Combs in February 2024 for sexual assault and lack of payment, and his attorney Tyrone Blackburn turned up to court, though declined to give statements.

	Dressed in a grey sweater, collared shirt, and grey dress slacks, a smiling Combs waved to his children greeted his attorneys before taking his seat. He held a Bible in his hands, reading passages before opening arguments began later in the morning. Southern District of New York prosecutors and Combs' defense team trimmed down the remaining 43 jurors into a final group of eight men and four women, with six alternates. The panel includes a massage therapist, an investment analyst, a deli clerk, and a nursing home.


	The government has claimed Combs — who founded Bad Boy Records, which produced legendary rapper the Notorious B.I.G. and whose tremendous influence brought hip-hop and rap to the mainstream — used his billion-dollar empire as a criminal enterprise, fueled by the mogul's sexual desires. In the background of his business dealings, Combs is accused of sex trafficking two women between 2009 and 2024. 


	He allegedly instructed a team of staffers — who were allegedly subjected to forced labor and physical threats themselves — to carry out acts of bribery, arson, and kidnapping. Other alleged victims were said to be coerced into sex with Combs, as well as with hired male sex workers in dayslong, drug-fueled sexual sessions Combs called “freak-offs.”

	











	Meanwhile, Combs' all-star legal team — which includes celebrity attorneys Brian Steel and Marc Agnifilo — has insisted upon their client's innocence. They have claimed that although Combs participated in a “swinger” lifestyle and would frequently hire male escorts that did not constitute as sex trafficking. 


	In regard to Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, referred to as “Victim-1” in the indictment, Combs' attorney Agnifilo indicated to Judge Arun Subramanian that the defense planned to argue the pair's decade-long relationship was deeply “toxic” and there was “mutual” violence on both sides.


	When quizzed on the lines of questioning the defense would take during their cross-examination of Victim-1, attorneys Agnifilo and Alexandra Shapiro said they hoped to question Combs' former girlfriend about “other instances where she has been violent.” They said the questioning was central to speak to Ventura's alleged nonpeaceful nature and her independence in effort to dismantle prosecutors' claim that Combs coerced her into certain situations. 


	Subramanian quickly shot down the notion. “Strong people can be coerced just like weak people,” Subramanian said.

	This week, prosecutors indicated that they planned to call two “short” witnesses to the stand, including a male escort, before a third witness would testify. Although the name of that witness has not been disclosed, all signs point to Ventura. While stressing it was necessary to keep to a strict time schedule for the trial, prosecutors said an early key witness was “time sensitive” and would need to take frequent breaks throughout their dayslong testimony. Ventura is several months along in her pregnancy for her third child, and the indictment closely mirrors the claims she made in her bombshell sex-trafficking lawsuit.

	As Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers ponder how best to cut Medicaid in order to pay for new tax boons for the rich, doctors, hospital executives, and advocates are warning that changes to the nation's health insurance program for the poor could harm patients, quickly cause rural hospitals to close, and force essential programs to shut down. 


	For months now, the Trump administration has been exploring ways to pay off the massive $4.5 trillion loss of tax revenue it would incur by making Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent. So far, House Republicans‘ initial reconciliation bill has demanded $1.7 trillion in spending cuts across a slew of committees and government sectors. The biggest concern for health care professionals is the $880 billion the House Energy and Commerce Committee has been instructed to slash from its budget. While Trump has repeatedly pledged not to cut Medicaid, there is virtually no way for Republican lawmakers to achieve their target without massive cuts to the program tens of millions of Americans rely on for health care.

	











	Conservatives appear ready to eliminate a key funding mechanism, called provider taxes, that have allowed states to provide supplemental payments to hospitals, doctors, and other providers in order to make up for lower reimbursements from Medicaid. According to an April report from The Wall Street Journal, delays in the processing of such payments by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have already forced hospitals in several states to lay off staff and pause payments to suppliers as the agency slow-walks supplemental funding approvals.

	Republicans are also reportedly pushing to impose work requirements on most able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries without dependents — demanding they work, volunteer, or go to school for 80 hours a month — while checking recipients' income more frequently. The changes will add more bureaucratic bloat to a program riddled with it, and could lead to coverage losses.

	Democrats are warning that Republicans' proposed health care cuts will cause millions to lose their insurance coverage. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) said Sunday that if Trump and Republican lawmakers cut Medicaid, “People will die. Children will die.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told Rolling Stone that Republicans are trying “to gut what is left of the health care and social safety net in the United States,” in order to fund tax cuts for their donors.

	











	The health care industry is sounding the alarm about proposed Medicaid cuts, too.


	In an April letter to Republican and Democratic congressional leadership, the American Hospital Association — a health care lobby representing over 5,000 hospital networks and two million health care workers — urged Congress to “refrain from considering disruptive policy changes to Medicaid and other health care coverage that could impact access to health care for tens of millions of Americans.” 


	The AHA pointed to not just the sum total of proposed cuts, but specific policy changes Republicans are floating that could result in hospitals getting less money, fewer Americans qualifying for benefits, and some patients covering more of their health care costs.


	The association warned about “harmful reductions to federal Medicaid spending” under consideration in Congress. “These include changing the underlying finance structure to a per capita cap, reducing the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for certain states, and placing new limits on provider taxes. Any of these changes would negatively impact state financing for their Medicaid programs, which in turn would harm hospitals and Medicaid beneficiaries,” the AHA wrote. “Should states see reductions in federal support for their Medicaid programs, it could force them to further reduce provider payments to account for these losses.”

	The AHA further warned of policies “that could result in the displacement of Medicaid coverage for millions of beneficiaries and could lead to additional uncompensated care for our facilities.” Proposals under consideration reportedly include making some Medicaid beneficiaries pay higher premiums or co-pays for medical visits. Republicans appear to have coalesced behind the idea of imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults under 65 years of age who do not have dependents.


	During the AHA's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., last week, “uncertainty” was the word of the moment. 


	Amid the ever-shifting sands of the Trump administration — where policy is shaped less by legislation than by executive orders, televised declarations, and impulsive Truth Social posts — hospital executives, doctors, and industry lobbyists have struggled to get a handle on what the administration has planned for health care. One thing is abundantly clear: What seems to be on the table is bad for the nation's poor — and for its businesses. 

	











	“Hospitals go out of business when Medicare and Medicaid are cut. Period,” one attendee tells Rolling Stone. 


	Troy Clark, president and CEO of the New Mexico Hospital Association, is worried about what cuts to Medicaid and Medicare could mean for rural hospitals in his state, which are often the only connection entire communities have to the nation's health care system. Cuts to funding and limitations on access to Medicaid would ripple throughout the entire state, where over 40 percent of the population is enrolled in the program. 


	“I have probably between six and eight hospitals in New Mexico that if the supplemental payments are cut, they will probably close in the next 12 to 18 months,” Clark tells Rolling Stone. “They're rural, they're small, and they have a high percentage [of Medicaid patients]. I have several counties that are 80-percent-plus Medicaid, and so that means [the hospital is] probably 95-percent Medicaid plus Medicare. They're not vibrant economic communities that have employers, so they rely on this, and if they go back to where they were before the supplemental payments, they'll have to close their doors. They can't stay open.” 


	“Words matter when it comes to politicians, and they will say things [in a] very couched [way]. So, ‘We're not going to touch the Medicaid program.' Well, does that mean to beneficiaries, or does that mean to the reimbursement to hospitals and doctors?” Clark adds of the messaging coming from Republicans. 


	Dr. Michael Brown, the chief medical officer and a pulmonary specialist at Colquitt Regional Medical Center in Georgia, says that hospitals like his would be severely impacted by the proposed cuts. 


	“We would all agree that there are big problems in health care that need addressing,” he says. “But you can't just cut the funding that these hospitals are dependent upon.” 


	“You have to be careful what you're going to compromise,” Brown adds. “And loss of health care, particularly in rural societies that really depend on it — both for health care and for jobs — without those entities, without having solvent hospitals in rural communities, those communities are in peril.” 


	Jessica Rivenbank, vice president of medical education at Colquitt Regional Medical Center, says the proposed cuts would also place critical programs, like those supporting obstetric and psychiatric programs at hospitals like theirs, at risk. 

	











	Republicans have framed Medicaid work requirements as one way to slash costs without harming beneficiaries who need it.


	“You don't want able-bodied workers on a program that is intended, for example, for single mothers with two small children who [are] just trying to make it,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said earlier this year. “That is what Medicaid is for. Not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”


	Data indicates most Medicaid enrollees already do, in fact, work. Imposing work requirements would add extra layers of bureaucracy to a program that already sees many eligible beneficiaries lose their benefits for administrative reasons. 


	Medicaid is aggressively means-tested; Americans are ineligible for the program if they earn near enough money to get by on their own. States are required to check beneficiaries' income annually to make sure they are still poor, and these checks frequently lead to eligible beneficiaries having their coverage terminated because they missed a phone call or failed to respond to a piece of mail. 


	Given Medicaid's strict income limits, imposing work requirements would likely force people to toil in low-wage jobs, or apparently volunteer, if they want to maintain their health coverage — and it would certainly lead to more beneficiaries losing their coverage for bureaucratic reasons. 


	When Arkansas attempted to impose similar work requirements during Trump's first term, it “substantially exacerbated administrative hurdles to maintaining coverage,” according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine. 


	Conducting more frequent checks on beneficiaries' income — another idea that Republicans have rallied behind — proved to be a disaster when Georgia tried it, according to reporting by ProPublica. 


	Lost in the conversation about forcing supposedly able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work is the fact that many beneficiaries cannot work, but haven't been approved for disability, which is an arduous process. 


	American Hospital Association attendees who spoke to Rolling Stone said they felt that the administration's focus on the imagined 29-year-old couch potato as the emblem of fraud, waste, and abuse in the medical system was misguided, and that work requirements would do little more than unnecessarily exclude people from the system. 


	“A lot of the patients who are on Medicaid can't work,” says Brown, the Colquitt Regional Medical Center chief medical officer. “A lot of the people who are in a borderline poverty scenario, or are impoverished, or have health care conditions that do keep them from being able to work, many of them are dependent upon Medicaid.” 

	











	Former Trump White House adviser and Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway spoke to the AHA last week and applauded Speaker Johnson's approach toward Medicaid and work requirements.  


	Conway said onstage that Medicaid should be reserved for people like a “single mom of two, who's doing everything she can to keep it together and keep those kids nourished, healthy, safe.” She explained, “I was raised by that kind of mom.”


	The program shouldn't be for “the 29-year-old on the sofa” who is able-bodied and refuses to find a job, she added.


	Based on Medicaid's income limits, an adult living in California without dependents cannot earn more than $21,597 — which is less than Conway's reported fee for speaking at events like the AHA conference. (Conway has spoken at several recent lobbying group events.)


	Clark, who leads the New Mexico Hospital Association, sees the talk about 29-year-old sofa surfers on Medicaid as a distraction. 


	“Get rid of the 29-year-old sitting on mom and dad's couch who has no interest in paying his own way. Get rid of the person who no longer is eligible and is still drawing on the system,” he says. Does fraud exist in the system? “Clearly it does,” Clark concedes, but it's realistically “a very small fraction that might cost us a lot more to go find” than what these cuts would truly eliminate.

	What is of bigger concern to people like Clark is the reality that a mass cut to Medicaid's already rickety funding system — flawed as it may be — could lead to catastrophic outcomes for patients throughout the country. 


	If legislators want to cut Medicaid supplemental funding, and then “stand there and present it as if we've done great eliminating waste. It's like, no, you haven't,” Clark said. “You have eliminated the ability for access to care. Without the add-ons, doctors aren't going to supply the services, and hospitals can't afford to. They won't be able to stay open.”

Donald Trump doesn't see why everyone is so concerned that he accepted a $400 million jet from the Qatari government — one that will serve as the new Air Force Once, and which the president will reportedly retain through his presidential library fund after he leaves office.


	“So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane. Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA,” the president wrote late Sunday night on Truth Social, reposting the message Monday morning on X.


	Trump elaborated during a press briefing. “I think it's a great gesture from Qatar, I appreciate it very much,” he said. “I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer.”


	ABC News reported on Sunday that Trump is accepting the jet, described as “a flying palace,” as part of a shockingly blatant attempt from the Qatari government to buy influence with the White House. It's the latest development in a disturbing string of nakedly corrupt maneuvers from Trump and his administration — from the president's crypto enterprise to his family's business deals in the Middle East.

	Yes, Democrats are pissed. “This isn't a good idea even if the plane was being donated to the U.S. government,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Ct.) wrote, highlighting how the plane will reportedly be donated to Trump's presidential library after he leaves office. “But Trump GETS TO KEEP THE PLANE??? It's simply a cash payment to Trump in exchange for favors. Just wildly illegal.”


	“The Constitution is perfectly clear,” wrote Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) in response to the report, noting how the Constitution states that the president cannot accept a gift or emolument of “any kind whatever” from a foreign state without the approval of Congress.

	Some of Trump's closest allies aren't happy, either.


	“I love President Trump. I would take a bullet for him. But, I have to call a spade a spade. We cannot accept a $400 million ‘gift' from jihadists in suits,” Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who has been advising Trump on personnel decisions, wrote on X, adding that accepting the plane would be “such a stain” on the administration and that she is “so disappointed.”

	











	The specifics of the jet transfer are still unclear, and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Monday that the legal details are “still being worked out.” Attorney General Pam Bondi, who signed off on the deal, formerly worked as a lobbyist for the Qatari government.


	“Any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law, and we commit ourselves to the utmost transparency,” Leavitt added on Fox & Friends. When asked if there was any concern that Qatar may want something in return, Leavitt said “absolutely not” and that Trump “only works with the interest of the American public in mind.”


	The implication then is that a foreign government known for trying to buy influence would simply give away a palatial jet worth nearly a half a billion dollars because it was … feeling generous?'

	Trump was asked the same question about Qatar expecting something in return by reporters on Monday. He largely ignored it, touting how nice the planes in “Arab countries” are compared to the current Air Force One and noting that the United States has done a lot for Qatar, and that the plane is a “nice gesture.”


	The news comes as Trump takes his first official international trip of his second term. He'll leave Monday for the Middle East, and Qatar will be one of his stops. Trump's company struck a deal last month to build a new golf resort in the desert nation.

Morgan Wallen‘s abrupt exit from the Saturday Night Live stage during cast goodbyes made for good content. “Weekend Update” hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che slipped jokes about it into the next episode. Cast favorite Kenan Thompson also responded. Now, more than a month later, Wallen is offering an explanation.


	Wallen appeared on the podcast Sundae Conversations with host Caleb Pressley, who asked him, “Seriously, SNL, did they make you mad?” The singer's response was brief. “No, no, I was just ready to go home,” he said. “I been there all week.”


	The conversation moved on just as quickly as Wallen walked off the stage. There wasn't much context provided to the Instagram Story post he shared following his departure, which featured a picture of a private plane with the caption, “Get me to God's country.” Wallen started selling merchandise using the phrase within 48 hours of the post. 


	“It just felt so abrupt. And it was already such a small grouping on the stage anyway. So it was just like, oh wow, that was pretty visible,” Thompson said in an interview that same week. “The ‘God's country' of it all is strange because it's like, what are you trying to say? You trying to say that we are not in God's country? … That's not necessarily my favorite. But whatever.”

	Appearing on Saturday Night Live is a week-long commitment that typically includes sit-downs with writers, other cast members, and general rehearsals. Wallen had a lighter lift, given that he only performed, while Mikey Madison completed all of the preparation required of a host. The singer was reportedly asked to be in a sketch with Madison, Bowen Yang, Chloe Fineman, Ego Nwodim, and Sarah Sherman, but declined. He was replaced by Joe Jonas.


	Wallen appeared on SNL once before, though that was marred with controversy, too. He was originally scheduled to make his debut on an October 2020 episode, but his offer to perform was rescinded after videos surfaced of the singer partying with clear violations to the show's Covid-19 protocols. Wallen eventually joined an episode that December, performing two songs and appearing in a sketch that poked fun at the cancelled performance.

	The Trump administration and China have agreed to temporarily scale back tariffs as the two nations take tentative steps towards negotiating an economic ceasefire after over a month of escalation in a trade war that has threatened the global economy. 


	The White House announced on Monday that “in reaching an agreement, the United States and China will each lower tariffs by 115 percent while retaining an additional 10-percent tariff,” and that “other U.S. measures will remain in place.” 


	“China will remove the retaliatory tariffs it announced since April 4, 2025, and will also suspend or remove the non-tariff countermeasures taken against the United States since April 2, 2025,” a White House fact sheet announced. “China will also suspend its initial 34-percent tariff on the United States it announced on April 4, 2025 for 90 days, but will retain a 10-percent tariff during the period of the pause.” 


	The U.S. will now lower its tariff rate against Chinese goods from 145 percent to 30 percent, while China will lower its rates from 125 percent to 10 percent. The agreement means China will also temporarily suspend restrictions on the exporting of rare earth minerals and other raw materials to the United States.

	Trump has repeatedly described the tariffs as a savior of the American economy. Over the weekend, he insisted on Truth Social: “IN JUST THREE MONTHS, TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS (and therefore, record numbers of JOBS!) HAVE BEEN POURING INTO THE USA. THIS IS BECAUSE OF MY TARIFF POLICY.” Last week, the president even claimed that a lack of ships entering U.S. ports was actually a “good thing,” because it means “we lose less money.”


	In reality, consumers are already feeling the sting of higher prices, the economy contracted in the first quarter of 2025 — putting the U.S. on track to enter an official recession if things don't shape up — and virtually every major financial institution is warning that the president's trade war will lead to higher inflation, unemployment, and instability.

	Trump tried to claim on Monday that it was actually China who backed down in the face of economic pressure. “The relationship is very good. We aren't looking to hurt China. China was being hurt badly and closing up factories and having a lot of unrest,” he said. Chinese state media, meanwhile, bragged about the effectiveness of “firm countermeasures and resolute stance” in the face of Trump's tariffs.

	











	In a statement issued Sunday night, U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer said that the two nations were able to come to an agreement “quickly.” 


	“Perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought,” Greer said, adding that people need to “remember why we're here in the first place — the United States has a massive $1.2 trillion trade deficit, so the President declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we're confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to work toward resolving that national emergency.”


	The only real national emergency was the impending economic fallout of Trump's hardline and seemingly arbitrary global tariff policy. Last week, the Federal Reserve dealt a blow to the president's supposedly masterful planning by refusing to lower interest rates in response to tariff-induced anxiety, and warning that “if the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment.”


	In April, after Trump's “Liberation Day” announcement of global tariffs and trade restrictions roiled international financial markets, the president announced a pause in enforcement in order to give nations time to negotiate “deals” with the United States. Instead of pausing the tariffs on China, however, Trump jacked them up to over 100 percent, and then ultimately to 145 percent.

	So far, no trade deals have been formalized, and the threat of economic fallout remains high. The Chinese government spent weeks denying the White House's claims that they were engaged in productive negotiations towards a trade deal, and that they wouldn't be willing to come to the table until Trump agreed to roll back the punitive levies.


	It seems that in the face of worsening economic indicators and stagnating leverage, the Trump administration finally caved. As the U.S. and China begin the long road to reconciliation, the biggest obstacle towards a resolution remains the American president's ego, and his willingness to screw over his own population in order to protect it.

	Playing a rock star in Rock of Ages apparently didn't satisfy Tom Cruise‘s instinct to sing onscreen. Reflecting on his career at the British Film Institute (BFI) in London last night, the actor admitted that he hopes to do a musical—or several. 


	“Definitely musicals,” Cruise said when asked what is still on his bucket list as a performer. “Drama, action, adventures. It's endless. My goals are endless.” 


	The event, “Tom Cruise in Conversation,” was held ahead of the actor receiving the BFI Fellowship, the organization's highest honor, this week. Cruise discussed several key moments from his career during the conversation, including his pivotal work in the Mission Impossible franchise. He explained that the original 1996 film was the first thing he officially produced and he took it on because of the “music.”  


	“I loved the theme music,” the actor quipped. “And I thought it would be interesting to take a Cold War TV series and turn it into action. I wanted action and suspense.” He continued, “It was about looking at Mission and going ‘What can we do with action?' How I can evolve action and storytelling and imbue that kind of storytelling with greater amounts of motion? That is my interest.” 

	











	He also reflected on his ongoing relationship with writer and director Christopher McQuarrie, who joined the spy franchise uncredited on 2011's Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. Cruise said he had shot three months of the film, directed by Brad Bird, but “didn't have the story.” He met McQuarrie and invited him to the set in Vancouver, where Cruise and Simon Pegg were shooting the scene with the sticky climbing gloves. 


	“I already shot the action where I go on the wall,” he recalled. “We shot in Dubai. We shot most of the action sequences, except the garage scene, in Dubai. And there I am and it was like, ‘I didn't know why I was on the side of Burj [Khalifa].' Like, ‘We'll figure that out later. Problems for another day!'” McQuarrie ended up coming onboard to help with rewrites and has since collaborated with Cruise more than 10 times, including on the forthcoming Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.

	The actor confirmed there will be more to come, too. “We've got a lot,” he said of his ideas with McQuarrie. “Our relationship is just endless stories.” He added that the filmmaker was onboard to write sequel Top Gun: Maverick more than 11 years before its release in 2022. 

	











	“Immediately, they were talking about the sequels,” Cruise noted of making the 1986 film. “And actually some of what we ended up with was an earlier idea we had… It was extraordinary doing it. The studio wanted me to make Top Gun over and over. As a young artist, I wanted to develop my talent in different areas, and I wanted to understand more and challenge myself.”


	He added of filming Top Gun with director Tony Scott and Val Kilmer, “It was an exceptional experience. The actors that we got to work with. And Val coming on board. I remember with Val, we basically begged him to do it. And Anthony Edwards and Kelly [McGillis]. All of them came in. It was very, very special.” 


	Elsewhere during the hour-long chat, Cruise reflected on how Hollywood has changed since he got started, his desire to “create an effect on an audience,” and how his sister helped him get cast in Rain Man, which came about after a chance meeting with Dustin Hoffman in a restaurant in 1984. 


	“She goes, ‘There's Dustin Hoffman.' I looked up and there he was, in a hat—he was doing Death of a Salesman—and he was ordering takeout,” Cruise said. “She goes, ‘You go over there and say hello to him.' I was like, ‘I'm not going to say hello.' She goes, ‘You know him, you know his movies.' And she doesn't do stuff like that. And I don't walk up to people, but she was so pushy.”

	He was ultimately convinced after his sister “pestered me so much.” “I said, ‘Excuse me, Mr. Hoffman, I'm sorry…'” the actor remembered. “And he went, ‘Cruise!'” Hoffman invited Cruise and his sister to see Death of a Salesman and brought them backstage afterwards. “As I was leaving he said, ‘I want to make a movie with you,'” Cruise said. “And I said, ‘That would be nice, sir.' And that's what happened, and basically a year later he sent Rain Man.”


	Speaking about Paul Thomas Anderson's 1999 film Magnolia, in which Cruise plays motivational speaker Frank T.J. Mackey, Cruise recalled that “the whole monologue wasn't there.” After receiving the script, Cruise invited Anderson to his home screening room to showcase his take on Frank.

	“I created that whole character,” he said. “I was in my screen room. I had him there and I said, ‘Just sit down.' I lit it. I had the whole music. I basically wrote the opening monologue, my version, and I was like, ‘Let me just show you.' … And then what's nice is you show them and then it evolves from there.”

	











	Following the talk, Cruise climbed on the roof of the nearby BFI IMAX movie theater. The unexpected ascent aligned with his memory of being a kid and “always doing stunts.” He also pronounced, when told he should keep up the great work, “I'll never stop.”

When pilot Kenneth Arnold took off from Chehalis, Washington, in his single-engine airplane one afternoon in June 1947, he was looking for a lost military aircraft that had crashed. But what he found was something completely different—something that would set off a cultural obsession in the U.S. that persists today.

While flying around Mount Rainier, Arnold reportedly encountered nine curious, wingless objects speeding through the sky at 1,200 mph, faster than any plane at the time could. Arnold spent years afterward trying to describe what he had seen, reportedly using a term that has been ingrained in the American lexicon ever since: ""flying saucer.""

Since then, Americans have been uniquely fixated on the idea that aliens are somewhere in the sky above us—and the number who believe that to be true is growing. In 2019, a Gallup survey found that 33% of Americans believed some UFOs were alien spacecrafts, while 60% felt they could all be explained by human activity or some natural phenomenon. Just two years later, in 2021, 41% of respondents said they believed at least some UFOs were alien-related compared to 50% who were confident any sightings could be explained by human behavior or scientific events.

There are two main reasons that belief in aliens has become so prevalent in the United States: government hearings and pop culture.

America's film industry has always been one of the most influential in the world, and a wave of science fiction films in the 1950s, like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" perpetuated the idea that there are other life-forms out there. This continues today with alien-centric sci-fi staples like the ""Avatar"" franchise and the ""Quiet Place"" movies dominating the box office.

Rather than leave flying saucers to the domain of Hollywood, the U.S. government has addressed the question of UFOs, only adding further speculation. In April 2020, the Department of Defense released multiple videos filmed by military pilots that were thought to possibly capture UFOs. In July 2023, an Air Force veteran came forward to the House of Representatives claiming that the U.S. military has been keeping important information on ""nonhuman"" sightings secret since the 1930s.

Just like it did in the 1950s amid Cold War paranoia, the lore of UFOs is also currently experiencing a resurgence as many Americans grow concerned about national security. The infamous Chinese spy balloon panic in 2023 and fears over being infiltrated by the Russian government have led to many reporting seeing UFOs in the sky. People are also mistaking the spike in Starlink satellites for extraterrestrial activity. In November 2024, the Pentagon announced that most reported sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs, as they're now known) can be attributed to balloons, drones, and other regular objects, while still noting that many objects lack a sufficient explanation.

UAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it's easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they've seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.

While New Mexico and Nevada are perhaps best known for UFO sightings, the National UFO Reporting Center data shows that the state with the most sightings is California, with more than 16,500 reports as of April 25, 2025. But what do the numbers look like in your metro area?

Stacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Georgia using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis.

For now, the U.S. government's official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America's alien obsession.

A former NASA official claims he saw a piece of technology that shouldn't exist.

UFOs and debates about what's going on up in the sky are all the rage these days. We get new photos, videos and stories on a regular basis.

The difficult part is figuring out what's true, what's complete fiction and what's in the middle. It's a truly fascinating topic, and that now includes a new story that is absolutely wild.

Dr. Gregory Rogers, a former NASA Chief Flight Surgeon and major in the Air Force, spoke with the Daily Mail about an incident from more than three decades ago.

Rogers claims he was working at the NASA facility in Cape Canaveral in 1992 when an Air Force major offered to show him a video.

It wasn't what he was expecting.

Rogers claims the Air Force major, who he didn't previously know, showed him video footage of a flying saucer in the government's possession.

""He sits down at the computer console. It takes several minutes, then all of a sudden up on the screen comes this closed circuit television [CCTV] feed,"" Rogers told the outlet. What was on the feed was a flying vehicle that, if true, the government has never acknowledged having.

Rodgers told the Daily Mail the following details about the craft:

""There's a flying saucer. I would estimate it was about 20 feet wide, probably 8 to 10 feet tall, and it had a shallow dome on top of it. There were no antennas, there were no flight control surfaces. Everything was very smooth and blended. I saw no rivets, no seams, nothing. There was a little area on top which had a stick coming out of it. At the top of it were umbilical hoses, like if you were feeding gasses or electricity into it. Everything was white, but there was a vertical black rectangle at the three o'clock, the six o'clock and the nine o'clock position on the upper half of the vehicle.""

The former NASA official claims there were several people in the footage, including men in lab coats and hazmat suits, according to the same report.

""I hear and see these things that look like electromagnetic charges coming off this vehicle. But there's no devices from which they're emanating. All of a sudden it just lifted up, as smooth as could be. Once it got up maybe 3 feet above the concrete surface, it rotated completely around, clockwise, one revolution, then it revolved counterclockwise, one revolution,"" he further explained.

At one point, the man showing him the footage hinted that the government got the UFO from aliens.

Rogers told the Daily Mail, ""He said, ‘We got it from them.' And he was pointing his thumb up to the sky, which I interpreted as meaning from space.""

Are UFOs real? (Credit: Getty Images)

Now, it's important to note that there doesn't appear to be proof for Rogers' claims other than his word. Granted, it allegedly happened 33 years ago.

Having said that, the government is always creating new technology the public doesn't know anything about.

What the public knows about in terms of military technology and aircraft is often designed years ahead of anyone knowing. I can only imagine what kinds of drones and planes are currently being designed and tested.

Does that mean Rogers' story is true? No, but there are plenty of secrets the government goes to great lengths to hide.

Cripple Creek will host the “Photo Analysis Boot Camp,” from May 16-18. According to a press release on the matter, “trained UFO field investigators from across the globe will gather in Colorado to learn advanced skills in photo forensics, helping to better authenticate and identify images and videos of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) and UFOs.”

Operating since 1969, the Mutual UFO Network has long been a community of people interested in the unexplained and the extraterrestrial. The upcoming event aims to teach participants how to properly analyze media in the search of better understanding unidentified flying objects.

The event is set to host hands-on sessions that analyze real cases, with the hopes of better allowing participants to be able to distinguish between a misidentified object and what may be a genuine UFO sighting.

The Colorado State Patrol and 39 local law enforcement agencies will be conducting its largest seat belt campaign of the year through June 1.

During the enforcement period, law enforcement will increase patrols and focus on issuing citations to unbuckled drivers as part of the national Click It or Ticket effort. Drivers with unbuckled passengers can also be ticketed. Last year 1,782 citations were issued, including 74 for unrestrained children.

A dangerous, viral TikTok Chromebook challenge has made its way into schools in the Pikes Peak region, the Colorado Springs Fire Department reported. The challenge encourages students to put a piece of metal or pencil lead into the charging port for the Chromebook. The reaction will then cause the device to spark, smoke, or catch fire. This challenge poses serious safety risks, including fire, battery explosions and the release of toxic fumes.

In addition to the above risks, if the Lithium-Ion batteries located in the Chromebooks catch fire, they can be exceedingly difficult to extinguish.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","The Winchesters Was Fun, But Supernatural's First Spinoff Deserves Some Love Too","https://screenrant.com/supernatural-first-spinoff-animated-series-recommendation/","Mon, 12 May 2025 17:40:00 GMT","

Since it initially premiered on The CW in 2005, Supernatural has enjoyed long-lasting success, with it largely considered the most popular series for the network as well as The CW's best show of all time. Across 15 seasons of Supernatural, fans were blessed with the spooky escapades of the Winchester brothers, as they battled everything from grounded monsters to biblical entities along the way. Despite its immense staying power from the beginning, Supernatural never really became a massive universe for The CW, akin to something like the sprawling Arrowverse or The Vampire Diaries' substantial spinoff shows.

Few spinoff shows even came out following the success of Supernatural, with the most notable being The Winchesters, an alternate universe prequel that follows Mary Campbell and John Winchester in the early 1970s, the parents of Sam and Dean. Unfortunately, The Winchesters was cancelled after only one season, quickly closing the book on the spinoff's potential. Though many might think The Winchesters is the only spinoff of Supernatural, there was another unique take on the franchise that came out relatively early in the show's run.

Supernatural: The Anime Series (also known as Supernatural: The Animation) is exactly how it sounds, an anime spinoff of the flagship series. Running for 22 episodes, Supernatural: The Anime premiered on February 9, 2011, and was produced by the legendary Japanese animation studio, Madhouse, which is behind iconic projects like Death Note, Perfect Blue, Black Lagoon, and countless others. It was the only spinoff to come out of the Supernatural franchise before the release of The Winchesters in 2022.

Despite not featuring Sam or Dean, one Supernatural crossover with an unlikely series is so bizarre that it actually works really well for it. 

When it was produced by a Japanese animation studio, Supernatural: The Anime features an impressive Japanese dub with Yūya Uchida and Hiroki Touchi reprising their roles as Sam and Dean, the voices for the Japanese dub of the live-action series as well. For the English version, Jared Padalecki was able to return to voice Sam, but Jensen Ackles had scheduling conflicts and only returned for the final two episodes, the show's biggest unfortunate blemish, though Andrew Farrar did a solid job for the first 20 episodes.

Determining what is canon or not is a much-discussed aspect of franchise fandoms, which raises questions about the standing of Supernatural: The Anime Series within the official story of Supernatural. Officially, Supernatural: The Anime Series is not canon to the 15-season series, though some fans do like to view it as part of the greater canon of the franchise, especially with how the story unfolds throughout its 22 episodes, leaving it open for some interpretation.

While these stories, especially diving into the Winchesters' past, might not fit perfectly within the canon of the live-action series, it does a good job of providing new context for some of the show's early storylines.

The way it ties into the live-action series is pretty interesting, though, as Supernatural: The Anime covers the plot of Supernatural's first two seasons, while also featuring new storylines about Sam and Dean's childhoods and expanding a bit on some secondary characters. While these stories, especially diving into the Winchesters' past, might not fit perfectly within the canon of the live-action series, it does a good job of providing new context for some of the show's early storylines.

While it is a shame that The Winchesters ended early, and there haven't been any other spinoffs of Supernatural besides Supernatural: The Anime Series, it seems unlikely that The CW will be producing any new projects in the franchise. The network's priorities have shifted, which meant scaling back on nearly all of their scripted series, putting the Supernatural franchise in limbo for the foreseeable future.

Sam and Dean Winchester use different secret codewords - or ""hunter's lingo"" - throughout Supernatural in order to keep their monster hunting covert.

There are still plenty of directions the franchise could take if another network or streaming service was able to pick it up, including several unfinished storylines that would be awesome to explore in the 16th season of Supernatural. There is also still a massive fandom around Sam, Dean, Castiel, and Supernatural as a whole, and plenty of spinoff ideas the franchise could delve into if the timing is right. Supernatural: The Anime Series proves that there are plenty of unique ways that Supernatural could continue.

Warning: Contains spoilers

Ryan Coogler's latest film, Sinners, made history with a second-weekend box office tally only six percent lower than its opening weekend. Just past its fourth weekend, it crossed the $200 million mark at the domestic box office. Both audiences and critics adore this Southern Gothic vampire thriller, starring Michael B. Jordan as identical twins Smoke and Stack. The pair has just returned to the Mississippi Delta after fighting in World War I and then getting involved with the Chicago mob, the details of which are mostly left to other characters' conjecture. Looking to open a juke joint for the community that raised them, they sign on their cousin Sammie (Miles Caton), a pastor's son and blues guitar virtuoso, and buy an old saw mill off a local landowner Hogwood (David Maldonado), who lies to the twins about his Klan membership, but Smoke and Stack learn this vital piece of information anyway, but from a different well of trouble: Remmick (Jack O'Connell), a vampire who comes knocking during the juke joint's opening night. 

Sinners is a horror movie, but it's also so much more—a moody, atmospheric fantasy and period piece in one, which plumbs the history of the blues, hoodoo, and the Jim Crow South. The twins are inseparable, but distinct. Stack is a swaggering troublemaker with a pissed-off white-passing ex-girlfriend, Mary (Hailee Steinfeld) hot on his tail, but a melancholy hangs over Smoke. We begin to understand why when he visits his estranged wife, Annie (Wunmi Mosaku), at her little shop and abode in the woods. Outside, a fresh bottle of milk is set next to a tiny grave for the couple's baby daughter.

As Smoke and Stack make their way through the Delta, culminating in the juke joint's grand opening, production designer Hannah Beachler's (Black Panther, Creed) exceptional structures, built from the ground up, define each location. At first glance, the spare, light church from whence the twins pluck Sammie couldn't be more different from Bo (Yao) and Grace Chow's (Li Jun Li) bustling grocery, but an aesthetic through line connects each of the locations for a historic, coherent sense of the Delta imbued with the fantastical. Beachler, who has worked with Coogler for twelve years on five of his films, has a shorthand with the director, but nevertheless, every project has its own challenges. 

We got to speak with Beachler about her historic references, visual guidelines, and working Easter eggs into the sets for Sinners.

 

The settings are so integral to this story. How did you approach them as a whole?

They were all built entirely from scratch on location, so that was an awesome feat. The first three sets I designed were Annie's, the church, and the saw mill. I assigned them colors of red, white, and blue. Ryan loves to assign colors to characters, which I run with. Jedediah [Saul Williams] was black, Smoke and Stack were red and blue, and you'll notice that Mary and Annie have colors. On the outside of Annie's, there's a haint blue. I think ultimately, my favorites were the church, the farmhouse, and Annie's. They each have their own personality, inspired by Dennis Gassner and Tim Burton's Big Fish, which is very much about these small silhouettes of buildings, leaning and exaggerated in form.

Ryan had talked about Sergio Leone, and these big vistas, Stagecoach and Searchers. It was really about wanting to put these structures on these big horizons so they could stand out, because nothing was big. We didn't have huge mansions outside of plantations, so the world was very small, and I wanted to keep it that way, but I wanted to exaggerate the shapes.

There's a very strong coherence from location to location.

Sometimes I put a piece of a set into another set, trying to draw a line between church, spirituality which is Annie and the haint blue, and then red, which is blood and the capitalism of the juke joint and the free spirit there, and how all of those live in juxtaposition to one another. The farmhouse also has a lot of juxtaposition. You'll notice things around Mary and Stack and Joan and Burt that are all sort of the same things, playing with lines. It was all intentional.

Annie's abode is really special. What was your inspiration there?

When I started doing my research and digging into the photography of Eudora Welty, I saw a photograph of a woman from a sharecropper family standing outside her house. Her house is just leaning. And it struck me, there's a huge pile of cotton on her porch. Cotton was king, and that's what our story was about. [We put] piles of cotton everywhere. We wanted it on the road. You could see it as if it dripped out of the carriages. When Sammie walked through his neighborhood on the plantation, you saw people with it on their porch. There were images from the Library of Congress and the FSA, the Farm Services Administration, in Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana during the 1920s and 1930s that I used for inspiration as well. I went to Clarksdale and talked to older people about the town and what they remembered from their relatives and ancestors. All of those things were really important in building what was a truth that feels like fantasy.

How did you create the barn-turned-juke joint? Was the lighting practical?

I knew I wanted to make it two stories, to tell the story that people lived there at one point. Of course, the kerosene lanterns were practical lighting, and then we had that moment when they jacked the electricity. Autumn [Durald Arkapaw, the cinematographer] really used that as a point of reference for the lighting she put in there. I love working with her. I can be as bold and crazy as I want, and she turns it into a beautiful piece of art. I was listening to a lot of Howlin' Wolf and Smokestack Lightning, and we stopped where the equalizers stopped in the middle of the chorus. Then, we painted the levels of the equalizer of the song in rust on the back wall. We wanted to bring in the feeling that music is surrounding them. The big light Mary and Stack are in front of looks like a moon, and foreshadows what they become. And the juke joint is where everybody's world collides, so I brought a little bit of everything [from other sets] into the structure.

Did the doubling for Smoke and Stack affect your process at all?

Ryan always said, Don't let that dictate what you're doing. The twinning affected us just a little bit when we had to make sure backgrounds matched, but otherwise, we just went for it without worrying too much about that. One place we really did dive into the IMAX of it all was the church. When you're at the doors of the church and Sammie walks in, I wanted to see rafters, and I wanted them to disappear at a certain point. So we had Autumn's people out in Los Angeles measuring the height of the bottom of where our rafters sat, with where the IMAX would fall, and how far in we would lose that.

So much of the key action takes place at night. What did that mean for your process?

Put light on it so we can see it! It was wonderful because the way Autumn lit everything, we could utilize the atmosphere and really layer the forest on the location where we built the juke joint. I knew the way we shot it was going to be about capturing silhouettes, the dirt road, and considering how to bring the fog in. Concentrating on shapes and creating a mood in the background was fun.

How was shooting in Louisiana?

I've been in New Orleans for about 22 years. I knew a lot of the crew and had worked with a lot of them in my early career. We're right next to Mississippi, and certainly our weather is the same as the Delta. Northern Louisiana is cotton, and southern Louisiana is sugarcane. We were able to use the sugarcane fields when they were low to plant an acre here or there of cotton, and the rest would be tilled in. That was one of the reasons we needed New Orleans; outside of it lay those big landscapes you're going to get in the Delta, the big sky, and that land forever. That was something Ryan really needed to tell the story of the wealth of that land and the poverty of the people who worked that land. I knew that we could get that [landscape] in Louisiana more so than in any other place.

What were the locations outside New Orleans like?

We shot in Donaldsonville, which was hit hard by economic times, so it was pretty empty. We augmented and filled all of those buildings. Those grocery stores were from the ground up. Our set decorating department made labels for every can. We also had a lot of stuff in there that really spoke to that story of Mississippi and Bo and Grace and the Asian community, how they were able to serve both the white community and the Black community, and dealt with their own hardships as well. There are a lot of little tells on the windows of the grocery stores as to what that world meant. I was so proud we were able to put catfish frying on 70mm IMAX—you don't see that every day. 

The town's main street had an incredible amount of detail. 

I hope people keep seeing things every time they watch it. It's both a thriller and a commentary on the time and what was happening in Mississippi during Prohibition and Jim Crow. After all these years, I've learned to trust how Ryan's going to tell the story. Really, the best part was the collaboration and working outside of the big studio system we'd worked in previously. It was still a studio, but it was Ryan's, and that made us free to stretch our own creativity. That's one of the great things about working with an auteur like Ryan.

Sinners is in theaters now.

As a surge of New Age influencers perpetuating right-wing ideologies swarms the internet, Olivia Petter asks how wellness became a gateway to conspiratorial thinking

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

We've all followed that friend of a friend online. The one who suddenly went sober during lockdown, cut out sugar, and started posting about her hardcore juice cleanse and daily gratitude ritual. She's dubious of modern medicine and societal convention; there's a rumour going around that she never got vaccinated against Covid. You heard she recently moved to Bali to become a yoga instructor. That she had started cutting off friends who weren't “aligned” with her “energy”. That she'd found a higher purpose. A calling. Then you hear that the mutual friend you have in common is in a WhatsApp group of people who are concerned she's losing touch with reality. 

This is not an unusual trajectory. Since the pandemic, much has been written about the rise of wellness and spirituality fostering a subsequent spike in right-wing ideologies; a pathway that is also cultivating conspiratorial thinking. Misinformation merchants posing as wellness gurus. In the US, there are many, including Kelly Brogan, a so-called “holistic psychologist” whose website carries the slogan: “Own your body. Free your mind.” The anti-vaxxer and New York Times bestselling author has promoted several widely disproven conspiracy theories. She went viral in 2020 for claiming that Coronavirus may not exist and that deaths from the virus were caused by fear. Elsewhere, there's JZ Knight, another notorious anti-vaxxer who claims to have channelled a 35,000-year-old Lemurian warrior and has spewed hate for Jews and Mexicans. There's also Amy Carlson, co-founder of the Love Has Won religious group, who claimed to heal cancer victims “with the power of love” and promoted conspiracy theories about 9/11 and UFOs. Carlson died in 2021 of alcohol abuse, anorexia and chronic colloidal silver ingestion.

All this and more is what prompted the launch of the hugely popular Conspirituality podcast, a show dedicated to exploring the unlikely crossover between the wellness industry and conspiracy theorists who err on the side of right-wing ideologies. Created after the viral anti-vax documentary films, Plandemic, the show looks at everything from New Age cults (there's an episode on CrossFit), Scientology, and climate denialists. 

While this has largely been observed as a US-focused trend, the term “conspirituality” itself was coined in the UK in a 2011 paper published in the Journal of Contemporary Religion by Charlotte Ward and David Voas. The “rapidly growing” online movement was described as a synthesis of “the female-dominated New Age (with its positive focus on self) and the male-dominated realm of conspiracy theory (with its negative focus on global politics)”. According to the research, proponents believe that “the best strategy for dealing with the threat of a totalitarian ‘new world order' is to act in accordance with an awakened ‘new paradigm' worldview”.

“The phenomenon had been bubbling away in the background during the previous decade, but it was largely invisible to most people,” says Voas, who is currently emeritus professor of social science at University College London. Much of the disinformation spreading was happening on the fringes of YouTube or in niche communities formed by people with chronic or terminal illnesses, who felt they had been failed by modern science. “The Covid pandemic was undoubtedly a tipping point. The social and medical crisis brought more of the population into contact with the ideas.”

As for how right-wing thinking became enmeshed in all of this, Voas suspects it boils down to the fundamental superiority that lies at the heart of conspirituality. “Conspirituality is fuelled by distrust of old sources of authority, including science, religion, mainstream media, and political leadership,” he explains. “Ironically, though, it is also characterised by a willingness to believe almost anything, if the ideas accord with our desires or suspicions. Conspirituality is a kind of crowd-sourced knowledge, where the spread of a belief is taken to be support for its content.”

It's not hard to see how this can become a source of concern, particularly when these voices are spreading misinformation on large platforms. But the appetite persists because we're in an era of distrust, which is exactly what draws people into these communities. “People are looking for answers, and more importantly, alternatives,” says Dr Christopher T Conner, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Missouri. “Austerity measures since the 90s, and a failure of leadership to pass policies to help, rather than disproportionately hurt, the working classes have created a sense of apathy, despair, and hopelessness. People have lost faith in the system, and they are tired of being lied to by politicians trying to earn their vote.”

This alone isn't worrying. That is, until you start adjusting your life choices according to this belief system. “I may trust my priest for matters of the heart and spirit, but I trust my doctor when it comes to matters of my cardiovascular system,” says Dr Conner. “The real issue, though, is that we have gotten to a point in society where someone would rather believe someone with a YouTube channel than an expert communicating through a traditional societal institution; that points to broader structural problems that we need to address.”

The real issue, though, is that we have gotten to a point in society where someone would rather believe someone with a YouTube channel than an expert communicating through a traditional societal institution

It might seem more pervasive in the US, but experts refer to it as a global trend. So perhaps it's only a matter of time until we see it escalate in the UK. Polly Shute, founder of the LGBT+ wellness festival in north Devon, Out & Wild, has noticed it beginning in her sector. “I have really noticed the growth of the wellness industry over the last five years, especially post-Covid,” she says. “There are lots of positive sides to this. But the growth also makes it an attractive market commercially and politically. And the target for this is women. Even something as simple as focusing on what the perfect body looks like, for example, does not support those coming from marginalised communities.”

Perhaps it's important to understand that beyond extremists, such as Knight and Carlson, conspirituality could be seen as a mechanism for dealing with financial and political instability. All of us could do with feeling a little more sure of what's going on in the world and why. And if that's subscribing to the belief that we're from a mythological sunken continent, well, whatever works for you.

“With so much in flux on our polycrisis planet, I would suggest that our tolerance for ‘not knowing' is being tested beyond our limits,” suggests Hamira Riaz, associate fellow of the British Psychological Society. “Conspirituality can be seen as a human coping response; it is a way of making sense of complex issues that we struggle to understand. Research suggests that people who are attracted to political extremes are more prone to black-and-white thinking, perhaps due to a lower tolerance for ambiguity. Conspiracy theories offer comfort to the brain; they are neat, simplified stories that reduce uncertainty.”

That might be an acceptable coping mechanism, so long as those simplified stories don't have you ingesting silver, or propagating extremist views online. It might seem like a big leap. But clearly, it's one more people are taking than you might think.

Humans love their conspiracy theories. The Apollo moon landings were faked by covert agents in NASA to broadcast America's technological prowess over Soviet Russia. (It was too expensive and risky to actually go to the moon.) Big Pharma covers up cures for diseases to boost their bottom lines with ineffective vaccines. The United States government secretly allowed 9/11 to take place to justify its preplanned war on the Middle East. Area 51 in Nevada is a secret military base that hides alien spaceships. Actual aliens, too.

As we've heard time and again, conspiracies are a devil to untangle from people's identities and what they want to believe about the world. Anyone trying to contest them is seen as part of the Deep State cover-up. Many interventions have been tried over the decades—offering counterarguments or priming participants to engage in analytical thinking—but a 2023 review of 25 studies found that most existing methods of changing conspiracy beliefs don't work.

This year, though, two studies conducted by psychologists from MIT and Cornell University suggest that when artificial intelligence presents sufficient counterfactual evidence, believers are more apt to change their minds. The first study, published in Science, drew from data from over 1,000 participants. The researchers found that subjects reduced their belief in their chosen conspiracy by, on average, 20 percent after conversing with ChatGPT4-Turbo, a large language model built by OpenAI that had absorbed knowledge from the Internet through April 2023.

The chatbot was transformative. People now doubted their conspiracy theory.

The fact that ChatGPT “knows so much, that it has memorized the internet, it can leverage all of these very specific facts to help people change their beliefs,” says Thomas Costello, lead author of both studies, an assistant professor of psychology at American University and research associate at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

The researchers didn't plant conspiracy theories in participants' heads; rather, the participants were asked to imagine and cite an example where a powerful group was acting secretly and with malevolent intent. If the participant's answer fit the mold of conspiracy theory, they were asked to rate the degree to which they believed in the theory on a scale of 1 to 10. Then ChatGPT went to work to dissuade them, using counterfactual evidence and Socratic questioning, all the while building rapport with the “believers.” The AI conversed in a friendly rather than confrontational manner. Following the conversation, the participant was asked to rate their belief in the conspiracy theory again, with follow up after two months.

For a quarter of participants, a conversation with the chatbot was transformative. Their belief in the conspiracy theory fell below 5 on a scale of 1 to 10, which meant they went from believing in the theory to doubting it. Another quarter of participants simply ended up feeling more tentative about their belief. “For the people who were very versed in their conspiracy theory, we still got an effect on average,” says Costello of the AI intervention.

Costello's and colleagues' initial study got a lot of media coverage when it was released. One intriguing take was a Washington Post column by cognitive psychologist and poker champion Annie Duke. She wrote AI worked so well at changing study participants' minds because they “were not interacting with a human, which, I suspect, didn't trigger identity in the same way, allowing the participants to be more open-minded.” When you're interacting with AI, she continued, “you're not arguing with a human being whom you might be standing in opposition to, which could cause you to be less open-minded.”

I asked Costello if people could be obstacles to convincing others to change their minds, and if the neutral robot is more effective. Costello said he heard that theme often after his initial paper was published. So, he and his colleagues decided to test it.

The idea that AI was effective because it was free of human bias was not born out.

In that follow-up study, currently under peer review, study participants were told that AI would try to persuade them not to believe the conspiracy theory. Participants were also told to try and convince the AI that their conspiracy theory was true, and AI would in turn try and convince them of the error of their ways. The explicitly adversarial frames to these interchanges, the authors believed, would dispel the idea that the AI was unbiased. Like a human, AI was driven to win the argument.

But this difference didn't affect the findings, as participants appeared to trust the information, regardless of the chatbot's intentions. The point that people themselves tarnished information, Costello says, was not born out by the study's findings. “Our finding that the experiment works just as well when the participant thinks they're talking to another person indicates that people are changing their minds in response to information, rather than primarily because they trust AI.”

So, do moon-landing conspiracists simply need to sit down with ChatGPT to be convinced their theory is bollocks? If only it were that easy.

Kerem Oktar, a cognitive scientist at Princeton, who studies society and beliefs, echoes the point that beliefs run to the core of people's beings. A “functional belief,” for instance, ties people to their communities, families, religions, and political groups. Breaking those allegiances would come with a personal or social cost that people aren't willing to gamble on. “If a belief holds functional value, you shouldn't expect just an informational intervention to have a large and robust effect,” Oktar says.

Oktar also points out that people hold “ontological beliefs,” which, he explains, “capture the idea that some things are fundamentally subjective or unknowable.” For instance, some climate-change deniers believe that the climate is too complex to be studied with the tools available to scientists. “That allows you to discount the current state of the evidence or consensus with regards to the facts about the climate,” Oktar says.

It's true, Costello says, a talk with ChatGPT is not going to rid the world of conspiracy theories or always talk true believers off the edge of their flat Earth. But the studies demonstrate that AI is an effective tool for combating misinformation; what's more, they underscore a larger message. “Believers can revise their views if presented with sufficiently compelling evidence,” Costello says.

""My contention is that Earth may, if we are lucky and diligent and clever enough, grow an emergent superconsciousness.""


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The idea that Earth may operate as a single, self-regulating, living organism has existed for decades, emerging in the 1970s as the Gaia hypothesis. In this excerpt from ""Gaia Wakes: Earth's Emerging Consciousness in an Age of Environmental Devastation"" (Columbia University Press, 2025), economic development and peacebuilding expert Topher McDougal describes how Earth might acquire a planetary brain powered by artificial intelligence (AI) in what he dubs the ""Gaiacephalos hypothesis."" McDougal argues that this giant, global brain could benefit humanity by boosting the complexity of life on Earth and ultimately secure a more sustainable future.

What if our entire planet were to grow a consciousness? The human race finds itself aboard a vessel traversing the vastness of the Milky Way — the Spaceship Earth, as Henry George, Kenneth Boulding, Buckminster Fuller, and others since have so appositely described it. But those thinkers were using the phrase only to evoke the limitations placed on human societies in a relatively closed, steady-state system. They were merely implying that our economies can only grow so far before they come up against the very real resource constraints of our tiny planet floating in the vast emptiness of space.

Certainly, the widening scope of environmental devastation humans are wreaking on this planet throws these considerations into stark relief.

But what if Spaceship Earth is itself developing (and indeed has already developed much of the infrastructure to support) a single emergent consciousness? I call this idea the ""Gaiacephalos hypothesis,"" in deference to the ""Gaia hypothesis"" forwarded by James Lovelock, Lynn Margulis, and others, which contends that Earth's interlocking environmental systems could be thought of as a single organism.

I argue that the two phenomena associated with Spaceship Earth — first the global environmental devastation we are starting to experience, and second the development of a planetary brain — are two halves of the same process. This process is part of a naturally recurring cycle that has driven the increasing complexity of life on Earth — one that will, with effort, culminate in the emergence of a global AI-powered ""brain"" capable of coordinating the body planetary.

Could a planet really develop a brain? A mind? Would such an outcome be desirable, and could we thwart that development if not? I don't claim to predict what will happen, but rather what could happen. My contention is that Earth may, if we are lucky and diligent and clever enough, grow an emergent superconsciousness.

The questions this development would beg range from the practical to the philosophical and even quasi-mystical. For instance: Is life itself a natural and inextricable part of the evolution of the universe? Are there any limits to the scale of life? Is life the process by which the universe comes to know and understand itself?

To postulate the growth of a planetary brain may at first sound bizarre, even outlandish. Consequently, many readers may, in an effort to grant me the benefit of the doubt, be tempted to misread this treatise in metaphorical terms. ""Perhaps the author means that the Earth has interlocking systems — climatological, ecological, biophysical — that could be thought of as a 'brain' or be likened to a mind."" But no, let's eliminate any possibility of confusion: I postulate the growth of an emergent neural network — one whose totality is not designed by humans, even if its initial constituent parts are.

This neural network could quite literally enable Earth to achieve unitary consciousness on a massive scale. After the advent of this development, humans would likely continue to play various supporting roles in the life of the planet, but will ultimately find themselves subordinate to and conditioned by a higher intelligence with higher purposes.

What would this new mind consist of in tangible, physical terms? Well, microchips, circuits, superconductors and semiconductors, digital storage devices, fiber optic cables, eventually quantum computers — the stuff of electronic processors and communications. In other words, the planetary mind and the brain supporting it would emerge from what geoscientist Peter Haff has termed the ""technosphere,"" the vast panoply of tools we have created to fashion for ourselves a more interconnected world.



The planetary brain, if it emerges, would likely arise from AI-enhanced, human-made institutions: technologically sophisticated corporations and the governments regulating them, or what we collectively term ""postindustrial economies,"" themselves increasingly cybernetic.

But these interconnected systems and the spectacular potential for information processing they represent operate according to an inherently global logic. As such, a natural scalar synergy exists between high technology and global human institutions, including but not limited to transnational corporations, the United Nations, and transnational social movements. The more extensive the network, the richer its capacities. If they become extensive and fast enough, these systems may, eventually, function together as a brain. And just as in the human brain, where logic may at times war with ""gut"" instinct, or the need for fresh thinking wrestle with well-laid plans, the decisions made by Gaiacephalos would almost always be the mediated results of discussions, conflicts, and compromises amongst constituent analytical components.

The emergence of a planetary mind would not be the first radical scalar upgrade in the complexity of life on Earth. Indeed we have no fewer than four precedents from which to infer the general patterns at work. All previous upgrades have built on the scalar units of their predecessors. All of them have radically increased life's capacity to harness and use energy — in other words, its capacity for entropy.

These entropy-maximizing processes oscillate cyclically between episodes of expansion and centralization, growth and coordination. Successful units first begin to predate others, but eventually forge more mutualistic relationships with them as prey becomes scarce.

Mutualism yields hierarchical collectives. But these collectives are unwieldy; they require the countervailing formation of centralized information-processing to coordinate their myriad functions. Collectives that succeed in developing coordination apparatuses thrive. In this way, a new, higher-order unit emerges.

The first three of Earth's upgrades are studied in biology. They include the emergence of, respectively, prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and brainy multicellular organisms. The fourth of these upgrades is studied in the social sciences, and involves the emergence of centralized states as massively coordinated resource exploiters.

As with the brains of multicellular organisms, Earth's brain will be energetically taxing to maintain. But it will also potentially pay great returns, allowing the planet to seek out new sources of energy, while regulating those internal functions that would dispose of the energy waste (heat). And while human-devised forms of organization would (at least initially) set the parameters for the basic structure, it would likely evolve quickly. Its abilities to make quick sense of terabytes of information, identify and anticipate possible problems, find optimal solutions to them, and take appropriate actions will far outstrip the capacities of human institutional apparatuses.



At least a few questions confront us under the Gaiacephalos scenario. First, is Earth endowed with the resources necessary to afford a planetary brain? Brains are always energy-intensive organs, and the emergence of the Gaiacephalos, nascent though it may be, has already proved extremely taxing to the body planetary.

Larger planets can probably more easily afford to invest in brain development than smaller ones. Do we have the necessary biological capital to support a brain, or will its development prove so costly that the planet falls back to a brainless state? Second, are there smarter policies that we can adopt that can make Gaiacephalos more likely to develop? Third, if we are successful in creating a planetary brain, what would daily life for humans look like? Will we be part of this brain? Or will we have worked ourselves out of a job? Will the planetary intelligence that emerges be inimical to human flourishing? And will our free will be totally overridden by this potential tyrant? And finally, what are the implications of the emergence of a planetary brain for our understanding of the universe and our place in it?

—Climate wars are approaching — and they will redefine global conflict

—Can our brains help prove the universe is conscious?

—'We can't answer these questions': Neuroscientist Kenneth Kosik on whether lab-grown brains will achieve consciousness

I cannot claim that what I describe will happen. Nor can I even say I believe it is statistically probable. It is for me one analytic possibility of uncertain likelihood. The argument traces a hopeful path into the future, but that hope should not bias our assessments of the path's likelihood of success.

But this argument does have the potential to direct our policy actions in order to make this path more likely. In that sense, it might serve as a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is important enough to deserve our attention, and perhaps also our best collective efforts: it may prove preferable to the foreseeable alternatives. It is something to run towards, rather than merely run away from. For those who despair of ever achieving environmental sustainability, it may plot one feasible course toward a version of that end.

A 35-year-old man diagnosed with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) claims that the mere thought of eating fruits, vegetables, eggs, or meat is enough to make him sick.

Calling Thomas Sheridan a picky eater would be an understatement. The 35-year-old UK man relies on a very strict daily diet that usually consists of two loaves of white bread, three bowls of Shreddies cereal, and lots of Haribo sweets, and he has never tasted fruits and vegetables. Because of his bland diet, he needs to take protein and vitamin supplements, but only those with a taste profile that he can stomach. The unemployed man claims to have made attempts to diversify his diet, but they have all ended in failure. A couple of years ago, he was diagnosed with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), an eating disorder that prevents sufferers from eating certain foods, and despite several attempted treatments, his daily diet remains incredibly restricted.

“There was one time when we started drinking and everyone used to talk about bacon sandwiches when they were roughed up,” Sheridan told SWNS. “I attempted to make an egg and sausage butty one day, and as soon as the egg touched my mouth, I vomited about 10 feet across the room.”

Thomas' parents recall that he started rejecting certain foods when he was 18 months old. He just “shut his mouth” one day, and all efforts to make him try fruits and vegetables failed. Doctors advised starving him until he ate what was offered to him, and his father tried offering him rewards, but nothing worked. At school, he was allowed to go home at lunchtime to eat toast because he couldn't stomach school lunches. As an adult, his aversion to certain foods has prevented him from leading a normal life and made it harder for him to work.

 ﻿

“The last time I worked over a 10-day period, I lost 21 pounds,” Thomas said.

Desperate to incorporate new foods into his daily diet, the 35-year-old man is now trying to raise $8,000 for hypnotherapy, but there are no guarantees that it will help cure his ARFID.

Senior EU officials, such as foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, represent a “tragedy” for the bloc, Slovak MEP Lubos Blaha has told RT. Blaha also accused top officials in Brussels of supporting fascism.

The MEP's remarks come after Brussels criticized Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's attendance at Russia's May 9 Victory Day celebrations in Moscow last week. 

Kallas warned EU officials and candidate countries against taking part in the event, urging them to travel to Kiev instead. Other EU officials warned that candidate states such as Serbia would have their status renewed if their leaders attended the celebrations in Russia.

According to Blaha, the criticism directed at Fico and other leaders, such as Serbia's Aleksandar Vucic, wasn't genuinely about the conflict in Ukraine. “The real truth is different. The real truth is that their anti-fascism is pretended,” he said.

Blaha used the example of this year's ceremony in the European Parliament commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, describing it as somber. 

“It was like a funeral. Everyone was so sad, and in the end, Beethoven was playing,” Blaha said, noting that the same music was used by Germany broadcasts after the Battle of Stalingrad. “This is the same tradition.” 

“If the European Union is governed by people like Kaja Kallas, then it's a tragedy,” he added.

Kallas, who previously served as the prime minister of Estonia, has repeatedly spoken out harshly against Russia and has labeled Moscow as the EU's primary adversary, while advocating for increased militarization of the European bloc. 

Her warnings to EU member states and candidate countries about attending the Moscow Victory Day celebrations were met with condemnation from Russian officials, who labeled her threats as “blackmail.”

“Euro-Nazism is being reborn before our eyes,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in response to Kallas' threats. “This is how the fascists 80 years ago forced those they considered ‘second-class people' to renounce their homeland, ethnicity, and faith,” she wrote on Telegram.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has also criticized Kallas as a “rabid Russophobe,” and recently claimed that “manifestations of neo-Nazism in Europe” are “significant,” and called for extensive efforts to combat the trend.

Echoing these sentiments, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev recently claimed that neo-Nazism is on the rise in Europe. He called for a comprehensive “de-Nazification” effort not just in Ukraine, but across the entire continent.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban is vilifying neighboring Ukraine in a bid to appeal to his supporters and discredit the opposition. 

The video clip shows investigators, fingerprints, crime scene photos, a drug lab and bullet casings, then the head of a black wolf looking maliciously into the camera. A man speaks in a deep, menacing voice: ""Drug and arms trafficking is the specialty of the Ukrainian mafia. Their mercilessness is notorious worldwide. The war has brought more weapons into their hands than ever before."" 

A tank rolls across the screen, a man puts on a balaclava, then there's a photo of EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ""Brussels is playing with fire,"" the voice continues. ""If Ukraine joins the EU, the Ukrainian mafia will come to Hungary unhindered.""

This and similar clips are currently all over Hungary's pro-government media platforms. They're part of a campaign recently launched by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban against Ukraine's EU accession process.

All Hungarian citizens have until June 20 to vote on whether they are for or against Ukraine joining the EU. Hungary's government is — not surprisingly — against it.

Orban has been on a pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian course for years. But recently, the sharpness of his tone and the bluntness of his language against Ukraine have been on the rise. His current campaign tops any of his previous smear and defamation campaigns by far — and that includes his controversial national consultations stoking anti-immigrant sentiments, or his antisemitic attacks against the billionaire George Soros. 

These are propaganda lies that are as shocking as they are racist. The neighboring country is portrayed as the ""center of drug trafficking and organized crime in Eastern Europe,"" as a mass of barbaric people who either belong to the mafia or are waiting to flood Hungary with their ""cheap labor"" and collect Hungarian pensions. If Ukraine were a member of the EU, one text from the campaign claimed, public security and the health system in Hungary would collapse.

Brussels, meanwhile, as the heart of the EU, is portrayed as the one pulling the strings. 

As absurd as all this sounds, the background to the campaign is easy to explain. All in all, it boils down to Hungarian domestic politics.

In Hungary, Orban fatigue has spread among the majority of the population, also encouraged by corruption and a disregard for the rule of law on the part of Orban himself, as well as his family and his inner circle.

Opposition leader Peter Magyar — the first serious challenger for prime minister in a long time — is by far the most popular politician in the polls. His Respect and Freedom (Tisza) party is well ahead of Orban's Hungarian Civic Alliance (Fidesz) party.

Parliamentary elections are set for next spring. As things stand at present, Orban could lose — and subsequently face investigation proceedings and imprisonment for corruption and abuse of office.

Against this backdrop, the prime minister and his government have long been trying to find a way to discredit Magyar. Recently, Ukraine has presented itself as an opportunity. But when Orban vaguely announced the current anti-Ukrainian campaign in March, Magyar got moving to respond — and fast.

Thousands of volunteers from the Tizsa party gathered opinions in every Hungarian town and municipality on a range of issues, including Ukrainian membership of the EU. The result was probably surprising even for Magyar: In total, 58%of Hungarians supported Ukraine's bid to join the bloc.

When this fact became public knowledge, Orban and his government did not accuse the Tisza party of lying — instead they came up with the narrative for the current campaign.

It put out messages about ""war-mongering Brussels,"" which, it said, finances Ukraine and, together with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, ""bought"" the Tisza party in order to overthrow the ""national, pro-Hungarian peace government"" in Hungary and bring a ""pro-Ukrainian, anti-national war party"" to power.

In reality, Magyar and his party are hardly enthusiastic supporters of Ukraine. It's unclear to what extent Orban's campaign will have an impact beyond his very tight-knit camp of supporters.

Beyond this, the prime minister's anti-Ukrainian stance serves the nostalgic revisionist sentiments of his own and other far-right voters in Hungary, who dream of Transcarpathia, a historical region on the border between Central and Eastern Europe, becoming part of the Hungarian state. Parts of this western Ukrainian region belonged to Austria-Hungary before World War I.

In his speeches, Orban repeatedly invokes the ""unity of all Hungarians"" and at the same time speaks of Ukraine as a ""no man's land"" or an ""area called Ukraine"" — deliberately hinting at a possible fragmentation of Ukrainian territory.

In terms of foreign policy, Orban's anti-Ukrainian stance can also be interpreted as a declaration of loyalty to Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump. Good relations with Putin play a particularly important role for Orban, as he has tied Hungary to Russia, both economically and financially.

While Orban and his government portray Ukraine as a corrupt mafia state, they have repeatedly protected Russian oligarchs who have links to organized crime and are included on EU sanctions lists for war crimes. Orban's government, for example, sought to have oligarchs such as Alisher Usmanov or Mikhail Fridman removed from the EU sanctions lists.

As far as the alleged mafia state of Ukraine is concerned, experts, for example, from the Organization for Economic Cooperation in Europe, agree that the rule of law is far more established there than in Hungary. It says a fight against corruption is being waged successfully even during the ongoing war. That contrasts with Hungary, where there are no visible steps in this direction.

Data includes full flight itineraries, passenger name records and financial details which are otherwise hard to obtain.

This article was originally published by The Lever, an investigative newsroom. If you like this story, sign up for The Lever's free newsletter.

A massive aviation industry clearinghouse that processes data for 12 billion passenger flights per year is selling that information to the Trump administration amid the White House's new immigration crackdown, according to documents reviewed by The Lever.

The data — including “full flight itineraries, passenger name records, and financial details, which are otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain” for past and future flights — is fed into a secretive government intelligence operation called the Travel Intelligence Program and provided to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies, records reveal.

Details of this program were outlined in procurement documents released Wednesday by ICE, which is a division of the Department of Homeland Security.

Privacy and travel industry experts interviewed by The Lever said that law enforcement's access to such a vast database — with little information on what privacy or other restrictions are in place — raises serious civil liberties concerns.

“This is probably the single most significant aggregated repository of data about American air travelers,” said Edward Hasbrouck, an expert in travel data privacy. “That the government has gotten access to it is a very big deal.”

When a passenger buys a flight through a travel agency — including via common online booking sites like Booking.com or Expedia — the transaction is fed through the Airlines Reporting Corporation, which acts as an intermediary between travel agencies and airlines. 

So, although most airline passengers have never heard of the Airlines Reporting Corporation, there's a good chance that their data has, at some point, passed through the company. Its dataset includes information on 54 percent of all flights taken globally, according to the company's website.

In a statement to The Lever, a spokesperson for the company said that the Travel Intelligence Program “was established after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to provide certain data to law enforcement … for the purpose of national security matters” and criminal investigations.

The spokesperson declined to answer questions about whether clients outside the U.S. government have access to the data.

The company is jointly owned by nine major airlines, most of which are U.S.-based: Delta, Southwest, United, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, JetBlue, Air Canada, Lufthansa, and Air France. But more than 200 airlines settle tickets through the Airlines Reporting Corporation, giving the company unparalleled, comprehensive access to passenger data. 

The company claims to manage the database in partnership with the International Air Transport Association, the primary lobbying group for airlines.

Consumer advocates have already been concerned about the monopoly that the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) has established over airline passenger data. Because no other comparable financial clearinghouse exists in aviation, there's no alternative for travel agencies or consumers to use instead.

“[The company] has long had a virtual monopoly on processing airline bookings,” explained Bill McGee, a senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project, a consumer protection watchdog organization. Through this, McGee explained, the Airlines Reporting Corporation “collects massive amounts of personal data on consumers, including information on finances, travel itineraries, shopping patterns.”

“To hear that ARC is now selling such personal information to the government is rather chilling,” McGee said.

The Lever contacted each of the nine airlines that are shareholders of the Airlines Reporting Corporation for this story. United Airlines declined to comment, referring questions instead to the Department of Homeland Security; the others did not reply. 

The Airlines Reporting Corporation has for many years provided commercial access to high-level data, offering travel trend reports and transaction data for a price. But several experts interviewed by The Lever said they were completely unaware that the company was providing its data to the government.

“I have never seen government access to ARC — or even ARC itself — mentioned in an airline privacy policy or a travel agency policy,” Hasbrouck said. “Never.”

Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst focusing on privacy at the American Civil Liberties Union, said that the program appears to have “flown by and below the radar.” 

“Why is [ARC] turning into a side business of selling data about people's travels to the Trump administration?” Stanley asked, saying that the documents raised “a lot of serious questions.”

Federal law enforcement has other ways to access flight data. Already, U.S. Customs and Border Protection demands that airlines hand over passenger records for every flight that passes through the United States, and there have been reports in the past of federal law enforcement, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, accessing passenger data through travel agencies' reservation systems and other intermediaries.

But the new documents indicate that the Airlines Reporting Corporation provides data that federal law enforcement cannot obtain elsewhere.

In the documents — published to provide notice that ICE is entering into a no-bid contract with the company — officials write that the Airlines Reporting Corporation database “is the only company in the U.S. that provides this level of real-time travel data access to law enforcement.”

The Airlines Reporting Corporation provides this data to ICE and Department of Homeland Security analysts through the Travel Intelligence Program, which is described in the documents as proprietary software.

“The [Travel Intelligence Program] database holds over one billion records, spanning 39 months of past and future travel data — an unparalleled intelligence resource,” the documents say.

In this database, “analysts gain unrestricted access to all sold ticket databases, enabling targeted searches by name or credit card number,” the documents continue.

The data is useful in part because it is aggregated, Hasbrouck explained. While Customs and Border Protection receives data from individual air carriers, the data is not always in a consistent place or format. 

“If you've got data that's scattered all over the place in different formats, you've got to query each one separately,” Hasbrouck said. “That's a lot harder. You can do more analysis if you've got aggregated data.”

It's unclear how long the federal government has used the Airlines Reporting Corporation repository. ICE inked a one-year contract for the data in 2023, according to the documents. But federal spending records indicate that the access goes back further. The Department of Homeland Security, in procurement records, references an “investigative database” hosted by the Airlines Reporting Corporation as far back as 2018.

Furthermore, it's not just ICE that has access to the data. The Department of Defense in 2017 signed a contract with the Airlines Reporting Corporation for “airline ticketing and reporting data,” records show. And the Department of the Treasury signed a contract in 2020 for Travel Intelligence Program software, records show. 

For the Airlines Reporting Corporation, these federal contracts have been lucrative. According to government spending records, the company has received at least $600,000 from federal contracts so far in 2025, and about $700,000 last year.

The new contracts come amid a significant budget increase for ICE under the Trump administration.

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not reply to inquiries from The Lever on Thursday.

Hasbrouck said that law enforcement's access to such data comes with “a lot of potential for abuse.” This may be particularly true amid the Trump administration's ongoing immigration crackdown, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement targets green card holders over their political views and sends immigrants to El Salvador without a hearing. 

“How will this information be used?” said McGee. “What safeguards on privacy and personal rights will be in place? There are far too many unanswered questions.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

The US president will not visit Israel on a trip to the Middle East and his envoy has reportedly said Netanyahu's government is drawing out the war

Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff didn't mince his words. In a meeting late on Sunday with former hostages and relatives of those still held in Gaza, he told them Israel is drawing out a war the US wants to end, local media reported.

On the eve of the release of Edan Alexander, the last living American being held by Hamas, Witkoff spelt out the gulf between his boss and the government of Benjamin Netanyahu.

“We want to bring the hostages home, but Israel is not willing to end the war. Israel is prolonging it – despite the fact that we don't see where else we can go and that an agreement must be reached,” Witkoff told the meeting, according to Channel 12 Television, quoting sources who were present.

It was the latest in a series of high-profile and high-stakes snubs from the White House which suggest that Israel's most important ally is frustrated with its government – and possibly losing interest in its fortunes.

“Trump's not against Israel, but he doesn't care about Israel,” said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat. “As far as Trump is concerned, Netanyahu has become an irritant and an irritant that doesn't contribute to the bank account.”

Trump may not have embarked on the open attacks that have characterised his relationship with other leaders fighting a war he wants to end, such as Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia's Vladimir Putin, but recent policy moves have undermined Israeli security, weakened its diplomatic standing and flown against Israeli defence policy, particularly over how to handle Iran.

Last week Trump announced a ceasefire deal with the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen which excluded Israel. He described the Houthi rebels as “brave” just days after one of their missiles hit Israel's main airport, prompting many international airlines to suspend flights. Houthi attacks on Israel have continued.

He previously dismissed Israeli calls for military action against Iran, instead opening talks with Tehran on ending its nuclear programme.

Days after the Houthi ceasefire deal, news leaked that the Trump administration had dropped a Biden-era demand that linked progress on a Saudi Arabian civilian nuclear programme to normalising relations with Israel.

Saudi Arabia has ruled out normalisation while Israel is at war in Gaza. Trump's move made clear he doesn't want his hands to be tied as he heads to Riyadh later this week to seal billions of dollars in expected deals.

His first trip to the region since returning to the White House will also include visits to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, but not Israel. That conspicuous absence from the presidential itinerary would have been unthinkable in recent decades.

Ilan Baruch, a former Israeli ambassador who now chairs the Policy Working Group, which advocates for a two-state solution, said: “Trump, it seems, has embarked on a bluntly new trajectory.

“Israel was expecting the Trump administration to stay the course within a paradigm of ‘shared convictions and mutual strategic interests'. Trump is the first president in a generation to put this equation in doubt.”

Strong, long-term support for Israel among much of Trump's Republican base means Netanyahu is in a better position to hold on to US support than a leader like the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Nadav Eyal, a research scholar at Columbia University and a commentator with the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.

“As to how serious the damage is, I would say right now it is not lasting … not a full blown crisis yet,” he said. “I suspect that both sides will try to mitigate, negotiate, and not make it a public confrontation.”

Still, Netanyahu's celebration of Israel-US ties at the start of the year, when he was the first foreign leader invited to Trump's second-term White House, now look premature.

Although Alexander's release was agreed without Israeli input, Netanyahu responded initially not by thanking Trump but by in effect claiming credit for it.

“The expected release of IDF soldier Edan Alexander without anything in return will be possible due to the vigorous policy that we have led with the backing of President Trump, and thanks to the military pressure of IDF soldiers in the Gaza Strip,” his office said in a statement before his planned release.

He is already facing the fury of hostage families and their supporters, who say he is extending the war – and their suffering – for personal political gain. One, Einav Tsengauker, described the prime minister on Monday as an “angel of death”.

But Netanyahu's truculent response to the release of Alexander risks stirring up the anger of a far more potent enemy, whose endless appetite for praise and deference is now the basis of global foreign policy from Beijing to Brussels.

Trump's post celebrating Alexander's release spelt out what he wants to see next. “Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. I look very much forward to that day of celebration!”

There is broad support inside Israel for ending the war in return for the release of all hostages, with opinion polls showing more than two-thirds of the country back a deal.

But those who want to carry on fighting include the leaders of two far-right parties at the heart of Netanyahu's coalition. That leaves Netanyahu potentially facing a choice between shoring up his government, or shoring up Israel's most important relationship.

“If he wants Trump back on his side, then he needs to do things that would cost him the coalition,” said Pinkas, the former diplomat. “If you look at his biography and experience, he should be fully aware of all this. If you look at his behaviour, it's as if he has no idea what's going on.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Russia, on May 10, 2025. (Contributor / Getty Images)

Russian President Vladimir Putin may have gotten more than he bargained for when, on May 11, he rejected calls for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire and invited Ukraine to engage in direct talks in Istanbul later this week.

In what may have been a surprise for the Russian leader, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded by accepting the invitation, saying he was ready to meet Putin in Turkey on May 15. 

""This is not what Putin was expecting,"" Oleksandr Merezhko, a Ukrainian lawmaker and chair of the parliament's foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent.

""This is an incredible move that turns the tables completely — Putin thought that he would send a Russian delegation, and create the illusion of negotiations,"" he said, adding: ""But now, because of this move by Zelensky, he is faced with a dilemma which cannot be solved.""

Ahead of the May 15 meeting, a source close to the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine is ""ready for all options"" — but there are still several unanswered questions, potential curveballs from the White House,  and multiple ways the week could turn out.

With all the talk of possible meetings, it's easy to forget that it all resulted from one thing — Russia's refusal to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire.

Initially proposed by the U.S. back in March, Ukraine signed up for a full, 30-day ceasefire on March 11. Russia has consistently refused to agree to the truce, instead unilaterally announcing short-term ceasefires that Ukraine says have all been violated by Moscow itself.

The idea was given fresh impetus over the weekend after talks between Ukraine, France, the U.K., Germany, and Poland, after which they said that no negotiations can begin without a full and unconditional ceasefire.

Putin made no mention of any ceasefire during his televised address on May 11 when he floated the idea of talks, but Kyiv's European allies have kept up the pressure, insisting Moscow agree by midnight on May 13.

""The clock is ticking — we still have 12 hours until the end of this day,"" German government spokesperson Stefan Kornelius said, adding that Berlin is coordinating with European partners on additional sanctions.

According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Russian forces have so far not honored the proposed ceasefire from May 12 and continued attacking Ukrainian positions across the front throughout the day.

With no indication at present that the Kremlin is going to agree to a ceasefire, the European nations demanding it will have to follow through with their threat of imposing additional sanctions on Russia.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, an EU official told the Kyiv Independent that the bloc will unveil its next package of sanctions against Russia on May 14.


""If he doesn't come, it will be obvious even to Trump, that Putin is not a person with whom he can negotiate, that he is incapable of negotiations."" 
    

Details of what will be the 17th package imposed on Moscow since the start of the full-scale invasion remain unclear, though earlier reporting suggested it could include measures aimed at Russia's military-industrial complex, Moscow's shadow shipping fleet, and related support networks.

While Zelensky has clearly stated his intention to travel to Istanbul — seemingly walking back on the demand for a full ceasefire to be implemented before negotiations can begin — Putin has not, and now faces what Merezhko referred to as a ""dilemma.""

""If he doesn't come, it will be obvious even to (U.S. President Donald) Trump, that Putin is not a person with whom he can negotiate, that he is incapable of negotiations,"" Merezhko said.

But if he does travel to Istanbul, ""then again, he loses,"" Merezhko said.

Putin does not see himself as Zelensky's equal, and has repeatedly mocked him and called him ""illegitimate,"" so to appear on the same level on the global stage would, in Russian eyes, make him look ""really weak,"" Merezhko.

""He has no solution,"" he added.

Whether or not Putin attends in person, there is deep skepticism in Kyiv regarding the prospects of a meeting bearing anything significant.

""Putin does not want any peace talks, because his goal is to seize Ukraine,"" Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, a lawmaker from the Holos party and chairman of the parliamentary committee on freedom of speech, said.

""Therefore, he is looking for any opportunity to stall for time, gushing with proposals for meetings and demands, hoping that Ukraine will refuse and this will show us in an unfavorable light,"" he added.

Yurchyshyn said Zelensky has ""seized the initiative"" when saying he would attend the meeting, but expects ""Putin will find another excuse not to come.""

One possible excuse on the cards is a decree approved by Zelensky in the fall of 2022, that ""stated the impossibility of holding negotiations with Russian President Putin,"" as a response to Russia's illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, parts of which it didn't even control.

Moscow has previously cited Zelensky's decree as a ban on talks with Putin and used it as an excuse for avoiding direct talks with Kyiv.

But according to a source in the President's Office, the decree was a ""a signal to those in Ukraine who wanted to speak (to Russians) bypassing the central government.""

They added that it had been ""twisted"" by the Kremlin and it was in fact solely up to Zelensky to determine if he could speak directly with Putin. 

Regardless, Ukrainian lawmakers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent all believe the Kremlin will find some way to get out of it.

""Therefore, this will be another illustration that Ukraine is looking for a solution, and Russia is not. Whether Trump will recognize this is an open question,"" Yurchyshyn said.

Trump has been vocal and enthusiastic about the meeting in Istanbul, despite it still falling far short of the full 30-day ceasefire that Trump himself has been calling for.

And in a significant development on May 12, he said he believed ""both leaders are going to be there,"" in reference to Zelensky and Putin, putting huge pressure on the Russian president.

""I think we may see a good result from Thursday's meeting in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine,"" Trump said during a press conference, adding: ""I even thought about flying over — I'm not sure where I'll be on Thursday, I have so many meetings.""

Despite placing enormous amounts of pressure on Ukraine to end the full-scale invasion, Trump has so far made no concrete moves to do the same with the side ultimately responsible for starting — and ending — the war.

The U.S. president's stance has hardened in recent weeks, and in Kyiv, there is hope that Russia can only stall and distract for so long until Washington acknowledges the game the Kremlin is playing.

""It is important that Trump finally begins to understand that Putin has been pulling the wool over his eyes, deceiving him, and using him for the Kremlin's advantage,"" Volodymyr Ariev, a Ukrainian lawmaker from the opposition European Solidarity Party, told the Kyiv Independent.

Aside from hoping the U.S. will see the light and start treating Russia as the only ones who can stop their own full-scale invasion, Ukraine is still hoping for some solid progress in the peace talks process. 

""Our key objective in Istanbul must be to secure a real ceasefire — starting with a 30-day halt in hostilities. That's our short-term goal,"" Halyna Yanchenko, a lawmaker from the Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent.

""I believe it's achievable, but only with the support of our international partners and strong external pressure on Russia, including through sanctions.""

Yelyzaveta Yasko, also from the Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent that developments over the last few days and the European unity with Ukraine on display had been ""optimistic,"" but cautioned that it didn't mean there would be a ""positive outcome"" for the peace process ""anytime soon.""

Failing any concrete progress, Ukraine must make sure it is in a position to defend against further offensives from Russia, Ariev said.

""If China does not begin direct support to Russia in 2026, Russia will not be able to continue a total war,"" he said.

""The Ukrainian goal is to keep a very strong relationship and coordination with the European Union and the American administration, convince our partners to level sanctions against the Russian Federation, and to maintain support and supply the Ukrainian army with weapons and everything that it needs.""

In his first remarks after the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, the Prime Minister promised strong retaliation for future attacks. Meanwhile, military officials held talks regarding the ceasefire. DW has more. 

Here is a roundup of developments from India and Pakistan on Monday, May 12:

The Board of Control for Cricket in India said the Indian Premier League will resume on Saturday.

""After extensive consultations with government and security agencies, and with all the key stakeholders, the Board has decided to proceed with the remainder of the season,"" it said in a statement. 

A total of 17 matches will be held across six venues, which will be announced later. 

The IPL is the sport's richest tournament.

It was suspended last week as fighting escalated between India and Pakistan. 

Pakistani Ambassador to Germany Saqlain Syedah told DW the international community must address the issue of Kashmir.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to deliver a strong response to any future ""terrorist attack,"" after a weekend ceasefire with Pakistan halted several days of military conflict between the neighbors.

""If another terrorist attack against India is carried out, a strong response will be given,"" Modi said in a televised address to the nation, adding that New Delhi would not tolerate ""nuclear blackmail"" in the event of conflict.

He also said Pakistan must dismantle its ""terrorist infrastructure"" if it wants to be ""saved,"" delivering his first public remarks since last week's deadly military clashes between the two countries.

""I will tell the global community also, if we talk to Pakistan, it will be about terrorism only... it will be about Pakistan-occupied Kashmir,"" Modi said in a televised address, referring to the region administered by Pakistan.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his first public comment on the recent military conflict between India and Pakistan, stating that the Indian Army had been given full operational freedom during the clashes.

""We gave a free hand to the Indian Army to bury the terrorists,'"" Modi said.

Modi said more than 100 ""terrorists"" were killed in India's strikes and that the strikes specifically targeted terrorist hideouts and training centres located in Pakistan.

The recent hostilities came in in the wake of the April 22 attack, which saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed by Islamist militants near the mountain town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir.

India blamed Pakistan for backing the militants and launched ""Operation Sindoor,"" a series of airstrikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Pakistan denied the accusations and carried out strikes against Indian targets.

Both agreed over the weekend to a ceasefire that seems to be largely holding. 

US President Donald Trump says it was US intervention that helped prevent a nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan, following the ceasefire agreement reached by the two South Asian rivals after a series of clashes.

""We stopped a nuclear conflict. I think it could have been a bad nuclear war, millions of people could have been killed. So I'm very proud of that,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.

Expert teams in India defused unexploded bombs along the border with Pakistan, the AFP news agency is reporting.

The move is to allow displaced Kashmiri villagers to begin returning home following a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed nations.

Tens of thousands had fled their homes on the Indian-administered side of the disputed Himalayan region last week, as intense artillery fire reduced some homes to rubble.

The ceasefire, announced on Saturday, brought an end to four days of missile, drone, and artillery exchanges. The violence has been the worst violence between India and Pakistan since 1999.

Police had issued formal warnings urging the public ""NOT to under any circumstances approach, touch, tamper with, or attempt to move any suspicious object resembling an explosive shell or device.""

Bomb disposal squads were deployed in Uri, near the de facto border, to ensure homes were safe before civilians returned.

""We started at homes where people had reported unexploded ordinance,"" senior police officer Gurinderpal Singh told AFP. He declined to disclose how many teams were involved or their specific locations.

""Every piece of ordinance is unique and needs to be handled very carefully,"" Singh added, noting that villagers were only being allowed to return to ""areas that have been cleared.""

India and Pakistan's military operations chiefs held a phone conversation on Monday evening, CNN-News18 has reported, only two days after the nuclear-armed neighbors agreed to a ceasefire following intense clashes last week.

The two countries had exchanged missile, drone and artillery fire across each other's airspace over four days of conflict.

Earlier the Indian military said both sides' director generals of military operations would speak by telephone, but gave no further information. 

Pakistan's army spokesperson told local media that his country reacted rather mildly to India's army operation against it due to the risk of ""mutual annihilation.""

According to Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the conflict between India and Pakistan ""can lead to the peril of more than 1.6 billion people.""

Chaudhry said that there was ""no space"" for war between New Delhi and Islamabad. 

""If anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving our space for mutual annihilation,"" he said.

The spokesman said that Pakistan's military response had been carried out ""in a very mature manner.""

After the worst escalation between the two countries in the past two decades, a ceasefire has been in place since Saturday.

DW correspondent Shalu Yadav, speaking about 15 miles (24 km) from the Line of Control between India and Pakistan, said it was the first time ""in days that people have woken up to a peaceful morning.""

""Today there is a sigh of relief but there is still a little bit of tension on the ground,"" she added when asked about the mood amongst locals.

However, she cautioned, their safety was far from certain at the moment. Although India and Pakistan have technically had a ceasefire over the region since 2003, it has been broke ""time and time again.""

""It's gonna take a lot of effort on both sides to iron out the details of the [most recent] ceasefire,"" Yadav said.

Yadav was speaking from the town of Rajouri in the Jammu region of Indian-administered Kashmir.



Speaking to the Indian Express daily, Germany's ambassador to New Dehli, Philipp Ackermann, was asked if he saw the violence in Pahalgam as similar to the 2008 terror attacks on Mumbai that killed some 175 people.

""The Pahalgam attack was horrifying for its selective killings. It should be called a terrorist attack and has had an impact on the consciousness,"" Ackermann said.

""You cannot help but feel strongly when you see the families and spouses of those who have been killed. It's heartbreaking to see the young and newly-married lose their husbands,"" he said.

He described the attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir as a ""game changer.""

""Pahalgam is a game changer in many ways and there's an enormous amount of solidarity that has gone out to India.""

He added that he was in Kashmir last year and had noticed how things had changed since 15 years ago when he ""saw tourists everywhere.""

Ackermann stressed that Germany stood with Delhi after this ""attack on the heart of India"" but said that ""both governments know that de-escalation is the question of the hour.""

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a ""high level"" meeting with several ministers and army chiefs.

This comes after Saturday's US-brokered ceasefire came into force, with the night being calm for the first time in days, according to India's army.

India and Pakistan's military operation chiefs are set to meet this evening to discuss the ceasefire.

India and Pakistan's chiefs of military operations are set to discuss the next steps after the US-brokered ceasefire restored calm to the border region between the countries.

After initial reports of ceasefire violations, no explosions were heard in the region overnight.

India's army said this was the first peaceful night along the country's border in recent days.

The Indian army confirmed the talks will take place in the evening local time. 

India's airport authority said the 32 airports in the country's northern and western regions that were out of operation due to the military escalation in Pakistan will now be reopened, with civil aircraft being able to make use of them with immediate effect.

This comes after a similar announcement made by Pakistan on Saturday as the announcement on the US-brokered ceasefire was made.

India and Pakistan have reopened airports that had been shut due to the escalation between the countries after a ceasefire was reached.

Senior military officials from both countries are also set to hold talks regarding the ongoing ceasefire.

On Sunday, India and Pakistan traded accusations of ceasefire violations but reported that hostilities had not intensified.

Germany and Israel are commemorating the beginning of their postwar relationship, with the war in Gaza omnipresent.

Sixty years ago, on May 12, 1965, Germany and Israel established diplomatic relations after a long period of preparation. It was anything but a matter of course at the time: World War II had ended just two decades earlier, and the memory of Nazi Germany's genocide of the European Jews was present in both countries. Even now, 80 years after the end of the war, relations with Israel remain extremely important, but also difficult.

Israeli President Isaac Herzog is coming to Berlin to mark the anniversary. Together with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, he plans to visit the ""Platform 17"" Holocaust memorial at Grunewald station in southwest Berlin. Some 10,000 Jews were deported from the train station to concentration camps during the Nazi era.

Herzog will meet with more than 100 German and Israeli youth, well aware that antisemitism has risen sharply, especially among young people in Germany, since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip more than a year and a half ago. Herzog and Steinmeier will then travel to Israel together and visit a kibbutz on the border with Gaza.

The visit takes place during the first days of the new German government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz of the conservative Christian Democrats(CDU). Like all chancellors before him, Merz is aware of Germany's special responsibility for Israel.

When former German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) visited Israel in 2008 and spoke in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, she used the term ""reason of state"" (Staatsräson) to describe this responsibility. In her view, Germany has a special political responsibility for the existence and security of Israel.

The ""reason of state"" is a political maxim, not a legal one. But chancellors after Merkel (and most of those before her) have always acted and continue to act in line with this fundamental principle.

Despite all the criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza, German politicians have repeatedly emphasized that Israel has the right to defend itself after the terror attacks by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7, 2023. The European Union, the United States, Germany and several other countries classify Hamas as a terrorist organization. Almost 1,200 people were killed in the attack, and around 250 people were taken hostage. 

In practice, however, fulfilling this maxim can be extremely difficult. Criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza is also growing in Germany. Israel has been blocking aid deliveries to the Palestinian territory since the beginning of March, resulting in hunger and death. The war in Gaza, which Israel started in retaliation for the 2023 Hamas attacks, has so far killed more than 52,600 people in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory, according to figures from its health authorities regarded as reliable by international organizations.   

In his first interview as chancellor, Merz told public broadcaster ARD: ""Israel is of the utmost concern to us. The new foreign minister will be traveling to Israel next weekend on my behalf. I don't want to anticipate. We are currently preparing this trip together. But it must be clear that the Israeli government must also fulfill its obligations under international law, under the international law of war.""

In November 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, among others, over alleged war crimes in Gaza. Germany is one of the founding members of the ICC and would have to arrest Netanyahu if he came to Germany.

Nevertheless, the day after the German election in February, Merz said after a telephone conversation with Netanyahu that, as chancellor, he would find ways and means ""to ensure that [Netanyahu] can visit Germany and leave again without being arrested in Germany."" Merz has not repeated that phrase since he was elected chancellor.

Instead, the new chancellor said on ARD: ""Israel has the right to defend itself against this brutal attack by Hamas terrorists on October 7 and everything that followed. But Israel must also remain a country that lives up to its humanitarian obligations, especially where this terrible war is now taking place — in the Gaza Strip, where this confrontation with the Hamas terrorists is necessarily taking place.""

The dispute over the arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister shows how complicated the relationship between the two countries still is today and how it is influenced by the Gaza war. Although the previous Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, of the environmentalist Greens, often visited Israel after the outbreak of the war, Netanyahu's last visit to Berlin was more than two years ago in March 2023, when Netanyahu visited then-Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD).

Germany also holds so-called government ""consultations"" with Israel — meetings between the entire cabinets of both sides. The consultations are intended to underline the special importance of the relationship. Germany holds such meetings with just 12 countries worldwide. The last consultations with Israel took place more than seven years ago.

Donald Trump has granted refugee status to white South Africans who claim they face racial discrimination in their home country.

A group of 49 white South Africans boarded a charter flight from Johannesburg on Sunday night and are set to arrive at Washington DC's Dulles international airport on Monday, in a move that ratchets up tensions between the two nations.

Despite halting nearly all other refugee admissions shortly after returning to office in January, the president swiftly organised a scheme to allow in Afrikaners, the descendants of mostly Dutch settlers, who say they have been denied jobs and targeted with violence because of their race.

Giving refugee status to white South Africans has been met with a mixture of alarm and ridicule by South African officials, who accused the Trump administration of wading into a domestic political issue it does not understand.

“The government unequivocally states that these are not refugees,” South African foreign ministry spokesperson Chrispin Phiri told local broadcaster Newzroom Afrika. “But we are not going to stand in their way.”

Tensions between South Africa and the US have simmered for months after the president signed an executive order in February cutting off American aid amid claims the country was discriminating against white farmers, whom he offered to resettle in the US.

His comment echoed those of Elon Musk, his close adviser who was born and raised in South Africa, who has accused the country of having “racist ownership laws” which equate to “genocide” against white farmers.

These allegations were dismissed by South Africa's Foreign Minister Ronald Lamoa, who said on Monday “there is no persecution of white Afrikaner South Africans”, adding that police reports debunk Mr Trump's assertion.

While the refugee process often takes years, the Trump administration has fast-tracked the process for the Afrikaner group who are the first making their way to the US.

Families who lined up at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg on Sunday said the US embassy had instructed them not to speak to news media, according to The New York Times.

The plane is believed to be less than a quarter full, with FlightRadar tracking data suggesting the passengers boarded an Omni Air Boeing 767-224, which has capacity for 224 passengers.

Afrikaners in South Africa have claimed they are denied jobs, ignored by the government and targeted by criminals because of their race.

Since Nelson Mandela brought democracy into South Africa in 1994, the once-ruling white minority has retained most of the wealth amassed under colonialism and apartheid.

South Africa's president Cyril Ramaphosa this year enacted a law allowing the government to take land from private owners without providing compensation in certain cases.

Stephen Miller, Mr Trump's deputy chief of staff and architect of his immigration policy, told reporters at the White House on Friday that what is happening in South Africa fits the “textbook definition of why the refugee program was created”.

Relocation to the US will give the South African refugees a pathway to US citizenship.

Upon arrival, those who do not have family in the US are expected to be placed in temporary accommodation and supported by local organisations, according to a document seen by NPR.

The White House reportedly negotiated with Hamas without Israel's participation for the captive release.

Hamas released an Israeli American soldier from captivity in Gaza on Monday, seeking to reopen ceasefire negotiations as a gesture of goodwill to President Donald Trump as he visits the Middle East this week.

The 21-year-old Israeli military soldier, Edan Alexander, was first released to officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), who handed him over to the Israeli military in Israel for a health check and to be reunited with his family. Both Hamas and Israeli officials confirmed the transfer.

Alexander was the only living American in Hamas captivity. Hamas is still holding 59 other captives in Gaza, with 23 believed to still be alive. The remaining captives were supposed to be released as part of the ceasefire agreement, but are still in captivity after Israel unilaterally ended the ceasefire after the first phase and resumed its intensified bombings and total humanitarian aid blockade.

Hamas released Alexander as a “good faith” gesture toward Trump, reportedly as a result of backchannel negotiations between the White House and Hamas officials and without involvement from Israeli officials.

“This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,” said Trump in a post on Truth Social on Sunday. “Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. I look very much forward to that day of celebration!”

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee also called for an end to the “war” in a post celebrating Alexander's release in a post on social media.

Axios reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered Israeli negotiators to travel to Qatar to resume ceasefire talks this week, after talking with White House officials about Alexander's release. 

However, Netanyahu's office has said that Israel is still committed to carrying out its plan to indefinitely occupy the entirety of the Gaza Strip, cordoning millions of Palestinians to a small portion of the enclave. Netanyahu's security cabinet approved that plan in a vote last week.

Alexander's release comes amid a reported growing rift between Trump and Netanyahu. Trump is not visiting Israel during his visit to the Middle East this week, and The Washington Post reports that there is “total panic” among Israeli officials in terms of Trump seemingly distancing himself from the Israeli regime.

On top of bypassing Israel to negotiate the captive deal with Hamas, the Trump administration reportedly did not consult Israel when it reached its ceasefire deal with the Houthis last week. In addition, Trump and Netanyahu have disagreements over whether or not to strike Iran — as Saudi Arabia grows closer to Iran and Trump seeks to reenter the Iran nuclear agreement that he had withdrawn from during his first term.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

The proposed ordinance would restrict repeated camping and block encampments on sidewalks.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is urging cities and counties to adopt a newly released model ordinance aimed at banning and clearing homeless encampments. 

The proposal would prohibit unhoused people from repeatedly camping in the same location, restrict encampments that block pedestrian access on sidewalks, and require authorities to provide notice and make a good-faith effort to offer shelter before destroying camps. According to the governor's office, the model ordinance builds on an approach already used by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), which has destroyed more than 16,000 encampments since 2021. 

Framing the move as an act of “compassion and care,” Newsom's administration announced that $3.3 billion in voter-approved Proposition 1 funds — originally intended to expand behavioral health housing and treatment — would be made available statewide to incentivize cities and counties to adopt the ordinance. 

As of January 2024, the state's homeless population was estimated at 187,000 people, with roughly 123,000 people living without shelter in tents, vehicles, trailers, or makeshift structures. Many advocates for unhoused people argue that the state's reliance on punitive measures — such as encampment sweeps and camping bans — criminalize and displace, rather than support, people without stable housing.

“[Newsom] is flouting decades of evidence on effective solutions and urging communities to merely move unhoused people out of public view rather than work to solve their homelessness,” Diane Yentel, then-president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in 2024. “Urging communities to use an ineffective, harmful, wasteful tactic to relieve political pressure on himself isn't leadership. It's cowardice.”

Newsom's expanded effort for statewide encampment sweeps and camping bans follows the U.S. Supreme Court's 2024 ruling allowing local governments to prohibit encampments even when no alternative shelter is available. In response to the ruling, Newsom directed state agencies in July to begin clearing encampments. In August, he warned California cities and counties that failure to clear homeless encampments could result in the loss of state funding. 

Local leaders have voiced concerns about Newsom's focus on policing homelessness instead of addressing its root causes — soaring housing costs, a severe lack of affordable housing, and stagnant wages. While he has launched initiatives aimed at these structural issues, critics argue that prioritizing enforcement over long-term housing solutions ultimately deepens the crisis.

“Clearing encampments only works if we have places for people to go, and require that they use them,” San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan said in a statement.”Without these solutions, we spend precious taxpayer dollars simply shuffling people from one jurisdiction's land to another's.”

Advocacy groups have similarly warned that such approaches are not only ineffective but also harmful. “The evidence is actually very clear: forced encampment evictions are ineffective, expensive, and non-strategic,” said Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. “The blanket order to clear encampments without addressing the immediate and long-term needs of their residents will displace thousands and increase their risk of harm.”

Advocates have also raised concerns about Newsom's emphasis on mental health and substance use interventions as a response to homelessness. They warn that programs like CARE Court and expanded involuntary treatment laws risk violating civil liberties and could result in the forced institutionalization of unhoused people. 

“The overall impact of this move towards forced treatment will not reduce houselessness, except to the extent it increases detention. Fear of placement in locked facilities, forced medication, unacceptable interim shelter, and loss of rights and self-determination will drive unhoused people away from needed services,” explains a 2024 Human Right Watch report. “Without permanent housing, forced treatment will not remove the underlying instability of houselessness.”

Meanwhile, a DHS spokesperson warned that the New Jersey congressmembers at the scene may still face arrest.

Mayor Ras Baraka of Newark, New Jersey, was arrested and detained by masked federal immigration police Friday when he joined three Democratic congressmembers set to tour a newly reopened 1,000-bed Immigration and Customs Enforcement jail run by GEO Group, which advocates say lacks proper permits. Baraka says he was asked to leave the premises and left the secure area to join a group of protesters in a public area outside the gate — when he was seized by officers in a chaotic scene. “This is completely insane, and it's a scary moment in the history of this country as we watch democracy slip between our fingers,” Baraka tells Democracy Now!

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman.

Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, the mayor of the largest city in New Jersey, was arrested Friday and detained by masked federal immigration police when he went to a newly reopened, private, 1,000-bed Immigration and Customs Enforcement jail called Delaney Hall. He says he was there to support three congressmembers set to tour the facility: Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez. Newark Mayor Baraka says he was asked to leave the premises, and did so. He had gone to the other side of the fence, the Newark public property side, away from the congressmembers, was on a public street, when he was seized by officers in a chaotic scene.

AIDE 1: Now circle the mayor! Circle the mayor!

REP. LAMONICA McIVER: What? What the hell?

AIDE 1: Circle the mayor!

REP. LAMONICA McIVER: What the hell?

AIDE 1: Circle the mayor! Circle the mayor!

REP. LAMONICA McIVER: What the heck?

REP. BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN: Absolutely not. Absolutely not.

ICE AGENT: Back up. Back up. Do not cause us problems.

AIDE 1: Where's my congresswoman?

AIDE 2: Congresswoman! Congresswoman! She's right in front of you!

REP. LAMONICA McIVER: Don't touch us! Don't touch us!

AIDE 2: Congresswoman!

AIDE 1: Get off of us.

REP. LAMONICA McIVER: Don't touch us!

AIDE 1: Get off of us.

AIDE 2: Get out!

AMY GOODMAN: As the ICE agents handcuffed Mayor Baraka, the three Democratic congressmembers — Menendez, McIver and Coleman — tried to wrap their arms around him to protect him. After he was arrested, a crowd of hundreds gathered, demanding he be released. He was charged with trespassing and later released and addressed supporters.

MAYOR RAS BARAKA: I didn't know that this morning when I woke up that I'd be in this detention facility here, that I would end up incarcerated for something that I believe is my democratic right, to show up and speak out against what I think was happening there, a violation of city and state laws and a lack of transparency.

AMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson accused the New Jersey congressmembers at the scene of assaulting ICE officers, warned they still may face arrest.

We'll speak with 80-year-old Congressmember Bonnie Watson Coleman in a few minutes, but we begin with Newark mayor, gubernatorial candidate Ras Baraka.

Welcome to Democracy Now! I'm glad I'm not speaking to you behind bars, but where you are in Newark, Mayor. If you can start off by talking about why you were there, outside Delaney Hall, what this place is, and what happened?

MAYOR RAS BARAKA: Well, I actually go there every day, every morning. I would have been there this morning. I go at 7 a.m. with fire code officials, UCC officials, health inspectors, to get in, as it is our right to inspect the facility for them to apply for a certificate of occupancy. We're in court with GEO right now, because they're defying city ordinances.

I went back that afternoon because I was invited to participate in a conference that the congresspeople were going to have after they toured the facility themselves. I went there for that purpose. You know, we waited there over an hour, almost an hour and a half, with no incident, without any incident whatsoever. I was allowed to come inside and stand there by the gate without incident for over an hour, waiting for the congresspeople to come out.

When the special agent in charge, Patel, showed up, he escalated the situation. There, the congresspeople tried to reason with him, you know, surrounded me inside, and finally got him to agree for me to leave. I left, on the other side of the fence. They may — I guess they reversed that decision and made a decision to come around and, in fact, arrest me.

And so they did. They arrested me, and the congresspeople and other bystanders tried to shield me from being arrested. But, you know, I did. And I think it was better that that happened, because it would have probably gotten worse than it was getting while I was out there.

AMY GOODMAN: Now, we heard that — well, you went to the Newark side, and you represent Newark. You were on the public property side. Someone got a call next to you, right? One of the officials got a call. Now —

MAYOR RAS BARAKA: Right, right.

AMY GOODMAN: Let's be clear: The U.S. attorney for New Jersey there is Alina Habba, the former private lawyer for President Trump. If you can explain what you understand took place? Because that seemed to escalate things, when that agent was on the phone.

MAYOR RAS BARAKA: Right. Absolutely. Absolutely. You could see that it was resolved, that I was leaving. I left. I was on the other side. When he got the call, I was already on the other side of the fence. He, in turn, got a phone call. Right after the phone call, they proceeded to come after me. When they first came, they came right up to me anyway. And this idea that other people got arrested is not true. I was the only one arrested there, and so they targeted me specifically. So, after the phone call, it did escalate.

AMY GOODMAN: So, the interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said on X that you, quote, “ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove” — well, she said, “to remove himself,” unquote, from the detention center, again, which, as you point out, is run by the GEO Group. She added, quote, “No one is above the law.” Please respond, Mayor.

MAYOR RAS BARAKA: Yeah, she's right: No is above the law. Neither are they. Neither is the GEO — the GEO Group is not above the law, the president or any of these people.

We have a dispute with GEO because they're violating city laws, and we are fighting with them in court. And ICE is interfering and interceding in that, unfortunately, without the judge's — you know, whatever the judge says, they are doing the opposite of that.

You know, I sat on that — sat inside of that fence there for over an hour, and nobody told me to move. Nobody told me to get out. Nobody questioned me. Nobody came up to me and said anything to me. I sat there for a very long time before that agent showed up there. And so, it was clearly their intention to escalate it and to focus everything on me and to target me, and that's exactly what happened.

AMY GOODMAN: Now, I wanted to clarify something, Mayor Baraka. A lot of the news reported that you were arrested during a protest.

MAYOR RAS BARAKA: Right.

AMY GOODMAN: But, in fact, you weren't protesting. Can you explain the history of this GEO facility, which wasn't always owned by GEO, and why you say they don't have the proper documentation to hold a thousand prisoners?

MAYOR RAS BARAKA: Right, yeah, I was not protesting, actually. And I could be protesting. I speak to the protesters when I get there. But at the end of the day, the GEO Group — the facility used to be a drug rehab center and a halfway house for people that were incarcerated that were coming home, and this was a transition for them to — from there, to come home, so short, very short periods of time that they spent there to transition home.

They converted it, or are in the process of trying to convert it, into this kind of detention facility, over a thousand beds in a detention facility. They had a certificate of occupancy 20 years ago. And according to city ordinance, they need an updated certificate of occupancy. In fact, they need annual updates of certificates of occupancy, not 20 years later. We challenged him on that.

Our folks showed up. Before I even came there, we sent our people there. They refused to let them in. So I needed to see that for myself. I came down there, one, with our folks and watched them turn them away and turn me away at the same time.

We went to court summarily after that. The courts had us in conversation, forced them to make them have an initial inspection. We did an initial inspection and found a few violations. After we find violations, we have to come back and check those violations. And we told them that they needed to apply for a certificate of occupancy. They refused to do that.

So, this is a dispute, a dispute that has to be settled in court, not by Alina Habba, not by, you know, the ICE or by the president, but by a court. A court settles these disputes, and it has not settled it yet. We're still in court now.

AMY GOODMAN: You know, the detention facility, the largest on the East Coast, a thousand beds, is near Newark Airport. I mean, maybe the only hope for the detainees is that there have been so many outages at Newark that they wouldn't be able to fly them out. But I wanted to ask you about the history. In 2021, advocates helped enact a law prohibiting New Jersey from renewing or signing detention contracts with ICE in New Jersey. Now, a federal district judge struck down parts of that in 2023 after private prison operators, like CoreCivic, which operates another immigration jail in the state, sued. “The state attorney general is appealing the ruling, invoking the 10th Amendment that stops the federal government from commandeering state resources for its purposes.” That is — I'm reading from The Washington Post. Can you respond to what you still are asking for? In a moment, we're going to speak with one of the congressmembers who are still threatened with arrest, who did tour the facility. But what you're demanding ICE give you now in terms of documentation? What you're concerned about is happening to the detainees inside?

MAYOR RAS BARAKA: Well, we want them to start filling out the application for the certificate of occupancy that allows us to come in and do full inspections, health inspection, fire inspection, make sure they have the proper, you know, procedures that are happening. They have women in there, have children in there. We need to know how many people are in there, how many beds that they have there, if the sprinkler system works, if the gas system is hooked up correctly, the electrical system is hooked up, if the elevators are working properly. All of these things are a part of what a certificate of occupancy allows us to do. If they're using the property for the stated use, or if they're using it for anything else, do they need to go through the zoning board or planning board? And this is what happens for every facility, even a new home that you build and open. Everybody has to have a CO or temporary certificate of occupancy. And they have neither. And so, we're in dispute about this.

I do think that the state should go further here and demand or write a law that says that we can't have private prisons in New Jersey in the first place. I think we should go as far as that in the state.

AMY GOODMAN: I know you have to go, but I want to just get you to respond to a very ominous moment right before you were arrested — it was on Friday — with the White House official Stephen Miller saying he's looking into, that the Trump administration is looking into suspending habeas corpus, which protects people from unlawful detentions. This is what he said.

STEPHEN MILLER: Well, the Constitution is clear — and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land — that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion. So, it's an option we're actively looking at. Look, a lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not. The end of the day, Congress passed a body of law, known as the Immigration and Nationality Act, which stripped Article III courts — that's the judicial branch — of jurisdiction over immigration cases. So, Congress actually passed — it's called jurisdiction-stripping legislation. It passed a number of laws that say that the Article III courts aren't even allowed to be involved in immigration cases.

AMY GOODMAN: So, if you, finally, can respond, just hours before you were arrested, to Stephen Miller saying they're weighing stripping habeas corpus, they're weighing doing away with it, because while it may not be wartime, we are in the midst of an invasion.

MAYOR RAS BARAKA: This is completely insane, and it's a scary moment in the history of this country as we watch democracy slip between our fingers. I think that because Trump was elected and there's still a process, we still have this separation of powers, that people believe that the separation of powers is going to fix this. This is not being fixed. People are watching this take place as authoritarianism becomes the rule of the land here in this country.

And we need more voices and more people to stand up against this. Suspending habeas corpus is something that happens in a time of war. You know, to relate this to war is definitely, definitely scary. It means that we're in an existential threat here, and we need to stand up and do something about this immediately.

AMY GOODMAN: When do you have to go to court?

MAYOR RAS BARAKA: May 15, I go back to court for my preliminary hearing in the city of Newark, and hopefully the supporters will be out there supporting me.

AMY GOODMAN: Soon afterwards, there's the primary for governor, is that right? June 10th?

MAYOR RAS BARAKA: Yes, June 10th, absolutely. Yeah.

AMY GOODMAN: Ras Baraka, I want to thank you for being with us, mayor of Newark, New Jersey, the largest city in New Jersey, yes, a Democratic candidate for governor in the state's gubernatorial election this year. On Friday, the mayor was arrested by 20 armed, many masked, federal agents, standing on public property in his city of Newark. He was released after five hours.

            President Donald Trump marched the US economy to the brink of a self-inflicted recession and a potential supply chain meltdown.
    


            But at the last moment, Trump decided to pull back.
    


            The US-China breakthrough unveiled Monday calls for a 90-day thaw in the trade war by slashing tariffs from suffocatingly high levels as trade was paralyzed between the world's two biggest economies.
    


            The dramatic drop in US-China tariffs is an undeniable positive compared to just a few days ago. The breakthrough has already set off an epic party on Wall Street and is raising hopes that a tariff-driven nightmare can be avoided.
    


            Yet economists say it's still too early to declare the US economy is out of danger altogether. Recession risks remain, even if the odds of a downturn have been dialed back a notch.
    


            Tariffs are still very high — much higher than at any point in decades. Uncertainty is even higher. Damage to confidence and trade flows won't be undone overnight.
    


            Moreover, there is no playbook for what happens next. There is no precedent for how a modern economy responds after going through this many shocks in this short a time.
    


            “We are far from out of the woods,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former economic adviser to Republicans. “There is a narrative that Trump did a U-turn. He didn't. We still have tariffs at levels we haven't seen in a century. That's a substantial tax increase.”
    


            At 145%, US tariffs on China were unsustainably high, amounting to an effective embargo on trade. Supply chain experts warned of imminent trouble, including empty store shelves.
    


            “This staves off the really disastrous consequences that were about to hit the US economy,” Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, told CNN.
    


            York added that Trump's economic team backtracking from the 145% tariff rates “shows the administration realizes what a disaster it would have been.”
    


            Even though Trump has repeatedly offered a dose of tough medicine in recent weeks, including questioning how many dolls kids need to own, he has been sensitive to the image of barren store shelves as well as financial market reaction to a deepening trade war, a senior administration official told CNN's Jeff Zeleny.
    


            “Both sides luckily decided to save Christmas,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, wrote in a report on Monday. “The US side listened to the existential crisis of many small businesses.”
    


            Still, despite Trump's decision to slash tariffs on China to 30% for at least 90 days, import taxes remain sharply higher than at the start of the year.
    


            Based on the trade framework agreements reached with China and the UK, Moody's Analytics calculates the US effective tariff rate has dropped from 21.3% to 13.7%. That's still the highest level since 1910.
    


            At that level, tariffs are set to add more than one percentage point to US inflation through this time next year and erase the same amount from gross domestic product (GDP), Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told CNN.
    


            As a result of the US-China trade war thaw, Zandi is cutting his recession forecast — but not dramatically. He now sees a 45% chance of a US recession this year, down from a peak of 60%.
    


            “The economy will have a tough year but should avoid a recession,” Zandi said in an email. “Of course, the economy will be highly vulnerable to anything else that might go wrong.”
    


            In other words, the trade war has eroded the margin for error in this economy.
    


            Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, noted on X that it's true that US trade policy and the prospects for the economy are “much better today than they were yesterday.” But it's also true, Wolfers said, to say that the situation is “much worse today than on Inauguration Day.”
    


            Such is the speed and turbulence of the Trump 2.0 agenda.
    


            After Trump spiked tariffs at his April 2 “Liberation Day” event, Wolfers warned the odds of a recession would reach 75% if all the tariffs kicked in and stayed in place.
    


            Now Wolfers tells CNN that the risk of a recession has fallen sharply but still remains a coin-flip at roughly 50/50.
    


            “There has been a wholly unnecessary supply chain disruption. You can't undo that. It will take some time to work itself out,” Wolfers said in a phone interview.
    


            Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic now sees the US economy eking out slightly positive growth this year, up from her prior call for no growth at all. Nationwide still sees inflation accelerating to 3.4% this year, but that's an improvement from 4% before the US-China breakthrough.
    


            Trump himself acknowledged on Monday that tariffs could still slingshot higher on China.
    


            Asked if tariffs would go back to 145% if no deal is reached at the end of the 90 days, Trump said: “No, but they'd go substantially higher.” He added: “I think you will have a deal, however.”
    


            In other words, the US-China trade war is not over, even if it got dramatically less bad.
    


            And tariffs are not being suddenly removed from the president's tool chest.
    


            Sector-specific tariffs still loom, including potentially on lumber, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, copper, critical minerals and trucks.
    


            Just last week the Commerce Department set the stage for potential aerospace tariffs by launching a national security probe into imports of airplanes, jet engines and parts.
    


            The risk of further tariffs ahead is one reason RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas is sticking to his forecast of a 55% chance of a recession over the next 12 months.
    


            “While the agreement prevented an economic decoupling, and that is significant, there are still too many details to be determined, especially those sector tariffs, to remove a recession risk from the table,” Brusuelas said.
    


            Deutsche Bank economists expressed relief on Monday about the easing trade war.
    


            “The global growth outlook is improving,” Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a report. “American trade policy has turned more conciliatory and there is now a better defined range of tariff outcomes. The peak of the trade war uncertainty is in.”
    


            Of course, uncertainty had almost nowhere to go but down.
    


            Trade policy uncertainty, as measured by an index that mentions the topic in major US newspapers, had skyrocketed in recent months to off-the-chart levels unseen since tracking began in the 1960s.
    


            The sudden reduction in US and China tariffs will ease financial pressure on the business community but only adds to the sense of whiplash. And it remains to be seen exactly how businesses will respond to levels of uncertainty that Wolfers described as “paralyzingly high.”
    


            “It's absolutely a manufactured crisis,” said Holtz-Eakin, who served as an economic adviser to Sen. John McCain during the 2008 presidential campaign.
    


            Wolfers said investors and the business world are still bracing for the next shoe to drop when it comes to tariff policy out of the Trump White House.
    


            “What are the chances that we have 90 days of calm ahead of us?” Wolfers said. “Today we have good news, but what would really be good news is if someone just took the button away from him.”

            President Donald Trump's shock-and-awe tariff approach threatened to rupture the global financial system and drive the US economy into recession. Nervous about the prospect of empty store shelves and reignited inflation, Trump sent in his even-keeled and professional negotiators to Geneva to snag a win.
    


            The unexpectedly dramatic de-escalation with China laid the groundwork for a growing series of trade negotiations that may produce a handful of rapid-fire, if less than fulsome, bilateral agreements to reduce US trade deficits.
    


            “We actually have a fresh start with China,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said in an interview on CNN News Central. “That's the way to think about these negotiations.”
    


            The decision by both the United States and China to drop stratospheric tariffs by 115 percentage points at the conclusion of two days of talks marked the most significant development in a policy approach that has been equal parts maximalist and messy. The de facto trade embargo between the world's two largest economies had produced domestic and global economic pressure that appeared on the brink of calamity.
    


            The de-escalation sent markets soaring across the world Monday, as it shed light on a Trump administration's strategy to maintain significantly higher tariffs while incentivizing its largest trading partners to come to the table with offers.
    


            In Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Trump sent lead negotiators who are viewed by market participants and their Chinese counterparts as serious, levelheaded and empowered.
    


            As those talks start in earnest, the ongoing effort to secure deals with roughly two-dozen other countries was given a boost last week after a small-scale agreement with the UK. That provided a model for what Trump wanted in the urgent scramble to secure bespoke deals with the US, according to several foreign diplomats involved in the bilateral talks.
    


            The negotiators, parameters for negotiation and clearly serious approach from both sides that will drive the next three months are all viewed as tangibly positive signs by Trump's advisors. Whether they lead to a substantive outcome remains an open question, but as one advisor put it to CNN, “this a hell of a lot better than the alternative both of us were staring down.”
    


            “This is really the first time it's been possible to actually see the path to land this plane without some cataclysmic economic disaster,” a Republican senator told CNN. “Doesn't mean we will, but that's a lot better than where we've been.”
    


            The path from the market-panic-inducing “Liberation Day” tariff announcement on April 2 to this point was hardly linear. Trump's advisors have long insisted, against plenty of evidence to the contrary, that it was all a deeply strategic roadmap that incorporated every possibility.
    


            The fallacy of that insistence is laid bare by Trump's own view that “flexibility” is paramount. Bessent, who is fond in private settings of talking through the game theory he sees as animating Trump's approach, cites the value of the “strategic uncertainty” created by his boss.
    


            It was Trump, after all, who hit the pause button on his hardest hitting “reciprocal” tariff rates on roughly 100 countries. And it was Trump who first publicly floated significant de-escalation with China after, in private internal discussions, his team weighed even more dramatic off-ramps to step back from the brink.
    


            The bond market, supply chains blinking red and increasingly apocalyptic warnings from executives across major industries all served as critical accelerants for Trump's personal pivots. The actions in some cases had the effect of hanging his own advisors out to dry hours after they'd been on television pledging there would be no exceptions, delays or revisions.
    


            There has, however, been a broad strategy designed to push trading partners to the very place the administration finds itself now, officials say.
    


            In the end, the Trump administration has somehow managed to lock into place dramatically higher tariffs – a 10% universal rate across the globe and sector tariffs that largely stand untouched. And, while recognizing that tariffs aren't going back to zero, trading partners are still lining up to get a deal done with the United States.
    


            That lawmakers and foreign diplomats alike appear willing to overlook – or even outright accept – that a 10% global tariff rate is basically a nonnegotiable reality at this point is perhaps the best window into the moment Trump has led the world into.
    


            Trump's team said that shock-and-awe strategy to get a “win,” even out of significant tariffs that remain in place was the strategy all along.
    


            “We have had a plan, we have a process in place, now with the Chinese, we have a mechanism in place for future talks,” Bessent told reporters in Geneva.
    


            The China talks would always be the most difficult, labor-intensive and time consuming. The lessons from Trump's first term negotiations are deeply internalized among not just his advisors, but Trump himself.
    


            For Trump, trade is the lynchpin to everything. That includes the India-Pakistan ceasefire agreement he told reporters was, in his view, primarily attributable to his promises of rapid increases in trade flows to both nations.
    


            It seemed fitting that the most astute observation in the rush to analyze the dramatic de-escalation in US-China trade relations came from the man who drove them to the brink on an entirely unrelated yet no less consequential matter.
    


            “People have never really used trade how I use trade,” Trump told reporters Monday morning.

Live Updates


            • Trade war breakthrough: The US and China agreed to drastically roll back tariffs on each other's goods for an initial 90 days, de-escalating a punishing trade war and buoying global markets.
    


• Lowering drug prices: President Donald Trump signed an executive order that his administration says will crack down on “unreasonable and discriminatory practices” by foreign countries that suppress drug prices abroad. It's unclear whether Americans will see lower prices and what authority the US has to direct drug pricing in other countries.
    


            • Middle East trip: Trump will visit three wealthy Gulf Arab nations this week, hoping to deepen economic ties. Here's what to watch for.
    


• Qatari jet: Trump's trip comes as his administration is expected to accept a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family to use as Air Force One, raising legal and ethical questions. The White House said today that the legal details on accepting the Boeing 747-8 are “still being worked out,” while Trump defended the plan, saying he would be a “stupid person” if he turned down a free jet.
    


            House Republicans on Monday unveiled one of the most critical pieces of President Donald Trump's domestic agenda: How it plans to spend trillions of dollars on tax breaks.
    


            It's a big win for Trump, as is the name of the bill — “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill,” adopting the president's moniker for the legislation.
    


            Here's what's in the bill:
    


            One headache in the GOP it does not solve: The battle over state and local taxes. House Republicans' tax bill would triple the current cap on state and local taxes, from $10,000 to $30,000 per year, but is limited to people who are making $400,000 or less.
    


            Republicans from high-tax states, such as New York, New Jersey and California, have already privately rejected this policy, though it's unclear how much leverage they have to change it before the final bill. Some of those GOP lawmakers have privately demanded a cap as large as $60,000.
    


            A flight carrying a group of 59 White South Africans granted refugee status in the United States by the Trump administration arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia on Monday, a State Department official said.
    


            US Deputy Secretary of State Christoper Landau and Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Troy Edgar welcomed the group at the airport.
    


            Landau told the new arrivals that “we respect what you had to deal with these last few years.” He noted that many of them are farmers, and said they would hopefully “bloom” in the US.
    


            The Trump administration has moved to not only admit but to expedite the processing of Afrikaners as refugees for alleged discrimination. At the same time, it has suspended virtually all other refugee resettlement, including for people fleeing war and famine. The policy has drawn criticism from the South African government and from refugee advocates.
    


            South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Monday that those going to the US “do not fit the definition of a refugee.”
    


            Jeremy Konyndyk, the president of Refugees International, called the policy “a racialized immigration program masquerading as refugee resettlement, while real refugees remain stranded.”
    


Some context: Since Trump began his second term, the US has taken a series of punitive measures against South Africa, whose government has been met with ire not only from Trump, but also from his ally Elon Musk, who was born and raised in the country.
    


            Both Trump and Musk, the tech billionaire, have alleged that White farmers in the country are being discriminated against under land reform policies that South Africa's government says are necessary to remedy the legacy of apartheid.

CNN's Larry Madowo and Nimi Princewell contributed reporting.



            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has been appointed to serve as acting librarian of Congress, according to the Justice Department.
    


            Blanche will replace Carla Hayden, who was fired by the White House last week. Hayden had served in the position since 2016 and had about a year and half left in her 10-year-term. She was the first woman and first Black person to serve in the role.
    


            Two other Justice Department officials will also hold positions at the Library of Congress, according to the DOJ. Associate Deputy Attorney General Paul Perkins will serve as acting register of copyrights, and Brian Nieves, Blanche's deputy chief of staff, will fill the role as acting deputy librarian of Congress.
    


            The Library of Congress serves as the largest library in the world, according to its website. The librarian of Congress is a position that requires presidential appointment followed by Senate confirmation. The librarian has several duties, including overseeing the more than 178 million items in the library's collection.
    


            Blanche represented Donald Trump during his 2024 criminal hush money trial, which ended with the then-former president being found guilty on 34 felony counts. Blanche was nominated to be deputy attorney general in November following Trump's election win.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday that his country “would appreciate” President Donald Trump attending potential peace talks with Russia in Istanbul.
    


            Zelensky said he supported Trump's call for direct talks between himself and Vladimir Putin, reiterating his readiness to meet the Russian president in Turkey on Thursday.
    


                    “And of course, all of us in Ukraine would appreciate it if President Trump could be there with us at this meeting in (Turkey). This is the right idea. We can change a lot,” Zelensky said in a post on X.
                





            Trump said earlier Monday that “I think you may have a good result out of the Thursday meeting in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine.”
    


            “I was thinking about actually flying over there,” he added. “There's a possibility of it, I guess.”
    


            Trump, who is headed to the Middle East for the first major international trip of his second term, continued that he would go to Istanbul “if I thought it would be helpful.”
    


Some background: Putin suggested direct talks in Turkey in response to an ultimatum by Ukraine's European allies, who said Saturday that Russia should accept a 30-day ceasefire proposal or face “massive” sanctions. Putin ignored the ultimatum and instead called for talks.
    


            Ukraine's allies initially said no talks can take place before a ceasefire — but after Trump urged Zelensky to agree to the talks, the Ukrainian leader said he is ready to meet Putin.
    


            The Kremlin has not said whether Putin or any other Russian official would travel to Turkey to meet Zelensky.
    


            Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee blasted President Donald Trump's plan to accept a jet from the Qatari royal family to be used as Air Force One and announced that they would force a vote on the Senate floor condemning it.
    


            “The Constitution is clear: elected officials, like the president, cannot accept large gifts from foreign governments without consent from Congress,” Sens. Chris Coons, Chris Murphy, Cory Booker and Brian Schatz said in a statement.
    


            “Air Force One is more than just a plane — it's a symbol of the presidency and of the United States itself. Any president who accepts this kind of gift, valued at $400 million, from a foreign government creates a clear conflict of interest, raises serious national security questions, invites foreign influence, and undermines public trust in our government. No one — not even the president — is above the law,” they continued.
    


            “This week, we will ask the Senate to vote to reiterate a basic principle: no one should use public service for personal gain through foreign gifts.”
    


Some context: A Qatari official said the plane is technically being gifted from the Qatari Ministry of Defense to the Pentagon, describing it more as a government-to-government transaction instead of a personal one.
    


            The White House has been looking for an off-ramp from its trade war with China — even a temporary one — and the president told his aides that he was eager to strike a deal before departing on his Middle East trip, a senior administration official said.
    


            While Trump has repeatedly offered a dose of tough medicine in recent weeks, lecturing Americans about a need to rein in their shopping habits of certain goods produced in China, he has been sensitive to the image of empty store shelves in the US and to the financial markets reacting to a deepening trade war, the official said.
    


            The official on Monday dismissed the notion that the escalating tariffs with China had been a miscalculation by the administration, but conceded that Trump wanted to “find a win” to avoid having a nasty trade war hanging over him this week as he seeks to rally more US investment from Gulf Arab states.
    


            The China announcement is only the latest example of how Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has emerged as the most critical player in the ongoing tariff negotiations inside the White House. That hardly means Peter Navarro — the White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing who is more supportive of tariffs — is out of the picture, given his unceasing loyalty to Trump. But the senior administration official said Trump views Bessent as the leading voice.
    


            The House GOP's unveiling of President Donald Trump's “one big, beautiful bill” is far from complete. But so far, House centrists feel like they have emerged the big winners.
    


            The House does not return to Washington until Tuesday, but privately, House centrists are feeling upbeat about the party's plans to largely sidestep the most severe Medicaid restructuring that some feared could cost them the majority.
    


            That's left some GOP hardliners fuming, including Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who took to X to tear apart the early details of the plan and declare: “I sure hope House & Senate leadership are coming up with a backup plan.” And behind the scenes, Roy is not the only Republican who is skeptical that the planned Medicaid revamp will get to the conference's goal of $880 billion in cuts.
    


            The backlash from the GOP's right flank is emerging ahead of a critical week of policymaking for House Speaker Mike Johnson and his Republican conference. Several key committees will hold votes to advance their own slices of Trump's domestic policy package — followed by a critical vote by the fiscally hawkish House Budget Committee. A full floor vote could follow as soon as next week.
    


            The Trump administration is terminating a form of humanitarian relief for Afghan nationals residing in the United States — a move that stands to impact around 11,700 people.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security announced Monday that it's ending Temporary Protected Status — which applies to people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict or natural disasters — for Afghanistan.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cited “notable improvements” in the situation in Afghanistan and national security to justify ending the relief, according to a notice in the Federal Register.
    


                    “This administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent,” Noem said in a statement. “We've reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation. Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent them from returning to their home country.”
                





            It's the latest in a series of moves to end Temporary Protected Status for certain countries that Trump officials argue has been extended too long. Attempts to terminate relief have been challenged in court. Both Republican and Democratic administrations have designated the protections.
    


            Families of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza may meet with President Donald Trump when he visits Qatar this week, two people familiar with the planning told CNN.
    


            The plans are in the works and not yet finalized.
    


            Officials hope Monday's release of Israeli American Edan Alexander — in a deal struck between the US and Hamas — will pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to come to an agreement with Hamas for the remaining 58 hostages, only 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.
    


            “It's an opening, not a one-off,” said one of the sources, who works with the families. “It puts enormous pressure on the prime minister.”
    


            CNN previously reported that Trump had invited the Alexander family to Doha, but their travel depends on Edan's condition.
    


            Trump had already planned to stop in Doha on his tour of the Middle East this week. Qatar, along with Egypt, has been a key mediator in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks of the past 19 months.
    


            America's shoe industry wants the White House to “finish the job” on lowering tariffs.
    


            “We're encouraged by President Trump and his administration's progress in the U.S.-China trade negotiations,” Matt Priest, the CEO of trade group Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, said in a statement Monday. “But we're not across the finish line yet.”
    


            The group represents Nike, Under Armour and other leading shoe companies.
    


            Shoes are highly exposed to tariffs because 99% of all footwear sold in the United States is manufactured overseas. The industry has warned that tariffs could wipe out hundreds of businesses, kill tens of thousands of jobs and raise prices for consumers.
    


            “Some shoes still face duties approaching 100%, and that's unacceptable,” Priest said. “Our industry needs relief — and so do (US) families.”
    


            If the United States and China are at an impasse following the 90-day pause, the tariffs on Chinese imports aren't expected to snap back to 145%, President Donald Trump said Monday.
    


            “No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said.
    


            “At 145%, you're really decoupling, because nobody's going to buy; but [the duties] got very high because of additional tariffs that were applied because of fentanyl and other things,” he said when asked if the US tariffs would return to 145%. “But no. But they'd go substantially higher.”
    


            “I think you will have a deal, however,” Trump said.
    


            Ahead of his trip to the Middle East this week, President Donald Trump said today he hoped more hostages held by Hamas will be released.
    


            His remarks came after Hamas announced it would be releasing Edan Alexander, the last known living American hostage who was kidnapped during the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel while serving in the military.
    


            “We hope that we're going to have other hostages released, too,” Trump told reporters from the White House. He said he believes about 20 living hostages, not counting Alexander, are still being held by Hamas.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order that he said promises to crack down on “unreasonable and discriminatory practices” by foreign countries that suppress drug prices abroad.
    


            Trump signed the order during an event in the White House's Roosevelt Room, where he was joined by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, among others.
    


            “This is the most powerful executive order on pharmacy pricing and health care ever in the history of our nation,” Oz said.
    


            It's unclear whether Americans will see lower prices and what authority the US government has to direct drug pricing in other countries.
    


Some context: The action goes far beyond Trump's implementation of a “Most Favored Nation” policy in his first term, which was quickly blocked by federal courts for procedural reasons before being rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in 2021.
    


            The initiative will likely face stiff opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which successfully halted the first iteration.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday defended the US government's plan to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family, describing it as a “contribution” and saying the US can't turn down a free jet.
    


            CNN reported Sunday that the Boeing 747-8 jet would be retrofitted to be used as Air Force One. The plan raised substantial ethical and legal questions about foreign influence over the US government because of the plane's massive value. Acceptance of the plane would also raise significant security concerns.
    


            Trump said the relatively younger Qatari jet was needed to replace an aging Air Force One.
    


            “I think it's a great gesture from Qatar. I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person say, ‘No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane.' But it was, I thought it was a great gesture.”
    


            Trump said the plane will “go directly” to his presidential library after he leaves office.
    


            “I wouldn't be using it,” he added.
    


            President Donald Trump said today he may travel to Istanbul for potential peace talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.
    


            “I think you may have a good result out of the Thursday meeting in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine,” Trump during an event about drug prices at the White House.
    


            “I was thinking about actually flying over there,” he added. “There's a possibility of it, I guess.”
    


            Trump is traveling to the Middle East later today. He continued that he would go “if I thought it would be helpful.”
    


            Trump took to Truth Social over the weekend to urge Zelensky to “immediately” accept the Putin's offer to hold peace talks in Turkey, something not seen since the early weeks of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday said he may “very well relieve” sanctions on Syria as part of an effort to give the country a “fresh start.”
    


            Trump's comments on sanctions came as he prepares to head to the Middle East today. He was trumpeting his relationships with various world leaders during a press availability this morning.
    


            “We're going to have to make a decision on the sanctions, which we may very well relieve,” Trump said. “We may take them off of Syria because we want to give them a fresh start.”
    


            He said “the way we have them sanctioned, it doesn't really give them much of a start.” He added that: “We want to see we can help them out.”
    


            Syria's economy has long been crippled by western sanctions. According to the World Bank, the country's economy shrank by more than half between 2010 and 2020.
    


CNN's Nadeen Ebrahim contributed.



            President Donald Trump said Monday he called House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to urge them to use tariffs and his new drug prices pharmaceutical order to lower the cost of the huge GOP tax bill.
    


            Doing so, he added, would pay for what he calls the “Golden Dome” — his vision for a defense missile system over the U.S. akin to the Iron Dome in Israel.
    


                    “I said when you score, you're going to have to score two things: You're going to have to, No. 1, score that hundreds of billions of dollars of tariff money is coming in. But even bigger than that, you're going to have to score that your cost for Medicaid and Medicare and just basically pharmaceuticals and drugs is going down at a level that nobody has ever seen before,” Trump said during a news conference at the White House.
                





            “It'll pay for the Golden Dome,” he added. “See, that'll easily pay for the Golden Dome, and we'll have a lot of money left over. We need the Golden Dome.”
    


            Trump signed an executive order Monday morning that aims to crack down on “unreasonable and discriminatory practices” by foreign countries that suppress drug prices abroad.
    


Some context: Earlier this year, Trump proposed a sweeping missile defense initiative aimed at protecting the US from incoming attacks — calling it the “Golden Dome.” CNN previously reported it would likely cost billions of dollars to construct and maintain.
    


            Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system selectively protects populated areas from short-range threats in a country the size of New Jersey; Trump wants a space-based missile defense system capable of defending the entire United States from advanced ballistic and hypersonic missiles.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday told a somewhat meandering story about a friend who he said was able to obtain weight-loss medication at a much lower price in the UK as an example of the disparities between drug prices in the US and overseas.
    


            “Highly neurotic, brilliant businessman — seriously overweight,” Trump described his friend, whom he didn't name. “And he takes the fat-shot drug.”
    


            Trump said his friend recently called him from London, where he was able to obtain a drug that helps with weight loss for $88, instead of the $1,300 he would have paid in New York.
    


            Trump said he recently relayed this story to a representative from a pharmaceutical company but didn't say which one or when this conversation took place.
    


            The remarks came before Trump signed an executive order that he said will aim to slash drug prices.



            President Donald Trump said today that he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping “maybe” at the end of this week, after the US and China reached a trade agreement over the weekend.
    


            The deal would temporarily reduce the two countries' tariffs on each other for an initial 90 days, de-escalating a punishing trade war and buoying global markets.
    


            “I'll speak to President Xi maybe at the end of the week,” Trump said during a news conference in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. “We have some other things we're doing,” he added.
    


            “They were very happy to be able to do something with us and the relationship is very, very good,” the president continued.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday said he threatened to end trading relationships with India and Pakistan as an impetus to get both countries to accept a ceasefire over the weekend.
    


            “I said, ‘C'mon, we're going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let's stop it. Let's stop it. If you stop it, we'll do a trade. If you don't stop it, we're not going to do any trade,'” the president said at the White House on Monday.
    


            “And all of a sudden they said, ‘I think we're going to stop,'” the president added. Trump said the countries came to the decision “for a lot of reasons, but trade is a big one.”
    


            The president said the United States will “do a lot of trade” with both countries. Negotiations with India are ongoing and negotiations with Pakistan will start soon.
    


            Trump said he believed a nuclear war might have been averted.
    


            CNN previously reported the ceasefire may not lead to a lasting peace as it does not address the fundamental grievances fueling the decades-long dispute over the status of Muslim-majority Kashmir, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan.
    


President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order Monday morning that promises to crack down on “unreasonable practices” by foreign countries that suppress drug prices abroad, a White House official said.
    


            It will apply to a wide range of drugs and to prices in the commercial market, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, and will most likely spark fierce legal battles.
    


            If prices do not come down quickly, the administration will look at various policy levers that can be used to force prices down, the official told reporters Monday. The mandate also calls for the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower prices across all markets. If no progress is made, the agency will implement a rule to impose the “Most Favored Nation” cost for the drug, which would be the lowest price available among peer countries.
    


            The trade war de-escalation with China represents a big win for the US economy and the American consumer, Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council of the United States, told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Monday.
    


            Hassett said Trump had scored major concessions from China and the United Kingdom in their respective recent frameworks for trade negotiations, announced over the past few days, particularly by opening up the UK market to American beef and potentially paring back some of the barriers China had put in place on American companies looking to do business there.
    


            “We described the non-tariff barriers and tariffs that disadvantaged American workers, and folks are coming to the table and and it's really stunning how quickly they're moving and how dramatic the changes are,” Hassett said. “I think it's really a very historic fresh start in the relationship between the US and China.”
    


            The biggest win for the US economy from this weekend's stunning agreement with China is likely the drastic reduction of the sky-high tariffs the US had placed on Chinese goods that had all but stopped trade between the two countries. That risked supply chain shocks, higher prices and some shortages. Although Hassett hinted at future agreements that could open up foreign markets more to US goods and services, it's not clear yet what shape those will take and whether Chinese and British consumers will want those American goods.
    


            Significant damage has already been done by the enormous tariffs put in place between the US and China over the past few months, economists and logistics experts say. Shipments of Chinese goods to the United States fell off a cliff in recent weeks. But Hassett suggested the agreement reached over the weekend should prevent further issues with supply from China.
    


            “A lot of that is cleared up now — the potential for supply disruptions from China,” Hassett said. “All of that stuff is cleared up by this really historic negotiation.”
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that the legal details on accepting a Boeing 747-8 jet to replace Air Force One as a gift from the Qatari royal family, are “still being worked out,” but that “any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law.”
    


            “The Qatari government has graciously offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense,” Leavitt said in an interview with Fox News on Monday.
    


                    “The legal details of that are still being worked out, but of course, any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law, and we commit ourselves to the utmost transparency, and we will continue to do that,” the press secretary added.
                





            When pressed if she believed this “gift” would require something in return, Leavitt was quick to respond, saying “absolutely not, because they know President Trump, and they know he only works with the interests of the American public in mind.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Sunday night that the Defense Department plans to accept the luxury jet as a “GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE,” on social media.
    


            CNN reported earlier on Sunday that the Trump administration was set to accept the plane from the Qatari royal family that will be retrofitted and used as Air Force One during the president's second term, according to two people familiar with the agreement.
    


            US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday morning characterized the trade war de-escalation that he helped negotiate this weekend with his Chinese counterparts as tough but respectful.
    


            “We were firm, and we moved forward,” Bessent told CNBC from Geneva. “We tried to identify shared interest. We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that.”
    


            Bessent noted that America was negotiating from a position of strength because China needs the United States to buy its products more than the US relies on China for its goods exports. China's economy is on the ropes, amid a housing crisis and an emerging debt crisis. Consumer spending has fallen, as has factory output. This is a bad time for China to be dealing with a crippling trade war.
    


                    “I had seen what's going on in the Chinese economy. We can see what's going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country. Historically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.”
                





            But, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war. US consumer sentiment fell off a cliff in recent months as inflation-weary Americans grew anxious about the prospect of rising prices and shortages. Shipments to the US from China were all but halted, rattling corporate America. And investors had braced for a recession, as economists said the US economy could get hit particularly hard by the trade war.
    


            The detente, though welcome by Wall Street, consumers and businesses, represents a remarkable shift for a Trump administration that only days ago had said the trade standoff with China was necessary to restore America's lost manufacturing prowess. Trump had said last week that zero trade with China put America in a stronger position, because that meant it was no longer “losing money” to the Chinese.
    


            Bessent said the deal didn't represent a major policy shift, however.
    


            “This is just a pause,” he said. “The April 2 tariff level for China was 34%, so we have moved that down from 34% to 10%.”
    


            President Donald Trump took to social media this morning to preview an executive order aimed at lowering drug costs that he is expected to sign later today.
    


                    “DRUG PRICES TO BE CUT BY 59%, PLUS! Gasoline, Energy, Groceries, and all other costs, DOWN. NO INFLATION!!! LOVE, DJT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





            The president announced yesterday that he plans to resurrect a controversial policy from his first term that aims to reduce drug costs by basing payments for certain medicines on their prices in other countries.
    


His prior rule, called “Most Favored Nation,” was finalized in late 2020 but blocked by federal courts and rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in 2021, as reported by CNN.
    


            Analysts welcomed the announcement that the United States and China will slash tariffs on each other's goods for a 90-day period on Monday, but warned against overoptimism on the trade spat between the world's two largest economies.
    


            “This is a substantial de-escalation,” said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at consultancy Capital Economics, chiming with others. But he noted that US tariffs on China remain much higher than on most other major economies and that America “still appears” to be trying to rally other countries to introduce restrictions of their own on trade with China.
    


                    “In these circumstances, there is no guarantee that the 90-day truce will give way to a lasting ceasefire,” he wrote in a note.
                





            Economists at Commerzbank, a big German bank, also pointed out that, compared with the situation before President Donald Trump returned to the White House, tariffs applied by the US and China to each other will still be significantly higher.
    


            Neil Wilson, a strategist at investment platform Saxo, also argued Monday that, despite comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the US does not want to economically “decouple” from China, “the US is absolutely trying to decouple.”
    


            That separation could take the form of a dramatic fall in trade between the two nations.
    


            The US and China have agreed to massively roll back tariffs on each other's goods for an initial 90-day period, de-escalating a global trade war.
    


            The announcement comes after a weekend of marathon trade negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland by officials from the world's two largest economies.
    


Major breakthrough: The substantial, if temporary, agreement was unexpected. Just last week, Bessent sought to manage expectations by suggesting that his goal for the talks was “de-escalation” of tension and not “a big trade deal,” as the US and China had been at a virtual stalemate since President Donald Trump imposed his tariff policy.
    


            The speed of the talks' progress seemed to surprise even US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer:
    


                    “It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,” he said Sunday.
                





            Trade Representative Li Chenggang had hinted at the tariff cuts when pressed by a reporter on Sunday for more detail about today's announcement:
    


                    “As regards the timing for the release of the joint statement, as we say back in China, if the dishes are delicious, then timing is not a matter. So I think no matter when this statement is released, it's going to be … big news, good news for the world,” he said.
                





            Beijing's upbeat and positive tone stands in stark contrast to its previous statements about the trade conflict with the US. For weeks, Chinese officials had struck a defiant tone, demanding the US remove all tariffs on China before agreeing to come to the negotiation table.
    


Brief relief: There had been a tit-for-tat escalation between the US and China since April, when Trump tacked 34% reciprocal tariffs on Chinese goods and upped that rate to 145% days later. China retaliated with 125% on US goods.
    


            Economists have said 50% is the make-or-break threshold for the return of somewhat normal business between the US and China.
    


Scramble to secure deals: White House officials have made clear they view the China talks as an entirely different endeavor than broader efforts to seal trade agreements with dozens of other nations. Those negotiations are on the clock after Trump's decision to pause the April 2 “reciprocal” tariff rates for 90 days.
    


            The deal Trump announced with the UK last week has maintained a 10% tariff rate but had some carve-outs for British cars, planes, steel, aluminum and beef.
    


            The trade war has already affected the US and Chinese economies.
    


            America's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, showed its first quarterly contraction since early 2022, as importers raced to bring in goods before punishing tariff rates kicked in.
    


            As for China, its exports to the US fell sharply last month, impacting the country's enormous manufacturing industry.
    


            Chinese factory activity contracted at its fastest pace in 16 months in April, adding urgency to Beijing's efforts to roll out fresh economic stimulus.
    


            On Friday, US port officials told CNN that not a single cargo vessel had left China with goods for the two major West Coast ports over the past 12 hours. That hasn't happened since the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reiterated that the US does not want to economically decouple from China, but seeks more “balance” in trade.
    


            “The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled, and what have occurred with these very high tariffs…was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade,” he said at a Monday press conference in Geneva.
    


            Last week, Bessent told Fox News: “We don't want to decouple; what we want is fair trade.”
    


            Global investors are cheering a thaw in the trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump's massive tariffs, which have roiled financial markets, disrupted supply chains and stoked recession fears.
    


            Stock markets around the world rose Monday after the United States and China agreed to drastically roll back tariffs on each other's goods for an initial 90-day period.
    


            Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 3.4% late afternoon local time.
    


            In Europe, Germany's DAX index and France's CAC were 1.2% and 1% up respectively early in the trading session. London's FTSE index rose 0.3%.
    


            US futures were also up. The Dow was set to open 2.1% higher, while futures in the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq were trading 2.7% and 3.6% higher respectively.
    


            The US dollar strengthened early Monday following the breakthrough in trade talks. The ICE dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of major currencies, rose 1.3% to $102.
    


            Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, was trading 2.8% higher.
    


            “This is buying time for a more comprehensive deal – allows for time for the process and ‘mechanism' in the words of Treasury Secretary Bessent to take place,” Neil Wilson, a strategist at investment platform Saxo Markets, wrote in a note Monday.
    


                    “But he also stressed that strategic rebalancing of the global economy is still underway, although ‘neither side want a decoupling,' which is the sort of commentary the market is going to lap up. But it is not true – the US is absolutely trying to decouple.”
                





            The United States and China have agreed to drastically roll back tariffs on each other's goods for an initial 90-day period, according to a joint statement from the two countries released Monday.
    


            The announcement comes after a weekend of marathon trade negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland by officials from the world's two largest economies.
    


            The tariff revisions will be imposed by May 14. US President Donald Trump's 20% fentanyl-related levies on China, imposed in February and March, will stay. However, each side has agreed to lower “reciprocal” tariffs on the other by 115 percentage points for 90 days.
    


            That effectively means the US will temporarily lower its overall tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will cut its levies on American imports from 125% to 10%, according to the joint statement.
    


            The two sides also agreed to establish “a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations,” led by Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, according to the statement.
    


                    “These discussions may be conducted alternately in China and the United States, or a third country upon agreement of the Parties. As required, the two sides may conduct working-level consultations on relevant economic and trade issues,” it read.
                





            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke separately with his British counterpart and Germany's Chancellor late on Sunday, reaffirming that the US position on Russia's war in Ukraine remains “an immediate ceasefire.”
    


                    “The Secretary reaffirmed the US position on the Russia-Ukraine war: our top priority remains bringing an end to the fighting and an immediate ceasefire,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a readout of Rubio's call with Lammy.
                





            In a separate call, Rubio and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz discussed a recent meeting between European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and “our shared goal of ending the war in Ukraine,” according to a State readout.
    


            The calls come as the British Foreign Minister David Lammy is set to host European delegations in London on Monday for critical talks on Ukraine and the future of European security. And as Russian President Vladimir Putin ignores calls from Ukraine's major European allies to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire by Monday or face “massive” new sanctions.
    


            US President Donald Trump urged Ukraine to “immediately” accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer for direct talks on Thursday in Istanbul, dropping his demand for Russia to agree to a ceasefire.
    


            Zelensky said he is prepared to meet Vladimir Putin. However, Ukraine's allies have stressed that no further talks should be held before Putin agrees to an unconditional truce.
    


            And Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, said in an interview with local media published Monday that the first step to any negotiations to end the war in Ukraine still rests on whether Russia will agree to a 30-day ceasefire.
    


            Representatives from France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Poland and the EU are expected to attend the talks hosted in London on Monday, according to Britain's foreign ministry. Lammy plans to announce further sanctions targeting actors supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the ministry said, according to Reuters.

Federal prosecutors will begin trying to prove Monday that Sean “Diddy” Combs turned his hip-hop conglomerate into a racketeering enterprise that forced women to satisfy his sexual desires for two decades. (May 12)

Sean “Diddy” Combs' family has arrived to the courthouse as opening statements are expected to begin in his sex trafficking trial in New York. A publicist for his attorneys says Combs is “Upbeat, ready to have his side told in open court.”

NEW YORK (AP) — The public knew Sean “Diddy” Combs as a larger-than-life music and business mogul, but in private he used violence and threats to coerce women into drug-fueled sexual encounters that he recorded, a prosecutor said Monday in opening statements at Combs' sex trafficking trial.

“This is Sean Combs,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Johnson told the Manhattan jury as she pointed at Combs, who leaned back in his chair. ”During this trial you are going to hear about 20 years of the defendant's crimes.”

Those crimes, she said, included kidnapping, arson, drugs, sex crimes, bribery and obstruction.

Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos, though, described the trial as a misguided overreach by prosecutors, saying that although her client could be violent, the state was trying to turn consenting sex between adults into a prostitution and sex trafficking case.

“Sean Combs is a complicated man. But this is not a complicated case. This case is about love, jealousy, infidelity and money,” Geragos told the jury of eight men and four women. “There has been a tremendous amount of noise around this case over the past year. It is time to cancel that noise.”

Geragos conceded that Combs' violent outbursts, often fueled by alcohol, jealousy and drugs, might have warranted domestic violence charges, but not sex trafficking and racketeering counts. She told jurors they might think Combs' is a “jerk” and might not condone his “kinky sex,” but “he's not charged with being mean. He's not charged with being a jerk.”




With the trial's first witness, Israel Florez, prosecutors went right to proof of violence by showing footage of Combs kicking and dragging the R&B singer Cassie, his longtime girlfriend, on the floor outside a Los Angeles hotel's elevators in March 2016.

After CNN aired video of the attack last year, Combs apologized and said he was “disgusted” by his actions.

Florez, who worked hotel security in 2016 but is now a Los Angeles police officer, said he knew who Combs was when he encountered him sitting by the hotel's elevators as he responded to a report of a woman in distress.

He said he encountered Combs by the elevators in only a white towel and slouching in a chair “with a blank stare ... like a devilish stare, just looking at me.”

He said that as he was escorting Cassie and Combs to their room, she indicated she wanted to leave and Combs told her: “You're not going to leave.” Florez said he told Combs: “If she wants to leave, she's going to leave.”

Cassie left, and Florez said Combs called out while holding a stack of money with a $100 bill on top, telling him, “Don't tell nobody.” Florez said he considered it a bribe and told Combs, “I don't want your money. Just go back into your room.”

Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, was expected to testify later Monday or Tuesday. 

Combs watched Monday's proceedings attentively. When he entered the courtroom, he hugged his lawyers and gave a thumbs-up to family and friends. The case has drawn intense public interest. The line to get into the courthouse stretched down the block. Combs' mother and some of his children were escorted past the crowd and into the building.

Combs, 55, pleaded not guilty to a five-count indictment that could result in a 15-year-to-life prison sentence if he is convicted. Since his September arrest, he's been held at a federal jail in Brooklyn.

Lawyers for the three-time Grammy winner say prosecutors are wrongly trying to make a crime out of a party-loving lifestyle that may have been indulgent, but not illegal.

Prosecutors say Combs coerced women into drugged-up group sexual encounters he called “freak offs,” “wild king nights” or “hotel nights,” then kept them in line by choking, hitting, kicking and dragging them, often by the hair.

In her opening, Johnson said Cassie was far from the only woman Combs beat and sexually exploited.

The prosecutor said Combs last year brutally beat another woman — identified only as Jane — when she confronted him about enduring years of freak offs in dark hotel rooms while he took other paramours on date nights and trips around the globe.

The sex parties are central to Combs' sexual abuse, prosecutors say. Combs' company paid for the parties, held in hotel rooms across the U.S. and overseas, and his employees staged the rooms with his preferred lighting, extra linens and lubricant, Johnson said. Combs compelled women, including Cassie, to take drugs and engage in sexual activity with male escorts while he gratified himself and sometimes recorded them, Johnson said.

Combs would beat Cassie over the smallest slights, such as leaving a freak off without his permission or taking too long in the bathroom, Johnson said. Combs threatened to ruin Cassie's singing career by publicly releasing videos of her sexually involved with male escorts, the prosecutor said. “Her livelihood depended on keeping him happy,” Johnson said.

Combs sat expressionless as Johnson described what she said was a pattern of violence, sexual abuse and blackmail. 

Cassie sued Combs in 2023, and the lawsuit was settled within hours, but it touched off a law enforcement investigation and was followed by dozens of lawsuits making similar claims. 

Geragos claimed Combs' accusers were motivated by money. She told jurors that Cassie demanded $30 million when she sued him, and another witness will acknowledge demanding $22 million in a breach of contract lawsuit.

“I want you to ask yourself, how many millions of reasons does this witness ... have to lie?” she said.

Geragos also conceded that Combs is extremely jealous and “has a bad temper,” telling the jury that he sometimes got angry and lashed out when he drank alcohol or “did the wrong drugs.” But, she said, “Domestic violence is not sex trafficking.”

The Associated Press doesn't generally identify people who say they are victims of sexual abuse unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has done.

The trial is expected to last two months.

LONDON (AP) — The Eurovision party is officially underway: a week of power pop, outrageous outfits — and, inevitably, protests — that culminates in the final of the 69th Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday night.

Competitors representing 37 countries are in the Swiss city of Basel for disco diplomacy and one of the world's biggest spectacles. Organizers say last year's final was watched by more than 160 million people — a guilty pleasure for some, an unabashed joy for others.

Here's how and what to watch:

This year's contest is in Switzerland because Swiss singer Nemo won the contest last year with the operatic anthem “The Code.” Basel, which borders Germany and France, was chosen as the host city.

Countries from across Europe — and a few beyond, like Israel and Australia — have sent an act to Eurovision. The performers will take the stage at St. Jakobshalle arena in semifinals on Tuesday and Thursday that will choose 20 acts to go through to the final.

The “Big Five” of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K., along with host Switzerland, automatically qualify for the final.




The competition will be aired by national broadcasters in participating nations, on streaming service Peacock in the United States and in many countries on the Eurovision YouTube channel.

Bars and clubs in many European cities will show the final at parties.

Halfdan Helgi Matthiasson, representing Iceland as half of sibling duo VAEB, said his family watches the classic, way, “sitting on a sofa with popcorn and snacks.”

Croatian contestant Marko Bošnjak said he was usually “the person who was hosting the Eurovision parties and forcing everybody to give me their scores and papers,” adding: “It's my Olympics. I live for this.”

Adonxs, this year's competitor from Czechia, has fond memories of working in a London pub where staff were body-painted in the colors of a national flag.

“I did get an allergic reaction on my face the next morning, which I did not appreciate,” he said. “But yeah, I guess it was worth it.”

During and immediately after the semifinals and final, viewers in participating countries can vote by phone, text message or the Eurovision app — but not for their own country. Viewers in the U.S. and other nonparticipating countries can vote online at www.esc.vote or with the app. The combined “rest of the world” vote is given the weight of one individual country.

The semifinals are decided by public vote, and viewers can only vote in the semifinal their country is participating in.

For the final, the winner is decided by a complex mix of public voting and points from juries of music industry professionals in all the participating countries. The juries allocate between one and 12 points to their favorite songs, with an announcer from each country popping up to declare which has been granted the coveted “douze points” (12 points).

Public and jury votes are combined to give each country a single score. Ending up with “nul points” (zero points) is considered a national embarrassment.

Betting odds make Sweden the strong favorite with “Bara Bada Bastu,” an upbeat ode to sauna culture performed by the trio KAJ.

Favorites have tended to win in recent years, but that isn't always the case.

Other strong contenders, according to bookmakers, include classically trained Austrian singer JJ's “popera” song “Wasted Love,” French singer Louane's ballad “maman,” Dutch entry Claude's “C'est La Vie” and Israeli singer Yuval Raphael, a survivor of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack, with “New Day Will Rise.”

Israel has competed in Eurovision for more than 50 years, and won four times. But last year's event in the Swedish city of Malmo drew large demonstrations calling for Israel to be kicked out of the contest over its conduct of its war against Hamas in Gaza.

More than 70 former participants, including 2017 winner Salvador Sobral from Portugal, 2023 U.K. entry Mae Muller and La Zarra, who competed for France in 2023, signed a letter calling for Israel to be excluded. They noted that Russia has been banned since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The European Broadcasting Union, which runs Eurovision, pointed out that Israel is represented by its public broadcaster, KAN, not the government.

Several of the national broadcasters that fund Eurovision, including those of Spain, Ireland and Iceland, have called for a discussion about Israel's participation.

After tensions ran high last year, with the expulsion of the Dutch contestant over a backstage altercation, the EBU tightened the contest's code of conduct, calling on participants to respect Eurovision's values of “universality, diversity, equality and inclusivity” and its political neutrality.

It has barred performers from waving flags, other than national ones, onstage or in other on-camera areas. But some delegations have protested that effectively bans LGBTQ+ pride flags from an event with a huge gay following.

Audience members will be allowed more leeway, however, after controversy last year after a ban on Palestinian flags.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Indiana Pacers spent two days looking for solutions against top-seeded Cleveland.

On Sunday, they delivered an emphatic answer.

Pascal Siakam scored 21 points, Myles Turner and Obi Toppin each scored 20 and the Pacers tied an NBA playoff record with a 41-point halftime lead before blowing out the Cavs 129-109 to take a 3-1 series lead. 

The No. 4-seeded Pacers can close it out Tuesday in Cleveland, where they've already won twice.

“We haven't done anything yet,” coach Rick Carlisle said after earning his 33rd playoff win with Indiana, passing Larry Bird for the most in the franchise's NBA history. “We're going to keep approaching this like we have everything to prove. We know people don't believe in us, so we're just going to stay in the fight and keep fighting.”

The Pacers certainly showed some resolve two days after an embarrassing 22-point loss on their home court, a game in which Cleveland dominated the glass and held two-time All-Star Tyrese Haliburton to four points and five assists.

This time, the towel-waving home crowd helped spur Indiana, right from the start of a physical, sometimes chippy game.

The Pacers built a 44-point lead before settling for an 80-39 halftime margin that matched the league's previous best since detailed play-by-play was kept, set by the Cavs in Game 2 of the 2017 Eastern Conference finals against Boston.




Indiana did much of its damage without Bennedict Mathurin, one of its best scorers, who was ejected for a Flagrant 2 foul just 7 1/2 minutes into the game. And with Donovan Mitchell missing the second half because of an injured left ankle, the Cavs had no chance.

Darius Garland led the Cavs with 21 points in his second game back from an injured toe. Mitchell finished with 12. Coach Kenny Atkinson said Mitchell would have an MRI exam Monday. 

“Complete domination by them,” Atkinson said briefly, before explaining at least the Cavs have two of the final three games on their home court. “They dominated us in every facet of the game.”

Indiana wasted no time taking control quickly with early runs of 11-2 and 13-0 to build a commanding 48-23 lead with 9:24 left in the first half. They didn't stop — or back down — there, either, closing the half on a 19-2 run

Aaron Nesmith's buzzer-beating midrange jumper put the Pacers in another exclusive club — the 10th team in playoff history and second this week to score 80 points in the first half of a playoff game. Oklahoma City scored 87 points in Game 2 against Denver. 

Turner made all four of his 3-point attempts with Indianapolis 500 winners Dario Franchitti and Scott Dixon, WNBA Rookies of the Year Caitlin Clark and Aliyah Boston, and former NFL star Reggie Wayne in the crowd.

“We felt the last game, they set the tone from a physical standpoint,” Haliburton said after finishing with 11 points, five rebounds and five assists. “Today, we came out and set the tone from the jump, really just rode that wave.”

Attorney Mehek Cooke explains why the Trump administration is using the Alien Enemies Act, and why federal judges have a range of opinions of the matter.

A U.S. appeals court will review the Trump administration's bid to avoid returning a 20-year-old Venezuelan asylum seeker who was deported to El Salvador earlier this year, keeping him in Salvadoran custody for now. 

The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed last week to take up Trump's appeal – staying through May 15 a lower court's ruling that required the Trump administration to immediately return him to U.S. soil.

The appeals court also ordered plaintiffs in the case to submit their response to the court before noon on Monday. The Trump administration will have through 9 a.m. Tuesday to respond.

At issue is the case of Daniel Lozano-Camargo, a 20-year-old Venezuelan national previously referred to in court documents as ""Cristian,"" who was deported to El Salvador in March in the Trump administration's early wave of Alien Enemies Act removals.

FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS RETURN OF DEPORTED MIGRANT TO US, REJECTING TRUMP REQUEST

U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, ruled in April that his deportation violated an agreement the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) struck in 2024 with Lozano-Camargo and a group of young asylum seekers who had entered the U.S. as unaccompanied children.

Under that agreement, DHS agreed not to deport the migrants in question until their requests for asylum could be fully adjudicated in U.S. court. Last month, Gallagher said Lozano-Camargo's deportation was a ""breach of contract,"" since his asylum case had not yet been heard, and ordered the U.S. government to facilitate his release.

She reiterated that decision in court last week, rejecting a new filing from the Justice Department that said it had determined Lozano-Camargo was eligible for removal under the law, citing his earlier arrest and conviction for cocaine possession in Houston this year. 

Justice Department officials claimed in earlier court documents that Lozano-Camargo was a member of a ""violent terrorist gang"" but have not linked him to Tren de Aragua. Portions of their most recent court filing have been redacted. 

Gallagher had specifically ordered the Trump administration to make a ""good faith request to the government of El Salvador"" to ""release Cristian, [or Lozano-Camargo], to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by USCIS,"" which it had not done.

Gallagher emphasized in court last week that her decision has nothing to do with the strength of his asylum request, and is based solely on due process protections.

""I don't think that this is a case about whether or not Cristian is going to eventually get asylum,"" she told lawyers for the Trump administration.

""Process is important. We don't skip to the end and say, ‘We all know how this is going to end so we'll just skip that part,'"" she said. ""Whether he ultimately receives asylum is not the issue. The issue is – and has always been – one of process.""

Still, Gallagher agreed to stay her ruling for 48 hours, giving the administration time to appeal it to the higher court, which it did.

More than a ton of cocaine worth nearly $400 million was seized off the coast of Australia during a drug bust that ended with the arrests of five men on Friday, local authorities said.

New South Wales (NSW) Police Force investigators obtained intelligence about a suspicious purchase of a boat with a large sum of cash in late April and began following the movements of the vessel and people involved, the NSW and Australian Federal Police (AFP) said in a joint news release.

Both the NSW and AFP monitored their activities as they traveled north via Nelson Bay and Port Macquarie, according to the agencies.

When the vessel came back to shore on Friday, marine authorities launched an interception.

Authorities discovered approximately 1,110 blocks of cocaine, weighing 1.039 tons, aboard the vessel. The cocaine had an estimated potential street value of nearly $400 million, according to authorities.

Two men, aged 24 and 26, were arrested on board the vessel. Three others were arrested on shore when police spotted vehicles trying to leave the area. (NSW Police/Australian Federal Police )

Two men, aged 24 and 26, were arrested on board the vessel. Three men – aged 28, 29 and 35 – were arrested on shore after investigators stopped two vehicles attempting to leave the area.

""Australia's vast coastline is attractive to organized crime groups, who attempt to exploit this by trying to import drugs using boats,"" AFP Assistant Commissioner Stephen Dametto said. ""The bad news for them is the AFP will continue to work together with our partners to target organized crime syndicates who wrongly believe they can operate with impunity.""

The two men arrested on the boat were charged with supplying a prohibited drug in a large commercial quantity, while the three men arrested on shore were charged with taking part in supplying a prohibited drug in a large commercial quantity. All five face charges of participating in a criminal group.

All five men appeared in court and were denied bail.

The media are losing their friends just as they lost viewership and readership as they stepped up bias, according to a new survey of news consumers.

Younger voters, older people, Hispanics, Republicans, independents, and even Democrats cited pro-Democratic bias in agreeing that they just can't hate the media enough.

The latest Rasmussen Reports survey shared with Secrets found that 49% believe news bias is getting worse, while, by a margin of 44% to 29%, likely voters agree with the statement: “No matter how much you hate the media, it's not enough.”

Bias in the media has been around forever, and political bias has exploded since President Donald Trump hit the presidential stage.

Recent presidents have tried to fight it, but with little luck. Former President Barack Obama, for example, tried to skip over the media and use social media as his direct outreach to voters.

Trump's team, which often criticizes the legacy liberal media, has moved to add center-right outlets to the White House press pool for balance.

But consumers still see it, and most believe it favors Democrats. Rasmussen said that 49% see bias getting worse, compared to just 11% who see it getting better.

There is little disagreement that Democrats are the beneficiaries. Even Democrats agreed. Asked if the media organizations favor Democrats over Republicans, 43% of Democrats agreed while 24% disagreed.

And on the issue of hating the media, more Democrats than not agreed with Republicans. Democrats, by a 40%-35% margin, believe they can't hate the media enough. For Republicans, it was 57% to 21%.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

How to understand the phony trade deals with Britain and China

If you've ever watched a game of three-card monte, you've noticed that the dealer talks nonstop. The chatter serves two functions. First, it distracts the victims. Second, and maybe more important, the dealer is deceiving his victims about what's befalling them. The spiel invites them to imagine they're playing a game in which they stand a fair chance. In reality, they are being swindled.

The Trump White House's press releases about its so-called trade agreements and negotiations—first with the United Kingdom, now with China—are just so much dealer patter.

The tariff numbers go up. Up and up and up. Ooh, now they come down. Up! Down! And all the while, everybody involved is telling contradictory stories about what's being done and why.

The noise is made even more confusing by the journalists trying to explain the game.

In the street-corner version of three-card monte, the dealer is typically assisted by confederates in the crowd. These confederates help the dealer misdirect the suckers and elbow out of the way anybody who seems wise to the hustle. Pro-Trump media play that same role in the tariff debate.

Meanwhile, the respectable financial media, which actually possess deep expertise on tariffs and trade, struggle as much as anybody else to interpret the seeming chaos. They perceive that the show being performed in no way resembles the negotiations that produced trade agreements in the past. But their own habits and rules forbid them from drawing the correct critical conclusions from the crazy discrepancy they observe.

Turn off the sound. Ignore the cards. Watch the players. And, suddenly, things come into focus.

A tariff is a tax, but a tax that differs from other taxes in three important ways.

First, a tariff is a tax that can be imposed by the president acting unilaterally. The normal constitutional rule is that only Congress can impose taxes. With tariffs, however, Congress has delegated much of its authority to the president. Theoretically, this deference is for emergency purposes, but because the president has the sole power to determine whether a trade emergency prevails, tariffs provide a means of raising revenue that he can impose all on his own.

Second, a tariff is a tax that the president can waive unilaterally. A president could never, say, exempt a company from corporate income tax on the condition that the company donate to the president's inauguration committee; nor can he forgive a taxpayer's obligation to pay capital-gains tax if that taxpayer buys the first lady's lifetime rights for a documentary that never gets made. But a president can create tariff exemptions in those ways and for those reasons.

Third, a tariff is a uniquely regressive tax, one that falls most heavily on the least affluent people in society. Imagine a low-income family eating a meal at home. The table is tariffed, the chairs are tariffed, the plates are tariffed, the knives and forks are tariffed, the Canadian wheat in the pasta is tariffed. Now imagine a wealthy family eating a meal in a restaurant. Their tables, chairs, and so on might be tariffed too. But the most important costs in their restaurant meal are the wages of the chef and the servers, the rent the restaurant pays to occupy its premises, and other overheads. Those costs are not tariffed. Basically, the more of your income you spend on services, the less you pay in tariffs. Income that is saved and invested pays no tariff at all, so the richer you are, the more of your income you can save and invest.

The working man's car is tariffed. The rich man's chauffeur is not tariffed.

The poor girl's dolls are tariffed. The nanny hired to play dolls with the rich girl is not tariffed.

Towels are tariffed. Membership fees at the sports club are not.

The doorknob is tariffed. The butler who stands by to open the door is not.

Read: China called Trump's bluff

The Trump administration and its allies in Congress are aiming to pass a big tax cut. That tax cut may be decorated with a few symbolic concessions to low-wage workers. Most of its benefit, however, will accrue to the very richest people in U.S. society. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has radically reduced tax enforcement upon the very rich by laying off one-third of the auditors for the IRS. Altogether, Trump's fiscal plans imply a huge increase in the U.S. government's deficit and a dramatic surge in federal debt.

An administration that genuinely cared about the trade deficit would flinch from these fiscal plans. Economists generally agree that fiscal deficits drive trade deficits. To simplify a complex relationship: The United States borrows in dollars. Lenders buy dollars to lend to the United States. All of those lenders buying at once push up the value of the dollar. With the dollar more valuable, U.S. imports seem cheaper and U.S. exports become more expensive. So the U.S. imports more and exports less. If the goal were genuinely to import less and export more, the Trump administration would stop futzing around with tariffs and would instead balance the federal budget.

If. But if the goal is to redistribute the cost of government from the richest to the poorest, while enormously augmenting the president's personal power to the detriment of Congress, then the Trump plans make a lot more sense.

All of this hullabaloo about nonsense deals with Britain and China serves to distract from the brute reality of the Trump and MAGA trade agenda.

There are no real deals. Tariffs on U.S. imports from Britain and China, and the ensuing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports to Britain and China, are all higher than they were the day before Trump's inauguration. Nothing has been achieved to promote trade, and indeed nothing has truly been tried, because trade promotion is not the goal.

Fiscal redistribution from poor to rich: That is the goal. This goal is advancing.

Maximization of the president's power—to punish enemies and sell favors—is also the goal. This goal is advancing even more successfully.

The six weeks since Trump's “Liberation Day,” on April 2, have seen some of the most extreme financial volatility since the global financial crisis of 2008–09. Back then, markets were tossed around by objective financial realities. This time, they are convulsed by one man's whims. Reporting strongly suggests that some market participants had advance access to that man's whims, and scored hundreds of billions of dollars of speculative profits from knowing when to buy and when to sell.

Non-speculators have also bought and sold influence. CEOs who Trump thinks are “nice” gain extra consideration for their companies: See the way Apple secured a special exemption for iPhone sales. But small businesses that lack the resources and contacts to win Trump's favor are crushed and ruined.

Meanwhile, the deal patter of jingoistic rhetoric and confusing promises is deployed to conceal the real mechanics of plunder and profit. The only people who say otherwise are the hustlers and their touts. The only people who believe otherwise are the marks.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

When President Donald Trump launched his trade war on the world, he issued a stern warning: “Do not retaliate and you will be rewarded.” China ignored the warning. It was rewarded anyway. This morning, Trump largely suspended his trade war in return for nothing but promises of ongoing discussions. There is a lesson here for everybody Trump threatens, whether countries or businesses or universities.

The unveiling of the Trump global tariff regime was accompanied by a distinct form of dominance theater. The president and his gang assured his targets that if they submitted to his tariffs, he would repay their compliance. Any country that dared defy him would suffer terribly.

“I wouldn't want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump,” posted Eric Trump. “The first to negotiate will win—the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life.”

Most of the world accepted this advice, only to discover the difficulty of making global trade deals with a president who doesn't seem to understand how trade works. Foreign diplomats expressed repeated frustration as they failed to ascertain what Trump even wanted from them, let alone what he was prepared to offer in return. To date, only the United Kingdom has managed to resolve its trade status with the United States.

China, however, retaliated with countermeasures of its own, imposing steep tariffs on American imports. Trump decided to make an example of the country. “Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” he announced on Truth Social. (This figure eventually increased to 145 percent.) Other countries, which had showed proper respect, would receive a merciful reprieve. “The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction,” claimed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

Rogé Karma: What if China wins the trade war?

Trump held out for one month before backing down. Under the new 90-day agreement, tariffs on Chinese goods will come down to 30 percent; China's tariffs on American goods will likewise decline to 10 percent. “The consensus from both delegations is that neither side wanted a decoupling,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced at a press conference in Geneva, as if the whole thing had been one big misunderstanding. The decades of China allegedly “ripping off” the United States were apparently forgotten, along with China's insolence in retaliating and the supposed need for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on Chinese imports. The administration isn't even pretending that it forced China to pay any special price for its defiance. It is memory-holing the entire “do not retaliate” episode and moving on as if the point this whole time was to get along better with Beijing.

As an exercise in trade policy, this makes no sense. But to treat Trump's behavior as if it were narrowly tailored to the objective of reordering global trade misses the symbolic role it plays. Trump is performing a character, the presidential version of the boss he played in The Apprentice, sitting in a plush leather chair doling out justice to quavering supplicants.

His threats of conquest against Canada, Greenland, and Panama, and his unilateral renaming of the Gulf of Mexico, advance no practical objective. Indeed, they generate resentment that weakens his leverage over those countries. Trump's best chance to add Greenland to the United States, for example, would have been to use a soft touch, rather than to insist that he would have it one way or another. The purpose that these gambits seem to serve is to establish Trump as the boss man lording his power over vulnerable targets.

The original target of this ritual was Mexico. Trump's crowds used to delight when he would respond to any defiance by announcing, “The wall just got 10 feet higher.” Nobody believed that Trump was planning to literally increase the height of the wall. The point was to show that Trump was in charge, and that anybody who tried to stand up to him would be punished.

This makes for an unusual style of governing, to say the least, and even a decade into the Trump era, the president's targets often respond with confusion. But the evidence suggests a fairly clear pattern: Although Trump instructs his targets to submit, doing so merely sets them up for more humiliation and abuse.

Consider a handful of recent cases. Columbia University agreed to the Trump administration's invasive demands, only for the administration to come back and issue even more. The powerful pharmaceutical lobby decided not to resist Trump's nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose weird ideology poses an existential threat. Not only has Kennedy declined to back down from his extreme positions; the administration has escalated its war on the industry by cutting funding for scientific research and taking steps to impose limited price controls.

By contrast, when Harvard defied Trump's list of demands, the administration claimed that its letter threatening the university had been released in error, and complained that the famous university had acted unreasonably. True, Trump has escalated by targeting Harvard's tax-exempt status, but he stands little chance of winning in court, and defying court orders won't help him make Harvard pay taxes that it does not legally owe. Similarly, after Canadians elected Mark Carney as prime minister and he insisted that his country could never be purchased or taken, Trump responded with a friendly Oval Office meeting in which he seemed to accept Carney's refusal.

Rose Horowitch: What Harvard learned from Columbia's mistake

The genuinely complicated factor in these negotiations is that “winning” with Trump is often impossible, because the relationship itself is lose-lose. Trump does not appear to recognize the possibility of a positive-sum engagement, and his attempts to turn a productive connection into an exploitative one create losses for both sides. This is most obvious in trade, where Trump's protectionist instincts have spread pain around the globe without generating any gains. His extortion of domestic firms and civil society has likewise undermined some of America's most admired sources of innovation, for no offsetting benefit other than the expansion of Trump's own power.

Trump is a classic bully who craves submission and fears conflict. His fervent supporters want him to be Michael Corleone, but he's more like Biff Tannen. Standing up to Trump does not mean that you win. But giving in guarantees that you lose.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

US President Donald Trump raised the possibility of flying to Turkey on Thursday to join potential conversations over the war in Ukraine between Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Russia's Vladimir Putin. 

“I was thinking about flying over,” Trump said Monday at the White House. “I don't know where I'm going to be on Thursday — I've got so many meetings — but I was thinking about actually flying over there.

Perplexity AI is in late-stage talks to raise $500 million at a $14 billion valuation, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to CNBC on Monday.

Accel, the Palo Alto-based venture capital firm, will lead the round, according to the source, who spoke anonymously because the round is not yet finalized. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the late-stage numbers.

The funding is on the lower end of Perplexity's planned raise, which CNBC reported in March. During those early-stage talks, Perplexity was looking to raise between $500 million and $1 billion in funding at an $18 billion post-money valuation, per a source familiar.

The artificial intelligence search engine company competes against the likes of Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Its valuation in December was $9 billion, triple its $3 billion valuation in June 2024.

Perplexity has just under $100 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR, the source told CNBC in March.

Perplexity has been in the middle of the generative AI boom that began in late 2022 with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, and it is betting big on its upcoming AI agent web browser, called Comet. But Perplexity faces increasing competition in the AI search market.

In March, Anthropic launched its web search product, allowing its chatbot Claude to display real-time search results to a subset of users.

Last fall, OpenAI launched a search feature within ChatGPT, its viral chatbot, that positioned it to better compete with Perplexity, as well as leading search engines such as Google and Microsoft's Bing.

Google has released AI Overviews within its search product as well, though it sparked controversy over high-profile errors soon after its release.

In this article

Shares of KindlyMD skyrocketed 350% Monday after the healthcare company announced a merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, a key cryptocurrency advisor to President Donald Trump.

The newly formed company has secured $200 million in convertible debt and $510 million in fresh capital through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, offering shares at $1.12 each.

According to Bailey, the convertible note carries a premium to the PIPE price, with investors buying shares at $1.12, but the notes will convert at $2.80. He added that the notes are zero-coupon for the first two years.

Since news of the fund broke on Wednesday, the project has attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in additional commitments, Bailey said.

""I've been raising about $100 million a day,"" Bailey told CNBC. ""Yesterday, I raised almost $200 million.""

The raise drew support from more than 200 investors, including Actai Ventures, Arrington Capital, BSQ Capital Partners, Kingsway, Van Eck, and Yorkville Advisors.

The roster of individual investors reads like a who's who of bitcoin — cryptographer Adam Back; Balaji Srinivasan, a former Coinbase executive; Jihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain; and Ricardo Salinas, the Mexican billionaire who has become one of bitcoin's most vocal supporters.

But KindlyMD's foray into crypto is even stranger, given that the company built its brand around combating opioid addiction with holistic health services.

Bailey said his team was searching for ""the right vehicle"" to take Nakamoto public, and KindlyMD's leadership team was already full of bitcoin enthusiasts.

""They believed in the strategy,"" Bailey said. ""What KindlyMD will look like in the future will be different than what it looks like today.""

He confirmed that the combined company plans to rebrand, change its ticker from ""KDLY,"" and begin acquiring bitcoin-native companies to build a global network of bitcoin holdings.

According to Bailey, the vision is to build a global network of bitcoin-focused businesses, with the healthcare operation eventually playing a smaller role.

""This merger represents a strategic leap for KindlyMD, allowing us to expand our mission,"" said Tim Pickett, CEO of KindlyMD. ""Nakamoto brings in a team with deep expertise in Bitcoin strategy and unparalleled access to the leading experts in bitcoin treasury management.""

Pickett, who will continue to oversee KindlyMD's healthcare operations, insisted that the clinics will maintain their focus on treating opioid addiction and offering patient-first care.

""It's a bold new vision that will drive long-term value for our shareholders,"" added Pickett.

Bitcoin was trading above $102,000 Monday afternoon, having surged past $100,000 on Thursday for the first time since February.

Nakamoto, led by Bailey as CEO, will focus on acquiring and holding bitcoin — a strategy that has become popular among investment firms seeking to turn their stock into a direct bet on the cryptocurrency's price.

""Our total focus is on increasing the bitcoin per share,"" Bailey told CNBC. ""We're selling one bitcoin for more than a bitcoin, or we're buying a bitcoin for less than a bitcoin.""

Bailey isn't the first to chase this model. Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) transformed itself from a software company into a de facto bitcoin holding firm in 2020, converting its cash reserves into bitcoin and watching its stock skyrocket as bitcoin's value surged.

But Bailey describes his vision as ""Strategy, squared."" Rather than simply holding bitcoin, Nakamoto aims to actively acquire and create bitcoin treasury companies in ""every capital market on the planet.""

Bailey pointed to existing deals in Hong Kong, India, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The company is also in talks with partners in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and Argentina.

Bailey's influence extends beyond business. He has visited the White House at least six times since Trump took office, including a trip just last week, according to a person familiar with the matter. His role has positioned him among a cohort of cryptocurrency experts advising on digital asset policy.

""I'm a massive supporter. I'm a believer in him and his family and his administration,"" Bailey told CNBC. ""The President has delivered on all the promises he made to the bitcoin industry… and I'm eternally grateful.""

When asked about his role, Bailey was clear: ""When called upon, I provide the best feedback or counsel I can on bitcoin.""

After the successful deployment last week of Pectra, Ethereum's biggest upgrade in more than a year, the network's core developers are already shifting focus to the next major chain upgrade: Fusaka.



Pectra, the biggest code change to Ethereum since the Merge in 2022, introduced key changes aimed at making staking easier for institutions, improving wallet accessibility, and boosting transaction efficiency.



Developers have already begun planning for Fusaka, the network's next upgrade, and have thus far agreed to include an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) called ""PeerDAS"" that could help the network support larger ""blobs"" of transaction data. 



Blobs, introduced during the Dencun upgrade, are dedicated spaces for large chunks of data related to transactions. They are stored off-chain, which reduces congestion on the Ethereum blockchain and lowers gas fees. The blobs are crucial for the growing layer-2 ecosystem built on top of Ethereum, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Coinbase's Base, which process transactions more quickly and at lower costs than the main chain.



PeerDAS, which stands for Peer Data Availability Sampling, would let validators download partial data from blobs instead of full blobs to validate whether the data has been posted to the network.



In theory, PeerDAS could reduce layer-2 transaction costs and benefit institutions operating validators on the Ethereum blockchain. 



“PeerDAS is super important since we want to help layer-2s scale,” said Parithosh Jayanti, a devops engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, to CoinDesk over Telegram. “PeerDAS allows us to bump the blob limit significantly.""



Fusaka is scheduled to go live at the end of 2025 and will eventually include a bundle of additional upgrades beyond PeerDAS. However, Ethereum developers are notorious for delaying their upgrades. 



Pectra was initially set for release at the end of 2024 but was postponed to the first quarter of 2025. After a few faulty tests, the developers further delayed the upgrade to May.



Ethereum developers have been criticized over the past year for not implementing protocol changes quickly enough. As the price of the network's token has lagged in recent months and developers have migrated to competing ecosystems, the chain's community has debated whether its unofficial leader — the non-profit Ethereum Foundation — is to blame.

 RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” is a modern open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles.

 If RISC-V causes a major shift in the Ethereum architecture, what will be the benefits of making this change? In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts' performance and processing.According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V's suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.It's less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate.

Did you know? Ethereum has gone through several major development milestones over its first decade. Notably, in 2016, it conducted a hard fork to roll back the chain after The DAO hack. The result is still noticeable today with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains both in existence.

 Buterin's proposal has sparked a lively debate among Ethereum users and developers. It is an ambitious idea that could be a milestone in the development roadmap for the leading smart contract blockchain. Programmer Ben Adams raised several concerns about the proposal: In short, the ZK-proof might become more efficient, but there could be a trade-off. Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower. “The risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,” commented Ben Adams.A sentiment that was echoed by another anonymous commenter, “I agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.”Others appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost. “Agree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks. But is this the set of priorities we want to solve for, especially given the scale of technical cost here?” added Adam Cochran. It's clear that the proposal still needs clarity and further discussions within the Ethereum community. While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the layer-1 blockchain works.Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn't just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community.

Wall Street analysts rerated Coinbase Global, Inc COIN on Friday after the company reported disappointing first-quarter results on Thursday.

Rosenblatt analyst Chris Brendler maintained Coinbase Global with a Buy and a $260 price target.

Needham analyst John Todaro reiterated Coinbase Global with a Buy and lowered the price target from $330 to $270.

Rosenblatt: Revenue of $2.03 billion missed consensus of $2.10 billion by ~3% but came in slightly higher than Brendler's estimate. 

Despite multiple attempts to anticipate trading weakness, transaction revenue still missed the analyst's below consensus estimate ($1.26 billion versus his $1.30 billion) as high-yielding Consumer volumes were in line, but take rates declined more than expected in both Consumer and Institutional. 

On a positive note, MTUs of 9.7 million exceeded expectations (consensus 9.2 million), showing strength in platform engagement even as spot trading volumes declined sequentially.

In Brendler's recent initiation, expanding opportunities outside the core trading business represented a key component of his thesis, as these largely recurring revenue streams should boost the multiple. This quarter, the analyst saw trading weakness more than offset by strength in Subscription and Services Revenue as Stablecoins were even better than anticipated and Other beat due to growth in premium offerings (Prime). 

The biggest positive surprise versus Brendler's estimates was in Blockchain revenue, as despite a 35+ % decline in token prices, staking revenue only fell 8.5% sequentially versus the analyst's -20% estimate.

Coinbase Global's acquisition of Deribit is expected to close by year-end and should be immediately accretive to adjusted EBITDA. The deal is perfectly timed as it cements Coinbase Global's leadership in the high-growth derivatives market and turbocharges its international exchange. Even better, Deribit's $1 trillion+ in trading volumes are all outside the U.S., and with domestic regulatory clarity coming soon, Brendler noted the synergies could be substantial. Combined with a lower-than-expected price tag of $2.9 billion, this is one of the most compelling acquisitions the analyst noted in a long time.

Brendler projected second-quarter revenue of $1.78 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.48.

Speculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500.

Needham: Coinbase Global reported a narrow top-line Street miss but modestly beat analyst Todaro's estimates. The take rate modestly declined in the crypto transaction segment for both retail and institutional customers. Positive call-outs in the quarter were around USDC and the recently announced Deribit acquisition, which is expected to close by year-end 2025.

The $2.9 billion deal consists of $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase Global stock.

The analyst noted the offering, which will be primarily geared for international markets, allows Coinbase Global to become a major player in derivatives and internationally. Additionally, Coinbase Global's international exchange launched 39 new perpetual contracts and expanded the asset collateral type to 8 assets from 3.

Coinbase Global's volume mix has recently been more Bitcoin and Ethereum than alt-coins, suggesting a greater shift towards institutional volume than retail for the second quarter. This negatively affects revenues as Coinbase Global has a significantly higher take rate on retail than institutional.

Additionally, April and May volumes are trending notably lower than average monthly volumes for the first quarter.

The good news is crypto asset prices recently inflected with Bitcoin rising back over $100k and a strong performance among alt-coins.

Historically, crypto asset prices find a bottom before volumes do, which suggests that with prices already inflecting, volumes should start seeing a bottom in the next one to two months. Nonetheless, Todaro lowered his fiscal 2025 and 2026 estimates to reflect lower volume estimates than his prior forecast.

Todaro projected second-quarter revenue of $1.56 billion and EPS of 80 cents.

COIN Price Action: Coinbase stock is up 5.74% to $210.76 at publication on Monday.

Speaking in a recent interview, Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano shared that Cardano's upcoming Midnight sidechain could let users make free transactions through NFTs. According to him, these NFTs would act as access passes, letting holders perform a set number of free transactions each day. Hoskinson compared the idea to the way Web2 platforms offer free accounts and services.

Instead of paying fees with ADA, users could hold a special NFT that allows daily transactions without spending any tokens. If implemented, this could attract more users who are used to free Web2 services. 

Meanwhile, Midnight has been seeing active development since announced. The launch date has not been announced yet, but the protocol is already seeing interest through hackathons, and engagement from the community. 

The Midnight is generally designed to bring privacy and regulatory compliance together with the help of advanced tools like zero-knowledge proofs and smart contracts.

Between December and January, a Midnight community survey showed that 12% of participants identified as blockchain developers. A further 39% described themselves as “seasoned pros,” while 46% considered themselves “somewhat experienced.” Only 15% said they were still learning, according to the recent Midnight's “State of the Network” report from March 2025. 

Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is surging fast, now trading for $0.82. This is a 4.51% jump record in the last 24 hours with a 32% increase in trading volume over the same period, according to CoinMarketCap.

After the successful deployment last week of Pectra, Ethereum's biggest upgrade in more than a year, the network's core developers are already shifting focus to the next major chain upgrade: Fusaka.



Pectra, the biggest code change to Ethereum since the Merge in 2022, introduced key changes aimed at making staking easier for institutions, improving wallet accessibility, and boosting transaction efficiency.



Developers have already begun planning for Fusaka, the network's next upgrade, and have thus far agreed to include an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) called ""PeerDAS"" that could help the network support larger ""blobs"" of transaction data. 



Blobs, introduced during the Dencun upgrade, are dedicated spaces for large chunks of data related to transactions. They are stored off-chain, which reduces congestion on the Ethereum blockchain and lowers gas fees. The blobs are crucial for the growing layer-2 ecosystem built on top of Ethereum, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Coinbase's Base, which process transactions more quickly and at lower costs than the main chain.



PeerDAS, which stands for Peer Data Availability Sampling, would let validators download partial data from blobs instead of full blobs to validate whether the data has been posted to the network.



In theory, PeerDAS could reduce layer-2 transaction costs and benefit institutions operating validators on the Ethereum blockchain. 



“PeerDAS is super important since we want to help layer-2s scale,” said Parithosh Jayanti, a devops engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, to CoinDesk over Telegram. “PeerDAS allows us to bump the blob limit significantly.""



Fusaka is scheduled to go live at the end of 2025 and will eventually include a bundle of additional upgrades beyond PeerDAS. However, Ethereum developers are notorious for delaying their upgrades. 



Pectra was initially set for release at the end of 2024 but was postponed to the first quarter of 2025. After a few faulty tests, the developers further delayed the upgrade to May.



Ethereum developers have been criticized over the past year for not implementing protocol changes quickly enough. As the price of the network's token has lagged in recent months and developers have migrated to competing ecosystems, the chain's community has debated whether its unofficial leader — the non-profit Ethereum Foundation — is to blame.

 The PREH Multifamily Fund is being tokenized on the RWA-focused Chintai blockchain. 

Patel Real Estate Holdings (PREH) has launched a $100 million tokenization fund on the Chintai blockchain, aiming to give accredited investors access to institutional-grade real estate opportunities.

The new PREH Multifamily Fund is a tokenized investment vehicle focused on vintage Class A multifamily units across the top 20 US growth markets, the company told Cointelegraph on May 12.

“The entire structure is digital-native from the start — compliant onboarding, reporting, capital calls, and (potential) secondary market transfers,” a PREH spokesperson said.

The fund is part of a broader $750 million investment vehicle co-developed by PREH and several institutional firms, including Carlyle, DRA Advisors, Walton Street Capital, RPM and KKR. Initially, the company said that $25 million of the $100 million allocation would be tokenized on Chintai. 

According to PREH, the tokenization structure helps alleviate many transparency and liquidity constraints investors typically face in private market placements.

Founded in 2010, PREH is a national real estate asset manager that oversees a portfolio of Class A multifamily properties. The company owns and operates real estate investments, overseeing the acquisition, financing and management of properties. 

Since its inception, PREH has completed more than $500 million in real estate transactions.

Chintai is a tokenization-focused layer-1 blockchain that also powers the R3 Sustainability Fund for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. Its native token, CHEX, is currently valued at $0.24, with a total market capitalization of $244 million, according to CoinMarketCap.

""We chose Chintai because they offer a fully regulated, institutional-grade platform purpose-built for tokenizing real-world assets,” PREH's president, Tejas Patel, told Cointelegraph in a written statement, adding:

Related: RWA tokenization trends and market outlook for 2025: Report

Tokenizing real estate has long been seen as a way to modernize property investment, but until recently, real-world examples were rare. 

By early 2025, real estate tokenization had gained traction across North America and the United Arab Emirates, while efforts are underway in Europe to establish regulatory frameworks that support its growth.

One of the biggest catalysts for tokenization is the “ability to eliminate the illiquidity discount on real estate,” Polygon CEO Mark Boiron told Cointelegraph in March.

The growth of liquid secondary markets for fractional real estate could significantly strengthen that advantage.

This motivation also drove RWA platform DigiShares to launch the REX marketplace on Polygon earlier this year, featuring two luxury property listings in Miami, Florida.

Efforts are also underway to tokenize commercial real estate, with Blocksquare and Vera Capital recently partnering to offer fractional ownership of more than $1 billion worth of properties.

Against this backdrop, consultancy firm Deloitte has forecast that $4 trillion worth of real estate will be tokenized on the blockchain over the next decade.

 The US will cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, and China will slash duties on US imports from 125% to 10%, boosting Bitcoin's breakout potential. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin broke above $105,700 after the US and China agreed to slash tariffs.

A confirmed bull flag breakout on the weekly chart projects $150,000.

Bitwise's sentiment index warns of potential short-term overheating.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls cheered a major development in the ongoing US-China tariff talks, with the cryptocurrency climbing over the $105,700 mark on May 12 for the first time in four months, further confirming a bullish continuation setup with a $150,000 price target.

The catalyst behind Bitcoin's breakout appears to be de-escalating trade tensions between the US and China. 

Over the weekend, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice President He Lifeng struck a deal in Geneva to reduce tariffs that had crippled bilateral trade for months.

Under the deal, the US will lower tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce its duties on US imports from 125% to 10%.

The agreement triggered a broad-based market rally, with S&P 500 futures rising 2.8% and the US dollar gaining 0.7%. In contrast, gold dropped 2.3%, signaling a shift away from safe-haven assets.

Bitcoin, often seen as a high-beta risk asset, had suffered under the weight of the trade war, with increased investor caution suppressing crypto inflows. The truce now signals improved liquidity and risk appetite, conditions historically favorable for BTC rallies.

The current Bitcoin rally follows the textbook breakout of a bull flag pattern on the weekly chart, a bullish continuation setup formed when the price consolidates downward in a parallel channel after a sharp upward move.

In Bitcoin's case, the flag began forming after BTC peaked at nearly $110,000 in January. The consolidation persisted for months until early May, when the price broke above the flag's upper trendline with a slight volume increase.

This breakout confirms bullish continuation, with the pattern's projected upside target now sitting near $150,000, measured after adding the height of the initial flagpole to the breakout point.

Momentum indicators, including the relative strength index (RSI), are also supportive, with weekly RSI rebounding above 65, reflecting renewed buying pressure without entering overbought territory above 70.

Some analysts are urging caution as Bitcoin's sentiment is becoming euphoric. 

André Dragosch, European head of research at Bitwise, noted that the firm's Cryptoasset Sentiment Index had reached its highest level since November 2024, a level that previously aligned with local market tops.

The chart shows that past peaks in sentiment, such as those in April 2022, October 2023, and November 2024, were followed by short-term corrections or sideways price action. 

This suggests growing optimism may be stretched, raising the risk of a near-term pullback despite Bitcoin's strong long-term outlook.

Bitcoin's price was retracing following its climb above $107,000 as of May 12, with its daily RSI alarming about overbought conditions. 

The next support target sits around $100,000, aligning with its 0.786 Fibonacci retracement line. 

A decisive drop below the level could have BTC test its exponential moving average (EMA) supports below, with the 20-day EMA (the purple wave) at around 97,385 as the initial downside target.

 RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” is a modern open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. In simple terms, it's like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.RISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.On April 20, 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a “radical” new scaling proposal to replace the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the RISC-V instruction set architecture, aiming to boost the speed and efficiency of the network's execution layer. The idea is that RISC-V is the best way to solve the blockchain's scalability constraints. “It aims to greatly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum execution layer, resolving one of the primary scaling bottlenecks, and can also greatly improve the execution layer's simplicity - in fact, it is perhaps the only way to do so.The idea: replace the EVM with RISC-V as the virtual machine language that smart contracts are written in,” said Buterin.Ethereum continues to face high transaction fees and reduced transaction volume as users shift to layer 2s for cheaper, faster transactions. This aligns with Ethereum's scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin's idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.Did you know? Ethereum's execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.

The idea is that RISC-V is the best way to solve the blockchain's scalability constraints. 

“It aims to greatly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum execution layer, resolving one of the primary scaling bottlenecks, and can also greatly improve the execution layer's simplicity - in fact, it is perhaps the only way to do so.

The idea: replace the EVM with RISC-V as the virtual machine language that smart contracts are written in,” said Buterin.

Ethereum continues to face high transaction fees and reduced transaction volume as users shift to layer 2s for cheaper, faster transactions. This aligns with Ethereum's scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin's idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.

Did you know? Ethereum's execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.

 Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (ETH) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another. An alternative approach, described as “more radical,” would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum can't risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter — essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.Did you know? In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed “The Merge,” the chain switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS). This involved merging the Ethereum mainnet with a separate PoS blockchain called Beacon Chain.

 If RISC-V causes a major shift in the Ethereum architecture, what will be the benefits of making this change? In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts' performance and processing.According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V's suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.It's less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources.

 Buterin's proposal has sparked a lively debate among Ethereum users and developers. It is an ambitious idea that could be a milestone in the development roadmap for the leading smart contract blockchain. Programmer Ben Adams raised several concerns about the proposal: In short, the ZK-proof might become more efficient, but there could be a trade-off. Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower. “The risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,” commented Ben Adams.A sentiment that was echoed by another anonymous commenter, “I agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.”Others appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost. “Agree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks. But is this the set of priorities we want to solve for, especially given the scale of technical cost here?” added Adam Cochran. It's clear that the proposal still needs clarity and further discussions within the Ethereum community. While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the layer-1 blockchain works.Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn't just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community. So, currently, Buterin's proposal has opened a wide conversation about any impending development action.

Sinking Cities, Waving Cuttlefish and Falling Spacecraft

A spacecraft is set to fall from the skies, 28 U.S. cities slowly sink, and a new study pinpoints how the overindulgence of the wealthy contributes to massive warming.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's catch up on some of the science news you may have missed last week.

First, a space-junk update. By the time you listen to this a Soviet-era spacecraft may or may not have crash-landed on Earth. Kosmos-482, which the U.S.S.R. launched back in 1972, was meant to follow the successful probes Venera 7 and Venera 8 in landing on and studying Venus. But a suspected engine malfunction meant that Kosmos-482 never achieved enough velocity to escape Earth's orbit. It's been orbiting our planet ever since and losing altitude along the way.

Some of Kosmos-482 already fell back down to Earth decades ago, but one last big chunk has held on for more than half a century. Last week researchers said Kosmos-482 would probably make its uncontrolled descent over the weekend. Its potential landing zone stretched from 52 degrees north to 52 degrees south latitude, which covers pretty much everywhere except for Antarctica and, like, places where you can see the northern lights. There's a chance that the 1,000-ish pound [495 kg] lander, which was designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, will hit Earth in one piece. That could be bad if it happens to crash in a populated area, but it's statistically more likely to hit the ocean or some uninhabited patch of land. And there's still a chance the craft will break up into smaller pieces in the friction of our atmosphere or even burn up entirely. We'll update you on how everything went down next week, or you can check ScientificAmerican.com for the latest space news.

Now, the sky may not be falling, but our biggest cities are sinking. A study published last Thursday in the journal Nature Cities found that all of the 28 most populated cities in the U.S. are sinking, regardless of how far inland they are. In 25 of those cities, the researchers say, at least two-thirds of their respective area is losing height.

The researchers called out Houston as the fastest-sinking city, with more than a third of its area going down by upwards of five millimeters [about 0.2 inches] each year. Around 12 percent of the city is sinking twice as fast as that, and some spots are dropping by five whole centimeters [roughly two inches] a year.

While natural forces and the sheer heft of buildings can play a role, according to the researchers behind the study, the extraction of groundwater is largely responsible for all of this sinkage. The researchers tied the removal of groundwater for human use to as much as 80 percent of the sinking they observed. They noted that in Texas, gas and oil extraction likely exacerbates this problem.

One obvious consequence of a city sinking is that it makes the area more prone to flooding. But the study also sounds the alarm on the unique risks brought on by uneven sink rates within a city. If some areas are sinking faster than others, that raises the likelihood that structures like building foundations and rail lines will start to tilt. The researchers noted in a press release that increases in water needs and population, along with climate-change-induced droughts, are expected to add to the problem, making it crucial that cities start adapting to these risks now.

If you're looking for someone to blame for that—for the climate-change-related part, anyway—consider your millionaire or billionaire of choice: A study published last Wednesday in Nature Climate Change concluded that the wealthiest 10 percent of the global population is responsible for two-thirds of climate-change-related warming as a result of their consumption and investments. The top 1 percent of people are responsible for one-fifth of all warming all on their own. If you're in the top 10 percent, you're an estimated six times more responsible for droughts in the Amazon than the average person is. According to a recent article in Forbes, a net worth of at least $970,000 puts you in that percentile in the United States, while one-percenters have net worths of at least $11.6 million.

If you're looking at your own robust bank account and feeling a little hot under the collar about this study. It does point out a major area for improvement: investments. The authors concluded that the richest among us primarily contribute to climate change through investments tied to high-carbon industries. So if you haven't cleaned up your stock portfolio, now's a great time to do so. As long as you're not, say, flying a private jet everywhere—or worse, taking jaunts into space for fun—then that should make a big difference. And hey if you are doing those things, girl stop.

We'll wrap up with a fun story that takes us under the sea.

In an unpublished study recently posted to the preprint server bioRxiv, scientists claim that cuttlefish wave to one another to communicate. The researchers observed four distinct arm waves: “up,” “side,” “crown” and “roll.” These movements are a bit more complicated than our one- or two-armed human gestures. In the “roll” move the cuttlefish tucks all its arms beneath its head as if it's about to try to somersault forward. The “side” signal has it move its arms to one side of its body. The “crown” looks a bit like someone steepling their fingers—if their fingers were several squishy tentacles. The “up” sign is complicated, with some arms extended up and others twisting in front of the cuttlefish.

The scientists observed cuttlefish trading these signals back and forth and occasionally responding to one signal with a different one. That makes them suspect these moves are a form of communication. What's even wilder is that when the scientists recorded cuttlefish signing with an underwater microphone and played the same vibrations for another cuttlefish, that second individual would start signing. So the creatures could be sensing the vibrations of this sign language, in addition to seeing visual cues. Researchers will have to directly connect these signals with certain behaviors or actions to prove that this is actually communication, but for now it is pretty cute.

Providing hearing aids and advice on their use may preserve social connections that often wane as we age, a new study shows. Its authors say that this approach could help ease the loneliness epidemic that older Americans face.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than a quarter of seniors say they have little or no contact with others, and a third report feeling lonely. Experts have linked such isolation in part to hearing loss, which can interfere with communication and relationship building. The 2023 U.S. Surgeon General's Advisory named improving social connection as great a priority as targeting tobacco use, obesity, and addiction.

Led by researchers at NYU Langone Health as part of the ACHIEVE clinical trial, the study revealed that those treated for hearing loss retained one additional social connection on average over a three-year period when compared with those who received no hearing therapies and were instead educated about healthy aging.

Publishing online May 12 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, the work further showed that those given hearing aids had more diverse relationships, with networks that had many different types of connections (e.g., family members, friends, and acquaintances). They also maintained deeper, higher quality bonds than those who were not treated for hearing loss.

""Our findings add to evidence that helping aging patients hear better can also enrich their social lives and boost their mental and physical well-being,"" said study lead author Nicholas Reed, AuD, PhD, a member of the NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Optimal Aging Institute.

Experts have linked both loneliness and hearing loss to depression, heart disease, and early death, among other concerns, adds Reed, also a faculty member in the Departments of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. A 2023 report on the ACHIEVE trial showed that hearing interventions may slow cognitive decline among those at highest risk for dementia.

""These results support efforts to incorporate hearing aid coverage into Medicare as a means of addressing the nation's social isolation epidemic, which is especially risky for the elderly,"" said ACHIEVE trial co-principal investigator Josef Coresh, MD, PhD. ""Making sure Americans can continue engaging with their family and friends as they age is a critical part of maintaining their quality of life,"" added Coresh, also the Terry and Mel Karmazin Professor in the Department of Population Health.

For the study, the research team collected data about older adults with untreated hearing loss across four sites in Maryland, North Carolina, Minnesota, and Mississippi. The study is among the largest to date to explore if hearing care can help prevent weakening of social networks, having included nearly 1,000 men and women ages 70 through 84.

Half of the participants received hearing aids, counseling sessions and personalized instruction with an audiologist, and when needed, tools such as adaptors that connect hearing aids to televisions. The other half of the participants were given instruction about exercise, strategies for communicating with healthcare providers, and further resources for healthy aging.

To measure social isolation, the researchers assessed how regularly participants spent time with others, the size and variety of their social networks and the roles they played in them, and the depth of their connections. Loneliness was calculated using a 20-question scoring system that evaluates how often a person feels disconnected from others. After the initial data was collected, the team followed up at six months and then every year for three years.

Among the other findings, the study revealed that before treatment, participants in both groups reported feeling equally lonely. Three years after the intervention took place, loneliness scores slightly improved among those who had received hearing care, while scores slightly worsened among those who did not.

Hearing aids and their related audiology appointments cost an average of $4,700, which is usually paid out of pocket, notes Coresh, who is the founding director of the Optimal Aging Institute.

Also a professor in the Department of Medicine, Coresh says the authors plan to continue following the participants for another three years and to repeat the study with a more diverse group of people -- the patients were mostly White. He cautions that the participants received concierge-level hearing care that provided more resources and time with audiologists than is typically offered to the public. Damaged hearing aids, for example, were replaced within days instead of weeks.

Funding for the study was provided by National Institutes of Health grants R01AG055426, R01AG060502, U01HL096812, U01HL096814, U01HL096899, U01HL096902, and U01HL096917.

In addition to Reed and Coresh, NYU Langone researcher James Pike, MBA, was involved in the study.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Olympic anti-doping lab puts U.S. meat supply to the test","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250512144716.htm","Mon, 12 May 2025 19:47:56 GMT","

Scientists at UCLA's Olympic Analytical Laboratory turned their sophisticated analytical capabilities for testing athlete samples for performance-enhancing drugs to research examining the U.S. meat supply as part of a study led by Texas Tech. The study was designed to investigate concerns that residues of growth promoters used in meat production could potentially cause athletes to test positive.

The laboratory, which typically searches for prohibited substances in urine and blood samples from elite athletes, took part in a comprehensive year-long surveillance study funded by the Partnership for Clean Competition (PCC) examining beef, pork, and chicken purchased from retail outlets across eight U.S. cities.

Growth-promoting substances like ractopamine and trenbolone are legally used in U.S. livestock production to increase muscle growth and improve feed efficiency. While the European Union bans many of these compounds, U.S. regulations permit their controlled use in specific animals (particularly beef cattle), though suggested voluntary withdrawal periods for ractopamine before slaughter help ensure residue levels remain within established limits for safe human consumption. Some athletes have attributed positive anti-doping tests to contaminated meat from the U.S. food supply.

Researchers at the lab led by Elizabeth (Ellie) Ahrens, director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, employed the same analytical methods used in anti-doping efforts -- liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry -- to screen meat samples for anabolic steroids and other growth-promoting agents that are prohibited in sports.

The study, led by Dr. Bradley J. Johnson at Texas Tech University, and in collaboration with the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), found that while some beef samples contained detectable levels of substances like ractopamine, trenbolone, and estradiol, all measurements remained well below the maximum residue limits established by regulatory authorities such as the FDA. Pork and chicken samples showed minimal residues, with the vast majority testing entirely negative for prohibited substances.

""The findings suggest that positive tests resulting from meat consumption are highly unlikely when consumed in amounts consistent with typical daily diets,"" the researchers concluded in their report. ""This study reinforces the effectiveness of current regulatory practices in limiting growth promoter residues in commercial meat."" The project is ongoing to collect more samples, including examining imported meat into the U.S. from abroad.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","CAR-T cell therapy for cancer causes 'brain fog,' study shows","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250512133656.htm","Mon, 12 May 2025 19:37:52 GMT","

After treatment with CAR-T cells -- immune cells engineered to attack cancer -- patients sometimes tell their doctors they feel like they have ""brain fog,"" or forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating.

A new Stanford Medicine-led study shows that CAR-T cell therapy causes mild cognitive impairments, independent of other cancer treatments, and that this happens via the same cellular mechanism as cognitive impairment from two other causes: chemotherapy and respiratory infections such as flu and COVID-19. The study, conducted mostly in mice, which will publish online May 12 in Cell, also identifies strategies for reversing the problem.

Medications that ameliorate brain fog will enable better recovery from cancer immunotherapies, the researchers said.

""CAR-T cell therapy is enormously promising: We are seeing long-term survivors after CAR-T cell therapy for aggressive cancers, saving patients who would otherwise have died,"" said the study's senior author, Michelle Monje, MD, PhD, the Milan Gambhir Professor in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology. ""We need to understand all its possible long-term effects, including this newly recognized syndrome of immunotherapy-related cognitive impairment, so we can develop therapeutic approaches to fix it.""

The study's lead authors are Anna Geraghty, PhD, senior staff scientist in the Monje lab, and MD/PhD student Lehi Acosta-Alvarez.

Cognitive impairment after CAR-T cell therapy is typically mild; patients are not developing dementia, for instance. But it is frustrating and may not resolve on its own, Monje said. In mice, her team reversed the impairment using compounds similar to existing medications or medications in clinical development -- meaning a treatment could be available relatively quickly, she said.

""We're deeply interested in how cancer therapies affect cognition because it affects patients' quality of life,"" Monje said. ""And this is especially important for kids because their brains are still developing.""

Investigating brain fog

CAR-T cell therapy was approved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2017. The treatment involves removing some of the patient's own immune cells, known as T cells, and engineering them to attack targets on cancer cells. The modified T cells are returned to the patient's body, where they recognize and destroy cancer.

In addition to leukemia, CAR-T cells are now used to treat other blood cancers, including multiple myeloma and some kinds of lymphoma, and they are being tested in clinical trials for various solid tumors. Monje and her colleagues have an ongoing trial of CAR-T cells for deadly brain stem and spinal cord tumors in children, which is beginning to show success.

Although patients report brain fog after CAR-T cell therapy, studies to measure how much cognitive impairment the therapy causes are only just emerging.

The research team wanted to get a comprehensive understanding of the situations in which CAR-T cell therapy might cause cognitive impairment. They studied mice that had tumors induced in the brain, blood, skin and bone. The researchers wanted to understand the influence on cognition of CAR-T cell treatment in combination with the tumors' location (originating in, spreading to or staying outside the brain), as well as the degree to which the engineered cells evoked additional, accompanying immune responses. Before and after CAR-T cell treatment, the researchers used standard cognitive tests on the mice, measuring how mice responded to a novel object and navigated a simple maze.

CAR-T therapy caused mild cognitive impairment in mice with cancers originating in, metastasizing to and located completely outside the brain. The only mice tested that did not develop cognitive impairment after CAR-T treatment were those that had bone cancer that causes minimal additional inflammation beyond the cancer-fighting activity of the CAR-T cells.

""This is the first study to demonstrate that immunotherapy on its own is sufficient to cause lasting cognitive symptoms,"" Monje said. ""It's also the first paper to uncover the mechanisms. We found the exact same pathophysiology we've seen in brain fog syndromes that occur after chemotherapy, radiation, and mild respiratory COVID-19 or influenza.""

The researchers demonstrated that the brain's immune cells, called microglia, are key players in the problem. First, the microglia become activated by the body's immune response. The activated, ""annoyed"" microglia produce inflammatory immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines, which in turn have widespread effects throughout the brain. They are particularly harmful for oligodendrocytes, the brain cells responsible for making myelin, the fatty substance that insulates nerve fibers and helps nerves transmit signals more efficiently. Reduction in the nerves' insulation translates into cognitive impairment.

The scientists also analyzed samples of brain tissue from human subjects who participated in the team's ongoing clinical trial of CAR-T cells for spinal cord and brain stem tumors. Using postmortem tissue samples, the researchers confirmed that microglia and oligodendrocytes appear dysregulated in the same way the team had observed in mice after CAR-T therapy.

In mice, the research team tested strategies to resolve the cognitive problems. They gave a compound that depleted microglia in the brains of the mice for a two-week period. After that transient depletion, the microglia returned in the brain in a normal, non-reactive state. The mice were no longer cognitively impaired.

The researchers also gave the mice a medication that enters the brain and interferes with signals from damaging chemokines, blocking a specific receptor for these molecules.

""That alone rescued cognition,"" Monje said, adding that the researchers are now exploring how to safely translate the two strategies -- transiently depleting microglia or interrupting chemokine signals -- in people who have had CAR-T cell therapy.

""This research further illustrates that there is a unifying principle underpinning brain fog syndromes,"" Monje said. ""And this particular study is so exciting because not only have we identified the cells central to this pathophysiology, we've found a molecular target we can investigate to treat it.""

Researchers from New York University's Grossman School of Medicine and from Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, also contributed to the research.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Different anesthetics, same result: Unconsciousness by shifting brainwave phase","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250512105543.htm","Mon, 12 May 2025 19:17:18 GMT","

At the level of molecules and cells, ketamine and dexmedetomidine work very differently, but in the operating room they do the same exact thing: anesthetize the patient. By demonstrating how these distinct drugs achieve the same result, a new study in animals by neuroscientists at The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT identifies a potential signature of unconsciousness that is readily measurable to improve anesthesiology care.

What the two drugs have in common, the researchers discovered, is the way they push around brain waves, which are produced by the collective electrical activity of neurons. When brain waves are in phase, meaning the peaks and valleys of the waves are aligned, local groups of neurons in the brain's cortex can share information to produce conscious cognitive functions such as attention, perception and reasoning, said Picower Professor Earl K. Miller, senior author of the new study in Cell Reports. When brain waves fall out of phase, local communications, and therefore functions, fall apart, producing unconsciousness.

The finding, led by graduate student Alexandra Bardon, not only adds to scientists' understanding of the dividing line between consciousness and unconsciousness, Miller said, but also could provide a common new measure for anesthesiologists who use a variety of different anesthetics to maintain patients on the proper side of that line during surgery.

""If you look at the way phase is shifted in our recordings, you can barely tell which drug it was,"" said Miller, a faculty member in The Picower Institute and MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. ""That's valuable for medical practice. Plus if unconsciousness has a universal signature, it could also reveal the mechanisms that generate consciousness.""

If more anesthetic drugs are also shown to affect phase in the same way, then anesthesiologists might be able to use brain wave phase alignment as a reliable marker of unconsciousness as they titrate doses of anesthetic drugs, Miller said, regardless of which particular mix of drugs they are using. That insight could aid efforts to build closed-loop systems that can aid anesthesiologists by constantly adjusting drug dose based on brain wave measurements of the patient's unconsciousness.

Miller has been collaborating with study co-author Emery N. Brown, an anesthesiologist and Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Computational Neuroscience and Medical Engineering in The Picower Institute, on building such a system.In a recent clinical trial with colleagues in Japan, Brown demonstrated that monitoring brain wave power signals using EEG enabled an anesthesiologist to use much less sevoflurane during surgery with young children. The reduced doses proved safe and were associated with many improved clinical outcomes including a reduced incidence of post-operative delirium.

Phase findings

Neuroscientists studying anesthesia have rarely paid attention to phase, but in the new study, Bardon, Brown and Miller's team made a point of it as they anesthetized two animals.

After the animals lost consciousness, the measurements indicated a substantial increase in ""phase locking,"" especially at low frequencies. Phase locking means that the relative differences in phase remained more stable. But what caught the researchers' attention were the differences that became locked in: Within each hemisphere, regardless of which anesthetic they used, brain wave phase became misaligned between the dorsolateral and ventrolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex.

Surprisingly, brain wave phase across hemispheres became more aligned, not less. But Miller notes that case is still a big shift from the conscious state, in which brain hemispheres are typically not aligned well, so the finding is a further indication that major changes of phase alignment, albeit in different ways at different distances, are a correlate of unconsciousness compared to wakefulness.

""The increase in interhemispheric alignment of activity by anesthetics seems to reverse the pattern observed in the awake, cognitively engaged brain,"" the Bardon and Miller team wrote in Cell Reports.

Determined by distance

Distance proved to be a major factor in determining the change in phase alignment. Even across the 2.5 millimeters of a single electrode array, low-frequency waves moved 20-30 degrees out of alignment. Across the 20 or so millimeters between arrays in the upper (dorsolateral) and lower (ventrolateral) regions within a hemisphere, that would mean a roughly 180-degree shift in phase alignment which is a complete offset of the waves.

The dependence on distance is consistent with the idea of waves traveling across the cortex, Miller said. Indeed in a 2022 study, Miller and Brown's labs showed that the anesthetic propofol induced a powerful low-frequency traveling wave that swept straight across the cortex, overwhelming higher-frequency straight and rotating waves.

The new results raise many opportunities for follow-up studies, Miller said. Does propofol (another anesthetic) also produce this signature of changed phase alignment? What role do traveling waves play in the phenomenon? And given that sleep is also characterized by increased power in slow wave frequencies, but is definitely not the same state as anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, could phase alignment explain the difference?

In addition to Bardon, Brown and Miller, the paper's other authors are Jesus Ballesteros, Scott Brincat, Jefferson Roy, Meredith Mahnke, and Yumiko Ishizawa.

Metrics details

PRODROME was a phase 3, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial evaluating whether ubrogepant 100 mg, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, dosed during the premonitory (prodromal) phase of migraine, prevented development of headache and resolved prodromal symptoms. Qualifying prodromal events were defined as attacks with symptoms in which the participant was confident headache would follow within 1–6 h. Of 1,087 screened participants, 477 formed the efficacy analysis population. Outcomes were collected across 48 h showing, for example, at 2 h post-dose, absence of photophobia in 19.5% and 12.5% of ubrogepant- and placebo-treated events, respectively (odds ratio (OR) = 1.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13–2.61)); at 3 h post-dose, absence of fatigue occurred in 27.3% and 16.8% (OR = 1.85 (95% CI = 1.17–2.92)) and absence of neck pain in 28.9% and 15.9% (OR = 2.04 (95% CI = 1.25–3.32)) of events; at 4 h post-dose, absence of phonophobia in 50.7% and 35.8% (OR = 1.97 (95% CI = 1.38–2.80)) of events; and at 24 h post-dose, absence of dizziness in 88.5% and 82.3% (OR = 1.82 (95% CI = 1.00–3.30)) of events. At 1 h and 6 h post-dose, respectively, absence of difficulty concentrating occurred in 8.7% and 2.1% (OR = 4.26 (95% CI = 1.17–15.54)) and absence of difficulty thinking occurred in 56.9% and 41.8% (OR = 2.05 (95% CI = 1.14–3.71)) of events. Treatment with ubrogepant during the prodromal phase may ameliorate common prodromal symptoms, with improvements possibly as early as 1 h post-dose.

Migraine is a common, globally recognized1, neurological disorder characterized by recurrent disabling attacks involving headache and symptoms of brain dysfunction2. The attack has recognized phases: premonitory (prodrome), aura, headache and postdrome, which, although distinctive, can overlap3. The canonical manifestations of an attack—lateralized, throbbing headache with associated sensitivity to light (photophobia), sound (phonophobia) and head movement4—have received considerable attention for the last three decades as treatments aimed at the headache phase of the attack were developed5. The identification of the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)6,7 and the utility of CGRP blockers for both acute and preventive treatment of migraine5 offer the possibility of exploring migraine pathophysiology with new tools.

Migraine symptoms that can occur in the premonitory phase (prodrome) fall broadly into three groups: first, higher center, such as cognitive impairment, manifests as difficulty concentrating or thinking—brain fog as it is often labeled by patients—and fatigue. Second, symptoms broadly reflect homeostatic dysfunction, such as food cravings or polyuria and, third, symptoms usually associated with the headache phase can occur in the premonitory phase, such as sensitivity to light (photophobia) or sound (phonophobia)8. Prodromal symptoms are highly predictive of impending headache9 and are generally considered to be common when enquired after in adults10,11 and children12,13. Functional brain imaging has identified activations in the central nervous system, such as the hypothalamic region14,15, in the premonitory phase. Mapping symptoms to imaging findings suggests central nervous system origins for the migraine attack16, with implications for understanding the pathophysiology and, importantly, where to target therapies.

Therapeutics in migraine have advanced considerably over the last three decades3. It has been argued whether the origin of both the attack and the pain is peripheral or central17, and thus how best to target therapies. Moreover, previous studies of therapeutics in the acute treatment of the premonitory phase (prodrome) have focused on the potential for blocking the onset of headache18,19. The analysis of the prevention of headache in the PRODROME study has demonstrated that ubrogepant given in the prodromal phase prevented moderate or severe headache, when compared with placebo, for the following 48 h (ref. 20). In the present study, we report the effect of ubrogepant, a small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonist21, on the prodromal symptoms commonly reported by the study participants, a prespecified additional endpoint of the PRODROME trial. In addition to the clinical benefit of resolving these symptoms, the findings may offer insights into the role of the central nervous system in the treatment of migraine. The work has been presented in preliminary form at the 75th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (Boston, MA, 22–27 April 2023)22.

A total of 1,087 participants were screened, with 518 randomly assigned to double-blind crossover treatment (Fig. 1). The safety and modified intention-to-treat (mITT) populations included 480 and 477 participants, respectively. Participants had a mean age of 42.3 years (Table 1). Most of the participants in the safety population were female (87.7%, n = 421 of 480), with most identifying as White (88.1%, n = 423 or 480) and non-Hispanic (92.7%, n = 445 or 480; Table 1). Of the 518 randomized participants, 84.6% (n = 438) completed the trial and 15.4% (n = 80) discontinued. Lack of treating two ‘qualifying prodrome events' within the 60-d double-blind treatment period was the most common reason for discontinuation (10.0%, n = 52 of 518). Additional information about PRODROME participants has been previously reported20.

The five most common prodromal symptoms identified at baseline (pre-dose) in the double-blind treatment period for placebo-treated (n = 449) and ubrogepant 100 mg-treated (n = 448) events were photophobia (60.8% and 60.9% of events, respectively), fatigue (50.3% and 50.7%), neck pain or stiffness (40.1% and 40.2%), phonophobia (36.1% and 35.9%) and dizziness (31.0% and 29.0%; Table 2). Although the cognitive impairment symptoms of difficulty concentrating (22.5% and 23.0%) and difficulty thinking (16.5% and 15.4%) were the eighth and eleventh most common prodromal symptoms at baseline before treatment, when considering them as one category ‘either difficulty concentrating or difficulty thinking or both' was reported in 33.0% of placebo-treated and 32.1% of ubrogepant-treated events, making it the fifth most common prodromal symptom (Table 2). Prodromal symptoms of moderate-to-severe intensity were reported at baseline in 31.7–57.2% of placebo-treated and ubrogepant-treated events: specifically, photophobia (42.9% and 42.1% of events, respectively), fatigue (52.2% and 51.5%), neck pain or stiffness (57.2% and 55.6%), phonophobia (38.9% and 36.0%), dizziness (31.7% and 30.8%), difficulty concentrating (45.5% and 39.8%) and difficulty thinking (45.9% and 42.0%) (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1).

Among ubrogepant- and placebo-treated events, respectively, 19.5% and 12.5% were associated with an absence of photophobia starting at hour 2 (OR = 1.72 (95% CI = 1.13–2.61)), 27.3% and 16.8% with an absence of fatigue starting at hour 3 (OR = 1.85 (95% CI = 1.17–2.92)), 28.9% and 15.9% with an absence of neck pain starting at hour 3 (OR = 2.04 (95% CI = 1.25–3.32)), 50.7% and 35.8% with an absence of phonophobia starting at hour 4 (OR = 1.97 (95% CI = 1.38–2.80)) and 88.5% and 82.3% with an absence of dizziness at 24 h post-dose (OR = 1.82 (95% CI = 1.00–3.30)) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2). An absence of cognitive symptoms was also observed: as early as 1 h post-dose for difficulty concentrating in 8.7% and 2.1% of ubrogepant- and placebo-treated events, respectively (OR = 4.26 (95% CI = 1.17–15.54)) and at 6 h for difficulty thinking in 56.9% and 41.8% (OR = 2.05 (95% CI = 1.14–3.71)) of events (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2).

The percentage of participants continuing to have prodromal symptoms at timepoints post-dose are shown. a–g, Participants who reported the prodromal symptoms at pre-dose: sensitivity to light (placebo, n = 273 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 273 of 448) (a); tired, sleepy or fatigue (placebo, n = 226 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 227 of 448) (b); neck pain or stiff neck (placebo, n = 180 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 180 of 448) (c); sensitivity to sound (placebo, n = 162 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 161 of 448) (d); dizziness, lightheaded, vertigo or imbalance (placebo, n = 139 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 130 of 448) (e); difficulty concentrating (placebo, n = 101 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 103 of 448) (f); and difficulty thinking (placebo, n = 74 of 449, ubrogepant 100 mg, n = 69 of 448) (g).

Analysis censoring data collected after rescue medication use for headache (if needed) yielded similar results (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Rescue medication use within 24 h post-dose was 21.7% for ubrogepant-treated events compared with 39.4% for placebo-treated events (Supplementary Table 4).

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported for 55 of 462 (12%) qualifying prodrome events treated with placebo and 77 of 456 (17%) events treated with ubrogepant 100 mg within 48 h of administration. Treatment-related TEAEs were identified in 42 of 462 (9%) of placebo-treated events and 60 of 456 (13%) ubrogepant 100 mg-treated events. As previously reported20, there were no adverse events (AEs) leading to study discontinuation and no serious AEs. The most common AEs (≥2%) after placebo and ubrogepant administration were nausea (3% versus 5%), fatigue (2% versus 3%), dizziness (3% versus 2%) and somnolence (1% versus 2%).

The results suggest that ubrogepant, a gepant, CGRP receptor antagonist, administered in the premonitory (prodromal) phase of migraine, when headache is absent, may promote the resolution of common prodromal symptoms. Moreover, in this trial, 31.7–57.2% of premonitory symptoms were moderate to severe in intensity and associated with functional disability20,23. As premonitory symptoms can be disabling, their treatment alone is clinically relevant, beyond the consideration that treatment during the prodrome prevents headache onset and improves function over 24–48 h, as demonstrated in the primary analysis of the study20. Greater awareness of the clinical symptomatology of the prodromal phase, as well as the availability of effective treatment, offers a major opportunity to improve the treatment of acute migraine.

It is interesting to examine the time course and magnitude of efficacy of ubrogepant for the different prodromal symptoms. The most common symptom, photophobia, which was present in approximately 61% of qualifying prodromal events, appeared to resolve after treatment with ubrogepant as early as 2 h post-dose, with a consistent effect across the first 8 h and an effect still evident at 48 h post-dose. Although being reported by only approximately 22% of participants, difficulty concentrating may also benefit from ubrogepant treatment, with resolution as early as 1 h post-dose and up to 6 h, and the trend continuing to 24 h post-dose. In contrast, ubrogepant appeared to have limited impact on the resolution of dizziness, which was present in approximately 30% of qualifying prodromal events, and these effects were observed primarily at the 24-h timepoint. Given the varied pathophysiology of the different symptoms, one would not expect ubrogepant to be equally effective or have a similar time course for all prodromal symptoms. Still, similar trends were observed overall for prodromal symptom resolution, which appeared to occur more frequently with ubrogepant than placebo.

The symptoms of the premonitory (prodromal) phase of a migraine attack have been recognized for more than a century24. In a case series of 50 patients, 17 identified symptoms on the day before their headache25, whereas a larger series of 530 reported 160 patients identifying premonitory (prodromal) symptoms and speculated on a role of the hypothalamus in the pathophysiology26. Studies based on clinic populations in adults10,11,27 and children12,13 and on large cross-sectional material28 have consistently identified premonitory symptoms, such as fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. In patients who recognize these symptoms, they are highly predictive of impending headache9, although the reliability of prediction remains an issue29.

Many of these common premonitory symptoms, such as photophobia, fatigue, phonophobia, cognitive impairment—difficulty concentrating or difficulty thinking, or both—and dizziness, may well originate in the brain. It has long been argued whether migraine is primarily a disease of the brain or of peripheral, specifically vascular, origin30. The new data firmly support a brain origin for migraine attacks. Both symptoms of the premonitory phase, such as photophobia and thirst or food cravings, and outcomes from functional imaging studies implicate brain regions in the earliest phase of a migraine attack31. As an example, laboratory studies implicating neuropeptide Y in the modulation of trigeminovascular nociceptive traffic32, and its localization in the hypothalamus33, or studies of ventral tegmental area reward mechanisms and their interaction with trigeminovascular nociception34 offer support to neuroimaging studies that demonstrate activation of these regions in the premonitory phase of an attack14,15,35. Photophobia, a symptom classically associated with the headache phase of migraine4, may also be reported in the premonitory (prodromal) phase and is indeed the most commonly reported symptom in the present study. Brain imaging has shown a signature in the visual cortex for premonitory phase photophobia36, demonstrating a central nervous system-associated biological change. Similarly, brainstem sites, such as the rostral ventromedial medulla, are implicated in trigeminovascular nociceptive modulation37 with variation over the cycling of migraine38.

There remains considerable debate around the site of action of anti-migraine treatments. The triptans, serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists, were developed on the inchoate basis that they constricted dilated cranial blood vessels which were the cause of the pain39. Several findings, including dissociation of the timing of a vascular effect and the pain response40, and the neural effect of the drugs41, have led to the broad adoption of a view that they act primarily through a neural target42. Although sumatriptan can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid43, and the exclusively neurally acting ditans, 5-HT1F receptor agonists44 are both effective45 and have brain access46, migraine therapies are widely considered to act outside the brain. A positron emission tomography study of telcagepant showed low receptor occupancy after a less than optimal dose of 140 mg47,48, leaving unresolved the issue of whether there was potential for gepants to have effects in the brain. Although it may be argued that the effects of ubrogepant in the present study on photophobia and phonophobia or neck discomfort reflect a primary peripheral site of action with brain consequences, it is difficult to argue that position for cognitive dysfunction, leaving a brain site of action as a more attractive, overall hypothesis. Broadly, the findings of the clinical trial support imaging studies that have identified central nervous system sites as the locus of initiation of a migraine attack.

The participants studied could identify prodromal symptoms that were reliably followed by headache as determined via a rigorous screening procedure20. Clinical experience suggests that it is not complex to point out these prodromal symptoms to patients and offer the possibility of the association, which patients can then recognize. Nevertheless, widespread adoption of this approach will require further real-world experience. Whether gepant intervention alters migraine aura or influences the postdrome49 was not rigorously explored in the present study and offers interesting avenues for insights and treatment opportunities in the future.

The primary objective of the PRODROME trial was to evaluate the efficacy of ubrogepant on the occurrence of headache after administration during the prodrome phase of a migraine attack. The trial was not primarily designed to evaluate the impact of ubrogepant on resolution of prodromal symptoms; these endpoints were prospectively defined as additional endpoints in the protocol. These analyses were outside the hierarchical gatekeeping procedure to control for type-1 error and were therefore not controlled for multiple comparisons. Although our results suggest a consistent amelioration of common prodromal symptoms after ubrogepant compared with placebo, additional studies specifically designed to evaluate the effect of acute treatment on prodromal symptoms are warranted.

Additional limitations resulting from the study design include participants being instructed to administer the study drug when they felt confident that a headache would follow within 1–6 h, and not at the onset, or first recognition, of prodromal symptoms. Furthermore, we did not analyze differences in symptom resolution between those who did and those who did not develop headache. Analyses censoring data collected after rescue medication use for headache (if needed) showed results similar to the uncensored data, suggesting that a difference in rescue medication use between ubrogepant and placebo treatment groups was probably not a confounding factor (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2).

Based on this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, ubrogepant 100 mg, when administered in the premonitory (prodromal) phase of migraine, before a headache has commenced, may treat symptoms such as photophobia, phonophobia and cognitive dysfunction. The clinical phenotype of the premonitory phase, its functional neuroimaging findings and the corroborating experimental neurobiology all point to a pathophysiology in the central nervous system. Reversing these symptoms with a gepant emphasizes the importance of the brain in migraine and offers the promethean possibility that targeting central nervous system mechanisms will be a fruitful path to new therapeutics in this common and disabling disorder.

The trial design for the PRODROME study has been previously reported20. PRODROME (NCT04492020) was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial conducted from 21 August 2020 through 19 April 2022, at 75 research centers and headache clinics in the United States of America (Supplementary Table 5). After a 60-d screening period, participants with migraine, who could reliably identify migraine attacks with prodromal symptoms that were reliably followed by headache within 1–6 h at least 75% of the time, were randomized to sequence A or B in a 1:1 ratio and entered the double-blind treatment period, during which they were tasked to treat two qualifying prodrome events within a 60-d period (Supplementary Fig. 1). A qualifying prodrome event was defined by the presence of prodromal symptoms that the participant was confident would be followed by a headache within 1–6 h. Headache should not be present at the time of a qualifying prodrome event and the participant should not have had a headache in the previous 48 h. Acute treatment should not have been used within 48 h before the qualifying prodrome event. Defining a qualifying prodrome event as 1–6 h before the expected headache onset was done to provide time for the acute treatment to take effect and aid in differentiating aura symptoms from prodromal symptoms.

Participants in sequence A received placebo to treat the first qualifying prodrome event and ubrogepant 100 mg to treat the second qualifying event, whereas participants in sequence B received ubrogepant 100 mg to treat the first qualifying prodrome event and placebo to treat the second qualifying event. The two treatments had at least 7 d of washout in between.

During the double-blind study period, after taking the study drug, rescue medication was permitted only after headache onset. For a mild headache, rescue medication was permitted 24 h after headache onset. For a headache of moderate or severe intensity, rescue medication was permitted at any time after headache onset. No rescue medication was permitted during the qualifying prodrome event if a headache had not yet occurred. Permitted rescue medications included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, triptans, ditans, ergots, analgesics or combination analgesics, opioids or antiemetics.

During screening, participants identified and confirmed prodromal symptoms from a predetermined list of 30 symptoms. This list included common and uncommon prodromal symptoms, as well as the options ‘other' and ‘a feeling, not otherwise described or difficult to describe'.

An automated interactive web response system was used to manage randomization, which occurred at visit 2. To maintain the blind, identical blister cards were dispensed at visit 2 and the visit after treatment of the first qualifying prodrome event (visit 3). Each blister card contained two tablets of either placebo or ubrogepant 50 mg. Participants in treatment sequence A received a card with placebo at visit 2 and ubrogepant 100 mg at visit 3, whereas participants in treatment sequence B received a card with ubrogepant 100 mg at visit 2 and placebo at visit 3. During the double-blind treatment period, each participant was instructed to take the study drug for each qualifying prodrome event as soon as they were confident that a headache would inevitably follow within 1–6 h.

Eligible participants were adults (aged 18–75 years), female or male (based on self-report) with at least a 1-year history of migraine with or without aura consistent with a diagnosis according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edn4 and a history of two to eight migraine attacks per month with moderate-to-severe headache in each of the 3 months before screening. At the screening visit, participants were asked whether they could identify migraine attacks in which prodromal symptoms were present and likely to be followed by headache within 1–6 h at least 75% of the time. If participants answered in the affirmative, participants received an eDiary to record all their qualifying prodrome events during the 60-d screening period. To be eligible for randomization, participants were required to record 3–16 qualifying prodrome events during the 60-d screening period, with at least 75% followed by a headache, of any intensity, within 1–6 h.

Exclusion criteria have been reported previously20. Briefly, exclusion criteria included: history of clinically important hematological, endocrine, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal or neurological disease that has not been stable for at least 1 year, history of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or neurological disease, confounding psychiatric conditions including dementia or epilepsy, difficulty distinguishing migraine from other tension type or other headache types, chronic migraine, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, painful cranial neuropathy, overuse of medication for migraine (opioids or barbiturates >2 d per month, triptans or ergots ≥10 d per month, simple analgesics ≥15 d per month) within the last 3 months or previous CGRP injectable use within the previous 3 months.

The primary endpoint of the PRODROME trial was absence of moderate or severe intensity headache within 24 h post-dose. Prespecified additional endpoints (that is, exploratory endpoints) were the absence of the five most common prodromal symptoms, of any intensity (mild, moderate or severe), at each of the prespecified timepoints (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 h), regardless of the presence of headache. Additional post-hoc analyses were performed on cognitive impairment symptoms, difficulty thinking or difficulty concentrating, or both. After identifying a qualifying prodrome event in which the participant was confident that a headache would follow within 1–6 h, the participant entered their premonitory (prodrome) symptoms in the eDiary and reported the presence or absence of those prodromal symptoms (up to six patient-identified symptoms were preprogrammed into the eDiary for ease) at the prespecified timepoints. Entries could not be altered retrospectively. After treating the qualifying prodrome event with study medication and completing their initial eDiary entry, participants were required to report the absence or presence of a headache and prodromal symptoms at each timepoint post-dose. Safety assessments included the incidence of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, vital signs, physical examination and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Adverse events were collected from the time of informed consent until 30 d after the last dose. An adverse event was considered to be a TEAE if the adverse event began or worsened (increased in severity or became serious) on or after the date of the first dose of study drug. The safety population included all treated participants who took at least one administration of study drug.

All efficacy analyses used the mITT population, defined as all randomized participants with one or more assessments of headache occurrence within 24 h after taking a double-blind study drug for one or more qualifying prodromal events during the double-blind treatment period. The mITT population is defined in the protocol and is equivalent to a full analysis set consistent with the International Council of Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines50. The safety population included all treated participants who took one or more administrations of study drug. Determination of sample size was previously reported; 480 participants in the mITT population were estimated to provide 95% power to determine a 16-point treatment difference in response rate for the primary endpoint, using a two-sided 5% significance level20.

For each of the five most common prodromal symptoms, as well as difficulty concentrating and difficulty thinking, the absence of symptoms of any intensity at each timepoint was analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) in the observed binary response variable. ORs (95% CIs) were based on the GLMM with treatment group, treatment period and pre-dose baseline prodromal symptom intensity as categorical fixed effects. An unstructured covariance matrix was selected for the covariance matrix of the residual effects for the repeated measurements, corresponding to the two qualifying prodrome events, within a participant. Covariance structure of compound symmetry was used when the model did not converge. Similar analyses were performed by censoring data collected after rescue medication. All symptom efficacy analyses were done using SAS software, v.9·4 or newer (SAS Institute, Inc.).

The Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board (IRB; that is, Advarra or University of Utah IRB) at each study site approved the study protocol, informed consent forms and recruitment materials before patient enrollment. The studies were conducted in accordance with the ICH guidelines, applicable regulations and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before screening. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04492020). The study protocol and statistical analysis plan have been published1.

OpenAI is best known for ChatGPT — the free-to-use, large language model-based chatbot that became a household name after its debut in 2022. The firm, in San Francisco, California, has since released a string of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including ‘reasoning' models that use step-by-step ‘thought' processes to specialize in logical tasks.

OpenAI's ‘deep research' tool: is it useful for scientists?

These tools have helped researchers to polish prose, write code, review the literature and even generate hypotheses. But, like other technology rivals, OpenAI has faced criticisms over the energy demands of its models and the way in which data are exploited for model training. And unlike some firms, OpenAI has almost exclusively released proprietary models that researchers can use, but can't build on.

Jakub Pachocki has been the firm's chief scientist since 2024. He joined OpenAI in 2017 from academia, where he was a theoretical computer scientist and competitive programmer. Now, he leads the development of the company's most advanced AI systems, which are designed to tackle complex tasks in science, mathematics and coding. 

Nature spoke to Pachocki about whether AI can generate original science, artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the firm's upcoming open-weight model.

Today you can talk to a model, but it's only an assistant that needs constant guidance. I expect this will be the primary thing that changes. 

We already see that something like OpenAI's Deep Research [a tool that can synthesize reams of information] is capable of working unsupervised for 10 or 20 minutes and producing something useful. But the amount of compute that's going into solving these queries is tiny.

If you have open research problems it is worth spending much more compute on that. I expect we will have AIs that actually are capable of novel research. We'll see a lot of progress, for example, on autonomous software engineering and the autonomous design of hardware components, and similar applications in other disciplines.

The original ChatGPT releases involved an unsupervised pre-training stage, where the model just ingests a massive amount of data and builds a sort of ‘world model'. Out of that, we extract a useful assistant through a process of reinforcement learning, using human feedback.

One way you can view this latest progress on reasoning models is that it really increases the emphasis on the reinforcement-learning phase, so that we're not only extracting something but also enabling the model to find its own way of thinking.

How much energy will AI really consume? The good, the bad and the unknown

A question is whether we should continue to think of these stages of learning separately. Reasoning models don't learn how to think in a vacuum, they are rooted in a model that has learned through pre-training. A lot of my focus is on thinking about that phase and combining the approaches and understanding their interaction.

One thing that we should be clear about is that the way the models work is different from how a human brain works. A pre-trained model has learned some things about the world, but it doesn't really have any conception of how it learned them, or any temporal order as to when it learned things.

Metrics details

Human attachment theory outlines three organized types: secure, insecure avoidant and insecure resistant, all considered adaptive responses to maternal care for offspring survival. In contrast, disorganized attachment is hypothesized to be maladaptive and therefore uncommon in wild mammals, though this remains untested. We assessed attachment types in 50 wild chimpanzees (ages 0–10 years) in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. Using 3,795 h of mother and offspring focal observations, we found no behaviours indicative of disorganized attachment. To explore organized attachment, we analysed a subset of 18 immature chimpanzees and their behavioural responses to 309 natural threatening events. Their responses showed organized attachment patterns: some sought maternal closeness (secure-like), while others displayed independence (insecure avoidant-like). Our study supports the hypothesis that organized attachment types are adaptive and have a long evolutionary history.

Attachment is defined as an affectionate bond between an infant and primary caregiver, characterized by physical proximity and reactions to separation1,2. In humans, attachment is crucial for both the physical and psychological well-being of the offspring3. Attachment theory suggests that the caregiver, usually the mother, serves as a secure base, enabling exploration and providing a safe haven for the infant during distress4.

In humans, offspring attachment to a primary caregiver is commonly examined using an experimental paradigm known as the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP)5,6. According to the SSP, different types of attachment can be classified based on the assessment of the offspring's perception of safety in the caregiver–offspring relationship. This is defined as confidence in the caregiver's availability and responsiveness, and is revealed by exposing the child to a temporary separation from their caregiver. Ainsworth and colleagues5 described three types of ‘organized' attachment, referring to attachment behaviours that are structured and consistent: (1) secure, (2) insecure resistant/ambivalent and (3) insecure avoidant (Fig. 1). Organized attachment is hypothesized to represent strategies adapted to the caregiver's responsiveness, ensuring offspring survival and sustained development in diverse early social settings. Such strategies are thought to be formed to optimize social capacity in the relevant environment2,7. Secure attachment arises from confidence in the caregiver's availability, nurtured by their high responsiveness. On the other hand, insecure-avoidant offspring adjust their behaviour due to their caregiver's lack of responsiveness, leading to avoidance of contact during distress and developing a level of independence earlier than is typical for their age. Insecure-resistant offspring exhibit clingy behaviour, a response to the inconsistent responsiveness of their caregiver. Their inability to venture away from their mothers serves as an indicator of their attachment security8. Research shows that attachment types remain stable across development and influence social growth. Waters9 found consistent infant behaviour during the SSP between 12 and 18 months. Kerns, Tomich and Kim10 used questionnaires to reveal that children aged 7–13 years maintained stable perceptions of attachment figure availability (with no change in the secure score for parent–child attachment), though they relied less on them as they aged, seeking less comfort or play from caregivers when distressed or sick.

The black boxes show human attachment types. The white boxes depict the respective predicted behaviour of offspring towards mothers, given the applied assessments. The letters on the left refer to the different types of attachment. The numbers on the left refer to the analyses to test the predictions related to the different types of attachment in the Methods and the Results sections. The numbers indicated in superscript correspond to the references in the literature: Bowlby2, Ainsworth et al.5 and Main and Solomon11.

Main and Solomon11 introduced a fourth attachment type, insecure-disorganized/disoriented attachment (Fig. 1), characterized by random or conflicting behaviours, stereotypies and fear of the caregiver typically, with offspring expressing distress without seeking comfort from their caregiver12,13. Disorganized attachment, linked to problematic parenting and higher rates of parental psychopathology, poses challenges for social integration14. The classification of disorganized attachment as adaptive2,15 or maladaptive16 remains debated. Indeed, Gazzillo and colleagues15 consider disorganized attachment as a child's adaptation to a traumatic, inconsistent environment, leading to contradictory behaviours such as avoiding approach and showing fear. Other researchers, in contrast, argue that disorganized attachment is maladaptive, lacking a coherent strategy and posing long-term developmental risks16,17. Understanding the evolutionary history of these behaviours could offer insights into child development, aiding therapeutic interventions and prevention strategies for emotional and psychological issues.

Unlike all other apes, reproduction in humans is relatively cooperative and includes a range of support structures that theoretically could limit the impact of poor parent–offspring attachment18. As such, disorganized attachment could emerge as a maladaptive response to disorganized parenting, which could arise from a lack of clear selection pressures on parenting. In this case, disorganized attachment is unlikely to be observed in environments where natural selection should favour more adaptive attachment patterns that increase the chances of offspring survival. Therefore, as a first step towards evaluating the evolution of certain attachment types, a comparative approach is needed.

Attachment theory is proposed to apply broadly to mammals to aid offspring survival19, but so far, it has predominantly been applied to human relationships. However, researchers have explored the mother–offspring relationship in captive nonhuman primates. Such studies demonstrate strong attachment bonds between biological mothers and their infants20. Furthermore, studies with monkeys, including Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata)21, bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata)22, brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella)23 and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)24, have identified individual differences in mother–offspring attachment security. Additionally, Yano-Nashimoto and colleagues25 found that captive infant marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), which are raised in a multi-caregiver system, selectively avoided and emitted negative calls when handled by rejecting caregivers. This suggests attachment figures are chosen depending on the quality of care provided in this species.

Studies of mother–offspring attachment types in wild primates, however, have not yet been conducted. Chimpanzees, one of our closest living relatives26, serve as an excellent model for studying mother–offspring attachment. Their exceptional social and cognitive abilities, coupled with an important dependence on mothers for at least the first decade of life27,28,29,30, make them extremely valuable for comparative research. This social dependency crucially contributes to the offspring's overall fitness31,32. Van Ijzendoorn et al.33 and Clay34 used the SSP with captive human-reared infant chimpanzees, revealing distinct attachment types with their favourite caregiver similar to those in human infants with their mothers. Responsive care (as opposed to standard care) correlated with less disorganized attachment and more advanced cognitive development. One-year-old captive chimpanzees with disorganized attachment had an increased likelihood of illness, heightened abnormal behaviours and reduced social interaction success over 20 years (ref. 34).

While insightful, findings from such studies potentially differ from those representing mother–offspring attachment in natural settings. Mothers not only provide nourishment, but also closeness, comfort and social learning opportunities35. While captive settings provide a more controlled environment, it is essential to acknowledge their limitations in representing attachment processes in a natural system where behaviours are largely adapted to socio-ecological conditions. Owing to predation, social competition and variable food availability, mother–offspring attachment under natural conditions should be shaped by selection processes.

In our study of wild chimpanzees, we first hypothesized that disorganized attachment would be rare in these natural settings due to its potentially maladaptive nature in humans, with some evidence supporting this in captive apes34. Given that disorganized attachment may result, at least in part, from the maternal style the offspring is exposed to, low survival rates would limit the proliferation of such a behavioural phenotype into future generations. We predicted that immature chimpanzees would show few behaviours typically observed in individuals with disorganized attachment. Specifically, we predicted immature chimpanzees would show few aggressive behaviours towards their mother, rare or no abnormal or stereotypic behaviour and would look for comfort when expressing vocal distress. Second, we hypothesized that organized attachment types would be prevalent in wild chimpanzees. In humans, caregiver responsiveness is thought to directly shape the attachment type5,36,37, but this has not been tested in nonhuman animals. Nevertheless, general social characteristics such as gregariousness, grooming rates and number of bond partners vary among chimpanzee mothers38 and depend on the sex of the offspring39, which might impact maternal care. Therefore, we expected some variation in attachment type in chimpanzee offspring. We compared attachment patterns with existing and well-defined attachment types observed in humans. We expected that if attachment types overlap with those of humans, wild immature chimpanzees would display different safety-seeking and comfort behaviours from mothers during threatening situations, reflecting secure, insecure-avoidant and insecure-resistant attachment types. Additionally, to assess the functional similarity of any attributed attachment types with those of humans, we determined how attachment security impacted mother–offspring proximity during social exploration8. We predicted that individuals who did not rely on their mother during exposure to a threat (insecure avoidant-like), would explore further away from her during social contexts, compared with those seeking comfort during threatening events (secure and insecure resistant-like). We also expected that individuals exhibiting overreaction during threatening situations (insecure resistant-like) would limit their exploration in social contexts, staying close to their mother compared to other individuals. The analyses performed to test each prediction are summarized in Fig. 1.

Therefore, the current research endeavoured to investigate the dynamics of mother–offspring attachment in wild western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), drawing parallels with attachment theory in humans. The behavioural data (ethogram in Supplementary Table 1) collected over 34 months (from 2016 to 2023) on 50 mother–offspring dyads (offspring's age between 0 and 10 years old) (Supplementary Table 2) provides a unique opportunity to explore the relevance of attachment theory in chimpanzees within their natural habitat. This approach also offers a fresh perspective by studying attachment types in wild primates.

To investigate mother–offspring aggression (test A2) and test for disorganized attachment, we used the entire dataset (Supplementary Fig. 1). For analyses related to organized attachment (test B) and part of the disorganized attachment assessment (test A1), we focused on data from 2021 to 2023, which included additional ethogram elements specifically designed to capture responses to directed and undirected threatening events (UTEs) (see ‘Threatening events' section) (Supplementary Fig. 1).

We collected 2,882 h of behavioural data on 50 immature chimpanzees (22 females and 28 males, aged 0 to 10years, mean observation time (M) = 58.06 h, range 28–107 ± 19.96 h (s.d.) per individual), and 913 h on 21 mothers to assess maternal aggressiveness (M = 36.63 h, range 12–58 ± 10.67 h (s.d.) per individual), totalling 3,795 h of observation.

To investigate the existence of disorganized attachment in 30 immature chimpanzees (ages 0 to 10 years), we tested whether vocal distress from the offspring predicted a mother–offspring approach during naturally occurring events (Model 1), a sign of organized rather than disorganized attachment. We categorized these events as undirectly or directly threatening for the offspring UTEs and directed threatening events (DTEs)). Whimpering or screaming predicted the likelihood of the mother–offspring approach (Table 1). Offspring showing vocal distress (whimpering or screaming) approached their mother (23% of 168 occasions) or were approached by her (42% of 168 occasions). We examined the credible intervals (CIs) for each individual to identify individuals not following the predictions of the model (Supplementary Fig. 2). We found that vocal distress did not predict an approach for three individuals out of 30 (10%). By examining the behavioural reactions during other threatening events, we found that these three individuals approached their mother on several occurrences. The conditional R2 of this model was 0.284.

We assessed the occurrence of aggressive behaviours between immature chimpanzees and their mother and other characteristic behaviours of disorganized attachment to investigate the existence of this attachment type. In over 3,795 h of focal data focusing on mother and offspring, the 50 studied offspring between 0 to 10 years old never showed aggression towards the mother. In contrast, we observed a total of 31 mild non-contact aggressions of 12 mothers towards their offspring during the observation period (27 arm waves, 2 hunches, 1 charge and 1 chase) and 15 contact aggressions of 11 mothers towards their offspring (6 push away, 6 hits and 3 pulls). Mother–offspring aggression rates are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.

We did not observe any abnormal or stereotypic behaviours in any chimpanzee (for example, rocking, hair pulling, face grimacing or incomplete behaviour), nor attempts by the offspring to escape from their mother, except in instances where the mother displayed aggression towards the offspring over the 50 studied offspring.

We investigated the behavioural reactions of 18 immature chimpanzees during UTEs and found differences across ages. The youngest chimpanzees (less than 2 years) predominantly whimpered, looked towards their mother and/or approached their mother during a UTE (model 2; Fig. 2a). However, with increasing age, this tendency decreased. The tendency to show no reaction increased with age and peaked at 50% of events around the weaning period (4–6 years old) before the likelihood of no reaction decreased again. After weaning (>6 years), however, the likelihood of climbing a tree or running away from the UTE increased.

Top: the likelihood of a particular behavioural reaction by the offspring when experiencing a UTE, in relation to the offspring's age.The solid lines depict the proportion of events in which each behaviour was observed and predicted by the model, and the coloured areas are the 95% CI. Bottom: individual variation in offspring behavioural reactions to UTEs. The violin plots show deviation from the expected value (0) for a given age while accounting for sex, party size and the presence of older siblings. Each dot depicts an individual chimpanzee. Positive or negative deviation from zero indicates that the individual shows a behaviour more or less than predicted, respectively. The sample size is n = 30 individuals across 550 independent events.

Comparing the deviation estimates of each offspring's behaviour when reacting to the UTE with the expected behaviour for its age and other variables (for example, sex or presence of older siblings), we found that some behavioural reactions had higher individual variability than others (Fig. 2b). Offspring showed different interindividual variability across the behaviours, with the highest variability for the behaviour ‘approaching the mother' (deviation of 4.78), all the other behaviours had a deviation under 2.3 indicating lower variability. This suggests that interindividual variability in behavioural reactions during UTEs was primarily influenced by differences in the approach behaviour towards the mother.

Given that we found strong individual differences in key attachment-related variables (Fig. 2b), we explored whether individuals displayed consistent behavioural patterns regardless of age and other social factors. Using the unsupervised Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method, we identified three clusters without predefined numbers. A supervised cluster analysis with three set clusters produced similar results, consistently grouping the same individuals (Fig. 3a).

Each dot corresponds to an individual offspring. Top: dimension reduction (UMAP) and cluster analysis of the behavioural reactions of the offspring during UTEs testing the existence of distinct attachment types. The position of the points corresponds to the UMAP representation, while the colours attributed correspond to the spectral cluster analysis. NN, number of nearest neighbors. The axis of both plots represents a dimension reduction of the original data to two dimensions. Bottom: interindividual variation of offspring reactions during UTEs (results of the PCA). The colours represent the attachment types attributed based on the UMAP method and the cluster analysis. The bigger points represent the average loading for each attachment type category. The arrows represent the different dimensions (behavioural reactions) that have been reduced into two dimensions (top). Attachment type 1 corresponds to individuals not showing specific behaviour more often than expected for their age during UTEs; attachment type 2 corresponds to individuals not reacting during a threat or climbing, approaching another individual or running away without orienting towards the mother to seek safety more than expected for their age; and attachment type 3 corresponds to individuals approaching and looking towards their mother more than expected for their age. The sample size is n = 18 individuals.

The principal component analysis (PCA) results indicated which behaviours drove each cluster (Table 2 and Fig. 3b). The first PCA component explained 65% of the variance, with ‘approaching the mother' contributing the most (eigenvalue of 2.01). Adding component 2 explained 79% of the variance (eigenvalue of 0.43), driven by ‘approaching other individuals'. Including component 3 explained 90% (eigenvalue of 0.34). Each remaining component explained less than 5%. Attachment type 1 was attributed to individuals near the PCA centre, following model predictions. Attachment type 2 individuals relied less on their mothers than expected, while attachment type 3 individuals approached their mothers more than predicted for their age (Fig. 3b).

To validate the attribution of attachment types to each individual based on their behavioural reactions during UTEs, we investigated whether there were differences in mother–offspring distances during social exploration across focal samples depending on attachment type. The exploratory events were not related to the UTE. We modelled the mean distance between offspring and mother per focal day predicted by the attachment type and other control variables (for example, sex and age) (model 3), with the results presented in Table 3. The conditional R2 was 0.279. We showed an effect of attachment type with 89% of CIs. Indeed, offspring with attachment type 2 engaged in social exploration further away from their mother than offspring with attachment type 1 (Fig. 4) Control variables produced no consistent difference in mother–offspring proximity (all 89% CI overlapped 0; Table 3). Only daily mean party size showed a notable trend, suggesting that larger social gatherings were associated with offspring engaging in social exploration further away from their mother.

Each dot corresponds to a focal follow on a given offspring. The y axis represents the model estimate of the mean distance between the offspring and its mother per focal. The box plots show the median and the interquartile range from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the posterior distribution. The whiskers indicate the range of data within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the lower and upper quartiles. Based on our prior analyses (UMAP, cluster analysis, PCA and model 2), attachment type 1 corresponds to secure attachment, attachment type 2 aligns with insecure-avoidant attachment and attachment type 3 corresponds to insecure-resistant attachment. The star represents an 89% CI excluding zero, indicating a credible effect. The sample size is n = 18 individuals across 260 independent events.

Finally, we investigated whether the offspring continued being distressed even after their mother had comforted them, to distinguish between secure and insecure-resistant attachment (Fig. 5). During the events when the mother approached or physically made contact, the offspring never continued or renewed vocal distress. In only 3 of 78 events did offspring continue or renew vocal distress within 30 s of experiencing a threat. During these three events, the mother did not approach or make physical contact with the offspring, nor did she react to further distress.

We assessed comfort seeking (offspring approaches mother) and comfort giving (mother approaches or touches offspring), represented by the arrows, or self-comfort (no new behaviour sign of distress of the offspring within 30 s after the threatening event without approach from either mother or offspring, no arrow). Blue represents offspring stopping or not renewing vocal distress within 30 s after the threatening event and orange represents offspring continuing or renewing vocal distress within 30 s after the threatening event suggesting no immediate comforting. The sample size is n = 18 individuals across 78 independent events.

Next, we analysed the variation in the duration spent by offspring exploring their environment in both social and non-social contexts per day in relation to attachment type. Our findings indicated that there was no discernible effect of attachment type on the duration spent by offspring exploring their environment in either social or non-social contexts (Supplementary Table 3). Finally, we investigated whether attachment types could predict the latency for offspring to resume exploration after experiencing a UTE or a threat during a play bout. There was no difference between attachment types 1 and 3 in latency time (Supplementary Table 4).

The results of these additional analyses are explained in Supplementary Text 1.

Our dataset of wild chimpanzees showed no evidence of disorganized attachment. This differs from what has been observed in humans and captive chimpanzees33,34. Instead, the responses of immature, wild chimpanzees during threatening situations revealed organized attachment patterns comparable to the secure (attachment type 1) and insecure-avoidant (attachment type 2) attachments found in humans5. Offspring who rarely approached their mother during a UTE explored socially from a greater distance than those who sought maternal proximity.

However, there was no strong support for a difference in mother–offspring proximity during social exploration between individuals with a secure-like attachment type and those with an insecure resistant-like attachment type (type 3). Additionally, there was no evidence of young chimpanzees continuing vocal distress after receiving comfort, indicating the absence of an insecure-resistant attachment axis. Finally, offspring did not exhibit aggressive, contradictory or abnormal behaviours typically associated with disorganized attachment.

Our findings suggest that certain characteristics of organized attachment have a deep evolutionary history. Meanwhile, the lack of disorganized attachment features in wild chimpanzees lends support to the assertions that this phenotype is indeed maladaptive.

The results revealed age-dependent responses to threats. As expected, offspring became more independent with age, relying less on their mother and acquiring skills to navigate and respond to potentially threatening situations, such as running away or climbing trees for self-protection (Fig. 2a). During weaning (at approximately 4 years old28), offspring were less likely to react to threatening events. We speculate that maternal availability may be limited following the birth of a new offspring, inhibiting approaches from both mother and weaned offspring before the latter has fully developed more independent strategies (for example, climbing up a tree or running away). Across animals, maternal reproductive strategies are finely balanced: mothers gain by reproducing with shorter inter-birth intervals but only if the older offspring survives40,41. Hence, when younger siblings are born, older siblings who show inappropriately low reactivity to threats may still be reaching suitable levels of independence. These findings support the notion that the weaning period, precipitating greater social and nutritional independence, plays a crucial role in ontogeny, being linked with the emergence of complex behaviours such as call combinations42, social grooming and tool use43.

The 50 subjects in this study did not show behavioural patterns corresponding to the disorganized attachment type found in humans and in captive chimpanzees33. In humans, disorganized attachment is found in 23.5% of children tested across cultures using the SSP6 and in 54% of institutionalized children44. Children and other primates with disorganized attachment demonstrate aggressive behaviour towards their mother, caregiver and peers, and exhibit abnormal or conflicted, confused or apprehensive behaviour. The Taï chimpanzees observed here did not show any of these behaviours. Given that aggressive or abusive behaviours from mothers towards offspring are considered a common cause associated with disorganized attachment14, we looked at the aggression rate per hour from mothers to their offspring. Events, when the mother showed aggressive behaviours towards her offspring, were very rare (48 aggressions over 3,795 h of observation among 17 of 33 mothers). The mean rate of aggression per mother–offspring dyad was 0.008 per hour for non-contact aggression (maximum rate at 0.10 per hour; arm waving) and 0.003 for contact aggression per hour (maximum rate of 0.03 per hour; hitting). The low rate of contact aggression from mother to offspring in wild chimpanzees is also supported by other studies (Reddy and Sandel45: no contact aggression observed in 29 young males over 1,570 h and Sabbi et al.46: 85 aggressions observed towards 49 immature chimpanzees over at least 4,116 h (maximum 0.02 per hour)). As a comparison, female chimpanzees direct contact aggression towards other individuals 2.3 times more frequently than towards their offspring, and non-contact aggression 2.5 times more frequently towards other individuals than their offspring (extrapolated data from the dataset of Tkaczynski47). Altogether, this suggests that the disorganized attachment type is rare or absent in wild chimpanzees. If it is present at an early age, those infants probably do not survive. In the wild, 15% of chimpanzee infants die before the age of 1.5 years48. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis that the disorganized attachment type is not an adaptive survival strategy in the face of environmental constraints in a wild setting.

In contrast, for orphaned chimpanzees in captive settings, behaviours indicative of disorganized attachment have been reported at relatively high rates33,34. Specifically, 41% of chimpanzees receiving responsive care and 72% of those under standard care from keepers exhibited disorganized attachment with the favourite human caregiver shown by sequential or simultaneous displays of contradictory behaviours or misdirected attachment behaviour. Compared with wild settings, captive settings provide an environment in which threats to survival are low, such as no exposure to predators nor out-group lethal aggression, health is managed and food is provisioned to reduce competition. However, psycho-social risk factors may be higher due to historical issues such as some zoo chimpanzees, that are now mothers, may have been rescued from isolated- or peer-housed living in medical facilities. As such, captive chimpanzee social scenarios may show parallels with those of modern human societies, where survival is less dependent on socio-ecological factors and high survival rates probably facilitate greater variation in psycho-social phenomena.

Disorganized attachment can result from caregivers displaying frightening behaviours towards children12,49. Specifically, offspring who have experienced sustained/extreme aggressive or neglectful maternal care, are at substantially higher risk of developing extreme psychopathologies in adulthood50. In contrast, the maternal behaviour of chimpanzees observed in our study lacked evidence of the abusive behaviours observed in human contexts. In Taï chimpanzees, extreme rejecting or neglectful maternal behaviour is exceptionally rare. Only two instances of abandonment were observed across 85 cumulative observation years of three communities. In each case, and unusual in chimpanzees, the maternal grandmother was present (Wittig and Crockford, personal observations). In contrast, instances of inadequate maternal care in zoos leading to humans taking over offspring rearing occurred for 8 infants involving 19 mothers across less than 5 years51 and for 7 infants involving 23 mothers across 9 years52.

Orphaned captive chimpanzees might develop disorganized attachment since, even with excellent care, they generally lack both a 24 h and permanent attachment figure to offer nurturing and protection and typical early social interactions with a primary caregiver of the same species. Both may explain the high percentage of disorganized chimpanzees in the studies of Van Ijzendoorn and colleagues33 and Clay34. It has been suggested that attachment and maternal nurturing propensity are transmitted across generations (in humans: Van Ijzendoorn and Bakermans-Kranenburg53; in mammals: Rilling and Young54), implying that individuals raised by nurturing mothers are likely to demonstrate nurturing care to their own offspring, as well as conversely. Animal welfare in captivity has become a welcome priority in recent years as understanding of the long-term impact of rearing conditions has improved55. Consequently, mothers born and raised in captivity or adopted from medical facilities a generation (20–30 years) ago might not have received adequate care as offspring, potentially leading to poor mothering skills with a higher likelihood of abandoning their own offspring or demonstrating reduced sensitivity to their needs56,57.

We demonstrated that young wild chimpanzees show variation in their reliance on their mother during UTEs, even after controlling for their age. This finding, driven principally by approach behaviour towards mothers, implies that some individuals use their mothers more as a safe haven during a UTE than others. Therefore, like in humans, chimpanzee offspring could be considered to have different organized attachment types. Some individuals did not demonstrate age-appropriate reliance on their mother during UTEs (attachment type 2), fitting well the criteria for insecure-avoidant attachment or excessive reliance on the mother (attachment type 3), similar to the insecure-resistant attachment (Fig. 3). Others showed age-appropriate reliance on their mother (attachment type 1) akin to the secure attachment (Fig. 3). To better understand individual differences and the adaptability of organized attachment, it is now necessary to investigate maternal responsiveness and determine whether the developed attachment is related to the mother's responsiveness.

An additional measure to distinguish between secure and insecure-resistant offspring's behavioural reactions examined whether offspring showing distress during exposure to a threat are comforted after seeking comfort from their mother. In humans, children with insecure-resistant attachment persist in displaying distress even when the mother attempts to provide comfort. In our sample, offspring rarely continued or renewed vocal distress after a threatening event (Fig. 5). Rare instances where offspring continued to seek their mother were observed only when the mother did not offer comfort. This observation strongly suggests that in the wild, young chimpanzees are reliably comforted by their mothers if comfort is provided, challenging the notion of the existence of insecure-resistant attachment. The individuals initially considered as insecure resistant in our dataset could be secure offspring overreacting during UTEs (which is a subcategory of the secure attachment). This overreaction could be due to the offspring's temperament, particularly their susceptibility to distress and anxiety, rather than being solely attributed to maternal factors58,59. In 32 out of 78 observed instances, there was no approach between mother and offspring, yet the distress subsided regardless. This behaviour might imply the use of self-comforting mechanisms or growing emotional independence. Furthermore, 14 out of 18 individuals exhibited this behaviour at least once. Notably, these instances often occurred during play bouts, indicating that the initial threat was mild and soon over, thus not requiring further comfort.

Furthermore, using the same focal data for analysis to determine the different attachment types (test B1) and incorporating new data from threat occurrences during play bouts, we examined (Supplementary Table 4) whether attachment types predicted the latency time for offspring to explore after a UTE or a threat during a play bout. This analysis revealed no strong differences, supporting the idea that attachment types 1 and 3 might demonstrate no functional difference. The findings presented in Table 3, which model the proximity between mother and offspring during social exploration unrelated to threatening events, support the notion of individual distinctions between offspring exhibiting attachment type 1 (secure-like) and attachment type 2 (insecure avoidant-like). Indeed, offspring with attachment type 2 explored further away from their mother in a social context than offspring with attachment type 1 (Fig. 4). Insecure avoidant-like individuals did not rely on their mother during UTEs, exploring further away from her, consistent with the idea that they did not consider her as a safe base. There was no difference between offspring with attachment type 1 (secure-like) and attachment type 3 (insecure resistant-like), again corroborating the idea that those individuals might all show degrees of ‘secure' attachment. Contrary to our prediction that securely attached offspring (attachment type 1) would explore their environment further away from their mother than insecure-resistant offspring (attachment type 3), the results indicated that attachment type 1 offspring actually explored closer to their mother than attachment type 3 offspring, yet with no substantial differences (no effect at 89%).

Overall, these results align with the findings of Van Ijzendoorn and colleagues33, who identified diverse organized attachment types (secure, insecure avoidant and insecure resistant) in captive chimpanzees that resembled those observed in humans. However notably, we did not yield evidence supporting the presence of insecure-resistant attachment in wild chimpanzees, possibly due to our comparatively smaller sample size, that is 18 versus 46 individuals.

Given our small sample size for the assessment of chimpanzee attachment types, our sample may not have captured the full diversity of attachment in young chimpanzees. Nevertheless, we showed strong evidence for interindividual variability. Controlling for offspring age posed challenges due to the limited number of individuals, resulting in few subjects with identical ages. Nevertheless, we maintained confidence in the validity of our methodology by controlling for age differences, asserting that attachment types can still be assessed in older offspring within the range of 1.5–6 years. A strength of our approach was having repeated observations in natural situations across time, which probably increases the capacity to distinguish variation in attachment. This contrasts with the SSP in humans, which is typically conducted only once per child, out of their natural environment, in a safe place and notably only in certain cultures5,6. Additionally, mother-initiated approaches could limit direct comparability to human studies, where mothers are told to not react, but this is unavoidable in a naturalistic setting where mothers behave freely. Additionally, behaviour not only in threatening contexts but also in daily social life, such as mother–offspring distance, was predictable based on reactions to threatening events in wild immature chimpanzees, further highlighting parallels to organized attachment in humans. Future research is needed to explore how attachment type relates to social behaviour across the lifespan. Finally, one might question whether organized attachment in humans is comparable to that observed in chimpanzees. In humans, organized attachment is defined by a child's use of a consistent and coherent strategy to seek comfort and support from their primary caregiver when distressed60. Our findings suggest that wild immature chimpanzees exhibit behavioural strategies similar to those seen in human infants, such as approaching or avoiding their mother when facing potential threats, which is a situation analogous to the SSP experiments. This convergence in behavioural patterns, despite differences in the nature of the stimuli (experimental versus naturally occurring), suggests a shared foundation in attachment strategies between chimpanzees and human infants. Additionally, behaviour not only in threatening contexts but also in daily social life, such as mother–offspring distance, was predictable based on reactions to threatening events in wild immature chimpanzees, further highlighting parallels to organized attachment in humans. Future research is needed to explore how attachment type relates to social behaviour across the lifespan.

By examining the hugely influential psychological concept of attachment theory within an evolutionary framework, we were able to identify distinct mother–offspring attachment types in young wild western chimpanzees, similar to the secure and insecure-avoidant types found in humans, but no evidence of disorganized attachment. While this does not rule out the occurrence of disorganized attachment in wild chimpanzees, it suggests that if it occurs, it does so at much lower rates than is found in humans or peer-raised captive chimpanzees. Thus, these findings support the hypothesis that disorganized attachment may not be adaptive for offspring survival. Future research should investigate the impact of attachment types on offspring fitness, and the relation between maternal care and attachment types in other mammals. Our findings provide a crucial step towards understanding how adaptive attachment strategies emerge across species, as well as the key role attachment may play in social evolution. Shared attachment strategies across species may indicate a common evolutionary heritage, underscoring the ancient origins of sociality in primates. However, the relatively high prevalence of disorganized attachment in both human and captive chimpanzee populations is consistent with the hypothesis that rearing environments contribute substantially to its manifestation and persistence in certain contexts. This contrast between the lack of disorganized attachment in the wild setting of our study and the relatively high prevalence of disorganized attachment in captive environments indicates a need for further research to understand the underlying causal factors (for example, genetic influence and parental state of mind)61. Further comparative research in natural environments is beneficial for understanding mother–offspring attachment dynamics, which are crucial for primate social development and for other long-lived mammals with protracted development. Observing these dynamics in natural settings reveals how ecological pressures and social contexts shape attachment behaviours, offering insights that controlled environments often overlook.

Our study was purely observational and non-invasive. Observers followed the strict hygiene protocol of the Taï Chimpanzee Project, adopted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as the best practice guideline for wild ape studies62. Observers quarantined for 5 days before following the chimpanzees. Every day, observers disinfected their hands and boots and changed clothes before leaving and entering camps. In the forest, observers wore face masks and kept a minimum distance of 7 m between themselves and the chimpanzees, to avoid disease transmission from humans to chimpanzees and to avoid disturbing the natural behaviour of the observed individuals. The research protocol used here was approved by the ‘Ethikrat' of the Max Planck Society on 04 August 2014 and by the ‘Directeur de Recherche en Côte d'Ivoire' under the Permit TCP Wittig/008/MESRS/DGRI from 05 May 2021.

E.R., O.N.-L., P.J.T. and research assistants collected behavioural data on three wild Western chimpanzee (P. t. verus) communities (North, South and East groups), habituated to human observers and located in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire63.

Behavioural focal sampling followed a standardized methodology, with two focal individuals observed daily for about 6 h each from approximately 6:30 to 12:30 and 12:30 to 18:30 (ref. 64). Cybertracker (v.3.389, v.3.440 and v.3.517) was used to record daily activities (resting, eating, walking and so on), social interactions (grooming, playing, affiliations, aggressions and solicitations), mother–offspring proximity and mother–offspring interactions. Subgroup composition and changes in behaviour were also continuously noted. Reliability of the coded behaviours and individual identities was high across datasets between coders (Cohen's Kappa tests: ĸ = 0.72, 0.81, 0.70, 0.78, 0.80 and 0.64)65. Full ethogram details are available in the supporting information66,67 (Supplementary Table 1).

To correspond with the SSP68, which involves a potential threat to the infant, we chose naturally occurring situations of undirected aggressions, or aggressions and threats not directed towards the offspring (excluding the presence of predators) for analysis (UTEs). In chimpanzees, third-party aggressions can result in redirected aggressions to nearby individuals69. Additionally, we included the following contexts of UTEs that typically alert the group: chimpanzee vocalizations outside of the group, alarm calls of other species and gunshots. We removed events when the offspring was already in contact with the mother and when the mother was included in the aggression to account for the mother's availability for their offspring. To assess responses to vocal distress (tests A1 and B3 in Fig. 1), we added threats directed at the offspring that more regularly triggered vocal distress, including threats during play bouts and aggressions directed towards the offspring (DTEs). Behavioural reactions of both the mother and offspring were recorded during these potentially threatening situations (immediately, that is, within approximately 2 s).

We performed the following analyses using R Studio (R version 4.2.2)70 and Spyder Python (version 3.9)71.

We first tested the existence of disorganized attachment by assessing whether distress during a UTE or DTE predicted approach behaviour between mother and offspring (test A1) and analysing aggression rates between mother and offspring (test A2). We then tested the existence of distinct organized attachment types by analysing offspring reactions to UTEs (controlling for age and other variables; test B1a in Supplementary Fig. 1), applying dimension reduction and cluster analysis to detect patterns (test B1b in Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, we examined differences in the mean distance between mother and offspring during social exploration excluding threatening events (test B2) and evaluated the existence of insecure-resistant attachment by assessing the effectiveness of maternal comfort after a UTE or DTE (test B3). The rationale for the different steps of analyses and the respective data used are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Model 1

If wild immature chimpanzees have a disorganized attachment type, we predicted that vocal distress would not result in comfort seeking with their mother. We used all threatening events (UTEs and DTEs) and modelled whether the presence of offspring distress (whimpering and screaming) would cause offspring and mother to reduce their distance (seeking or offering comfort, respectively) using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a Bernoulli error distribution. The control variables are explained in Supplementary Text 1. Each UTE or DTE constituted a data point, totalling 567 observations across 30 individuals (ages 0–10 years). We extracted the estimates of the random slope for whimpering or screaming occurrences associated with the identity of the individuals to evaluate how strongly vocal distress predicted the probability of the mother–offspring approach for each dyad.

Disorganized attachment can be identified in situations where the offspring exhibits fear towards the caregiver. If an offspring consistently displays aggression towards their mother in a fearful context, it suggests a disorganized attachment, particularly if the mother exhibits aggressive behaviour at a higher rate than other mothers towards their offspring. Therefore, to identify whether some individuals presented disorganized attachment, we investigated how often there was aggression observed between mother and offspring. We counted the number of occurrences of both contact and non-contact aggressions between mother and offspring in 50 mother–offspring dyads (ages 0–10 years). Contact aggressions were described as hitting, pushing away, and pulling an individual. Non-contact aggressions were described as hunching, doing an arm wave, charging or chasing an individual (see ethogram in Supplementary Table 2).

To investigate the existence of different types of attachment in immature chimpanzees, we explored the variability between individuals in behavioural reactions during threatening events. Given that our dataset contained individuals from 0 to 10 years old and that we expected immature wild chimpanzees to rely less on their mothers with age, we first ran a model (model 2) controlled for age and other variables. We then used dimension reduction approaches and cluster analysis to see whether within and between individual correlations in these behavioural responses existed.

Model 2

We expected offspring to react differently to a threat depending on age, with younger individuals relying more on their mothers. Therefore, to control for the variation of age across individuals, we used Bayesian models with a Bernoulli error distribution. Each UTE constituted a data point, totalling 550 observations across 30 individuals of data between 2016 and 2023 (ages 0–10 years), and the response variable was again a binary value of the occurrence of the behavioural reaction during an event. Individuals could show multiple reactions during the same UTE.

We ran a separate Bayesian GLMM for each of the nine behaviours (approaching the mother, looking towards the mother, whimpering, screaming, running away from the threat, climbing up a tree, attacking, approaching another individual or not reacting). For visual representation (Fig. 2), we ran a similar model with all the behavioural reactions into a matrix (model 2). We used the offspring age in months on the day of the event as a test predictor. The control variables are explained in Supplementary Text 1. The random intercepts for individuals were extracted, representing deviations from the population-level intercept (average behavioural response), accounting for age and other fixed factors. This captured individual variability not explained by the fixed effects. Positive values meant that individuals showed the given behaviour more than expected for their age and other fixed effects, and less than expected for negative values.

Owing to older offspring (>6 years old) exhibiting fewer mother-dependent behaviours such as approaching and looking towards the mother and displaying more independent behaviours such as climbing up a tree and running away from threats (Fig. 2), we excluded them from subsequent analyses. Young individuals (<1.5 years old) were omitted from further analysis, similar to the practice of excluding very young human infants in the SSP owing to their consistent proximity to their mother, which posed challenges in assessing variations in mother-directed behaviours. This resulted in 18 dyads (M = 3.7 years, range of 1.5–6 years, s.d. 2.4).

We investigated whether individuals exhibited consistent behavioural patterns regardless of their age and the other control variables. We used dimension reduction techniques (UMAP and PCA) and a spectral cluster analysis. We aimed to discern whether individuals aged between 1.5 and 6 years displayed distinct behavioural reactions across 309 UTEs and could be categorized into clusters. We applied these techniques to the deviation estimates extracted from model 2 on 18 individuals (ages 1.5–6 years). More details about these methods are described in Supplementary Text 1.

Model 3

To investigate whether attachment type predicted mother–offspring proximity during social exploration, we analysed the average distance between mothers and their youngest offspring during social play (excluding the mother as a partner). Attachment type was determined using dimension reduction techniques and cluster analysis previously explained (test B1). We applied a Bayesian GLMM with a Gaussian error distribution for this analysis. Each date of data collection per individual constituted a data point, totalling 260 observations across 18 individuals (ages 1.5–6 years).

The mother–offspring distances were categorized and a value corresponding to the mean distance was attributed as follows: contact (value of 0), less than 1 m (value of 0.5), between 1 m and 5 m (value of 3), between 5 m and 10 m (value of 7.5) and more than 10 m (value of 15). The mean distance during social exploration per date per individual was calculated as the sum of every distance multiplied by the time spent at that distance divided by the total observation time of social exploration of that date (sum(value.distance × (duration.distance/duration.total.date))). We used attachment type in interaction with the age of the offspring in months as a test predictor, since we expected that the impact of attachment type on mother–offspring proximity during social exploration would differ across different stages of offspring development. Justifications for including the control variables are given in Supplementary Text 1.

Additionally, we modelled the percentage of time spent by the offspring exploring their environment in non-social (model 4) and social contexts (model 5) with the attachment type (model explanation in Supplementary Text 1 and results in Supplementary Table 3).

To disentangle secure and insecure-resistant attachments, we investigated whether offspring continued being distressed even after their mother had comforted them. We took all the UTEs and frightening events during play bouts that elicited offspring whimpering or screaming and plotted whether they continued or renewed vocal distress (whimpering or screaming) after the distance between mother and offspring was reduced between the moment of the threat and until 30 s after (Fig. 5). There were 78 observations across 18 individuals (ages 1.5–6 years).

Additionally, we performed a survival analysis (model 6) to investigate the existence of insecure-resistant attachment by looking at the latency time between a threatening event and exploratory behaviour (Supplementary Text 1 and Supplementary Table 4). On the basis of the human literature, we hypothesized that insecure-resistant offspring would take longer to explore their environment after a threat compared with secure and insecure-avoidant offspring.

We ran all models in R 4.2.2 (ref. 70) using the function ‘brm' from the package ‘brms'72. All continuous values were scaled to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. We tested for collinearity issues by quantifying variance inflation factors for our predictor variables using the function ‘vif' from the package ‘car'73. We ran 2,000 iterations (1,000 for ‘warm-up') on 12 chains. We used weakly regularizing priors for the fixed effects (normal (0,1)) and the priors given by default by the function ‘get_prior' of the package ‘brms' for the random effects (that is, Student's t (3, 0, 2.5) for the random intercepts and slopes). We then extracted the 95% and 89% CIs for each fixed effect from the posterior distribution of the model. Sampling diagnostics (R-hat of 1 for all predictors) and trace plots confirmed chain convergence for all models. Effective sample sizes (all >3,800) confirmed no issues with autocorrelation of sampling for all models. All variance inflation factors were below 5 confirming non-collinearity between variables. All posterior predictive checks for each model were satisfactory (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6).

Migraine symptoms that appear long before a headache can include fatigue, light sensitivity, neck pain and difficulty concentrating. Credit: skynesher/Getty

Scientists have shown that a drug approved to treat migraine headaches can also alleviate debilitating non-headache symptoms, such as fatigue, brain fog and blinding light sensitivity, that occur as the migraine is starting.

The drug — called ubrogepant — is already known to stop the onset of a full-blown migraine attack in some people if they take it when the headache begins. But a phase III clinical trial, described in Nature Medicine on 12 May1, shows that it can also tackle the ‘prodrome' symptoms that arrive hours or even days earlier.

The results suggest that ubrogepant could “free patients from a disabling part of migraine”, says study co-author Peter Goadsby, a neuroscientist at King's College London.

The process of a migraine starts long before the head pain, when brain circuits involving the hypothalamus — a region that regulates several vital bodily functions — become dysregulated. In the prodrome, or premonitory phase, people can experience various unpleasant symptoms, including fatigue, neck pain, an aversion to light (photophobia) or sound (phonophobia) and difficulty concentrating.

“Not enough attention has been given to prodrome symptoms,” says Goadsby. The trial aimed to “fill this gap” by investigating whether ubrogepant has an effect on the initial stages of a migraine.

Migraine is more than a headache — a radical rethink offers hope to one billion people

The trial included 438 participants who could reliably identify incoming migraine attacks from their prodromal symptoms. During the 60 days of the trial, they took ubrogepant or a placebo whenever they felt any prodromal symptoms coming on, and reported whether doing this had any effect.

The results suggest that for some participants, the drug increased their ability to concentrate one hour after treatment, reduced their photophobia two hours after treatment and reduced their fatigue and neck pain after three hours.

But the “effect sizes were small” and never more than 15 percentage points compared with the placebo, points out Gregory Dussor, a neuroscientist and migraine specialist at the University of Texas at Dallas. For example, 27% of participants who took ubrogepant reported an absence of fatigue, compared with 17% who took the placebo. Dussor suggests this modest improvement is because the class of drugs to which ubrogepant belongs is a “life-changing therapeutic” for a minority of people — perhaps only one in five, according to some studies. It makes little difference to others, so its effect for that minority “gets diluted in the data”.

Metrics details

Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder — which are the most common adult disorders requiring psychiatric care — contribute substantially to premature mortality and morbidity globally. Treatments for these disorders are suboptimal, there are no diagnostic pathologies or biomarkers and their pathophysiologies are poorly understood. Novel therapeutic and diagnostic approaches are thus badly needed. Given the high heritability of psychiatric disorders, psychiatry has potentially much to gain from the application of genomics to identify molecular risk mechanisms and to improve diagnosis. Recent large-scale, genome-wide association studies and sequencing studies, together with advances in functional genomics, have begun to illuminate the genetic architectures of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder and to identify potential biological mechanisms. Genomic findings also point to the aetiological relationships between different diagnoses and to the relationships between adult psychiatric disorders and childhood neurodevelopmental conditions.

Frequently used to increase the power of exome-wide association studies. They combine sets of variants within a gene to produce a single burden score that is then tested for association.

Variants that are present in the population at frequencies of 1% or more. They include single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which can be assayed in parallel across the genome in genome-wide association studies.

(CNVs). Variants for which the number of copies of a specific segment of DNA varies in the population. These structural differences between individuals may have arisen as a result of duplications, deletions or other changes.

A fixed, false belief that is not amenable to change despite conflicting evidence.

A mental state that involves low mood and decreased activity.

(rg). An estimate of the average similarity of causal allelic effects on two traits. This usually refers to the genome-wide average, although it can be specified to be locus wide or chromosome wide. A high degree of genetic correlation is usually indicative of pleiotropy.

A perception in the absence of an external stimulus that has a compelling sense of reality.

A less severe form of mania that is not accompanied by marked functional impairments (for example, to occupation or personal relationships).

Genes with near-complete depletion of protein-truncating variants in population studies, suggesting that there is strong direct selection against such variants.

A mental state that involves elevated mood, which can be euphoric or irritable, and increased activity.

Hallucinations or delusions that are not aligned with the person's current mood state.

Describes the phenomenon whereby a variant or gene influences more than one phenotype. The terms ‘direct', ‘horizontal' and ‘biological' pleiotropy imply that the effects on the phenotypes are independent. The terms ‘mediated', ‘vertical' and ‘indirect' pleiotropy imply that the effects on one phenotype are mediated through the other; for example, alleles that influence smoking behaviour are likely to have pleiotropic effects on all traits for which smoking is a risk factor.

(PRS). Summarizes the estimated effect of many genetic variants on an individual's phenotype. It is typically calculated as a weighted sum of trait-associated alleles.

(PTVs). Variants that are predicted to shorten the coding sequence of a gene and which may result in reduced expression of that gene and its protein owing to nonsense-mediated decay. They include nonsense, frameshift and essential splice site variants.

Symptoms, particularly delusions and hallucinations, that involve difficulty in determining what is real from what is not.

(RCVs). Variants in the coding sequence of a gene that are present in less than 1% of the population. They can be detected by genome-wide sequencing studies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Two Men Claiming to Be Trump Appointees Blocked From Entering US Copyright Office","https://www.wired.com/story/us-copyright-office-trump-takeover/","Mon, 12 May 2025 17:52:26 GMT","

Two men claiming to be newly appointed Trump administration officials tried to enter the US Copyright Office in Washington, DC, on Monday, but left before gaining access to the building, sources tell WIRED. Their appearance comes days after the White House fired the director of the copyright office, Shira Perlmutter, who had held the job since 2020. Perlmutter was removed from her post on Saturday, one day after the agency released a report that raised concerns about the legality in certain cases of using copyrighted materials to train artificial intelligence.

A source familiar with the matter tells WIRED that the two men who tried to enter the Copyright Office showed security at the building a document stating that they had been appointed by the White House to new roles within the office. The source identified the men as Brian Nieves, who claimed he was the new deputy librarian, and Paul Perkins, who said he was the new acting director of the Copyright Office, as well as acting register. It is unclear whether the men accurately identified themselves.

There is an official with the name Brian Nieves currently employed as deputy chief of staff at the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, and a Paul Perkins is currently employed as an associate deputy attorney general at the Department of Justice, according to their LinkedIn profiles. The Department of Justice and the White House did not immediately respond to questions from WIRED about whether the two officials had been appointed to work in the Copyright Office.

Sources told WIRED that Capitol Police prevented the men from entering the copyright office, but a spokesperson for the law enforcement agency denied that officers escorted anyone out or denied them entry.

The US Copyright Office is a government agency within the Library of Congress that administers the nation's copyright laws. It processes applications to copyright creative works and maintains a searchable database of existing registrations. Last week, the Trump administration also fired the Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden, who was the first woman and the first Black person to hold the position.

The document the two men cited also stated that deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, who previously served as a personal defense lawyer for Trump, was now the acting Librarian of Congress. The Department of Justice announced Monday that Blanche would be replacing Hayden, who had been in the job for nearly a decade. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Hayden's firing stemmed from “quite concerning things she had done at the Library of Congress in pursuit of DEI.”

The Trump Administration has not commented so far on why Perlmutter was fired. Some lawmakers have speculated that her ouster is connected to the report on copyright and AI that her office had released. “Donald Trump's termination of the Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, is a brazen, unprecedented power grab with no legal basis,” Representative Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the committee that oversees the Library of Congress, said in a statement on Saturday. “It is surely no coincidence he acted less than a day after she refused to rubber-stamp Elon Musk's efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works to train AI models.”

The 108-page report was a “pre-publication” version, which means it wasn't yet finalized. It is not customary for the US Copyright Office to release this type of document, according to copyright lawyer Aaron Moss. The report was highly anticipated in Silicon Valley, as a number of big tech companies are currently embroiled in dozens of court battles over the legality of their approach to training AI tools on copyrighted materials.

In most of these cases, the AI companies are arguing that fair use doctrine makes it legal for them to train on copyrighted materials without permission. The report holds that the fair use doctrine may indeed shield some use cases—but not necessarily all. “Making commercial use of vast troves of copyrighted works to produce expressive content that competes with them in existing markets, especially where this is accomplished through illegal access, goes beyond established fair use boundaries,” it reads.

The New York Times is suing OpenAI for copyright infringement for using its work to train tools like ChatGPT. Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said in a statement that using copyrighted material to generate content that competes with original works “is not fair use.”

Buzzy new EV startup Slate Auto has racked up more than 100,000 reservations for its customizable low-cost electric pickup truck, the company has confirmed to TechCrunch. 

Slate crossed the milestone over the weekend, just a little more than two weeks after coming out of stealth mode and unveiling the truck at an event in Los Angeles, California. The company has said the truck will start below $20,000 after applying the $7,500 federal EV tax credit and plans to build the vehicles at a former printing plant in Warsaw, Indiana, as TechCrunch first reported.

“We are truly humbled by America's response to Slate's brand launch and the launch of our truck,” Slate's chief commercial officer Jeremy Snyder said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We are excited for what the future holds.”

Collecting 100,000 reservations so quickly is one sign of how much interest there has been in Slate since it revealed the truck, but it's no guarantee those reservations will translate to sales. The company is only asking prospective buyers to plop down $50 to reserve their place in line to eventually order the truck; the fee is refundable.

Many other EV startups have touted reservations in the past only to fail to live up to the expectations of such big, round numbers. Fisker filed for bankruptcy having sold just a few thousand Ocean SUVs despite once claiming more than 60,000 reservations. Lordstown Motors, meanwhile, was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for misleading investors about the number of “preorders” for its own electric pickup truck. (Lordstown Motors similarly filed for bankruptcy and ultimately settled with the SEC.)

Slate has big goals for its truck, which — for a currently undisclosed price — can also be transformed into an SUV. The company says it will have capacity to make as many as 150,000 vehicles by the end of 2027 at the Indiana factory. And it has big backers helping Slate try to reach that goal, including Jeff Bezos (through his family office, Bezos Expeditions), Guggenheim Partners CEO Mark Walter, and VC firm General Catalyst.

Saudi Arabia's ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, launched an AI company called Humain to bolster the country's artificial intelligence sector. The company plans to build out the country's AI infrastructure, including the construction of data centers.

This news arrives as Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Mark Zuckerberg are expected to attend a U.S.-Saudi investment forum on Tuesday, where AI will likely take center stage. President Trump is also preparing to visit the country this week as part of a tour of the region.

Humain is funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which manages assets worth around $940 billion and is part of the Crown Prince's ambitions to diversify his country's finances beyond the lucrative oil industry.

American tech giants have looked to the wealthy PIF as a source of capital. Companies like Google and Salesforce have also recently worked with the PIF on AI-related projects and investments.

Google is gearing up to hold its largest developer conference of the year, Google I/O 2025, on May 20 and May 21. CEO Sundar Pichai, DeepMind CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis, and executives in charge of Search, Cloud, and Android will announce major updates to Google's product offerings.

We're expecting Google I/O 2025 to focus on AI a lot (seriously, a lot). 

Google's family of AI models, Gemini, will likely take center stage during Google I/O 2025 as Pichai and Hassabis continue their push for dominance over OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and other well-funded competitors. We're also expecting updates around DeepMind's projects, such as its multimodal AI system Project Astra. At last year's Google I/O, the company teased a pair of smart glasses powered by Project Astra.

A key theme at Google I/O 2025 will be how AI is infiltrating all of Google's products. For example, Google's head of Search, Elizabeth Reid, is giving a talk on the AI stage about how generative AI is “revolutionizing search.” Other Google executives are scheduled to speak at the event about how scientists are using AI, how AI agents will use apps for users, and how Waymo's autonomous vehicles use AI to navigate the physical world.

The Google I/O 2025 keynote kicks off at 10 a.m. PT on May 20 from the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View. You can watch a livestream of Google's keynote here, or watch via the embed below. At 1:30 p.m. PT, the developer keynote begins. As the name suggests, the developer keynote will focus less on the consumer side of things.

Later in the day, at 3:30 p.m. PT, Hassabis will speak with Alex Kantrowitz, host of the Big Technology Podcast, about the future of DeepMind's AI and its impact on the world. At the same time, there will be livestreamed talks about the latest updates to Android, Chrome, and Google Cloud.

Some of the talks at Google I/O won't be livestreamed, but lucky for you, TechCrunch will be on the ground covering the biggest announcements from the event.

This year, Android announcements will come a week ahead of Google I/0 2025 during an event called “The Android Show.” It kicks off on Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT, and you can watch the livestream here.

Nothing quite says 1997 New York City like a brand-new VHS. John Carpenter's 1981 cult classic Escape From New York saw Kurt Russell's Snake Plissken drop into near-future New York City with a mission to save the President. Most of us probably first saw the film on the old school format, which just so happened to be prevalent around the time reality caught up to the movie. Now, almost 30 years later, Escape From New York is coming back to VHS, and it's all sorts of awesome.

This Thursday, May 15, Vice Press is releasing two new VHS versions of Escape From New York. One is a 1,000-piece, limited edition slipcase featuring brand new artwork by Phantom City Creative with a specially designed tape. Then there's a collector's edition featuring the original theatrical poster on one side, and Matt Ferguson's recent work on the other.

And yes, the VHS actually plays. Though, for those of us in the United States, it's unfortunately in the UK's PAL format. So, if you want something new from Snake's world but not the VHS, Vice also has that brand new Phantom City Creative poster dropping on its own. There's both a regular and variant 24 x 36 inch lithograph, each in editions of 250.

Finally, if you love Escape From New York but really are only drawn to that iconic original image by Barry E. Jackson, Vice Press has also worked with Matt Ferguson to fully restore and release that. It's a 27 x 40 lithograph in a limited edition of 250. Here's the iconic image.

All of these go on sale at Vice Press at 2 p.m. ET (that's 6 p.m. GMT) on Thursday, May 15. Both versions of the VHS are £30, and the posters range between £40 and £50.

When a camera whips around from one point to another, most people expect the fast movement to result in a blurry smear. What they don't realize, however, is that our own eyes engage in a similar kind of rapid movement—called saccades—over 100,000 times a day. Unlike video cameras, our brain avoids the nauseating blur—but when things move in a particular way, they become invisible.

As detailed in a study published May 8 in Nature Communications, researchers have revealed that the speed of an individual's saccades corresponds to the limit at which a moving object becomes too fast for them to see. That means people with faster eye movements can perceive faster-moving objects, with potential implications for activities requiring fast eye movements such as sports, video games, and even photography. The researchers claim to be the first to provide evidence for the theory that a person's movement impacts their perception.

“What parts of the physical world we can sense depends fundamentally on how good our sensors are,” Martin Rolfs, lead author of the study and an active vision scientist at Humboldt University of Berlin's Department of Psychology, said in a statement by the research group Science of Intelligence. “In this paper, however, we show that the limits of seeing are not just defined by these biophysical constraints but also by the actions and movements that impose changes on the sensory system.”

Rolfs and his colleagues demonstrated that when a study participant saw visual stimuli moving with the same speed and pattern as their own saccade shifts, the stimuli became invisible. This suggests the brain filters out motion that mimics our own eye movements, which might be why our saccades don't cause visual blurs in the way that cameras do. More broadly, this suggests that physical movement—such as eye movement—limits our sensory system's perception of the world. In other words, our ability to see things in motion is not just dictated by our sensory abilities, such as the strength, or sensitivity, of the photoreceptors in our eyes.

“In simple terms, the properties of a sensory system such as the human visual system are best understood in the context of the kinematics of actions that drive its input (in this case, rapid eye movements),” said Rolfs. Kinematics is the study of object motion without considering the cause of said motion. “Our visual system and motor system are finely tuned to each other, but this has long been ignored,” he continued. “One of the issues is that the people who study motor control are not the same ones who study perception. They attend different conferences, they publish in different journals—but they should be talking!”

It's only a matter of time until helicopter parents start timing their kids' saccades to decide whether they belong in little league or theater.

A failed Venus mission fell from the sky over the weekend after aimlessly orbiting Earth for the past 53 years. Various agencies closely monitored Kosmos 482's reentry, but its exact landing site remains unknown due to conflicting reports.

Kosmos 482 performed an uncontrolled reentry on Saturday, May 10, plunging through Earth's atmosphere around 2:24 a.m. ET, according to Russia's space agency, Roscosmos. The Soviet-era spacecraft was built to withstand the scorching temperatures of Venus, so it's likely that parts of it survived the heat of atmospheric reentry before crashing on Earth. So far, however, there have been no reports of visual observations of Kosmos' descent nor has there been recovery of its debris from the ocean.

Roscosmos said that the Soviet-era spacecraft splashed down in the Indian Ocean west of Jakarta, Indonesia, around 350 miles (560 kilometers) west of Middle Andaman Island. The European Space Agency (ESA) also monitored the probe's descent, placing its reentry time at 2:16 a.m. ET. ESA failed to spot the spacecraft over Germany for an expected pass that was supposed to take place at 3:32 a.m. ET, and therefore stated that the reentry had most likely already occurred. The U.S. Space Force, on the other hand, places the spacecraft's reentry between 1:20 a.m. and 1:44 a.m. ET.

Without a confirmed time of reentry, it is hard to pinpoint where exactly the spacecraft may have ended up on Earth, or whether it burned up in the atmosphere. Keep in mind, this object was moving at roughly 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour), so even a one-second difference can shift the landing zone to a considerable degree.

Kosmos 482 launched on March 31, 1972 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome spaceport in what is now Kazakhstan. The mission was an attempt by the Soviet space program to reach Venus, but it failed to reach enough velocity to enter a transfer trajectory toward the scorching hot planet. A malfunction caused the Kosmos 482 spacecraft to perform an engine burn that failed to reach Venus's orbit, according to NASA. Since then, the spacecraft has been stuck in an elliptical orbit around Earth. Over time, however, atmospheric drag took its toll on Kosmos 482, eventually leading to its predicted plunge through Earth's atmosphere this past week.

After failing to reach Venus, the spacecraft broke apart into four different pieces, with two of the smaller fragments reentering over Ashburton, New Zealand, two days after its launch. The two remaining pieces are a carrier bus and a lander probe, which together form a spherical pressure vessel weighing more than 1,000 pounds (495 kilograms). The spacecraft was also outfitted with a 27-square-foot (2.5-square-meter) parachute to slow it down during its descent toward the Venusian surface. Recent images of Kosmos 482 revealed what may be its parachute flapping around in orbit while attached to the spacecraft, but it is unlikely that it would have done its job during its descent toward Earth.

With Saturday's reentry, the saga of Kosmos 482 finally came to an end, but questions remain about where the spacecraft ended up and what condition it may have landed in. The old Venusian probe may be in one piece at the bottom of the ocean, or its remains may have burned up during its much-delayed descent on the wrong planet.

We've long known follicular lymphoma (FL) as a slow-growing, incurable disease that tends to relapse. For many patients, that has meant cycling through treatments over decades, each remission a little shorter than the last. Historically, treatment has centered on balancing disease control with quality of life: watchful waiting for low-burden cases, immunochemotherapy for high-burden disease, and re-treatment at relapse. This approach has worked, with median overall survival now approaching 20 years. But for years, the paradigm remained largely cyclical: treat, respond, relapse, repeat.

For decades, first-line treatment was relatively straightforward: BR, R-CHOP, or R-CVP, chosen on the basis of age, comorbidities, and risk for transformation. For low-burden disease, clinicians often deferred treatment or opted for single-agent rituximab. BR became the preferred option after the StiL trial demonstrated superior progression-free survival and tolerability over R-CHOP. R-CHOP still retained a role for patients with early signs of histologic transformation. 

Then came R², a chemo-free combination validated by the RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trials. It offered a new option in both frontline and relapsed settings. But for those with early relapse, especially progression of disease within 24 months, the outlook has been frustrating. These are the patients we worry about. CAR T-cell therapy changed that conversation, emerging as a beacon of hope and delivering high complete response (CR) rates and prolonged remissions in ZUMA-5, ELARA, and TRANSCEND FL.

For years, treatment advances mostly reshuffled the sequence of relapse management. Now, however, that entire framework is being called into question.

In recent years — and most notably with data presented at ASH 2024 last December — we've started to see more than incremental progress. We're seeing depth of response rivaling CAR T, durability with time-limited therapy, and multiple studies pointing toward viable chemo-free strategies — not just in relapse, but even in the frontline setting.

Mosunetuzumab, a CD20 x CD3 bispecific antibody, has already made its mark in relapsed/refractory FL. Now, the MITHIC-FL1 trial brings it into the frontline. With an overall response rate (ORR) of 95% and a CR rate of 80%, these results are striking for a single-agent therapy in treatment-naive, high-tumor-burden FL. They challenge what many of us have long accepted: that high-burden FL requires chemo from day 1. Cytokine release syndrome was generally mild and manageable in the outpatient setting. While long-term progression-free survival data are still maturing, the early signal suggests bispecifics could upend the frontline playbook altogether.

In the second-line setting, the inMIND trial evaluated tafasitamab, a CD19-directed monoclonal antibody, combined with R² in relapsed/refractory FL. Tafasitamab-R² achieved a CR rate of 52% vs 41% with R² alone and extended median progression-free survival by 57% (22.4 vs 13.9 months). Of note, toxicity profiles were comparable. This regimen may redefine the standard for relapsed patients, especially those not yet eligible for bispecifics or CAR T, or for use after those therapies. However, whether tafasitamab induces CD19 loss — and potentially affects eligibility for future CAR T — remains an important open question.

Bispecifics aren't just moving up the line; they're doubling down. A separate study combining mosunetuzumab with R² in the relapsed/refractory setting reported an ORR of 96% and a CR rate of 87% — numbers that rival CAR T, without the need for apheresis, bridging therapy, or inpatient admission. The data are early, yes, but the responses are hard to ignore. This could become a second-line, outpatient-friendly option with real staying power. Similarly, the EPCORE NHL-2 trial combining epcoritamab with R² for a fixed 2-year duration showed an ORR of 95% and a CR rate of 73%.

Meanwhile, antibody-drug conjugates are beginning to carve out space in high-risk disease. Loncastuximab tesirine plus rituximab has shown promising metabolic responses in patients with early relapse or adverse-risk features.

The takeaway is becoming increasingly clear: We're in the midst of a shift toward immune-based, chemo-free strategies that are achieving deeper and longer-lasting remissions than many of us thought possible in FL. And with many of these regimens being time-limited, the burden of chronic therapy and ongoing immune suppression may begin to ease.

That said, we're not there yet. Long-term follow-up and real-world validation are essential. Questions around sequencing, re-treatment after bispecifics, and eligibility for subsequent CAR T still need to be sorted out. We're not at a cure — not yet. But for the first time, “functional cure” doesn't feel out of place in the FL conversation.

And that, in itself, marks a quiet revolution in how we talk about, and treat, this disease.

 May 12, 2025  

Anyone who describes themselves professionally as a nurse without the relevant qualifications and registration will be committing a crime under planned government measures.

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it aimed to protect the title ‘nurse' in law and prevent the public from being misled by unqualified individuals.

Currently, only the title ‘registered nurse' is protected by law. Under the proposed changes, only those registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) will be legally allowed to call themselves a nurse.

Anyone who breaches the new law could face prosecution and a fine of several thousand pounds.

Some roles that legitimately include the word ‘nurse' will be exempt. These include veterinary nurse, dental nurse, and nursery nurse.

The announcement followed campaigning by unions and MP Dawn Butler, who introduced a private member's bill in the House of Commons earlier this year to protect the title.

Paul Rees MBE, NMC interim chief executive and registrar, emphasised that it is already an offence to claim to be a registered nurse without proper registration.

However, the current loophole means anyone, including individuals struck off for misconduct or criminal convictions, can still use the general title ‘nurse'.

This has led to several incidents where unregistered individuals provided care or advice under false pretences.

The DHSC cited one case in which a person ran a cosmetic clinic offering Botox and dermal fillers for years without NMC registration. Another involved an individual, struck off by the NMC, who continued to present herself as a nurse and gave a speech at a COVID-19 conspiracy rally, comparing NHS staff to war criminals and spreading vaccine misinformation.

Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said he was appalled by such behaviour.

“This new legislation will help crack down on bogus beauticians and conspiracy theorists masquerading as nurses, and those attempting to mislead patients,” he said.

Registered nurses must complete undergraduate and postgraduate education and undergo revalidation every 3 years.

Duncan Burton, chief nursing officer for England, said: “The trust that people place in registered nurses is based on the rigorous training and education required to be registered as a nurse, which gives us the skills and knowledge to deliver high quality, safe, and personalised care.” 

Dr Crystal Oldman CBE, chief executive of The Queen's Institute of Community Nursing, welcomed the proposal.

“People need confidence that when the person caring for them is described as a nurse, that person really is a qualified and registered nurse,” she said.

Helga Pile, head of health at UNISON, said the new law would help protect patients and the profession's reputation. 

“Charlatans and conspiracy theorists mustn't be allowed to harm patients or damage nurses' reputation and good standing with the public. It's only right that anyone that tries to will now feel the full force of the law.”

Alison Morton, CEO of the Institute of Health Visiting, also backed the move, saying that “the current gap in legislation needs to be closed as a matter of urgency”.

Dr Rob Hicks is a retired NHS doctor. A well-known TV and radio broadcaster, he has written several books and has regularly contributed to national newspapers, magazines, and online. He is based in the UK.

Early in the covid-19 pandemic, the failure of UK government advisers to follow World Health Organization (WHO) advice and emerging evidence from East Asia that suppression could bring the virus under control quickly led to avoidable UK deaths, argues an expert in The BMJ today.

Suppression aims to avoid national lockdowns and maintain economic activity for most of the population by introducing surveillance systems to bring new outbreaks under control quickly, thus reducing the reproductive rate of infection (R0) to below 1 and causing the epidemic to wither.

Anthony Costello, professor of global health at University College London says, had the UK followed a suppression strategy, it might have prevented thousands of deaths. He asks why long term strategies of suppression continue to be under-recognised and calls for better governance of UK pandemic science advice.

In January 2020 the global threat from covid-19 was clear and the WHO was advising countries to focus on rapid suppression to avoid immediate threat from the spread of the new coronavirus, he explains.

Yet while Greece, Germany, Norway, and Ireland took steps to follow these recommendations, the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) unanimously chose a response based on pandemic flu that ignored the different characteristics of coronavirus transmission.

Nor did SAGE change its advice after reports of rapidly falling cases and infection rates in several East Asian countries that had focused on suppression. Instead, in March 2020, the government published its ""contain, delay, research, mitigate"" plan based on influenza that would allow the virus to spread to achieve ""herd immunity.""

SAGE's unwavering decision to recommend a response based on influenza has continued to be defended by its co-chairs, Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser until 2023, notes Costello. Yet their defence is based on three arguably mistaken assumptions: that covid could not have been suppressed, that a huge second wave could follow even if it was, and that suppression required prolonged national lockdowns.

He acknowledges that SAGE faced a difficult and fast changing situation in early 2020 but says its advice to government was ""flawed"" and ""arose from systems failure.""

For instance, SAGE did not recommend rapid expansion of testing, form plans to mobilise community health workers as contact tracers at scale to hotspot areas and across district health protection teams, or advise on key financial and support measures for effective self-isolation, he writes.

""Had the UK followed the same strategy and achieved the same excess cumulative death rate by March 2024 as South Korea, 69 instead of 344 deaths per 100,000, it might have prevented up to 180,000 UK deaths.""

The BMJ asked Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance why they had not recommended a suppression response, given WHO advice and emerging evidence early in the pandemic; about SAGE's lack of independent experts; why they were not more outspoken about health harming policies; and whether they stand by the recommendations they made not to focus on suppression, but had not received a response by the time of publication.

Costello points out that, five years on, many of the people who developed the UK's flawed response are still in post; they have not changed their views on suppression, and little has been done to improve government pandemic advice committees or to introduce detailed governance rules for the UK's future pandemic response and resilience. 

""The covid inquiry and the UK medical establishment should properly critique this public health failure,"" he concludes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","USWNT Rewind: Alyssa Thompson comes up big, Lindsey Heaps and Korbin Albert lift clubs to Première Ligue Final","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/05/uswnt-rewind-alyssa-thompson-lindsey-heaps-korbin-albert-premiere-ligue-final-psg-lyon-angel-city","Mon, 12 May 2025 18:33:01 GMT","

The NWSL season cruised through Week 8 with two draws, several close matches and a big 4-1 win for the Kansas City Current over Bay FC that put the women in teal back on top of the NWSL standings. Alyssa Thompson scored a key goal for Angel City FC while abroad, Korbin Albert and Lindsey Heaps each scored over the weekend in their respective Première Ligue semifinal matches.The two U.S. midfielders will meet in the final on May 16 at Groupama Stadium in Lyon, site of the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.

Angel City (8-2-4, 12 points) earned its second straight win as Alyssa Thompson scored her fourth goal of the 2025 season in the 2-0 victory over the Utah Royals. The Angel City forward is currently tied for fourth in goals in the NWSL with fellow USWNT player pool members Emma Sears and Ashley Hatch, among others.

The game also featured a spectacular goal from two-time FIFA Women's World Cup winner Christen Press netted her first goal of the season in the 66th minute, just a minute after she subbed into the game. Press has played 15 games since returning last year from a knee injury that had kept her sidelined since she suffered an ACL tear in 2022. Thompson later scored in stoppage time (90+5) just before the final whistle blew.

Midfielder Claire Hutton continues to show well for Kansas City Current (6-2-0, 18 points) who are back at the top of the NWSL. The Current beat Bay FC 4-1 on Sunday as Hutton contributed an assist to Brazilian Debinha's goal in the 33rd minute.

Hutton recorded her second assist of 2025 in eight matches so far. She tallied just one in her rookie season in 2024. The 19-year-old defender was fired up after her second USWNT cap and start in April. She said she was eager to take her confidence she gained playing for her country colors into her day-to-day development with the Current.

Paris Saint-Germain (16-2-4, 52 points) and Olympique Lyon (20-0-2, 62 points) advanced to the Première Ligue Final, in part, thanks to USWNT players Korbin Albert and Lindsey Heaps. Crystal Dunn also played the final 30 minutes for PSG to help her side to the final.

Lyon beat Dijon 4-1 in the second year of playoffs in France's top women's division, which qualifies the top four finishers in the league to semifinals, with the winners meeting for the title. Heaps scored the team's second goal just before halftime (45+2). That marked Heaps' 12th score of the Première Ligue season, the most in her European career.

Albert and PSG took down Paris FC 3-0 in the other semifinal. Albert scored on a nifty finish in second-half stoppage time (90+1) to cap the victory. It was Albert's fifth goal of the season, a career-high for the midfielder. She tallied a single goal last season and none in her first professional year.

Both Albert and Dunn's club will face off against Heaps' Lyon in the final May 16 to decide the title.

Naomi Girma and Catarina Macario celebrated the Women's Super League title last week, but in the season finale, they helped complete Chelsea's (19-0-3, 60 points) undefeated season, beating Liverpool 1-0. Girma played 90 minutes while Macario subbed in for the final 18 minutes. It looked like Chelsea was headed for a draw, which still would have kept Chelsea unbeaten on the season, but Aggie Beever-Jones scored the game-winner in stoppage time (90+1).

In other WSL news, Emily Fox and Arsenal (15-4-3, 48 points) beat Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Manchester United (13-4-5, 44 points) 4-3 in the final regular season match for both clubs. Jenna Nighswonger was on the bench for the Gunners. Next, Arsenal will face Barcelona in the UEFA Women's Champions League Final May 24, while Manchester United will battle Chelsea in the FA Cup Final May 18.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT Rewind: Big Performances from Agyemang, Pulisic, White and Zendejas Highlight a Stat-Packed Week","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/05/usmnt-rewind-patrick-agyemang-christian-pulisic-brian-white-mls-ac-milan","Mon, 12 May 2025 18:05:54 GMT","

If you had trouble keeping up with the heroics, goals, assists and shutouts recorded by members of the U.S. Men's National Team pool this past week, there was a good reason - there were plenty of them.

Christian Pulisic pulled off late heroics for AC Milan, while Alejandro Zendejas struck for a brace to boost Club América into the Liga MX Clausura semifinals.

Brian White connected twice off headers to lead the Vancouver Whitecaps to a comeback draw.

Patrick Agyemang scored and assisted on goals in extra time for Charlotte FC in the 2025 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup tournament.

Diego Luna entertained fans with another spectacular goal for Real Salt Lake, while DeJuan Jones, Max Arfsten, Jack McGlynn and Brandon Vazquez also found the net for their MLS teams.

Weston McKennie, Mark McKenzie, Shaq Moore and Brian Gutiérrez assisted on goals.

Johnny Cardoso and Real Betis reached the UEFA Conference league final, and Monaco, with Folarin Balogun, clinched a spot in next season's UEFA Champions League.

What more can we say about Christian Pulisic's amazing season for AC Milan? On Friday, May 9, he put his game into overdrive late in the Serie A encounter to lead the Rossoneri to a 3-1 comeback win at home past Bologna. Trailing 1-0 in the 73rd minute, Pulisic set up Mexican striker Santiago Gimenez for the 73rd-minute equalizer. A deflection then found Pulisic's feet six minutes later. João Félix's shot in the penalty area was blocked, but Pulisic gathered the ball and scored on his first touch for a 2-1 lead.

Pulisic has 17 goals and 12 assists across all competitions this campaign. Milan (17-10-9, 60 points) sits in eighth place and will meet Bologna again in the Coppa Italia final at Stadio Olimpico in Rome on Wednesday, May 14 at 3 p.m. ET.

Alejandro Zendejas struck for a brace to propel Club América to a 2-0 second leg victory over Pachuca and into the Liga MX Clausura semifinals on Saturday, May 10. The teams played to a scoreless draw in the first leg at Pachuca on Wednesday, May 7. The 27-year-old midfielder slotted home a left-footed shot off a rebound past goalkeeper Carlos Moreno in the 16th minute before giving the hosts some breathing room, converting a Kevin Alvarez feed on a shot that hit the post and bounded into the net in the 28th minute. Moreno denied Zendejas' hat-trick quest with a big save in the 80th minute. Zendejas' 11 goals tie his career-high, which he set for Club América during the 2022-23 season.

Club América, the first Liga MX team to reach the semifinals seven consecutive times, will visit Cruz Azul in the first leg on Tuesday, May 13 and will host its rivals on Friday, May 16 in the second leg.

Can anyone stop Brian White these days? His brace helped the Vancouver Whitecaps rally from a two-goal deficit en route to a 2-2 home draw with Los Angeles FC on Sunday, May 11. White started the comeback in the 26th minute, heading Sebastian Berhalter's long free kick off the crossbar and into the net past goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. On his 70th-minute equalizer, second-half substitute Ali Ahmed headed the ball toward the left far post and White headed it home from point-blank range. White is in a four-way tie for the MLS goal-scoring lead with eight goals. He has 11 across all competitions this year.

The Whitecaps (8-1-3, 27), who currently boast MLS' best record, are five points ahead of Minnesota United (6-2-4, 22) in the Western Conference. They're also enjoying an 11-game unbeaten streak (6-0-5) across all competitions.

Patrick Agyemang came off the bench to lift Charlotte FC to a 4-1 extra-time triumph over North Carolina FC in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup on Tuesday, May 6. Agyemang, who replaced Idan Toklomati in the 78th minute, snapped a 1-1 deadlock with a six-yard header past keeper Akira Fitzgerald in the 104th minute, thanks to Djibril Diani's feed. He also assisted on Kerwin Vargas' tally three minutes into injury time to close out the match. Charlotte will visit D.C. United in the Round of 16 on Wednesday, May 21 at 7:30 p.m. ET.

Diego Luna scored for the second week in a row, burying his team-leading seventh goal to help 10-man Real Salt Lake record a 1-1 draw at FC Dallas on Saturday, May 10. Holding the ball at the top of the box, Luna spun around several defenders and drilled a shot into the right side of the net to lift the visitors into the lead in the 24th minute. Luna, who scored in a 2-1 defeat at the Vancouver Whitecaps on May 3, has six goals in his last nine league appearances. RSL (4-7-1, 13) is in 11th place in the MLS Western Conference.

Midfielder Jack McGlynn recorded a goal and an assist for Houston Dynamo last week. He came off the bench in the 63rd minute and connected for an impressive goal in the 99th minute in a 4-1 extra-time triumph over Phoenix Rising in the Round of 32 of the Open Cup on Wednesday, May 7. He curled a long-range shot into the upper left corner past goalkeeper Patrick Rakovsky to break a 1-1 deadlock, off a Brooklyn Raines assist. He also assisted on Fela Awodesu 32nd-minute goal in Houston's 3-1 home loss against the Seattle Sounders on Saturday, May 10. The Dynamo (2-6-4, 10) is in 14th place in the MLS Western Conference, seven points ahead of cellar-dwelling LA Galaxy.

A week after recording his first two assists of the campaign, DeJuan Jones scored his first goal for the San Jose Earthquakes in their 2-0 victory at the Colorado Rapids on Saturday, May 10. Vítor Costa sent a pass from the left side into the middle of the box to a charging Jones, who fired a shot past keeper Zack Steffen two minutes into first-half stoppage time. The Quakes (5-6-1, 16) are in seventh place in the MLS Western Conference.

Make it three consecutive weeks for Max Arfsten getting into the box score for the Columbus Crew. He scored the Crew's first goal of its 2-2 comeback draw at the Philadelphia Union on Saturday, May 10. Mo Farsi dribbled down the right side to start the scoring sequence before he found Dylan Chambost on an overlapping run. Chambost then sent a cross toward the back post that Arfsten banged home from six yards past goalie Andrew Rick. He has three goals and three assists this season for second-place Columbus (7-1-4, 25) in the MLS Eastern Conference.

In his first MLS game at FC Cincinnati since he was transferred from the side in January 2024, Austin FC's Brandon Vazquez did not celebrate his penalty kick goal in a 2-1 loss on Saturday, May 10. Vazquez buried his attempt past keeper and one-time teammate Roman Celentano for his third goal of the season, which tied the game at 1-1 in the 48th minute. Austin FC (5-6-1, 16) is in eighth place in the MLS Western Conference.

Weston McKennie, Mark McKenzie, Shaq Moore and Brian Gutiérrez assisted on goals for their respective teams.

-- Midfielder Weston McKennie set up 10-man Juventus' lone goal of its 1-1 draw at Lazio on Saturday, May 10. He sent in a left-wing cross that French striker Randal Kolo-Muani headed in from point-blank range in the 51st minute, his fourth assist this Serie A campaign.

-- Defender Mark McKenzie assisted on Yann-Alexandre Gboho's tally in the 47th minute in Toulouse's 1-1 home draw with Lens in French Ligue 1 on Saturday, May 10.

-- Only three minutes after kickoff, defender Shaq Moore made his presence felt in FC Dallas' 3-1 victory over AV Alta FC in the Open Cup on Wednesday, May 7. Luciano Acosta, from close range, buried Moore's pass from the right side past goalkeeper Denzil Smith.

-- After coming on in the 53rd minute for Jonathan Bamba, Brian Gutiérrez set up Maren Haile-Selassie's goal in the 71st minute, the Chicago Fire's final score in its 4-0 win over Detroit City in the Open Cup on Wednesday, May 7.

Johnny Cardoso and Real Betis reached their first major European final as the Spanish La Liga team defeated Fiorentina in aggregate goals, 4-3, in the UEFA Conference League semifinals on Thursday, May 8. After recording a 2-1 win in the first leg on the road, Real Betis managed a 2-2 tie in the second leg, on an extra-time goal by Abde Ezzalzouli. Real Betis will meet Chelsea in the May 28 final.

An injury sidelined forward Folarin Balogun from Monaco's 2-0 victory over Lyon on Saturday, May 10, but the team was able to clinch a spot in next year's UEFA Champions League. Balogun, who recently had returned from a dislocated shoulder, scored his first Ligue 1 goal in almost seven months in a 3-1 victory at Saint-Etienne in French Ligue 1 on Saturday, May 3. Monaco (18-8-7, 61) secured third place in French Ligue 1.

Forward Haji Wright and Coventry City went down to a 2-1 home loss to Sunderland in the English Championship League promotion playoffs on Friday, May 9. They will have another opportunity to right themselves in the away leg on Tuesday, May 13.

CAIRO (AP) — Spanish coach José Riveiro was released Monday by South African soccer club Orlando Pirates amid reports he will go to Egypt and join Al Ahly ahead of the Club World Cup in the United States.

Al Ahly plays Lionel Messi's Inter Miami in the opening game of the monthlong FIFA tournament on June 14.

“I want to express my sincere appreciation to Orlando Pirates for allowing me the opportunity to leave before the end of my contract,” Riveiro said in a statement on the club's website.

Al Ahly, the African champion in four of the past five seasons, has been without a full-time coach since Marcel Koller left last month after elimination in the CAF Champions League semifinals by Mamelodi Sundowns.

Orlando Pirates said Riveiro “will be on the bench for the final time” at the team's game on Tuesday.

“Jose approached us a few weeks ago with a request to be released from his contract ahead of schedule, having signed with a new club,” club chairman Irvin Khoza said in a statement on Pirates' website.

Riveiro spent nearly three years at Orlando Pirates and previously coached in Finland.

Al Ahly has not announced talks with the 47-year-old Spaniard which have been reported in Egyptian media.

Al Ahly qualified for the inaugural 32-team Club World Cup by winning the African title in 2021, then again in 2023 and 2024.

After playing Inter Miami at the Miami Dolphins' stadium, Al Ahly has two more Group A games at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, against Palmeiras and Porto.

Xabi Alonso will reportedly take over as Real Madrid's manager for the upcoming Club World Cup. The club and the coach have supposedly agreed to begin the new project immediately. This tournament is vital for Florentino Pérez and his board, given its prestige and the potential €150 million prize. This pushes Real Madrid to place their future in Alonso's hands, foregoing an interim appointment like Solari. Xabi will start now.

The decision to have Alonso manage the team at the Club World Cup in the United States was allegedly made last week. The club essentially left the coach with no choice. Real Madrid feels it's senseless to hire a coach only to leave him at home planning for next season while a less experienced Solari takes charge in such a vital tournament.

The relentless schedule also compels Real Madrid to make this decision, resembling a mid-season change. Ancelotti leaves and Xabi arrives, without any transition. Xabi faces the difficult task of shaping the team while competing. He will also inherit a squad that likely won't be entirely his. This may lead to issues.

Xabi will immediately encounter several challenges. First, the disappointment of not winning any major titles this season. Second, a squad full of injured key players. Third, a team that's physically exhausted. Fourth, players aware their future at the club is uncertain. Fifth, limited preparation time, with most players joining their national teams before the World Cup. Thus, Xabi faces a complex task. He aims to implement a new system with a five-man defense. Whether this change begins in June or waits until the 2025/26 season remains to be seen.

Carlo Ancelotti's long-rumoured takeover of Brazil's national team was made official on Monday, leaving Real Madrid without a manager ahead of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

Ancelotti ends his second stint with Los Blancos on May 26, the date the CBF has confirmed that the Italian will take the reins of the Selecao.

“The CBF is proud to confirm that Carlo Ancelotti will become the next head coach of the Brazilian national football team,” a statement from the CBF read.

“Mr. Ancelotti is a legend of the game as the most successful manager in football history, will officially take charge following the conclusion of the 2024/25 La Liga season, ahead of Brazil's FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign in June. His official start date May 26th, 2025. “

While Brazil's future is set with 13 months to go until the 2026 FIFA World Cup, what about Real Madrid? Who will manage the famed side during next month's FIFA Club World Cup and beyond?

When murmurs of Ancelotti's desire to link up with Brazil started several months ago, a few names were thrown about in media reports as potential replacements.

As time went on, however, one name stood out more than the rest: Xabi Alonso.

The former Real Madrid, Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Spain midfielder has gone on to become a successful manager, leading Bayer Leverkusen to a historic treble last season. The club will also finish second in the Bundesliga this season, cementing Alonso's reputation as a manager that can compete every year, and his playing days at Real Madrid make him an ideal replacemment for Ancelotti.

The 43-year-old is reportedly close to confirming a three-year contract with Los Blancos, with multiple reports on Monday indicating that the deal has already been agreed.

According to those same reports, Alonso would take over the La Liga giants in time for the FIFA Club World Cup.

Carlo Ancelotti has won two Champions League trophies since returning to Real Madrid in 2021

Carlo Ancelotti has agreed to take over as head coach of the Brazil national team.

It is one of the most eye-catching appointments in international football history.

For a team so deeply tied to the nation's 'beautiful game' identity, the decision to bring in a foreign coach - one of Europe's elite - signals a desperation to win and an ambition for the struggling Selecao to turn a corner.

""Ancelotti was the main choice because he has an unrivalled tradition of success, winning in five countries,"" said South American football expert Tim Vickery.

So, with the 2026 World Cup around the corner, can Ancelotti fix Brazil?

Brazil's footballing dominance has fallen away in the last two decades.

Despite lifting two Copa America titles in that time, in 2007 and 2019, their record at the World Cup - the ultimate measure of success - has been disappointing

They have not won the tournament since triumphing for the fifth time in 2002, and their recent exits have been painful signals of decline.

The most dismal came in 2014, when Brazil, hosting the World Cup, were humiliated 7-1 by Germany in the semi-finals.

Belgium got the better of Brazil in a 2018 quarter-final, while 2022 trophy hopes were dashed by defeat to Croatia on penalties in the last eight.

""Every campaign since 2002 has ended as soon as the side has come up against a European team in the knockout stages,"" said Vickery.

""It's become a hoodoo they want to overcome and another reason they've gone with a European coach this time round. They're saying 'if we want to beat them next time round, we need someone who knows them'.""

Ronaldo's eight goals as Brazil win 2002 World Cup

Brazil's current World Cup qualifying campaign has been alarming.

They should qualify comfortably enough, but a dire run, including a humiliating 4-1 defeat to Argentina, has caused a scramble for answers.

Managers have come and gone in recent years amid the clamour for a winning team.

Tite, respected for bringing a sense of order and pride, stepped down as planned after Qatar 2022. The team's most recent coach, Dorival Junior, was sacked following the Argentina collapse.

This has led the Brazilian Football Confederation to deploy a bold plan, one that has been long in their thoughts: Project Ancelotti.

It will officially begin on 26 May, as the 65-year-old Italian ends his stint in Madrid, where Xabi Alonso is expected to be his successor.

Vickery said: ""We were hearing last year that the senior players weren't sold on Dorival Junior, but there will be none of that with Carlo Ancelotti.

""He has instant credibility in the dressing room.""

Flamengo manager Jorge Jesus celebrates winning the Copa Libertadores in 2019

In over a century of international football, Brazil's football federation has largely shied away from trusting foreign managers with its top job.

Only three non-Brazilians have ever led the side, and they coached just seven games in all.

Uruguayan Ramon Platero was the first in 1925 and managed four games, Joreca from Portugal managed two games in 1944, with Argentine Filpo Nunez the last foreign appointment, managing a single game in 1965.

It has been a similar story in Brazil's domestic league, Serie A. The sense had always been that only a Brazilian could truly understand what it means to play football there.

This culture changed soon after Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus, who was linked in recent reports, external as another candidate for the Brazil job, took over in 2019 at Flamengo.

His arrival initially came amid doubts that a pragmatic European system could bring success.

Jesus went on to lead Flamengo to the league title as well as the Copa Libertadores, with the Rio de Janeiro club experiencing one of their most successful seasons ever. His team won 43 of their 57 games before Jesus left in July 2020.

Since then there has been a domestic shift and acceptance of foreign coaching in the country - and this is now translating to the international stage.

""This is an important wall coming down,"" Vickery told BBC Sport.

""Especially as it now seems that Ancelotti wants to do the job from Europe which is going to be very controversial.""

Ancelotti will be the first true European titan at the helm, with a decorated trophy cabinet that includes five Champions League titles and domestic trophy success in Italy, England, France, Spain and Germany.

'You can't have all the success he's had without a genius of a brain'

Carlo Ancelotti has won the Champions League a record five times as a head coach (AC Milan in 2003 and 2007; Real Madrid in 2014, 2022, 2024)

One of Ancelotti's greatest strengths lies in his ability to steady teams without drama. His famously calm demeanour, often typified by little more than a raised eyebrow in the heat of a big moment, has helped some of the world's most powerful dressing rooms find stability.

""Ancelotti was the main choice because he has an unrivalled tradition of success,"" said Vickery.

Although the 2024-25 season at Real Madrid has proved tricky, with his team losing to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final and being knocked out in the Champions League quarter-finals by Arsenal, past achievements count for a lot with Ancelotti.

He cultivated an elite culture and mindset throughout his time in the Spanish capital. For evidence of this we need look no further than Real's stunning run to the 2022 Champions League title under Ancelotti.

Comeback victories from what seemed impossible positions against Chelsea and Manchester City were followed by a 1-0 victory against Liverpool in the final.

That Real team benefited from the coach's tactical expertise but also performed with exceptional emotional composure.

Such a collective temperament could lift a Brazil side who have often fallen short in the face of expectation and pressure.

Critics 'continue to try to cancel me' - Vinicius Jr

Brazilian football has long wrestled between two systems: the flair of a samba style and the pragmatism needed to win at the highest level.

Ancelotti's gift lies in having blended these identities throughout his career.

His AC Milan teams of the early 2000s included such luminaries as Paolo Maldini, Andrea Pirlo and Kaka. They played a controlled, elegant brand of football that was defensively resilient yet could be breathtaking when going forward.

He applied much the same approach during his second stint at Madrid, which began in June 2021.

There was structure without suffocation, allowing Brazilian talents like Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo to express themselves while maintaining discipline.

""Vinicius Jr absolutely loves working with him. He will be delighted with this appointment,"" said Vickery.

""It's not just him though. You could also see a return for Manchester United midfielder Casemiro to shore up their midfield - which has been one of the main positions of concern.""

Carlo Ancelotti has worked with Brazilians including Eder Militao, Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo, Casemiro and Endrick during his time at Real Madrid

Forwards Vinicius and Rodrygo have been crucial to Real and Ancelotti's most recent successes.

Vinicius, in particular, has seen his club career take off. Despite dazzling on domestic duty in Spain, though, his performances for Brazil have often been underwhelming and his record shows a modest six goals from 39 caps.

Critics argue, external he struggles with the different tactical set-ups, but Ancelotti knows how to get the best out of him – simplifying his role, boosting his confidence, and  providing freedom within a structured system.

""Ancelotti will act as a lightning rod for any criticism that side get - which will take the pressure off the players,"" said Vickery.

""There will be some in the coaching fraternity in Brazil who want him to fail, but the people who are least affected are the players.""

Make no mistake: appointing Ancelotti is a seismic move for Brazil, a statement that they are willing to change to regain their place at football's summit.

If Ancelotti can bring his brand of stability to the group, while unleashing players like Vinicius Jr, and perhaps even coaxing one last magical tournament from Neymar, he may just be the man to lead Brazil back to glory.

And in doing so, he may not just fix Brazil; he could redefine what Brazilian football means in the modern era.

Hey there! Between managerial hires and the battle to book a spot in the Premier League, the start of this week is almost just as busy as the weekend that came and went. I'm Pardeep Cattry with the latest.

The second Carlo Ancelotti era at Real Madrid is officially coming to an end.

Ancelotti will leave the club following their final game in La Liga this season on May 25, when they host Real Sociedad, to take the Brazil job he has long been linked to. He officially starts with Brazil on May 26 and will be in charge for their World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Paraguay on June 7 and June 10, respectively, when the national team's final preparations for the 2026 World Cup will begin.

He becomes the latest high-profile manager to leave the club game for a job in charge of a national team in time for the 2026 World Cup, a list that includes the U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino, England's Thomas Tuchel and Germany's Julian Nagelsmann. Ancelotti's hire definitely adds another layer of allure to next year's tournament, but is also a stark reminder of the task ahead for Brazil. The five-time World Cup winners have been somewhat directionless since their quarterfinal exit to Croatia at the 2022 World Cup, so much so that they won just two of their opening six games during the 2026 qualifying campaign and were eliminated in the quarterfinals of last year's Copa America. The new head coach will be tasked with correcting course and finally getting the best of a talented attacking group that is headlined by Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo, who have not excelled for the national team the way they have for Ancelotti's Real Madrid.

As for Real Madrid, Ancelotti leaves a club that he has become synonymous with during two incredibly impressive spells, so much so that he said that ""the honeymoon [period] with Madrid will be until the last day of my life,"" in a press conference on Saturday, the end clearly in sight. He won three of his five UEFA Champions League titles with Real Madrid, becoming the most successful manager in the competition's history, and also collected two La Liga trophies along the way. Ancelotti is expected to be succeeded by Xabi Alonso, the former Real Madrid player who has been a manager on the rise since winning the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen last season, someone Ancelotti described as ""one of the best coaches in the world"" on Saturday.

While Ancelotti embraces a new challenge with Brazil, he leaves a sizable task behind him in Madrid. Los Blancos are poised to end the season without a domestic or continental title for the first time since the 2018-19 campaign, failing to make the most of their new-look Galacticos era headlined by Kylian Mbappe. Though the France international has been a helpful addition, this season offered reminder after reminder that the squad was unbalanced and that improvements in several areas of the pitch are needed. Ancelotti returned to Madrid in 2021 to steady the ship, but a true period of transition awaits now that the Italian manager has confirmed his exit.

The race to claim the final spot in next season's edition of the Premier League continues this week, where the field of teams is trimmed from four to two in the second legs of the Championship's promotion playoff semifinals.

One team essentially has their spot in the playoff final booked – Sheffield United. The Blades host Bristol City on Monday after winning the first leg 3-0 thanks to goals from Harrison Burrows, Andre Brooks and Callum O'Hare, reflecting the wide gap in the table between the sides after Bristol finished 24 points behind them. United are targeting a return to the Premier League after finishing last place in last season's competition, sticking by manager Chris Wilder through it all with the hopes of bouncing back up to England's top flight.

Things will likely be a bit more competitive on Tuesday in Sunderland, who host Coventry City while boasting a 2-1 advantage after the first leg. Wilson Isidor and Eliezer Mayenda scored to give Sunderland a slim lead as the team targets their first Premier League season since the 2016-17 season, when they finished last. The Black Cats have been on a dramatic journey since, immediately getting relegated to League One after another last place finish and spending four seasons in England's third division before returning to the Championship for the 2022-23 campaign. As for the Frank Lampard-led Coventry, they hope to play the Premier League for the first time since the 2000-01 season, bouncing around England's lower divisions for more than two decades since that relegation.

Each team targets a spot in the promotion playoff final on May 24 at London's Wembley Stadium, otherwise known as the sport's richest game. A spot in the Premier League, after all, comes with a prize pot of hundreds of millions – Sheffield United pocketed around $145 million for participating in the top flight despite finishing last place, much more than the roughly $65 million they earned in the Championship this season as a ""first year"" relegated team.

Saturday May 10, 2025: The day Harry Kane was finally able to loft a trophy above his head.

Recent Madrid champion Casper Ruud led 29th seed Matteo Berrettini 7-5, 2-0 on Monday evening in the third round of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia when Berrettini retired due to injury.

In Madrid, Berrettini withdrew from his third-round match against Jack Draper after a set due to an abdominal injury. 

Watch Highlights:

On the antepenultimate point against Ruud, Berrettini showed his quick reaction time and produced a sensational half-volley lob against Ruud. But on the next two points, it was clear that something was not right physically with the 29-year-old. He hit a forehand drop shot into the net on the last point of the match and promptly informed chair umpire Aurelie Tourte that he could not continue.

“I feel so bad for him because this is where he's from, his home Masters 1000,”  said Ruud, who signed the camera 'Sorry Matteo. Feel better!' “I know he hasn't played since 2021 because of other injuries.


“I know he's worked hard to come back and now he gets another setback. I hope it's not a long thing for him. I hope he can fix it soon and have a speedy recover. He's a hell of a player.”

Berrettini was competing in Rome for the first time since 2021 and made a good start by defeating Briton Jacob Fearnley 6-4, 7-6(0) in the second round. The 10-time ATP Tour titlist was competitive with the in-form Ruud, winning 79 per cent of his first-serve points in the opening set according to Infosys ATP Stats to keep things close.

But when Berrettini began to feel a physical issue, he quickly decided to retire. 

Ruud, the No. 7 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, will next play Jaume Munar for a place in the quarter-finals. The Spaniard ousted 22nd seed Sebastian Korda 6-4, 6-2.

Emma Raducanu says she is in a positive headspace with Roland Garros around the corner and does not want to ""hide in a hole somewhere"" after losing comfortably to Coco Gauff at the Italian Open.

Raducanu was comprehensively beaten on Monday as the Gauff advanced to the quarter-finals in Rome in an hour and 20 minutes.

The match was potentially Raducanu's final competitive action before the French Open, which gets under way on May 25.

While the straight-sets loss served a reminder for Raducanu of how much ground there is to make up on the players at the top of the world rankings, she walked away from the encounter focused on the positives, suggesting she could still compete at next week's Internationaux de Strasbourg.

""I would love to just keep improving, keep playing. I think that's a positive for me,"" Raducanu told Sky Sports.

""I don't want to go and hide in a hole somewhere, I want to get back out there, so that's good.

""We'll see how it goes in the next week before the French, if I get into Strasbourg. But, for now, I've played a good 12 days on the trot, so I'm looking forward a day off or so and then getting back to it.""

Raducanu credited her promising showing in Rome to playing with enjoyment, insisting that she was still seeking to ""win the day"" despite the loss to Gauff.

"" It makes it more enjoyable, it makes it more sustainable. It doesn't make the losses feel as bad, because I just know that every day I'm trying to be the best version of myself, I'm trying to win the day and I've kind of gone back to that,"" she said.

""I didn't win on the match court today but I'm going to find a way to win the day still today.

""It was a tough day in the office. I just have to take a lot of positives. I am getting out more, I am enjoying myself and taking it in wherever I go, because it is tough on the road. So, I think just trying to find small pockets of the day, small glimmers, to make it more enjoyable.""

Sky Sports Tennis pundit Tim Henman believed the match was tighter than the final scoreline suggested and that the tournament on the whole has been progressive for Raducanu.

He said: ""When you reflect on the score, it looks very straightforward, but I think there were a couple of really long games, but on each of those occasions it was Gauff who found a way to come through.

""It wasn't the result or performance Raducanu was looking for. She didn't have the opportunities to dictate because Gauff was hitting so aggressively from the back of the court.

""But when you reflect on Raducanu's clay-court season so far, it's been very positive. The clay courts at Roland Garros are the trust, the best, they will suit Emma even more.

""Her game is moving in the right direction, she's up to 42 in the live rankings. A number in the back of my mind is 32 - can she be seeded pre-Wimbledon and get that protection in the early rounds on grass?""

Norwegian tennis star Casper Ruud, offered high praise for Roger Federer, recounting the awe-inspiring experience of playing against the Swiss legend at Roland Garros. Speaking candidly about Federer's playing style, Ruud reflected on the challenge of facing one of the sport's most unpredictable and gifted athletes.

“I've experienced playing against players where it's so tough to predict what's coming,” Ruud said in an interview with Tennis Majors. “And I think the greatest of all was Roger. I was lucky enough to play him once at Roland Garros, and wow, I had no idea what was coming off his racket.”

Ruud, known for his clay-court prowess and disciplined baseline game, described Federer's uncanny ability to vary his shots in ways that left even top-tier opponents guessing. “He could suddenly hit a loopy one and then, like, knife a short slice or rip a fast one on the rise,” Ruud continued. “It was impossible to anticipate.”

Despite the temptation to emulate Federer's style, Ruud acknowledged the near-impossibility of replicating such genius. “I'm not going to try to play like Roger, because that's too difficult for me,” he admitted. Instead, the Madrid Open champion is looking to add a bit of Rafael Nadal's grind into his game.

“Ultimately, on clay, the way Rafa beats his opponents is by making them suffer, grinding them down to the backhand,” said Ruud. “In the end, you get so tired of doing it that you almost give up. I'm nowhere near Rafa — not trying to compare myself — but that's not exactly a secret recipe. That's how many clay matches are won,” he added.

Ruud's comments not only highlight Federer's enduring influence on the current generation of players but also magnify the Swiss maestro's rare combination of elegance, variety, and tactical brilliance that made him one of the most formidable and admired figures in tennis history.

ROME — Bianca Andreescu's run at the Italian Open tennis tournament came to an end Monday with a 7-5, 6-1 loss to Qinwen Zhang in the fourth round.

Andreescu, from Mississauga, Ont., looked poised to continue her impressive run at the WTA 1000 clay-court event as she served for the win in the first set.

But Zheng, the eighth seed from China, saved set point before completing her fourth break of the set, then closed out on serve.

That momentum carried over as Zhang scored two more breaks in a dominant second set.

Zhang overcame eight double-faults and a 47.1-per-cent accuracy on first serve to win in 93 minutes.

Despite the loss, the tournament was a success for the 24-year-old Andreescu, who returned to action earlier this year after nearly six months off to focus on her health.

The former world No. 4 and 2019 U.S. Open champion posted wins over 20th-seed Dora Vekic and 11th-seed Elena Rybakina in Rome and is projected to jump 21 points to No. 100 in the WTA rankings.

Also Monday, the top-seeded women's doubles team of Ottawa's Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe of New Zealand advanced to the quarterfinals with a walkover against Peyton Stearns of the United States and Australia's Daria Kasatkina.

Stearns and Kasatkina withdrew after Stearns posted a 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (4) win over Naomi Osaka in singles action earlier Monday. The win took two hours 41 minutes to complete.

Dabrowski and Routliffe will next face the winner of Tuesday's match between sixth-seeded Russians Diana Shnaider and Mirra Andreeva versus Taiwan's Chan Hao-ching and Mexico's Giuliana Olmos.

American tennis player Peyton Stearns earned a huge win on Monday at the Italian Open - but it came at a price as she became sick after the match.

Stearns outlasted Naomi Osaka 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(4) in a two hour, 42-minute marathon of a contest in sunny Rome.

But after securing the win to reach the quarterfinal round of the tournament, Stearns immediately vomited on the side of the court.

The 23-year-old, who had been seen cramping towards the end of the match, also threw up before the third set tiebreak.

'I think in the tiebreak I was just trying not to throw up in the middle of the court,' she said afterwards in an on-court interview.

'I wasn't feeling the best. But I dug so deep. I don't think I've dug that deep in a while.'

Stearns then withdrew from her scheduled doubles match alongside Russian-Australian Daria Kasatkina, citing gastrointestinal illness.

That illness seems to be an ongoing issue for the American, as she also referenced it in February.

'Highly don't recommend having a GI illness & playing 2 matches in a day… not a good combo,' she wrote, along with a photo of her laying on the ground.

However, she appears to be in good spirits following her win on Monday, as she actually posted the video of her vomiting, along with a dog emoji and brick emoji.

Monday's loss will be tough to swallow for Osaka, who led 4-2 in the tiebreak before ultimately dropping the match.

Stearns, meanwhile, has now made a WTA 1000 quarterfinal for the second time.

She will face either Danielle Collins or Elina Svitolina in her next match.

The 23-year-old Stearns, the world No. 42, has wasted little time making her mark in tennis after winning a college national championship at Texas.

Since turning pro in 2022, Stearns has compiled a 9-8 record at Grand Slams, including a career-best run to the US Open fourth round in 2023.

Stearns made it to the third round of the French Open and US Open last year.

Aside from beating four-time Grand Slam champ Osaka, Stearns also earned an impressive victory a round earlier when she took down world no. 6 and fellow American Madison Keys.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"

Emma Raducanu and Coco Gauff will clash for just the second time in their careers for a spot in the Italian Open quarter-finals TODAY.

Brit Raducanu appeared surprised when told the American would be her last-16 opponent after seeing off Veronika Kudermetova.

The 22-year-old came from behind to beat the Russian 5-7, 6-0, 6-1 and set up a meeting with her fellow former US Open champion.

It is only the second time that two of the most high-profile young female tennis stars have gone head-to-head on the WTA Tour.

Gauff won their first encounter in straight sets 6-3, 7-6, in the second round of the 2023 Australian Open.

The 21-year-old followed in Raducanu's footsteps months later by winning her first Grand Slam as a teenager at the US Open - two years on from the latter's achievement at the same event.

However, the pair have had contrasting fortunes on the court since their career-best win, with Gauff currently the world No3 rank.

Meanwhile, Raducanu has struggled for fitness and form and sits just inside the top 50 while also having less experience on clay.

The last 16 showdown of the 2025 Italian Open will take place on Monday, May 12.

The match will be held on clay at the Grand Stand Arena in Rome.

It is scheduled third for Monday's action and has an estimated start time of 2pm UK time.

In the United States, it is expected to get underway at around 9am ET, 6am PT and 8am CT.

The tournament is being shown on Sky Sports in the UK.

Sky Go customers will be able to watch the action via their laptops or mobile devices. Alternatively, fans can purchase a NOW TV pass.

talkSPORT will have updates throughout, while talkSPORT.com will be on hand for the best of the reaction.

Gauff vs Raducanu will follow two matches in the men's singles.

Alex de Minaur first faces Hugo Dellien, before Miami champion Jakub Mensik battles Fabian Marozsan.

Raducanu is now just two wins away from reclaiming the mantle of British no.1.

Reaching the semi-finals would see the Canadian-born superstar leapfrog world no.40 Katie Boulter in the WTA rankings.

It would be the first time she has been the top-ranked female British player in two years.

However, her road to redemption is blocked by fourth seed Gauff, who had earlier beaten Magda Linette 7-5, 6-3.

“I haven't looked at the draw to be honest, but she's a great competitor. Are you sure I'm playing Coco?” Raducanu said when being interviewed by Sky Sports after beating Kudermetova.

“I think I'm playing pretty good tennis right now, and she is going to be a great test,” Raducanu added.

“I mean, she's made the final of the French Open, so she's great on this surface. 

“I'm just going to keep focused, but I'll savour this one for now.”

Fresh off a first Masters title, Mensik reached back-to-back fourth rounds in Madrid and Rome.ByDavid KanePublished May 12, 2025 copy_link

ROME, Italy—Just over a month removed from his first Masters 1000 title at the Miami Open, not much has changed for Jakub Mensik.On the court, anyway.“The media and fan attention, the crowds, that's all different,” the 19-year-old told me in his at-times brooding monotone.“I'm quite enjoying it,” he added, somewhat inexplicably. “It's super that I can be an inspiration for the others. On the court for me, I'm just locked in…For me, it's just another tournament, another day at the office.”

The Internazionali BNL d'Italia, then, is not only an opportunity for Mensik to prove that his Miami title was indeed “the first of many,” but also that his game can be just as effective on clay.True to form, the disarmingly confident Mensik has few concerns about either.“I'm from Czech Republic,” the Prostejov-born Mensik reminded me. “I've been playing my whole life on the clay courts. When I was a kid, I was practicing seven-eight months during the year on clay. Clay is in my blood.“The last few years, I didn't play too many clay-court tournaments, but for me, the transition is quite simple. I just need a couple of practices and then I'm feeling pretty confident. My game is big and I'm pretty happy that even on hard courts and clay courts, I'm getting the wins.”

His first Masters 1000 after Miami saw him become only the fifth teen to reach a Mutua Madrid Open quarterfinal, matching a pace set by the likes of Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. He was a tiebreaker away from the semifinals before Francisco Cerundolo roared back in three sets.Though he's yet to drop a set at the Foro Italico, Mensik had to draw on fast-rising levels of experience to solve Fabian Marozsan—and fend off a feisty crowd—in two close sets on Monday.“I was struggling to find myself on the court,” said Mensik, prone to the occasionally poetic turn of phrase. “When you are not feeling comfortable on the court, it's not that you're finding excuses, but you're just not calm.“In Madrid, the crowd was against me but I was feeling pretty well on the court, so I didn't pay much attention. Here, I was trying to calm myself down when I wasn't feeling in rhythm, and the crowd was not helping.”

Here, I was trying to calm myself down when I wasn't feeling in rhythm, and the crowd was not helping.”

The No. 20 seed shook off the frustration of having blown a 5-3 lead to restore order in a tiebreaker against Marozsan who, as Mensik made sure to mention, had beaten Joao Fonseca and Andrey Rublev earlier in the week.“Today, I worked on my mental side a lot, so I'm glad that even when there were a couple of fans that were doing unfair play, I stayed focused,” he said. “I had the opportunity to tell them something, to call them out, and that can sometimes help me to find my best game.”The 6'4” Mensik was sitting forward in his seat but was almost making himself smaller, arms in his lap and looking down as he gave thoughtful but dense answers to ostensibly straightforward questions. His smile returned once the interview was over and it was then that I wondered if, like on the court, he was still finding himself off it.“I know that it's the biggest achievement of my career,” he said of his Miami win, “but I'm trying to improve every tournament, every week, every match.”Much as Mensik insists things are still the same, he will likely look back on these months as the most formative of his career. And with each rep, he looks more and more ready for the even bigger changes to come.

The mockumentary from Greg Daniels and Michael Koman will premiere in September.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	The next series in the Office world officially has a title — and a premiere date. 


	The show, in which the documentary crew from The Office lands on a new subject, is called The Paper. It follows the publisher (Domhnall Gleeson) and staff of a historic but struggling newspaper in Toledo, Ohio. 




	The series, from former Office showrunner Greg Daniels and Michael Koman, is set to premiere in September. Peacock also released the first image from the series, which also shows Oscar Nuñez, who will reprise his role as Oscar Martinez from the earlier series.

	Nuñez, Gleeson and co-star Sabrina Impacciatore appeared on stage Monday at NBCUniversal's upfront presentation to advertisers, and Nuñez related that he talked with Daniels that post-The Office, he imagined Oscar moving to a more cosmopolitan environment.


	“Greg heard me and moved Oscar to Toledo, Ohio, which has three times the population of Scranton,” Nuñez said. “So it's nice to be heard.”


	Daniels told The Hollywood Reporter during an interview for an Office oral history that The Paper will employ much of the same crew that worked on the former series and that he's excited to work on another mockumentary.


	“It's about this struggling Midwestern newspaper that's much reduced from its glory days. A lot of the story lines are about how this guy, Domhnall Gleeson's character, is trying to restore this paper, and he just doesn't have the budget for hiring reporters, and he has to use all the staff that work there on a volunteer basis to be reporters. They're completely untrained and don't know what they're doing,” Daniels said. “It's a fruitful premise. There's a tremendous history for local papers. The villain here is the internet and the ability to look at everybody's news for free, and all the ad revenue going to Google.”


The Paper also stars  Chelsea Frei, Melvin Gregg, Gbemisola Ikumelo, Alex Edelman, Ramona Young and Tim Key. Duane Shepard Sr., Allan Havey, Nate Jackson, Mo Welch, Nancy Lenehan, Molly Ephraim and Tracy Letts will have guest roles. Ikumelo, Edelman, Rahill and Welch are also writers on the series.


	Universal Television produces the series. Daniels and Koman (Nathan for You) executive produce with The Office creators Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, Howard Klein, Ben Silverman and Banijay Americas.

The tech giant says that Prime Video's main offering has added 15 million customers since its last update.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Amazon says that Prime Video continues to reach new users in the U.S., as it prepares to roll out new ad tech in connection to its 2025 upfront presentation later today.


	The tech giant said Monday that the ad tier of Prime Video now reaches more than 130 million U.S. customers, that is up from 115 million, a number which it revealed last year. The 130 million figure is not the same as a subscriber number (Amazon last revealed Prime subscriber numbers in 2021, when it tallied up over 200 million worldwide), but it gives a sense of reach and scale for its streaming platform.

	The company also says that 88 percent of Prime Video viewers have also shopped on Amazon, a stat meant to underscore the direct relationship between watching and buying on the platform.

	Prime Video entered the advertising business in a major way last year, flipping on ads for all of its U.S. users (subscribers could also opt out of ads for a small monthly fee), giving it instant scale. The move worked, with ads revenue surging, but it also shook up the entire ad market, flooding it with inventory and sparking grumbles from other streaming players that suddenly had a lot more competition than anticipated. 


	The company has since been rolling out its ad tier to other markets.


	At its initial upfront, the company wowed buyers with a star-studded event, meant to underscore that it meant business. Ahead of the 2025 installment, the company says that it will roll out new artificial intelligence-powered ad tech that its customers will be able to use meant to drive sales of products, both on Amazon and outside of the shopping giant's walls.


	Those products will include AI-generated contextual ad messaging which “auto-generates hyper-relevant ad copy to make ads feel like natural extensions of what viewers are watching”; shoppable ads that incorporate pricing, reviews and Prime shipping info from Amazon, letting users buy the product without ever leaving the content stream; and an expanded suite of interactive formats meant to drive sales off of Amazon, including calls to action like “subscribe now” or “book an appointment,” with info sent to users phones.


	“Our ad formats are proven to drive measurable action on and off Amazon,” said Alan Moss, VP of global ads sales for Amazon Ads. “Starting this year, we are introducing a contextual advertising experience that dynamically aligns the ad message with the content viewers are watching –  creating a natural and relevant connection. Based on Amazon's signals and fully addressable and authenticated audiences, we are uniquely positioned to offer viewers scene-aware ads as extensions of the entertainment experience, not interruptions.”

Cold brew from a Red Hot Chili Pepper.


													By
												

	Dave Brooks



Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis is launching his own coffee brand, and he's turning to Live Nation for help getting it in front of coffee drinkers.


	Today, Kiedis and longtime friend Shane Powers are debuting their coffee in a can consumer brand JOLENE along with a marketing campaign, which a press release says is “built to move with the rhythm of live entertainment and meet the ambition of those living life to the fullest.”

	Kiedis and Powers have partnered with Live Nation as both an investor and distribution partner for JOLENE. The global concert promoter will carry the coffee brand at its festivals and 40 amphitheaters owned or operated by Live Nation, including the Gorge Amphitheater in Washington, Northwell at Jones Beach Theater in New York and Allianz Amphitheater at Riverfront in Richmond, Virginia.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Live Nation is an equity investor in JOLENE as is consumer spirits company Global Brand Equities and h.wood Group founder John Terzian. The agreement is similar to one Live Nation struck with water company Liquid Death in 2021 and its celebrity ownership group that included Wiz Khalifa, Machine Gun Kelly, Steve Aoki and Tony Hawk. That agreement had Live Nation selling Liquid Death at its 120 owned-and-operated venues as part of a larger sustainability effort to phase out the sale of single-use plastics at all owned and operated venues and events. 


	JOLENE comes in two flavors: Black (cold brew) and White (oat milk latte) and will be used to make four signature cocktails at Live Nation-owned venues. According to a press release, JOLENE is sourced through an all-female co-op in Peru, “ensuring high-quality beans while directly supporting the women growers and their communities,” the release reads. The product is also available for purchase online at retailers in Los Angeles and New York.


	The origin of the coffee goes back several years, according to Kiedis. “Shane shouted at me down the sidewalk ‘Let's do something!' I shouted back ‘how 'bout coffee'? He said ‘done.' And so began the adventure of putting a high-quality spin on a can of coffee.”


	The name JOLENE is a spin on the phrase “cup of Joe” and the common descriptor “skinny latte” or “lean latte” referring to a latte without whole milk, as well as a reference to the hit country music song “Jolene” by Dolly Parton.


Russell Wallach, Live Nation's global president of Media & Sponsorship added “Fans want options that fit the pace and energy of live music,” noting, “Cold brew has come up again and again, and JOLENE delivers — it's high quality, easy to enjoy, and adds something new to the fan experience. It's one more way we're evolving to meet what fans are asking for.”

	Written and directed by Australian filmmaker Zak Hilditch (1922), the film hasn't been dated but is expected to be released next year.


	The story unfolds after a catastrophic American military experiment results in mass casualties across Tasmania, as Ava (Ridley) joins a body retrieval unit to help identify the dead and search for her husband on the southern part of the island. As Ava makes her way south, across the ravaged landscape, she soon learns that some of the victims of the disaster are coming back to life.

We Bury the Dead is a Penguin Empire production in partnership with Campfire Studios. Major production investment came from Screen Australia in association with Screenwest, Lotterywest and the WA Regional Screen Fund, with production financing provided by Peachtree Media Partners.


	The film was produced by Kelvin Munro, Grant Sputore, Ross M. Dinerstein, Joshua Harris, and Mark Fasano. Exec producers included Nathan Klingher, Ford Corbett, D.J. Jiang, Nicholas Erickson, Sean Fannan, Ari Novak, Lee Broda, Ari Harrison, and Jeff Harrison.

EXCLUSIVE: David Leitch's next movie How To Rob a Bank isn't done adding top-tier talent, with sources telling Deadline that Zoë Kravitz is set to star in the Amazon MGM Studios film. The deal reunites Kravitz with her Mad Max: Fury Road co-star Nicholas Hoult, who is also on board to star. Anna Sawai, Pete Davidson and Rhenzy Feliz are also on board.


	The film, which Leitch is directing, will be released in theaters September 4, 2026.

	Plot details are being kept under wraps, but given Leitch's track record of delivering on big thrills and fun set pieces in films like Bullet Train, Deadpool 2 and most recently The Fall Guy, expect something similar in scope.

	











	87North's Kelly McCormick and Leitch will produce alongside Imagine's Brian Grazer, Jeb Brody and Allan Mandelbaum. Mark Bianculli (Hunters, upcoming Cliffhanger reboot) wrote the script and will executive produce. 


	Besides Hoult, this also marks a reunion between Kravitz and Amazon MGM, where she helmed Blink Twice, which marked her directorial debut. The film earned strong reviews and put Kravitz on the map as a director.


	Kravitz can be seen next opposite Austin Butler in the Darren Aronofsky thriller Caught Stealing, which bows this fall. She is repped by CAA and Untitled Entertainment.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: True-crime thriller Golden State Killer (previously known as The Policeman), starring Vincent Gallo and James Franco, is on sale this week at the Cannes market with Lionsgate.


	The film has secured a domestic distribution release via Lionsgate's longtime genre partner Grindstone.


	Written and directed by Vito Brown, the movie has Gallo playing Golden State killer Joseph James DeAngelo, the serial murderer and rapist who began terrorizing California residents all the way back in the 1970s, only being brought to justice in 2018. Franco plays a detective who faces the impossible task of finding the serial killer at the height of his crime spree before he can claim his next victims.

	Producers are Scott Clayton, Jordan Gertner, Barry Brooker, Todd Williams, and Gary A. Hirsch. Gertner was previously aboard as writer-director but that's no longer the case, we understand.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The project, which is currently in post-production, hit some turbulence last year when it was scrutinized by SAG-AFTRA over misconduct complaints against Gallo by multiple female actors. The complaints spotlighted sexual comments allegedly made by Gallo in the audition process, which took place in November 2023. 


	Actor, filmmaker and musician Gallo, a Venice Best Actor winner, is known for subversive and provocative works including The Brown Bunny.


127 Hours, Spring Breakers and Pineapple Express star Franco has a spate of independent projects in production or post including Bunny-Man and Alina of Cuba: La Hija Rebelde. He hasn't appeared in a studio movie since the 2021 settlement of a legal case brought against him by former students who accused him of sexual misconduct.

Tom Cruise, the daredevil king of Hollywood, pulled off a jaw-dropping stunt on May 11, 2025, standing atop the BFI IMAX in London to promote his latest blockbuster, “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.” 

The 62-year-old star, known for doing his own stunts, turned heads and sparked a social media frenzy as he waved to fans from the UK's largest cinema screen's roof, hyping the eighth “Mission: Impossible” film, set to hit theaters May 23. With the building wrapped in a massive ad for the movie, Cruise's high-flying antics proved he's still Ethan Hunt at heart. Here's how this wild moment unfolded and how it can help the ticket sales for the upcoming movie.

A post shared by SCREEN THRILL| Movies & TV (@screenthrill)

On a sunny Sunday afternoon, Londoners near Waterloo Station did a double-take as Cruise appeared on the BFI IMAX roof, dressed in a sharp suit, waving to onlookers below, People reported. The 65-foot-tall, 85-foot-wide screen was the perfect backdrop, plastered with “The Final Reckoning” promo art. Sources confirmed to Deadline it was indeed Cruise, though how he scaled the roof remains a mystery, likely a nod to his “Mission: Impossible” climbing feats, like the Burj Khalifa in “Ghost Protocol.” 

X went wild, with one user posting, “Tom Cruise on the BFI IMAX roof? This man IS cinema!” The stunt tied into his BFI Fellowship honor, awarded the next day for his contributions to film, including shooting multiple “Mission: Impossible” movies in the UK.

Cruise's rooftop appearance was no random flex, it was a calculated move to drum up excitement for “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,” the direct sequel to 2023's “Dead Reckoning Part One.”

 Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the film sees Ethan Hunt and his IMF team: Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg prepare to face a rogue AI called the Entity, housed in a sunken Russian submarine, per Rotten Tomatoes. 

Filmed in IMAX for maximum impact, it features Cruise's most daring stunts yet, like hanging off an upside-down biplane, as seen in CinemaCon footage. The BFI IMAX is screening the entire “Mission” series and other hits like “Top Gun: Maverick” throughout May, culminating in a special preview of “The Final Reckoning” with live red-carpet footage from its London premiere.

The rooftop moment doubled as a celebration of Cruise's BFI Fellowship, recognizing his 40-year career and UK film industry impact, from “Eyes Wide Shut” to “Mission: Impossible – Fallout.” Hours before, he'd given a career Q&A at BFI Southbank and introduced a fan-voted screening of “Fallout” at the IMAX, Deadline noted. 

The stunt also echoed his “Mission” ethos: real stunts, no CGI. As he told CBR, IMAX “invests you in that world. This is cinema.” With the Cannes Film Festival premiere looming on May 14, Cruise's London antics set the stage for a global rollout.

Cruise's BFI IMAX stunt wasn't just a flex, it was a love letter to fans and the theatrical experience he's championed for decades. As “The Final Reckoning” nears, rumored to be Ethan Hunt's last mission, the film promises a “teeth-clenching, white-knuckle ride,” per BFI. 

With a cast including Angela Bassett and Nick Offerman, and McQuarrie's knack for jaw-dropping action, the film's poised to be a 2025 highlight. Catch Cruise's legacy on the big screen at BFI IMAX all month, and brace for “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” to be the perfect send off for the series that has been around almost 30 years.

Have you ever been told you're just “Too Much,” especially from an ex? Well, leave it to the “voice of a generation” Lena Dunham to capture that feeling all too well with her aptly titled Netflix rom-com series.

Megan Stalter leads “Too Much” as a Dunham-esque character. The “Hacks” breakout star plays Jessica, who relocates from New York to London while reeling from a breakup. Despite planning on being alone forever, Jessica soon meets Felix (“The White Lotus” star Will Sharpe), who challenges her to reevaluate her thirty-something crisis.

 










Dunham co-created the series with her real-life husband, Luis Felber, who also serves as an executive producer and provides original music. The 10-episode show was announced in 2023. Dunham is the creator, writer, director and executive producer.

The official synopsis of “Too Much” reads: Jessica (Stalter) is “a New York workaholic in her mid-30s, reeling from a broken relationship that she thought would last forever and slowly isolating everyone she knows. When every block in New York tells a story of her own bad behavior, the only solution is to take a job in London, where she plans to live a life of solitude like a Brontë sister. But when she meets Felix (Will Sharpe) — a walking series of red flags — she finds that their unusual connection is impossible to ignore, even as it creates more problems than it solves. Now they have to ask themselves: do Americans and Brits actually speak the same language?”

“Girls” alums Rita Wilson and Andrew Rannells also star, along with Andrew Scott, Emily Ratajkowski, Naomi Watts, Stephen Fry, Michael Zegan, Janicza Bravo, Richard E. Grant, Leo Reich, Daisy Bevan, Adele Exarchopoulos, Dean-Charles Chapman, Prasanna Puwanarajah, Rhea Perlman, Kaori Momoi, and Adwoa Aboah.

“This is a show that is very close to my heart — created with my husband Luis, cast with my favourite actors — the geniuses that are Meg and Will, along with a bevy of friends — and partnering again with Working Title, who are behind the romantic comedies that formed me,” Dunham said in a press statement. “Netflix has been so deeply supportive of the vision, which is to create a romantic comedy that makes us root for love, brings joy but also has the jagged edges of life.”

 










Dunham later said during a Next on Netflix event that the lead characters, Jessica and Felix, were inspired by her own life. Dunham added of lead actress Stalter, “What I love about Meg is she has this warmth and openness and this sort of Midwestern charm that just makes her inherently likable. And even when she's, you know, acting naughty or hysterical or making well-meaning mistakes, you are still on her side. And that's what we needed for this role.”

Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Michael Cohen, Surian Fletcher-Jones, and Bruce Eric Kaplan executive produce “Too Much.” Camilla Bray produces. The series comes from Dunham's Good Thing Going banner and Universal International Studios' Working Title Television. Dunham also has a college-centric spy series in the works at Netflix, with which Good Thing Going has an ongoing partnership.

Dunham will next direct a feature about the rise and fall of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Dunham will adapt the screenplay from Michael Lewis' New York Times-bestselling book, “Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon.” The Apple Original film comes in partnership with A24.

“Too Much” start streaming on Netflix onThursday, July 10. Check out first look images below.

Palme d'Or-winning auteur Cristian Mungiu is making his English-language film debut with Neon. Mungiu's upcoming family drama “Fjord” starring Sebastian Stan and Renate Reinsve has landed at the powerhouse indie distributor ahead of Cannes.

“Fjord” follows the Gheorghiu family, comprised of a Romanian father (Stan) and a Norwegian mother (Reinsve), as they settle into new life in a remote Norwegian village, where the mother was born. The film's official synopsis reads: “They quickly bond with the Halbergs, who live in the neighboring house near the bay and despite their very different upbringings, the children of both families soon become close friends. When the Gheorghius are suspected of disturbing behavior, their lives are thrown into chaos as they become the center of small town scrutiny.”

Stan and Reinsve previously starred in Aaron Schimberg's “A Different Man” together; this is their second feature playing a couple onscreen. Production for “Fjord” has wrapped in Norway.

Goodfellas is handling worldwide sales on the film with Neon acquiring rights for the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, and New Zealand. Neon will release the film theatrically in the U.S. nationwide. The deal was negotiated by Sarah Colvin for Neon and Eva Diederix for Goodfellas. 

“Fjord” is a truly international feature, and is billed as being a Norway-Sweden-Denmark-Finland-France-Romania coproduction. The film is produced by Mobra Films, Eye-Eye Pictures, Why Not Productions and Goodfellas, alongside Snowglobe, Aamu Film Company, Garage Film, FilmGate Films and Film i Vast (supported by Eurimages and Creative Europe MEDIA). 

“4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days” director Mungiu already has one Palme d'Or to his name, and he's joining forces with a shingle with some big Cannes wins under its belt. The distributor has distributed the last five Palme d'Or winners out of Cannes, including Sean Baker's Best Picture winner “Anora” in 2024. 

This year, the studio will debut Joachim Trier's “Sentimental Value” also starring Reinsve, and Julia Ducournau's “Alpha.” Their other titles inclue Raoul Peck's “Orwell: 2+2=5” and Michael Angelo Covino's “Splitsville,” starring Dakota Johnson and Adria Arjona which Neon also produced.

Stan previously told IndieWire that working with Mungiu was an incredible experience in his filmography. “With all of these smaller indies, I always feel even while I'm on the plane going there, I'm always worried, ‘Is the financing going to come through?' It's on its way,” Stan said. “He's been up there with me for a few years with filmmakers from Romania where I've been calling him trying to find a way to work with him, where I can speak Romanian as well. We finally found this story, which is about a Romanian family who's moved to Norway and then ends up in this very complicated trial. There's a system [that] investigates cases if there's ever been physical abuse in the household between the parents or the kids. They go investigating the family for an incident, and it leads to this trial. It happened before the pandemic, and it became national news. There were a lot of religious communities that came to their side, and it's really interesting and quite complicated.”

Joe Wright‘s buzzy eight-part drama series “Mussolini: Son of the Century” has finally found a home, as MUBI will be distributing the show on its streaming service later this year. The global distributor and production company has acquired the North American rights for the series, which premiered at the 81st Venice Film Festival; MUBI will also handle the release of the series in Latin America, Belgium, Luxembourg, Turkey, India, and New Zealand in a multi-territory deal with Fremantle.

“Mussolini: Son of the Century” was adapted from Antonio Scurati's bestselling trilogy of the same name, and charts the rise of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini as he served as Prime Minister of Italy from 1922 to 1943. Luca Marinelli portrays the infamous ruler.

“Pride & Prejudice,” “Darkest Hour,” and “Cyrano” director Wright makes his return to TV more than 20 years after helming 2003 BBC One series “Charles II: The Power and the Passion.” Writers Stefano Bises and Davide Serino adapted “Mussolini: Son of the Century,” which is billed as a “scathing contemporary portrait of Mussolini and his political rise, from the formation of the irregular militia of the Fasces of Combat to the imposition of the most ferocious dictatorships Italy has ever known.”

“This series was a chance to explore how charisma and chaos can coexist in a single man — and how that dangerous combination can reshape a nation,” Wright said in a press statement. “Luca Marinelli brings Mussolini's volatility and magnetism to terrifying life. It was a privilege to work with such an extraordinary team on a story that feels both historical and disturbingly timeless. MUBI is the perfect home for the series — a platform that embraces daring, intelligent storytelling and treats its audience as collaborators in the experience.”

Efe Cakarel, the founder and CEO of MUBI, added, “Fearless storytelling has always been at the heart of MUBI, and no one embodies it more vividly than Joe Wright. With ‘Mussolini: Son of the Century' he transforms history into pulse-quickening drama — elevated by Luca Marinelli's searing performance — and proves how the screen can both unsettle and enlighten. We're honored to bring this extraordinary series to audiences around the world.”

 










Christian Vesper, the CEO Global Drama & Film at Fremantle continued, “It was really important to us that we found the right partner to help us expand the reach of ‘Mussolini: Son of the Century' and I've no doubt that's exactly what we've got in MUBI. I can't think of a better pair of hands to nurture and celebrate this extraordinary series and help us tell this important story.”

“Mussolini: Son of the Century” is produced by Sky Studios and Lorenzo Mieli for The Apartment Pictures, a Fremantle company, in co-production with Pathé, in association with Small Forward Productions, in collaboration with Fremantle, Cinecittà S.p.A., and Sky. Fremantle handles global sales.

Additional MUBI releases include Cannes 2025 films such as Oliver Hermanus' “The History of Sound” starring Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor, as well as fellow O'Connor feature “The Mastermind,” directed by Kelly Reichardt. In 2024, MUBI distributed the Academy Award-winning film “The Substance” and Luca Guadagnino's “Queer.”

Previous MUBI TV series range from Wiliam Kentridge's “Self Portrait as a Coffee Pot” and Lars von Trier's “The Kingdom Trilogy.” IndieWire recently announced that late icon David Lynch's beloved series “Twin Peaks” and its  2017 continuation, “Twin Peaks: The Return,” will both be streaming on MUBI starting June 13. 

 










MUBI will release “Mussolini: Son of the Century” on its streaming service later this year. Check out the teaser below.

Sean “Diddy” Combs, the musician and rap mogul being sued by dozens of people for alleged sex crimes, begins his sex trafficking trial today (May 12) in Manhattan's Federal District Court. Prosecutors will argue that Diddy abused his money and power to traffic, drug, and sexually assault women; the defense claims any encounters were consensual. Opening statements commenced today. If convicted, Diddy could face life in jail.

Diddy, who has been incarcerated since September 2024 due to multiple denials of bail, appeared in the court last week as Judge Arun Subramanian oversaw jury selection. The final selection was delayed until today over fears jurors might get cold feet over the weekend.

Jury selection began last Monday. Nearly 100 potential jurors were questioned and assessed on their impartiality. Because of the high-profile nature of the case, some familiarity with the allegations against Diddy—including the video that showed his physical assault of the singer Casandra Elizabeth “Cassie” Ventura, his former girlfriend, in 2016—did not automatically disqualify potential jurors, The New York Times reports. Many admitted to having seen memes, satire, and speculation about the case. Those who admitted to bias against Diddy, bad experiences with law enforcement, or, in one case, difficulty staying off marijuana for the trial's duration were excused.

At least three accusers are expected to testify, as well as some of Diddy's former sexual partners, a business associate, and one or more male sex workers, according to CNN. Cassie's testimony is expected to be at the center of the prosecution case, alongside two or three other women who may use pseudonyms to protect their identities.

In her opening statement, one of the government's prosecutors, Emily A. Johnson, described Diddy's alleged acts of abuse and said, “He had an inner circle of bodyguards and high-ranking employees who helped him commit crimes and helped him cover them up,” per The New York Times. In contrast, one of Diddy's defense attorneys, Teny Geragos, acknowledged that Diddy has been violent with women, but claimed that his sexual relationships have been consensual and argued they do not amount to sex trafficking.

After months of snowballing lawsuits alleging crimes that include sexual assault, battery, grooming, and statutory rape, Diddy was arrested in a New York hotel room on September 16, 2024, and indicted by a grand jury on charges of racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. He pleaded not guilty the following day.

The arrest followed a raid of his homes in Los Angeles and Miami that March as Homeland Security Investigations built its case. At the time, his attorney, Marc Agnifilo, said his client “is an imperfect person, but he is not a criminal.” Diddy has since hired an eight-person defense team including Brian Steel, the lead defense attorney in Young Thug's Atlanta RICO case, which resulted in the rapper's release from jail after pleading guilty to some charges. Last Tuesday, the judge admonished Mark Geragos, who has represented Diddy but is not part of his defense team, for describing the prosecution as a “six-pack of white women” on his podcast.

The federal indictment alleges that, since at least 2008, Diddy has run a criminal enterprise, under which he “abused, threatened, and coerced women and others around him to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct.” The racketeering charge pertains to alleged acts that include kidnapping, arson, bribery, and narcotics offenses. Much of the indictment revolves around Diddy's so-called “freak offs,” in which Diddy and his associates allegedly drugged women and forced them to have sex with male sex workers while being filmed.

The federal investigations, as well as dozens of subsequent civil cases, followed the bombshell lawsuit filed in late 2023 by Cassie. She accused Diddy of physical and sexual assault but settled the next day, a move that Diddy's lawyer said “does not in any way undermine his flat-out denial of the claims.” CNN later released leaked hotel surveillance footage that showed Diddy hitting, dragging, and physically assaulting Cassie in 2016. Diddy posted an apology video without mentioning the singer by name. Among the subsequent lawsuits was one from Combs' Diddy Dirty Money bandmate Dawn Richard, who accused him of sexual assault, battery, sex trafficking, and other offenses.

Since his arrest, Combs has spent eight months in a dormitory-style room in a Brooklyn detention center, with ping-pong and television in a communal space, as well as a monitored telephone, The New York Times reports. (The jail has drawn complaints in the past for mold, vermin, and neglect, though Diddy's team has not publicly taken issue with the conditions.) Though there is no internet access, inmates can watch movies and listen to music on tablets purchased from the commissary. Diddy was also granted a laptop without Wi-Fi to go over prosecutors' evidence.

Follow all our Sean Combs trial coverage


	Sean “Diddy” Combs strode into court today morning to a packed courtroom filled with his children and anxious family members, as the hip-hop mogul faces charges of sex trafficking and racketeering that could put him behind bars for life.


	The 55-year-old, who is now fully gray, has pleaded not guilty to the five felony counts against him. During jury selection last week, the larger-than-life music executive who is known for commanding a spotlight and has previously faced a 15-year prison sentence and beat the case admitted he was a “little nervous” ahead of the trial's commencement. 


	Yet this morning, his publicist, Holly Baird, described Combs as “upbeat” and “ready to have his side told in court.” Combs' mother, Janice, and children Christian, Justin, Quincy, D'Lila, Jessie, and Chance appeared in court to support the mogul.


	Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Johnson began opening statements by conceding the jury members might be familiar with Combs by multiple names, his multi-million-dollar businesses and his “larger-than-life” persona, but she said, “there is another side to him”: a dangerous and violent figure, whose “inner circle” of bodyguards, personal assistants and a chief of staff worked tirelessly to deliver on his every whim and to safeguard his reputation. At the heart of his alleged “criminal enterprise” was Combs' insatiable sexual appetite where he required two girlfriends, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura and an anonymous woman identified as “Jane,” to have sex with male escorts, in what he called “freak-offs” or “Wild King Nights.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In the coming days, Johnson said, Ventura will testify about the “dark hotel rooms” that Combs kept her in for days at a time, where she was allegedly forced to have sex with hired male sex workers. During these days-long “freak-offs,” Ventura was allegedly kept compliant and awake through a variety of drugs, including Ecstasy. Johnson said Ventura once overdosed during a freak-off and said it felt like she was “choking” when Combs directed a sex worker to urinate in her mouth.

	











	Jane is expected to testify that Combs physically abused her too, Johnson said. The prosecutor said jurors will hear that Combs once chased Jane around a house and lifted her off the ground in a chokehold before he kicked her to the ground.

	Johnson said the evidence will show Combs ran an enterprise with the help of co-conspirators. One employee allegedly helped Combs break into a romantic rival's residence in December 2011. Johnson said Combs' chief of staff helped him “broker a deal” with a hotel security guard in 2016 to cover up the video showing Combs beating Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel. Combs allegedly bought the surveillance video by paying a hotel security guard $100,000 stuffed in a brown paper bag, Johnson told jurors.

	











	Meanwhile, Combs' attorney Teny Geragos argued that the case is not about sex trafficking, but about people's motivations for coming forward after all these years. She argued that Ventura and “Jane” were fully capable women who made choices because they had something to gain from being in a relationship with Combs. She told jurors that Ventura filed a civil lawsuit before reporting her alleged abuse to authorities. “Ask yourself why,” Geragos said. “The answer is money.”


	Geragos admitted Combs engaged in domestic violence in both relationships, but she said it was the product of romantic quarrels linked to jealousy. She claimed the hotel beating caught on tape was not sparked by Ventura trying to escape alleged sex trafficking, but by something found on a cellphone that led to a dispute over alleged infidelity. When combined with drug use, the fight led to regrettable actions — but in no way did it constitute sex trafficking, she told jurors.

	The defense lawyer said Jane was older than Cassie and had a child from a previous relationship. She described Jane as a fully consenting adult who was a willing participant in threesomes and remained in the admittedly “dysfunctional” relationship by choice.


	Earlier Monday morning, the line outside the Manhattan federal courthouse stretched down the block, as members of the press, enthusiastic supporters, curious spectators, podcasters, and content creators — including Myron Gaines from Fresh and Fit and Jaguar Wright — waited upward of 12 hours in hopes of securing a seat in the courtroom and catching a glimpse of the embattled Bad Boy Entertainment founder. Music producer Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones, who sued Combs in February 2024 for sexual assault and lack of payment, and his attorney Tyrone Blackburn turned up to court, though declined to give statements.


	Dressed in a grey sweater, collared shirt, and grey dress slacks, a smiling Combs waved to his children greeted his attorneys before taking his seat. He held a Bible in his hands, reading passages before opening arguments began later in the morning. Southern District of New York prosecutors and Combs' defense team trimmed down the remaining 43 jurors into a final group of eight men and four women, with six alternates. The panel includes a massage therapist, an investment analyst, a deli clerk, and a nursing home.


	The government has claimed Combs — who founded Bad Boy Records, which produced legendary rapper the Notorious B.I.G. and whose tremendous influence brought hip-hop and rap to the mainstream — used his billion-dollar empire as a criminal enterprise, fueled by the mogul's sexual desires. In the background of his business dealings, Combs is accused of sex trafficking two women between 2009 and 2024. 

	











	He allegedly instructed a team of staffers — who were allegedly subjected to forced labor and physical threats themselves — to carry out acts of bribery, arson, and kidnapping. Other alleged victims were said to be coerced into sex with Combs, as well as with hired male sex workers in dayslong, drug-fueled sexual sessions Combs called “freak-offs.”


	Meanwhile, Combs' all-star legal team — which includes celebrity attorneys Brian Steel and Marc Agnifilo — has insisted upon their client's innocence. They have claimed that although Combs participated in a “swinger” lifestyle and would frequently hire male escorts that did not constitute as sex trafficking. 


	In regard to Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, referred to as “Victim-1” in the indictment, Combs' attorney Agnifilo indicated to Judge Arun Subramanian that the defense planned to argue the pair's decade-long relationship was deeply “toxic” and there was “mutual” violence on both sides.


	When quizzed on the lines of questioning the defense would take during their cross-examination of Victim-1, attorneys Agnifilo and Alexandra Shapiro said they hoped to question Combs' former girlfriend about “other instances where she has been violent.” They said the questioning was central to speak to Ventura's alleged nonpeaceful nature and her independence in effort to dismantle prosecutors' claim that Combs coerced her into certain situations. 


	Subramanian quickly shot down the notion. “Strong people can be coerced just like weak people,” Subramanian said.

	This week, prosecutors indicated that they planned to call two “short” witnesses to the stand, including a male escort, before a third witness would testify. Although the name of that witness has not been disclosed, all signs point to Ventura. While stressing it was necessary to keep to a strict time schedule for the trial, prosecutors said an early key witness was “time sensitive” and would need to take frequent breaks throughout their dayslong testimony. Ventura is several months along in her pregnancy for her third child, and the indictment closely mirrors the claims she made in her bombshell sex-trafficking lawsuit.


This post was updated on Monday, May 12 at 1:15 p.m. to reflect opening statements by prosecutors and Combs' lawyers.

							By 

	Jon Blistein



Robert Fripp recently underwent two surgeries after suffering a heart attack he didn't even know he'd had.


	The King Crimson guitarist shared the story in a new video posted over the weekend alongside wife/collaborator, Toyah Wilcox. “He had a heart attack two weeks ago,” Wilcox said in the clip. “And you were in the right place, in the right time, and I am so grateful, because you've been through a lot.”


	Fripp then explained the surreal sequence of events. Last month, the musician said he'd been dealing with what he thought was acid reflux in the weeks leading up to a trip to Italy for a show. Having endured something similar a few years prior, Fripp didn't think much of it. But the day he flew to Italy, he said, he felt “more discomfort.” 


	While Fripp's team had already scheduled a doctor's visit, upon landing, they decided to take him to a cardiac hospital in Bergamo instead. While Fripp said he thought the doctors would prescribe him some acid reflux medication, they ultimately alerted him to some alarmingly high troponin levels in his blood, which can be a sign of a recent heart attack.

	Wilcox then said Fripp underwent “five hours of surgery, intensive care, then a second surgery.” But the musician fixated on a totally different moment. 


	“I was in A&E [accident and emergency], not quite knowing what was going on, other than I knew they were going to do something. And an orderly came along and shaved my balls!” Fripp said with a laugh. “The dear man, I really didn't wish his job on him at that point. Now this is the thing, you're concerned with my heart? Fine. What are you doing shaving my balls!” 


	(Wilcox then sagely explained it was likely to rid his body of anything that could possibly harbor germs before undergoing heart surgery.)

	Fripp has since been able to return home to the U.K., and while he's currently on a few medications, he's on pace to recover well over the next couple months. Fripp ended the video by encouraging people who think they have heart burn or acid reflux to “really look into it,” because “it might be something more.” 


	The musician also didn't seem to be letting the emergency surgeries get in the way of his music. Fripp noted that after being released from the hospital in Italy, he still managed to play his scheduled gig. “You went to work,” Wilcox quipped, to which Fripp replied, “No, dear, I went to play with my friends. And the performance in the church at in Castione della Presolana, it was stunning on the Saturday night. The audience were prepped with orchestral maneuvers, and it really was a magical event for me.”

	For 69 years, the Billboard 200 has ranked the most consumed albums in the United States, and for the first time, the albums in the Number One and Two spots are both in Spanish. Bad Bunny's Debí Tirar Más Fotos sits atop the chart at Number One after a new vinyl release. It had previously been Number One for three consecutive weeks after its release in January. 


	New to the chart is música mexicana band Fuerza Régida's album 111XPANTIA, which debuts at Number Two. Not only does this make for Fuerza Régida's highest-charting album yet, 111XPANTIA is now the highest-charting Spanish-language album by a duo or group, and the highest-charting album in its genre. 


	In another record-breaker, Debí Tirar Más Fotos's roughly 48,000 vinyls sold marks the largest vinyl sales week for a Latin album since Luminate began tracking those sales in 1991. For the crown, Bad Bunny bested Kali Uchis, whose Orquídeas sold 20,000 on chart from Jan. 27, 2024.

	Last week, in an interview with Rolling Stone on 111XPANTIA, Fuerza Régida frontman Jesús Ortiz Paz said, “This album right here, is all about making your dreams come true, bro. The eye [in the artwork], it resembles manifestation. It resembles new beginnings. The 111 [angel numbers] in the name. The name Ixpantia comes from the Aztecs… It's all about manifesting.” 

	











	On Debí Tirar Más Fotos, which means “I Should Have Taken More Photos,”  Bad Bunny told Rolling Stone, “It has more to do with the way that sometimes there are these moments I live through, and I enjoy them, but I didn't take any photos. I have a good memory, but I know there's going to be a time where I'm not going to remember really incredible times. It has a lot of meaning in terms of wishing I had seized certain moments. That's the idea: enjoying the moment when I could and valuing memories.”

Filed under:

Your in-built excuses for the draft lottery tonight.

The NBA Draft Lottery is on Monday night with Cooper Flagg being the biggest prize since, well ... okay, Victor Wembanyama two years ago — but still, Flagg is a big deal. 

Flagg might be the best U.S.-born prospect since LeBron James, garnering comparisons to Scottie Pippen, Jayson Tatum, and Grant Hill in terms of his length and all-around playing ability. So with stakes like this on the line it's only natural to assume that the entire lottery process is going to be rigged in order to ensure only a team the NBA wants to have Flagg will actually get him.


    Related
  

Read our latest mock draft before the lottery here. We also ranked the best and worst landing spots for Flagg. Thankfully we're in luck, because there are solid conspiracies behind every single lottery team that could win on Monday night. So to save your Twitter fingers some time, we've got all your theories right here for you.

Utah Jazz

The NBA needs to dispel it's “big market bias” narrative, and putting Flagg in Utah achieves just that. Also it coincides nicely with the owners of the Jazz (and now the Utah Mammoth) expanding their arena to make Salt Lake City a bigger sports destination. Like putting Wemby on the Spurs, Flagg on the Jazz achieves similar goals.

Washington Wizards

The Wizards have been lagging woefully behind in attendance for a large market and Flagg can change that. It's a great sports narrative to have the Wizards and Commanders rising from the ashes at the same time, and the NBA needs to jump on that hype bandwagon.

Charlotte Hornets

Adam Silver met with the owners of the Hornets close to the end of the regular season to hear about their arena expansion plans. The NBA has always had a soft spot for the Charlotte market, putting the NBA All-Star game in the city in 2019 and loving the link between the team and J. Cole. Flagg could be the missing piece to make this team actually good, and Charlotte has been robbed of the No. 1 pick multiple times in the past.

New Orleans Pelicans

Two big reasons here: The Saints are going to be in the toilet after Derek Carr stunningly retired, and this could easily be pre-payment on a deal to send Zion Williamson to a major market. We've seen this in the past. Remember when New Orleans was gifted Anthony Davis right after the Chris Paul trade? 

Philadelphia 76ers

The phrase “too big to fail” applies here. Of course the NBA is going to find a way to route Flagg to Philly and make the Sixers a phenom again. The whole Paul George fiasco blew up in their faces, and it's unclear if Joel Embiid can stay healthy. This is a contingency plan so the team can build a future big three around Jared McCain, Tyrese Maxey and Cooper Flagg if needed. 

Brooklyn Nets

It is not okay to have a team be in the world's largest media market and struggle as much as the Nets do — especially when the Knicks have finally found their form. The NBA needs a Knicks-Nets rivalry to be a thing, and in order to achieve that Brooklyn needs a star. Is there anything more perfectly Brooklyn that a lanky basketball star from Maine? The hipsters are going to love him.

Toronto Raptors

It's a dicey time in world politics and the NBA needs to currie as much favor with the Canadian government as possible. This franchise was built off Vince Carter coming up from North Carolina, now we do it again with Flagg heading North from Duke.

San Antonio Spurs

This is too obvious. Flagg and Wemby is a marketing dream. The new Big Two in Texas. A Gen Z Duncan and Robinson. The opportunities write themselves.

Houston Rockets

This is a great opportunity to take the already good Rockets and push them into the stratosphere (forgive the pun). It would also take a lot of attention off the Mavericks so they can make a more quiet move to Las Vegas.

Portland Trail Blazers

Sending Damian Lillard to the Bucks did the NBA a major solid, even if it didn't work out. This is a payment on that trade, and gives Portland a major star to build around.

Dallas Mavericks

This is obvious. Nico Harrison gifted Luka Doncic to the Lakers, so the NBA gifts Cooper Flagg to the Mavs.

Chicago Bulls

A huge market team on the cusp of winning. Also a chance to make significant inroads with the Catholic market by making Pope Leo XIV happy that his team has a star.

Atlanta Hawks

It's time to strike while the iron is hot for the NBA. The Falcons and Braves are down bad, so by boosting the Hawks to the moon they can help claim the largest market in the Southeast. It's all about building the brand and making the Hawks a hot commodity.

By studying seismic waves, researchers have found a layer deep beneath the surface of Mars that could contain enough liquid water to flood the planet with an ocean thousands of feet deep.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


There might be a hidden ocean's worth of liquid water below the surface of Mars, seismic evidence suggests.

According to a new paper published April 25 in the journal National Science Review, recordings of seismic waves from deep within the Red Planet indicate that a layer of liquid water may be lurking in the Martian rocks between 3.4 and 5 miles [5.4 to 8 kilometers] below the surface.

The total volume of hidden water could flood the whole of Mars' surface with an ocean 1,700 to 2,560 feet [520 to 780 metres] deep, around the same volume of liquid that is contained within Antarctica's ice sheet, the study authors estimated.

Our neighboring planet was once abundant in water. In the time between Mars' formation 4.1 billion years ago to about 3 billion years ago, the Red Planet is thought to have been extremely wet, with features like valley networks, delta formations, and layered sedimentary rocks suggesting sustained water flow.

However, this abundant liquid water ""vanished as the planet transitioned to become the cold, dry environment we see today,"" paper co-author Hrvoje Tkalčić, a professor of geophysics at the Australian National University, said in a statement.

Over time, Mars lost its magnetic field, and solar radiation began stripping away its atmosphere. With a thinner atmosphere, surface temperatures dropped; the planet's liquid water began to escape into space, become trapped as ice in the subsurface or polar caps, or become locked in hydrated minerals within the planet's crust, the researchers said.

However, these methods of water loss have previously been shown to not entirely account for all the water that is estimated to have once flowed on the Red Planet, with a large volume of ""missing"" water going unaccounted for. This conundrum has long puzzled scientists, posing the question of whether there is still liquid water hidden on Mars that we have yet to find.



This new research suggests that there is indeed liquid water buried deep below the surface of the planet. Upon analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, which landed on Mars in 2018, researchers found that seismic waves within the planet's interior — caused by asteroid impacts and marsquakes in 2021 and 2022 — appeared to slow down between 3.4 and 5 miles [5.4 to 8 kilometers] below the surface. They suggest that this could be due to the presence of liquid water hidden within porous rocks, as seismic waves travel more slowly through liquid than they do through more solid materials.

""This 'low-velocity layer' is most likely highly porous rock filled with liquid water, like a saturated sponge,"" Tkalčić and another study co-author Weijia Sun, a professor of geophysics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, explained in an essay for the Conversation about the new study. ""Something like Earth's aquifers, where groundwater seeps into rock pores.""

The researchers suggest that this liquid water could make up the total volume of water missing from previous calculations.

""Our study indicates it's possible that much of that ancient water percolated through the porous surface rocks and was retained underground,"" Tkalčić said. ""This also matches estimates of the 'missing' water on Mars from other studies.""

—NASA rover discovers out-of-place 'Skull' on Mars, and scientists are baffled

—Life on Mars could survive — so long as you're one of these strange, hybrid lifeforms

Previous studies have also found that large volumes of water may be stored beneath the Martian surface in ice form, and a study from 2024 suggested that liquid water could be stored within rocks between 7 to 13 miles (11.2 to 21 km) beneath the surface.

The potential presence of liquid water on Mars is exciting to scientists, as liquid water is essential to life as we know it. While these potential reservoirs deep below the planet's surface could host some form of Martian life, we won't know if the liquid water even exists until we can drill deep into Mars and find it for ourselves.

""Future missions with seismometers and drills are needed to confirm the presence of the water at these depths and gather more clues,"" Tkalčić said.

The carmaker's stock surge owes more to the vibes around tariff news than any fundamental change in its outlook.

The Washington vibes.

Tesla Inc. is back in the trillion-dollar club for the first time since February. Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker added about $65 billion of market value on Monday morning, as of writing this, taking it into thirteen figures again.

The obvious catalyst is the partial truce in the US-China trade war, fueling a 2.5% rally in the S&P 500 Index. Tesla's gain is more than double that, presumably reflecting the specific benefits it stands to reap from all this.

Illinois's quantum campus, championed by Governor JB Pritzker, is adding an Australian tech firm to its list of future tenants on Chicago's South Side, advancing his push to make the state a hub for the industry.

The Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, which will be under construction over the next two years, has signed a letter of intent with Diraq, an Australian firm working on expanding technology using silicon quantum dot spin qubits, which quantum computers use to exchange information. Diraq will use the park's “On-Ramp,” a program that provides more than 2,000 square feet of space and specialized equipment while the campus is under development at the site of a former US Steel plant.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency firm co-founded by Eric Trump, said it was merging with a company traded on the Nasdaq, the latest expansion of the family's investments in crypto.

By David Yaffe-Bellany and Kenneth P. Vogel

American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency firm co-founded by Eric Trump, announced on Monday that it would become publicly traded, the latest expansion of the Trump family's investments across the crypto industry.

The company, which focuses on Bitcoin mining, is set to merge with Gryphon Digital Mining Inc., a firm that is already traded on the Nasdaq. Mr. Trump, the president's middle son, is listed as one of the founders and a member of the company's management team.

American Bitcoin was started in late March, when Mr. Trump and his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., announced that they were joining forces with a Bitcoin mining firm called Hut 8. Bitcoin mining is a vital branch of the crypto industry, in which major companies, many of them publicly traded, run energy-guzzling data centers to process Bitcoin transactions.

The move to take American Bitcoin public could pave the way for traders — including those seeking favor from President Trump — to invest in a Trump family entity, though the company said in its announcement that existing stockholders were expected to own an overwhelming majority of the company.

The business is one facet of an increasingly broad array of Trump family crypto ventures that have alarmed government ethics experts. President Trump and his sons have started a crypto firm called World Liberty Financial that offers its own digital coin. And working with a separate set of business partners, the Trump family has marketed the digital currency $TRUMP — a type of crypto called a memecoin that is typically treated more as a novelty investment than an actual currency.

At the same time, President Trump has taken steps to advance the crypto world's interests in Washington, ending a Biden-era enforcement campaign against crypto companies and backing legislation supported by the industry.

In an investor presentation posted on its website, American Bitcoin aggressively promoted its connection with the Trump family, featuring a large photograph of Eric Trump near the beginning. A message next to the photo describes the company's ambitions and links the firm to the domestic crypto industry in ways that echo the president's messaging.

“Crypto is the future,” the message reads. “America must lead the way. American Bitcoin will set the standard.”

Among a list of key figures in the business, the presentation describes Eric Trump as a “strategic amplifier” who “drives brand equity and institutional visibility through unparalleled network reach.”

The Flying Eagles edged past the reigning African champions in a dramatic penalty shootout, after a tense 120 minutes ended goalless at the Suez Canal Stadium in Ismailia.

Goalkeeper Ebenezer Harcourt emerged as the hero, saving spot-kicks from Pierre Dorival and Mame Mor Faye, while Ousmane Konate's attempt rattled the crossbar.

In addition to securing a spot at the global football showpiece in Chile, the seven-time African champions have also reached the AFCON U20 semi-finals, where they will face either South Africa or DR Congo.

“We don't want to pursue two things at the same time,” coach Aliyu Zubair had told the media.

“First things first, and that is getting the ticket to the World Cup. That's where all our attention is. We are gathering momentum, and I believe we are in a ready stage now.

“We respect all opponents, including Senegal as defending champions. But Nigeria has been in that position before. This time, we are coming to be the ones to stop them and run our race into the semi-finals.”

Nigeria will be making their 14th appearance at the U20 World Cup, since debuting in the tournament's fourth edition held in Mexico in 1983.

Their best performance to date remains a second-place finish, achieved in the 1989 and 2005 editions in Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands, respectively.

The West Africans were eliminated in the Round of 16 at the 2023 edition in Argentina. Despite defeating the hosts in the previous round, Ladan Bosso's boys fell short against South Korea, losing 1-0 after extra time.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

If you'll be in town and would like to attend, or just want to connect, reach out to the contacts above. (A festival badge is required for the summit, but not to talk with me.)
 










This year, Cannes will have an extra frisson of, uh, excitement thanks to Trump's tariff tantrum and the vibe toward Americans in general. That could impact the Cannes market, but the festival? Non.

More than any other film festival, Cannes floats above whatever's fraying. It has rules (or deeply held principles, depending on your POV) about everything from auteurism to the shoes allowed on the red carpet.

Snobby? Yes! And in its way, comforting: Consistency is a rare commodity. It's also the festival that means the most to filmmakers and film culture, full stop.

And this is where I suggest that tradition represents something of a problem.

Cannes isn't the issue. It's the tendency to conflate engagement with any industry institution — festivals, agencies, studios, networks, distribution deals — with safe harbor. It was really hard to get here; isn't that enough? Today, it's not.

It doesn't make legacy Hollywood out to get you (although it could be — depends!), but the establishment is in a full-nelson of existential crisis that touches every bit of the film and TV lifecycles. Development? Production? Distribution? Theaters? Advertising? A hot mess, all of them.

While no one should ever have confused the entertainment business with a warm binkie, the institutions themselves are in the new and awkward spot of having to justify their existence. This isn't a recession, at least not yet; that might be less stressful. Instead, the balance of power is shifting and it's cool to cede power said no one ever.

Maybe a chunk of it will go to the kinds of creators who are building their own studios. Maybe a piece will finally go to the XR, AR, and VR companies. (This is the second year that Cannes will host a juried Immersive Competition.) Corporations are deciding YouTube is interesting, again. Maybe the studio system will shrink to Disney, Sony, and Universal. Maybe Netflix will own everything. (Please, not that.)

 










The thing is, no one should waste energy worrying about the stuff they can't control (unless you're one of the legacy entities, in which case I feel you).

However, having the courage to recognize change also gives you the power of deciding how to respond. It's probably harder than putting your head down to charge over well-worn paths, but decreases the likelihood of breaking an ankle. 

Young creators have to seek new case studies; the ones in film school are out of date. Those already in the business, who fought so hard to be here, have to fight all over again. 

Helping people understand how they might make sense in a time when little does is why IndieWire created Future of Filmmaking. If there's specific topics you'd like us to explore, tell me: dana@indiewire.com.

Next Monday, I'll tell you what I've learned at Cannes. But for now, I'm going to close with a chunky quote from my friend Brian Newman's newsletter (Sub-Genre, strong recommend).

He culled this gem from a conversation between MoMa curator Michelle Kuo and artist Mark Bradford as they discussed exhibition Jack Whitten: The Messenger. I'll let Brian take it from here:   

 










“As [Bradford] put it, when he was starting his career, he had to really create most of his own opportunities. Perhaps there was room to hang his art in the bathroom stall of a nightclub? Fine, he would take it (he wasn't exaggerating). Someone told him he would have to paint the walls for his own show at a gallery? His first reaction might be, ‘Not me, I'm a Yale graduate,' but … ‘Uh, uh,' he said… ‘you paint those walls.' He always thought to himself – I am a 1099, not a W2 worker. You don't have job security, you don't have a regular paycheck. You have to make it work. And make your own opportunities.”   

See you next week.

In addition to our summit in Cannes at the American Pavilion, Future of Filmmaking has partnered with Universal Studio Group for a series of virtual panels about the making of TV shows like “Hacks,” “Man on the Inside,” and “The Four Seasons.”

Last week, Future of Filmmaking published a piece related to the shuttering of Industry Arts brands — Coverfly, ScreenCraft, The Tracking Board, and more. The positive response has been greatly appreciated, but the way people have expanded on the conversation moves us even more.
