                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this interview, industry expert Blake Webb shares insights on the future of fluidic technology, highlighting trends in automation, microfluidics, and smart systems shaping medical diagnostics and laboratory workflows. Over the years, fluidics in medical devices and laboratory equipment has evolved from large, centralized systems to highly integrated, compact solutions—especially for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. The demand for faster diagnostics, reduced supply chain dependencies, and cost-effective instrumentation has pushed OEMs toward miniaturized, precise fluidic systems. At Fluid Metering, our core technology has long supported traditional, high-reliability architectures. Our pumps are engineered as precision instrumentation designed to last the full lifecycle of medical and diagnostic devices, making them a cornerstone of high-accuracy fluid management. As the new Head of Product, my focus is on bridging that gap—leveraging our legacy of precision and reliability while evolving toward more compact, high-performance fluidic solutions that meet the growing demands of next-generation medical and lab devices. One of the most significant advancements in fluidic technology has been the rise of microfluidics, which has transformed medical diagnostics and research—particularly in drug discovery, gene therapies, and high-throughput screening. These systems allow for extremely precise handling of small fluid volumes, reducing reagent costs while increasing sensitivity and automation. Companies like Tecan and Hamilton have led the way in integrating advanced fluidic handling into fully automated lab workflows. However, as fluidic technology evolves, there's growing demand for next-generation pumps and fluid handling systems that seamlessly integrate into microfluidic architectures while maintaining reliability and cost-efficiency. For OEMs, this translates into significant cost savings, not just in reduced consumable waste but also in eliminating field service costs and improving end-user satisfaction. This often leads to the selection of lower-precision fluidics, which can result in higher reagent consumption, assay failures, and increased service calls—ultimately frustrating end users. We've worked with proactive OEMs who recognize this, and ROI calculations have revealed potential savings in the hundreds of millions of dollars—a massive, often overlooked opportunity. At Fluid Metering, our goal is to help OEMs see beyond upfront costs and optimize fluidic performance for long-term success. As laboratory automation continues to advance, the demand for high-precision, low-maintenance fluidic solutions will grow. At Fluid Metering, we see an opportunity to evolve our technology to better align with automated workflows, ensuring greater efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness for our OEM partners. Several key trends are shaping the future of fluidics in medical devices and laboratory equipment: At Fluid Metering, we are focused on advancing fluidic technologies that integrate reliability, precision, and smart automation, ensuring our OEM partners stay ahead of evolving industry demands. As laboratory and diagnostic workflows become more automated, there is an increasing need for fluidic systems that are not just precise, but also intelligent—capable of self-monitoring, adjusting flow rates in real time, and integrating with AI-driven diagnostics. A key part of this effort is our collaboration with our parent company, Roper, to integrate smart fluidic systems directly into Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). By leveraging LIMS integration, we can offer real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and advanced analytics, helping laboratories optimize performance, reduce downtime, and improve reproducibility. Beyond smart fluidics, we are also highly interested in single-use and disposable fluidic systems, as they play an essential role in contamination-free diagnostics and biopharmaceutical applications. As these technologies evolve, we see significant opportunities for Fluid Metering to leverage our precision fluidics expertise in new, cutting-edge applications. One of the biggest challenges when working with highly sensitive fluids in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics is the wide range of properties these fluids can have. Customers ask us to dispense materials that vary significantly in viscosity, composition, and particle content—including suspended and unsuspended solids like magnetic beads or silica gel beads. These applications require precise, consistent, and contamination-free handling, which can be difficult to achieve without specialized fluidic solutions. For example, our pumps are used in delicate dispensing applications such as mAb (monoclonal antibody) metering and silica bead suspensions, both of which require extreme precision to maintain fluid integrity. Two of the most common concerns we hear from customers are shear stress and pulsation—both of which can negatively impact sensitive biological or particulate-laden fluids. While our pumps often push the boundaries of feasibility, we've found that working closely with OEMs and our engineering team can help optimize solutions that successfully meet application requirements. To address this, we have developed proprietary technologies, including specialized coatings and custom ceramic components, that prevent crystallization and ensure long-term system reliability. Balancing innovation, cost, and practicality in fluidic product development requires close collaboration with OEMs to ensure that new technologies are not only technically advanced but also commercially viable. Our most successful innovations come from strong partnerships with OEMs who understand that fluidic performance is a key differentiator in their instruments. At Fluid Metering, we see ourselves as an extension of our OEM partners' engineering teams, ensuring that innovation translates into real-world benefits—whether through precision, reliability, or cost-effectiveness. We believe the future of fluidics lies in highly integrated, smart, and scalable solutions that enable OEMs to stay ahead of industry demands while ensuring their products remain commercially competitive and scientifically robust. We are at a critical inflection point in fluidics, driven by the integration of AI and smart automation. AI is rapidly simplifying these challenges, unlocking new possibilities in automation. One of the most exciting opportunities I've heard about lies in AI-driven cancer diagnostics. Studies show that trained AI models can be significantly more accurate than doctors at identifying cancerous cells, as AI can analyze vast datasets that no human could process manually. This is poised to reshape fluidic workflows, particularly in histology and pathology applications. For example, traditional cell and slide staining—a process that relies on precise fluidic dispensing—may undergo a major transformation with the rise of digital staining. We've had fascinating discussions with OEMs who believe the future may not require physical stains at all. Instead, AI could analyze biopsy images digitally, removing the need for certain fluidic applications. In one way, this is disruptive, as it could impact existing business models. Fluidics will still play a role in upstream processes like sample preparation, cell isolation, and reagent management. As AI reshapes laboratory automation, Fluid Metering is actively exploring how to adapt and innovate, ensuring that fluidics remains at the core of advanced medical and biotech applications. One of our largest OEM customers was designing a next-generation immunoassay instrument but struggled to find a fluidic solution that could precisely and accurately dispense their new assays. This collaboration showcased how early partnership and precision-engineered fluidic solutions can help OEMs overcome critical dispensing challenges and bring innovative diagnostics to market. Fluid Metering is entering an exciting phase of innovation and expansion, with a strong focus on new fluidic hardware, advanced pumping solutions, and miniaturization. Looking ahead, we see huge opportunities in AI-driven automation, connectivity, and next-generation fluidics. By continuously adapting to industry trends and collaborating with forward-thinking partners, Fluid Metering is well-positioned to lead the future of precision fluid control.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The modest increase for 2026 Medicare pay is “welcome, but this is a large and complicated bill,” Anders Gilberg, senior vice president of government affairs for the Medical Group Management Association, told Medscape Medical News. Substantial Medicaid cuts also would likely have “negative repercussions for physician reimbursement,” Gilberg told Medscape Medical News. “It remains to be seen how this will all net out in the end, but we appreciate our physician champions in the House working to address Medicare reimbursement shortfalls in an otherwise austere legislative package as it relates to healthcare,” Gilberg said. Congress allowed a 2.83% cut in 2025 to the Medicare conversion factor, which is key to setting Medicare payment rates for services provided by about 1.3 million clinicians, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. In 2027 and following years, the increase would be 10% of that index. Still, the committee's Democrats called this week for more than just a stopgap Medicare pay hike. “This is woefully underfunding the need to address inflation,” said committee member Rep. Raul Ruiz, MD (D-CA), who worked as an emergency physician before joining Congress. The Medicare pay proposal is part of House Committee on Energy and Commerce's section of a wide-ranging draft GOP legislative package, known as a reconciliation bill. Reconciliation is a special process in Congress that allows lawmakers to bypass some Senate procedural hurdles. Reconciliation requires House and Senate lawmakers to concur on a budget blueprint, which has proven challenging. There's strong bipartisan support in Congress for revising the Medicare physician fee schedule. A bill introduced in 2023, which would have provided for an update equal to the annual MEI percentage increase, had 126 Democratic and 47 Republican co-sponsors. Mark Miller, PhD, executive vice president of healthcare at the philanthropy Arnold Ventures, said Congress should try to shift Medicare away from its current reliance on the fee-for-service model. “Keeping in mind that Medicare physicians are financed by taxpayers and beneficiary premiums, payment rates should be deemed adequate when they assure beneficiaries have access to high-quality care — rather than blindly defaulting to the full Medicare Economic Index,” Miller wrote. He suggested offsetting these new costs with cuts to payments to Medicare Advantage plans for “upcoding,” or making patients appear more ill than they are. Miller said savings could also be achieved by a shift to site-neutral policies, which would end higher pay for some services depending on the ownership of the facility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Oh my god," physician assistant Anna Rink gasped, as she and three other Planned Parenthood employees finally walked outside. "Thank you for trusting us with your care," Rink called out, her voice quavering. But Planned Parenthood of Michigan is giving up on four of its health centers in the state, citing financial challenges. It's part of a growing trend: At least 17 clinics closed last year in states where abortion remains legal, and another 17 have closed in just the first five months of this year, according to data gathered by ineedana.com. That includes states that have become abortion destinations, like Illinois, and those where voters have enshrined broad reproductive rights into the state constitution, like Michigan. Experts say the closures indicate that financial and operational challenges, rather than future legal bans, may be the biggest threats to abortion access in states whose laws still protect it. "These states that we have touted as being really the best kind of versions of our vision for reproductive justice, they too struggle with problems," said Erin Grant, a co-executive director of the Abortion Care Network, a national membership organization for independent clinics. But some abortion rights supporters question whether leaders are prioritizing patient care for the most vulnerable populations. Planned Parenthood of Michigan isn't cutting executive pay, even as it reduces staff by 10% and shuts down brick-and-mortar clinics in areas already facing health care shortages. "I wish I had been in the room so I could have fought for us, and I could have fought for our community," said Viktoria Koskenoja, an emergency medicine physician in the Upper Peninsula, who previously worked for Planned Parenthood in Marquette. "I just have to hope that they did the math of trying to hurt as few people as possible, and that's how they made their decision. And we just weren't part of the group that was going to be saved." If a clinic could survive the fall of Roe v. Wade, "you would think that resilience could carry you forward," said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation. But clinic operators say they face new financial strain, including rising costs, limited reimbursement rates, and growing demand for telehealth services. They're also bracing for the Trump administration to again exclude them from Title X, the federal funding for low- and no-cost family planning services, as the previous Trump administration did in 2019. The clinics being closed are "our smallest health centers," said Sarah Wallett, PPMI's chief medical operating officer. The clinics being closed offered medication abortion, which is available in Michigan up until 11 weeks of pregnancy, but not procedural abortion. Planned Parenthood of Greater New York is now selling its only Manhattan clinic, after closing four clinics last summer due to "compounding financial and political challenges." Earlier this spring, the Trump administration began temporarily freezing funds to many clinics, including all Title X providers in California, Hawaii, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, and Utah, according to a KFF analysis. While the current Title X freeze doesn't yet include Planned Parenthood of Michigan, PPMI's chief advocacy officer, Ashlea Phenicie, said it would amount to a loss of about $5.4 million annually, or 16% of its budget. But Planned Parenthood of Michigan didn't close clinics the last time the Trump administration froze its Title X funding. Its leader said that's because the funding was stopped for only about two years, from 2019 until 2021, when the Biden administration restored it. "Now we're faced with a longer period of time that we will be forced out of Title X, as opposed to the first administration," said PPMI president and CEO Paula Thornton Greear. Until a few years ago, doctors could prescribe abortion pills only in person. Those restrictions were lifted during the covid-19 pandemic, but it was the Dobbs decision in 2022 that really "accelerated expansions in telehealth," Myers said, "because it drew all this attention to models of providing abortion services." Suddenly, new online providers entered the field, advertising virtual consultations and pills shipped directly to your home. And plenty of patients who still have access to a brick-and-mortar clinic prefer that option. "Put more simply, it's gotta change their business model," she said. Historically, about 28% of PPMI's patients receive Medicaid benefits, according to Phenicie. And, like many states, Michigan's Medicaid program doesn't cover abortion, leaving those patients to either pay out-of-pocket or rely on help from abortion funds, several of which have also been struggling financially. "When patients can't afford care, that means that they might not be showing up to clinics," said Fonteno of the National Abortion Federation, which had to cut its monthly budget nearly in half last year, from covering up to 50% of an eligible patient's costs to 30%. "So seeing a sort of decline in patient volume, and then associated revenue, is definitely something that we've seen." Meanwhile, more clinics and abortion funds say patients have delayed care because of those rising costs. One abortion fund said the number of patients who had to delay care until their second trimester had "grown by over 60%." Even when non-abortion services like birth control and cervical cancer screenings are covered by insurance, clinics aren't always reimbursed for the full cost, Thornton Greear said. When you start looking at the costs to run a health care organization, from supply costs, etc., when you layer on these funding impacts, it creates a chasm that's impossible to fill." Yet, unlike some independent clinics that have had to close, Planned Parenthood's national federation brings in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, the majority of which is spent on policy and legal efforts rather than state-level medical services. The organization and some of its state affiliates have also battled allegations of mismanagement, as well as complaints about staffing and patient care problems. Planned Parenthood of Michigan staffers in five clinics unionized last year, with some citing management problems and workplace and patient care conditions. When the Marquette clinic's closure was announced, dozens of patients voiced their concerns in Google reviews, with several saying the clinic had "saved my life," and describing how they'd been helped after an assault, or been able to get low-cost care when they couldn't afford other options. Planned Parenthood of Michigan responded to most comments with the same statement and pointed patients to telehealth in the clinic's absence: "Please know that closing health centers wasn't a choice that was made lightly, but one forced upon us by the escalating attacks against sexual and reproductive health providers like Planned Parenthood. "We know that telehealth cannot bridge every gap; however, the majority of the services PPMI provides will remain available via the Virtual Health Center and PP Direct, including medication abortion, birth control, HIV services, UTI treatment, emergency contraception, gender-affirming care, and yeast infection treatment. PPMI's virtual health center is already its most popular clinic, according to the organization, serving more than 10,000 patients a year. "For some rural communities, having access to telehealth has made significant changes in their health," said Wallett, PPMI's chief medical operating officer. I don't have to take extra time off. I don't have to find child care." Yet even as the number of clinics has dropped nationally, about 80% of clinician-provided abortions are still done by brick-and-mortar clinics, according to the most recent #WeCount report, which looked at 2024 data from April to June. And Hannah Harriman, a Marquette County Health Department nurse who previously spent 12 years working for Planned Parenthood of Marquette, is skeptical of any suggestion that telehealth can replace a rural brick-and-mortar clinic. Some areas are "dark zones" for cell coverage, she said. There are places here that don't even have internet coverage. Telehealth has its advantages, said Koskenoja, the emergency medicine physician who previously worked for Planned Parenthood in Marquette, "but for a lot of health problems, it's just not a safe or realistic way to take care of people." "She needed to see a gynecologist, and I called the local OB office," Koskenoja said. "They told me they have 30 or 40 new referrals a month," and simply don't have enough clinicians to see all those patients. "So adding in the burden of all the patients that were being seen at Planned Parenthood is going to be impossible." The local health department can provide Title X family planning services 1½ days a week, but that won't be enough, Harriman said. And there are a few private "providers in town that offer medication abortion to their patients only — very, very quietly," she said. "But we lost a very functional system for delivering this care to patients. This article is from a partnership with Michigan Public and NPR.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While there is currently no cure for a type of dementia called Alzheimer's disease, over the last few years, new medications have been introduced to help manage disease symptoms and slow its progression. Now, a new study recently published in JAMA Neurology reconfirms the Clarity AD findings by reporting that significant adverse events — such as ARIA — were rare and manageable in “real-world” use of lecanemab for people with very mild or mild Alzheimer's disease. For this study, researchers recruited 234 people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, with an average age of about 74, who received lecanemab at the outpatient specialty memory clinic, Washington University Memory Diagnostic Center. “Lecanemab is an antibody, a kind of protein normally made in your body by your immune system,” Barbara Joy Snider, MD, PhD, a professor of neurology at WashU Medicine and affiliated with the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, and co-senior author of this study, explained to Medical News Today. “In a large clinical trial, people who were treated with lecanemab for 18 months had about 25-30% less decline in their memory and thinking than did people who did not get the medication,” Snider said. “It is important to note that the people treated with lecanemab did have a loss in their memory and thinking, so the drug did not reverse or completely stop the memory loss, but it did significantly slow it down. The clinical trial results showed that people with very mild symptoms likely benefit more from medications like lecanemab (40-50% slowing of decline instead of 25-30%), so people with very mild symptoms have more benefit and fewer side effects. Snider and her team also discovered that of the 11 participants who experienced ARIA symptoms, the effects mostly disappeared within a few months, and no patients died. “This is very similar to what was seen in the clinical trial,” Snider commented. “This is very reassuring and tells us that these drugs can be used safely in a ‘real world' clinic population.” “We will continue to follow our patients and hope to learn more about side effects of these medications and about how much they slow down memory loss,” she continued. We are encouraged by our experience of providing amyloid-targeting treatments to appropriate patients and we look forward to the next generation of treatments for Alzheimer's disease.” MNT spoke with John Dickson, MD, PhD, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, about this study. Dickson commented that the study's findings are generally in line with what he has observed at his center. This may help patients make more informed decisions regarding their treatment options. These treatment decisions include whether or not to pursue treatment with anti-amyloid therapy, and if so, whether lecanemab or donanemab would be a better option.”— John Dickson, MD, PhD Dickson said that for future research, these findings should be examined in a larger patient sample and that the observation time should be extended. MNT also spoke with Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD, director of the Division of Geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this research. This requires careful consideration of the patient's disease stage, overall health, and other risk factors.” — Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD “Additional safety data and ‘real world' experience [are] helpful for this process.” A new contender for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, lecanemab, may soon be on the market, but what does it really do, and how much promise does… In this episode of our podcast, MNT investigates how sounds, silence, and music affect our cognitive health, and whether it can be a powerful tool for…</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From incorporating multiple specialists to working with social workers, primary care physicians and more, figuring out the right calculus to help these particularly ill patients is often difficult. Unlike certain specialists and primary care physicians, hospitalists don't know the majority of their patients well. The position has its pros and cons, but more than anything, it means a hospitalist must develop effective strategies for managing these complex patient cases. The layers of complexity involved in each patient can range from physical to mental, and may also involve logistics, a lack of social support, and more. While physical ailments are often at the top of the list, psycho-social issues are taking an increasingly larger role in the treatment of complex patients, according to Adjoa Boateng Evans, MD, a critical care anesthesiologist at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. “Or if a patient has survived a critical illness, but is too ill to go home, we have to make decisions about long-term care.” Those decisions may be further complicated by issues like lack of insurance or little-to-no support system, which can present additional obstacles for hospitalists. “If they've got multiple patients and psycho-social issues, too, patient management can be difficult.” Additionally, hospitalists are in the unique position of managing admissions and discharges, all while keeping abreast of new data and results throughout a shift. “We are seeing these patients often at the sickest points of their lives,” said Maninder (Dolly) Abraham, MD, chief of hospitalist medicine at RWJBarnabas Health, West Orange, New Jersey. “A big challenge is that we don't know them or their families.” This means there is a learning curve when hospitalists take over a complex patient, and due to the severity of the patient's illnesses, they must overcome this curve swiftly. If patients are bouncing back and forth between the floor and the intensive care unit (ICU), that task can be even more convoluted. Another issue hospitalists may face is bridging gaps between specialists. Both are right for those systems, but as hospitalists, we get all that information and must make decisions.” While that can feel intimidating, with good communication and a willingness to collaborate, hospitalists can deliver the quality of care necessary to adequately support complex patients throughout their stay. “You should review records, reach out to the primary care physician, and reconcile the poly-pharmacy issue so that there are no side effects or adverse reactions,” said Anila Faizan, MD, medical director of the hospitalist program at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey. “You must communicate with everyone involved in the patient's care.” This requires a holistic approach that addresses social detriments along with the physical condition. Your patient will eventually move on to the next site of care — or their home, ideally — and you must begin addressing this on day 1. “We're in-house for 10-12 hours and not running off to offices,” said Abraham. That gives us an advantage in the care of complex patients.” “But our breadth of knowledge on these patients is vast, and we're always happy to help collaborate.” These conversations can lead to comanagement decision-making, often improving patient outcomes. When hospitalists add their two cents on patient care — and ask for the same in return — it can unearth the best route of care. “You must be openly and transparently explaining all that's going on with a patient's care. This may involve levels of uncertainty, but that's ok, said Sweigart. “We relay that one message of plan of care to everyone because we see patients as a whole, not just an organ system or specialty.” “Our job is to shepherd through these very vulnerable patients,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From ancient Ayurvedic remedy to modern scientific spotlight, tulsi (holy basil) is emerging as a promising botanical for stress, metabolic health, immunity, and beyond—yet experts caution that robust clinical trials are still needed. For over 3,000 years, tulsi, which is also known as holy basil, has been revered in Ayurveda as a sacred plant and remedy for ailments of the body and mind. Modern pharmacological research is now beginning to validate what ancient medical systems have long claimed about tulsi. Ocimum sanctum, commonly known as tulsi or holy basil, is an important herb in Ayurveda and other Southeast Asian traditional medicine systems. In recent decades, tulsi has garnered increasing scientific interest, particularly in the context of modern health challenges such as chronic inflammation, metabolic disorders, and psychological stress.1-4 This article critically examines the evidence behind tulsi's health benefits through the lens of modern scientific research, including its adaptogenic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic effects. Tulsi belongs to the family Lamiaceae and genus Ocimum. The most well-known species used medicinally is Ocimum sanctum, which is also known by the synonymous taxonomic name Ocimum gratissimum.5 The bioactive constituents of O. sanctum include eugenol, ursolic acid, rosmarinic acid, apigenin, and linalool, all of which are compounds known for their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects.2,3 Tulsi is commercially available in multiple forms, including fresh leaves, dried powders, teas, essential oils, and encapsulated extracts. The concentration of active compounds in these preparations varies. In Ayurveda, tulsi is believed to promote longevity, enhance resilience, and foster systemic balance. Traditionally, tulsi has been used as a household remedy to treat a wide range of ailments, including fever, cough, asthma, bronchitis, malaria, diarrhea, and skin diseases. It is often consumed as a tea, infused into oils, or in herbal powders and pastes.4 Tulsi is also considered an adaptogen that supports the body's ability to acclimate to physical, emotional, and environmental stressors.1 In folk medicine, tulsi has been used to relieve headaches, earaches, and indigestion, whereas its leaves are applied topically for insect bites and skin eruptions. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, supplementation with an O. tenuiflorum extract (OciBest) significantly reduced symptoms of stress, including exhaustion, sleep disturbances, and forgetfulness, over six weeks.7 These effects could be attributed to compounds such as eugenol and ursolic acid present in tulsi, which modulate cortisol levels and neurotransmitter activity.1 Tulsi's antioxidant properties are attributed to its ability to upregulate enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase while scavenging free radicals.2 In fact, a 2014 study reported that tulsi leaf extracts reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) secretion and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) translocation, both of which are key inflammatory processes, in human monocyte leukemia cell lines.8 Rosmarinic acid, eugenol, and other phenolic compounds have also been shown to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thus suggesting the potential utility of these compounds within tulsi to prevent chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress.4 Several studies have also reported the effectiveness of tulsi in regulating blood glucose and lipid profiles. Tulsi exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and fungal species like Candida albicans. Immunologically, tulsi has been shown to enhance macrophage activity, natural killer (NK) cell function, and antibody production in preclinical studies. Human trials have also reported improved immune markers, including lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine balance, following tulsi supplementation.6 These findings suggest the potential applications of tulsi extracts in adjunctive care for mood disorders and cognitive decline. Tulsi has also demonstrated hepatoprotective effects in chemically induced liver damage models by attenuating oxidative damage, enhancing antioxidant defenses, reducing lipid peroxidation, as well as improving liver enzyme profiles and histopathological markers.5 Human trials report minimal side effects associated with tulsi ingestion. However, tulsi may interact with anticoagulants, hypoglycemic agents, and sedatives due to the impact of this plant on metabolic and central nervous system (CNS) pathways.6 A recent animal model study reported lower sperm counts, reduced levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), as well as increased levels of testosterone in male rabbits after supplementation with fresh tulsi leaves.9 Comparatively, other studies have reported no adverse effects of tulsi or its extracts on the reproductive health of male or female murine models.4 The use of tulsi during pregnancy and lactation has not been well studied. Thus, caution should be exercised while using this herb during pregnancy. Most studies examining the health benefits of tulsi are preclinical or involve small sample sizes. Furthermore, few large-scale, randomized controlled trials with clearly defined endpoints and standardized preparations have been conducted to validate the clinical efficacy of tulsi. Although tulsi is classified as a dietary supplement in the United States, it is not approved as a drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA). Current evidence suggests that consumers and practitioners should use tulsi as a supportive, adjunctive herb, preferably under the guidance of qualified health professionals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have identified mutated immune cell clones that could point to improved treatment for refractory celiac disease. Researchers at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research and UNSW Sydney have discovered why some people with celiac disease continue to suffer debilitating symptoms despite strictly avoiding gluten. The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, used cutting-edge single-cell sequencing techniques to reveal that certain immune cells in the gut of these patients carry genetic mutations. The team's findings suggest these abnormal immune cells are driving ongoing intestinal inflammation that causes symptoms like diarrhoea, pain and malnutrition – pointing to a new way to diagnose and potentially treat the most severe form of celiac disease. Our research suggests that, in some cases, the disease may be fuelled by immune cells that have acquired genetic mutations – something we've never been able to see before." celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune condition where the body mistakenly attacks the small intestine in response to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. While most people with the condition experience relief when they remove gluten from their diet, around 1% develop refractory celiac disease, which is where symptoms persist despite strict dietary control. Type 2 is caused by abnormal immune cells that can rapidly develop into an aggressive lymphoma, but the cause of type 1 has remained a mystery – until now. "This is the first time we've been able to pinpoint a molecular signature for type 1 refractory celiac disease," says Dr Manu Singh, first author of the study and Senior Research Officer at Garvan. "We discovered that some patients with refractory disease have an accumulation of immune cells with genetic mutations, which may develop during periods of chronic inflammation, such as earlier gluten exposure. What's interesting is that these mutations share similarities with those we see in certain lymphomas – appearing to give the cells a growth and survival advantage. The researchers found that these mutated – or 'rogue' – immune cells were present in seven out of 10 patients with type 1 refractory celiac disease. "If we can confirm that these mutated immune cells are driving the disease, then we may be able to target them with existing drugs," says Professor Fabio Luciani, co-senior author of the study, Visiting Scientist at Garvan and Professor in Systems Immunology at UNSW Sydney. "For example, we found that many of these aberrant cells have mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway, which is already targeted by approved drugs known as JAK inhibitors. With more investigation, this could lead to a personalised medicine approach where we treat patients based on their specific immune cell mutations." "Understanding these mutated immune cells gives us a new way to think about why some patients don't recover on a gluten-free diet, and could help us identify which patients might benefit from different treatment approaches," adds Associate Professor Jason Tye-Din, a celiac disease specialist at WEHI who collaborated on the study. Until recently, these abnormal immune cells were undetectable using traditional methods, but new single-cell sequencing techniques have made it possible to analyse thousands of individual cells from intestinal biopsies," says Dr Singh. "This research is a great example of how new genomic technologies can uncover hidden disease mechanisms. By applying these state-of-the-art tools to celiac disease, we are beginning to solve long-standing medical puzzles and move towards more precise treatments," says Professor Goodnow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals takotsubo cardiomyopathy remains a major cause of in-hospital deaths and complications, with men facing more than twice the risk and outcomes worsening during the COVID-19 era. TC is a reversible left ventricular dysfunction triggered by physical stress, mainly in males, or emotional stress, primarily in females. Despite being traditionally viewed as a transient condition, the study underscores persistent risks of severe complications and mortality. They used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, which includes weighted and unweighted data for about 35 million and seven million hospitalizations, respectively. TC cases were identified using the ICD-10 code I51.81. However, the study relied on ICD-10 codes, which may be subject to coding errors and did not differentiate between TC subtypes (e.g., reverse-type TC). TC patients aged at least 18 years between 2016 and 2020 in the NIS database were included. The primary outcomes were cardiogenic shock, myocardial rupture, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, stroke, and cardiac arrest. A chi-squared analysis was performed to assess categorical outcomes. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate the association between length of hospital stay and independent variables. Between 2016 and 2020, out of over 148.7 million total weighted population in the NIS database, 199,890 patients were hospitalized with TC. The annual incidence of TC did not exhibit a consistent trend, but increased overall from 39,015 cases in 2016 to 41,290 in 2020. The mean age of TC patients was 67 years. TC incidence increased in all age groups between 2016 and 2020, but was consistently the highest in those aged over 61. A notable surge occurred in the 46–60 age group compared to younger adults (31–45 years), which researchers attributed to accumulated stressors, under-treated cardiovascular risks, and hormonal changes in middle age. White individuals had the highest TC incidence rate, followed by Native Americans, whereas Black people had the lowest incidence. Socioeconomic factors varied significantly, such as hospital bed size, primary payer, and median household income. TC patients had larger hospital bed sizes and higher household incomes. Most patients were on Medicare; TC rates were the highest in private non-profit and urban teaching hospitals. TC patients had a high burden of cardiovascular complications, including atrial fibrillation (20%), CHF (36%), cardiogenic shock (6.6%), stroke (5.3%), and myocardial rupture (0.02%) compared to non-TC patients. TC patients also had a higher mortality (6.58%) than non-TC patients (2.4%), with an odds ratio of 2.86 for mortality. Further, TC patients had higher odds of cardiogenic shock, CHF, cardiac arrest, and myocardial rupture. The 1.5% mortality increase from 2019 to 2020 coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, which prior studies associate with heightened stress-induced cardiac events. TC patients had a slightly higher odds of atrial fibrillation and were also twice as likely to experience a stroke. Notably, the incidence of some complications increased over the years, while others, such as atrial fibrillation and myocardial rupture, remained stable. Researchers emphasized that hormonal differences, particularly lower estrogen levels in men and postmenopausal women, might explain this disparity, as estrogen has shown protective effects in animal models of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. The multivariable analysis found that TC was associated with all-cause death, adjusted for age, ethnicity or race, sex, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, chronic obstructive lung disease, and chronic kidney disease. The median length of hospital stay for TC patients was four days, consistent throughout the study period. Conversely, female sex, older age, private insurance, treatment in the South, West, or Midwest regions, and private non-profit hospital ownership were associated with shorter hospital stays. Taken together, the data indicate that individuals with TC are at a significantly elevated risk of various cardiovascular complications. Notably, no improvements were observed in complications throughout the study years. The study's limitations include reliance on administrative coding (which may overlook TC subtypes) and potential duplicate entries from hospital transfers or readmissions.
