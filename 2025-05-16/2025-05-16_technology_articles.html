In short, he will oversee the entire product line of GM's gas-powered and electric vehicles — a position that will cover the entire life cycle of GM's portfolio and include hardware, software, services, and user experience. Anderson did say he wouldn't have taken the new job if Aurora had yet to launch its commercial self-driving truck service in Texas. In an absolutely wild turn of events, Luminar's founder Austin Russell appears to have been pushed out as CEO and board chair. You can read my coverage here, which provides a bit of an overview of how this unfolded, but I know there is so much more to this story. A separate press release, released as the company's earnings went out, announced a leadership change and that Russell had resigned following an ethics inquiry from the board's audit committee. Here's what I'm hearing from a few little birds. Luminar board member Jun Hong Heng, who is founder and chief investment officer at Crescent Cove Advisors and a mentor of Russell's, resigned a day later. Aurora has had an odd couple of weeks filled with highs — driverless commercial service woohoo! As you might expect, stocks dropped after investors got spooked about potential dilution and what this might mean for the value of Aurora's stock. The Santa Monica, California-based startup, which built an API to allow dealerships and service shops to communicate in real time with the manufacturers and software vendors that power their operations, has been operating quietly for about nine months. Chinese battery manufacturer CATL is far from a startup. Here's a potential deal that has raised some eyebrows. Federal railroad regulators are in talks with Elon Musk's tunneling firm, The Boring Company, over a multibillion-dollar Amtrak project. Flock Freight, the shared truckload freight brokerage based in California, raised $60 million in a Series E funding round led by O'Neil Strategic Capital. Tesla's plan to launch a robotaxi service in Austin next month has caught the attention of federal safety investigators. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation sent the company a detailed list of questions on its upcoming robotaxi service as part of an investigation into how the company's “Full Self-Driving (Supervised)” software operates in low-visibility conditions. Recalls are starting to pop up more in the AV sector. Now Waymo has issued a software recall on 1,200 self-driving vehicles after some of its robotaxis were involved in minor collisions with gates, chains, and other gate-like roadway objects. The company has also started trialing fully driverless robotaxis in Abu Dhabi. General Motors has been working on a new battery chemistry called lithium manganese-rich, which it says should slash costs while delivering driving range. Notably, these LMR batteries dramatically reduce the amount of nickel and cobalt compared with GM's most advanced cells, two critical minerals that aren't readily available from domestic sources in the United States. The EV maker's record quarter got a lift from rental sales and company leases. Slate Auto has racked up more than 100,000 reservations for its customizable low-cost electric pickup truck. Everyone, let's give a slow clap to Toyota for redesigning — and more importantly, renaming — its sole all-electric vehicle for the U.S. market. Meanwhile, Toyota has brought back the C-HR nameplate, but this time as an EV. Three years ago, reporter Rebecca Bellan noted that Uber was going through an Amazonification. Her pitch was that the company, like Amazon, had created a closed business loop to feed customers back into other Uber channels. The second part of that evolution has started, she reported this week. Uber appears to be moving beyond its focus on transportation and working to become a convenient super app, an aggregator of services, a daily-use lifestyle platform with its best offerings tucked behind a paywall. U.S. lawmakers introduced the Supersonic Aviation Modernization Act in a bid to revise the FAA's 52-year ban on supersonic flight over U.S. soil. Vertical Aerospace announced a plan to develop a hybrid-electric variant of its VX4, suggesting the company is pursuing opportunities in defense and logistics. Apple's next generation of its popular CarPlay infotainment software is finally launching. Google is bringing Gemini, its generative AI, to all cars that support Android Auto in the next few months. Patrick Brady, VP of Android for Cars, said Gemini will surface in the Android Auto experience in two main ways.

The startup is prioritizing sites that already have permits or licenses to operate. Fewer than a dozen sites fall under that rubric, according to filings for combined operating licenses and early site permits at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. At the sites that are closer to groundbreaking, each can support reactors with more than 1 gigawatt of generation capacity. The Nuclear Company is aiming to develop 6 gigawatts in its first fleet. The funding round arrives as tech companies and utilities are struggling to secure power for data centers. In the face of potential power shortages, tech companies have been cozying up to nuclear startups and developers. Google is working with Kairos to build 500 megawatts' worth of small modular reactors (SMR), while Amazon participated in a massive $700 million round to fund X-energy's SMR plans. The technology is inexpensive, and new projects can be developed in around 18 months. This week, the House Ways and Means Committee published its draft of a reconciliation bill that would kill subsidies for nuclear power that were granted under the Inflation Reduction Act.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most of the time, given Nothing's frequent product cadence, that phenomenon could just be referred to as any day of the week, but this time things feel different. Earlier this week, Nothing announced a partnership with KEF—a well-established hi-fi audio brand—to bring us… something. That something, as it turns out, could very well be an AirPods Max or Sony WH-1000XM6 competitor. In a YouTube video on Friday, Nothing confirmed that it's expanding its audio lineup outside of wireless earbuds and into over-ear headphones. The company says they're launching “this summer,” and more info will be available in “the coming months.” While Nothing didn't give much detail on what to expect from its first-ever over-ear entrant, one thing you can count on—especially if KEF is involved—is that it will almost for sure be the company's most expensive audio product to date. And that steeper price looks like it might not just be for audio gear. What I'm trying to say is: buckle up, transparent gadget lovers, cause things might be careening toward a big premium pothole. The safest, arguably, is that this will be a hi-fi audio product. In a statement announcing the partnership, KEF says, “Our six decades of high-fidelity audio expertise will support Nothing's expansion into new audio categories—bringing acoustic precision to products shaped by Nothing's distinct approach to design and user experience.” Though, again, we can't say for sure what the collab will produce, my money is on one of two things: the aforementioned pair of over-ear headphones or, more tantalizingly—a full-on speaker. And as I mentioned before, if there's one thing that hi-fi audio connotes, it's an even higher price tag. While KEF does make a spectrum of products across different price points, speakers tend to start at dollar amounts that are inching toward $1,000+. KEF's Mu7 over-ear headphones cost $400, which isn't unattainable compared to the broad field of premium over-ear competitors, but they're certainly pricier than any audio gear that Nothing has dabbled in to date. In a showcase on the Android Show, Nothing CEO Carl Pei teased—you guessed it—another upcoming product in arguably the company's most competitive category: phones. The Phone 3, which Pei says is coming this summer, will be a step up for Nothing in the phone space and mark its first real flagship-level device. According to Pei, the Phone 3 will have “premium materials, major performance upgrades, and software that really levels things up.” As someone who's tested pretty much every Nothing phone to date, I'm excited to see what that means in practice, but also maybe not as excited to see what that means for my wallet. Am I shocked that Nothing seems to be inching toward the premium sector? Whether Nothing has actually summoned the acumen, resources, and clout to do that is another question entirely, but I look forward to seeing its best effort.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I'd always known Doom was a highly regarded video game franchise. Still, up until now I'd only watched from the sidelines—seeing an amalgamation of wild Let's Plays of its chaotic run-and-gun combat in my poor college days, witnessing folks play it on unconventional computer appliances, and blasting composer Mick Gordon's heavy metal original soundtrack in my leisure without fully grasping the context to why its gnarly songs went so unbelievably hard on Doom (2016). Now, with id Software and Bethesda Softworks' latest entry in the 32-year-old first-person-shooter series, Doom: The Dark Ages, serving as a prequel to its newly christened trilogy—while wedding two action genres I have a high affinity for and am coming around to, sci-fi and fantasy—I've finally jumped into the deep end on the series with its newly released game on my PlayStation 5. I got something far more wild: a Doom game that somehow also channels other greats like Halo and Gears of War and yet remains purely, unapologetically Doom, packed with relentless action and satanic madness unlike anything I've played before. After sleeping on the series for too long, I'm wide awake now—Doom absolutely fucking rocks. As a prequel, Doom: The Dark Ages eases players into its mayhem, setting the stage for an all-out war between alien overlords, medieval warriors, and hell's demons. The game sees Doom Slayer under some mind control, caught in a battle where Tonka-toy-built knights (equipped with high-tech comms like the Avengers) face off against a horde led by a warlord rocking Dracula's muscle armor. Early on, Doom Slayer is treated with the same gravitas as a Final Fantasy summon, given a simple directive: annihilate everything in his path with the same cold efficiency as a walking nuclear weapon. Granted, it mainly serves as an epic backdrop, blending dark fantasy with a touch of sci-fi, all while ferrying players from one bonkers WatchMojo “Top 10 Insane Doom Slayer Kills” video moment to the next. Even beyond Dark Age‘s massive set-piece spectacles, its moment-to-moment gameplay is pure old-school gaming bliss. Throughout the game's 22 levels, frenzied players run and gun through an ambush of demons, grabbing shields, ammo, and health potions littered around the battlefield or offered as an incentive for ripping and tearing through demons with their bare hands. As its killer box art suggests, Doom Slayer fights off demons with firearms that drop from the sky like orbital supply capsules, ensuring each battle feels like an escalating arms race where hell is on the back foot. New weapons enter your arsenal at every level, allowing customization and fluid switching via the weapon wheel. Another pleasantly surprising part of Dark Age‘s combat that felt as rewarding to solve as its combat encounters was platforming its environmental puzzles. I found Dark Ages' emphasis on stopping and smelling the roses by heavily encouraging exploration to be just as much of a brain teaser as its experimental offering of combat combinations. Exploration is heavily promoted, and Dark Ages continuing the series' implementation of a map that smartly separates hard progress from side content with icons and markers for where hidden items like gold and gems to upgrade equipment was a godsend, making it easy to double back and hunt down upgrades, codex entries, or skins without losing momentum. I found it the perfect blend of action and curiosity-driven exploration for a game about killing demons. And then there's the Shield Saw—a new weapon introduced in Dark Ages that I doubted would fit Doom's FPS combat. While I was initially apprehensive over whether or not the game's implementation of a shield would bog down its lightning-fast combat, it quickly became my favorite weapon in the game. Not just because it saved my ass a ton in sticky situations, but for how much more texture its added to its gameplay. The Shield Saw isn't just for blocking oncoming sword slashes and fireballs; it also doubles as a Mjolnir-like tool, letting you grapple to secret areas to uncover treasure, execute enemies with a shield bash, or ricochet into a line of overheated enemy shields from a hail of the Doom Slayer's gunfire for explosive crowd control. By far, my favorite use case for the shield saw was with its perfect parries. Like in Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Dark Ages‘ Shield Saw transforms parrying into a high-stakes rhythm game, rewarding players who seek out oncoming green fire balls and sword slashes and send them flying back at enemies. Landing brutal in-your-face punches (or mace flails) funnels health-regenerating orbs, shields, and ammo into Doom Slayer like a vacuum. Oddly enough, my biggest gripe with the game is its soundtrack. If anything, it went unnoticed the more I played; even to a newbie, that struck me as a sacrilegious takeaway from the game. A few hours in, I barely noticed the music ramping up before fights, like it was struggling to punch above its weight (more than I was in a boss fight) to match the sheer insanity on screen. Finishing Move (known for Borderlands 3, Halo Wars 2, and The Callisto Protocol) composed the soundtrack, but for a game like Dark Ages, music needed to be a driving force, not just background noise. Eventually, I turned Dark Ages‘ music volume down and blasted Gordon's old tracks instead to make up for what the game lacked sonically. Doom: The Dark Ages is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Hence, water filters like WIRED's best-tested shower filter, the Canopy Filtered Showerhead, designed to remove chlorine before you wash with it. But note that the chlorine is entirely supposed to be there. Extremely low concentrations of chlorine or chlorine compounds, generally around 1 part per million—well below the Environmental Protection Agency's acceptable limits for human consumption—are added to water pipes to kill potential germs like typhoid and cholera and E. coli that might otherwise grow in water and shorten your life or make it briefly awful. Home filters are designed to remove chlorine after it's already done its job in the pipes. More than half of big US cities don't use chlorine, in part because free chlorine in water is highly reactive and has a short half-life and can interact with other substances to create harmful compounds thought to be carcinogenic. If you're trying to filter out chlorine compounds, it matters which one your city is using. New York, Atlanta, and Chicago use chlorine in their water systems. But Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Boston use chloramine in their water. The aroma is generally perceived as less pronounced in drinking water. Chloramine's longer half-life and longer persistence in pipes also means health authorities can use lower quantities and still maintain levels needed to disinfect pipes. But chloramine's relative stability can also make it harder to filter out of water than pure chlorine, especially using shower water filters that rely on chemical reactions to neutralize chlorine. The certification arm of the National Science Foundation, which has seen drastic and systematic cutbacks in recent months under DOGE, traditionally offers reliable testing standards for chlorine removal for water filters, certifying chlorine removal over thousands of gallons of water. And so if your city uses chlorine, the most reliable gauge of a water filter's effectiveness has generally been whether it's been tested and certified to NSF standards. Most makers of shower water filters in particular have not received certification and don't share independent data. But there's at least one exception in the United States: The Weddell Duo inline shower filter is certified to remove chlorine from water systems treated with free chlorine. So I did my own testing using home lab kits designed for pools and aquariums. In general, I found that filters that used activated or catalyzed carbon and multistage filters appeared to fare better at removing chloramine levels. Specifically, our testing indicated that only a few shower filters on the market removed chloramine down to undetectable levels, in cities with chloraminated systems.

Acer's new Swift Edge 14 AI, leading its ultraportable lineup ahead of Computex in Taipei, is a sleek notebook that weighs less than 1 kilogram (approximately 2.18 pounds) but still has plenty of ports. The Swift Edge 14 AI will use Intel's "Lunar Lake" chips, ranging from a Core Ultra 5 226V up to a Core Ultra 9 288V, with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD storage. It's notable that Acer isn't skimping on ports here. While many 13, 14, and even some 15-inch laptops have dropped to just a pair of USB-C ports, Acer's got two USB Type-C ports (supporting Thunderbolt 4), a pair of USB Type-A ports, HDMI 2.1, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. We saw this with HP's OmniBook 7 Aero, but that much I/O on an ultrabook is still pretty rare these days.Like many high-end laptops, Acer's chassis is built from a mix of magnesium and aluminum. But unlike those laptops, the company is pushing a "soft-touch" keyboard that the company says has a "unique UV-cured coating that feels like velvet and is wear- and stain-resistant." We didn't get too much time to play with this keyboard, but we're certainly hoping it stays clean in the long term, especially considering this is a white laptop.Acer is promising up to 21 hours of battery life from the 65 WHr battery, but doesn't say how it got there. If it comes close, that would match the longest-lasting laptop we've ever tested. Unfortunately, Acer hasn't removed the weird AI indicator light from its touchpad, which glows whenever you use the NPU or use Copilot (which uses the internet and does not run locally). Acer is also using Computex as a launch pad for its Swift Go 14 AI and Swift Go 16 AI, each with OLED displays and media controls built into the touchpad. All of these Swift laptops have 1080p webcams with IR support for Windows Hello.North American pricing and availability haven't been revealed just yet. Acer said that this information will be announced "closer to market availability." Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Andrew E.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The AI industry has promised to “disrupt” large parts of society, and you need look no further than the U.S. educational system to see how effectively it's done that. In fact, the disruption is so broad and so shattering that it's not clear we're ever going to have a functional society again. Probably the most unfortunate and pathetic snapshot of the current chaos being unfurled on higher education is a recent story by New York magazine that revealed the depths to which AI has already intellectually addled an entire generation of college students. “Most assignments in college are not relevant,” he told me. “They're hackable by AI, and I just had no interest in doing them.” While other new students fretted over the university's rigorous core curriculum, described by the school as “intellectually expansive” and “personally transformative,” Lee used AI to breeze through with minimal effort. The cynical view of America's educational system—that it is merely a means by which privileged co-eds can make the right connections, build “social capital,” and get laid—is obviously on full display here. If education isn't actually about learning anything, and is merely a game for the well-to-do, why not rig that game as quickly, efficiently, and cynically as possible? When you think about the current assault on the educational system, it's easy to forget how quickly this has all happened. After accumulating thousands of pages of school district documents via FOIA requests from around the country, 404's Jason Koebler found that ChatGPT has “become one of the biggest struggles in American education.” Koebler's reporting notes that, in the early days of the AI deluge, school districts were courted by “pro-AI consultants” who were known to give presentations that “largely encouraged teachers to use generative AI in their classrooms.” For instance, Koebler writes that the Louisiana Department of Education sent him… The presentation includes slides that say AI “is like giving a computer a brain so it can learn and make decisions on its own,” note that “it's time to rethink ‘plagiarism' and ‘cheating,'” alongside a graph of how students can use AI to help them write essays, “20 ways to use ChatGPT in the classroom,” and “Warning: Going back to writing essays—only in class—can hurt struggling learners and doesn't get our kids ready for their future.” In other words, AI acolytes seemed to anticipate that the technology would effectively ruin essay-writing and test-taking, and wanted to spin it to present the ruination as mere “transformation”—a new way of doing things—instead of a destructive force that would devastate education. Now, teachers, too, seem to be taking the easy way out, as a recent New York Times story shows that college professors have been using chatbots to create their lesson plans, just as their students are using them to complete said lesson. The result of all of this is so obvious that it doesn't really bear repeating, but I guess will anyways: Everybody who uses AI is going to get exponentially stupider, and the stupider they get, the more they'll need to use AI to be able to do stuff that they were previously able to do with their minds. The tech industry's subscriber-based, “as-a-service” model is obviously on full display here, except that the subscription will be to intellectual capacity. Eventually, companies will be able to pipe AI directly into your brain with the kind of neuro-implants being hawked by Neuralink and Apple. By then, of course, there will be no need for school, as we'll all just be part of the Borg collective. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. But even in a statement to clear its name, Microsoft acknowledged it can't know the full extent of Israel's use of its technologies. Job prospects in the current software industry look grim.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All leaks point towards an MCM design for the high-end variants. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. AMD is reportedly going big on core-counts with Zen 6 mobile next-generation, as suggested by a new rumor from HXL, backed by several other leakers. Codenamed "Medusa Point", these APUs will reportedly carry up to 22 hybrid cores, based on Zen 6, with classic, dense, and low-power options. Since Zen 6 is at least a year off, and mobile versions might not arrive until early 2027, we need to be careful about putting too much faith in this leak. That being said, architecturally, Medusa Point will switch to the Zen 6 architecture, which should be detailed by AMD sometime around Computex next year. It's probable RDNA 4 won't make its way to the APU landscape, since AMD's next-generation graphics architecture, UDNA 1 / RDNA 5, is projected for release during the same timeframe. This is complemented by an eight Compute Unit equipped RDNA 3.5+ based graphics engine, similar to the Radeon 860M. These mainstream Ryzen 5/Ryzen 7 configurations are likely based on a monolithic design, expected to use a 3nm class node from TSMC. Following that, next-generation APUs are shaping up to be thrilling for enthusiasts, as Ryzen 9 Medusa Point options have been rumored with a massive (up to) 22-core layout: a 12-core Zen 6 CCD (likely the same as Venice), four classic Zen 6 cores, four dense Zen 6c cores, and two LP cores. This strongly points to an MCM (Multi Chip Module) layout, where the 10-core chiplet with I/O and the iGPU from the mainstream (Ryzen 5/7) Medusa Point line would be connected alongside a beefier desktop/server-grade CCD with 12 cores, expected to be based on TSMC's N2 process. Other details, such as the memory controllers, NPU, and cache configurations, have not been mentioned. We'll have to wait and see what RDNA 3.5+ offers, especially with Intel's new Celestial architecture arriving soon in Panther Lake. However, depending on when Medusa Point hits the market, its main competitor in the mobile space might end up being Nova Lake.

The U.S. Government is reportedly planning to add "a number of Chinese chipmaking companies" to its ever-expanding export blacklist, a move that could only be prevented by the prospect of a long-trade agreement with China. As reported by the Financial Times, the commerce department has compiled a list of companies to add to its list, notably including China memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory (CXMT). The list, drafted by the Bureau of Industry and Security, reportedly includes subsidiaries of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), and Yangtze Memory Technologies Co, China's biggest chipmaker and memory chipmaker respectively, both of which are already listed. Announced in Geneva, the two have reached an agreement to rescind reciprocal tariffs for 90 days in the hopes of striking a more permanent and broader deal. Seven of those were involved in quantum tech development for military application, while two had supplied restricted components to Huawei and HiSilicon, both of which are blacklisted. It comes as the U.S. government also issued a global crackdown on the use of Huawei's Ascend AI chips, which it says violates export controls.

It was also about protecting the company from disparate impact lawsuits, where any difference in the makeup of a company compared to the general public could be interpreted as discrimination, regardless of whether it actually does discriminatory practices.My guess is that these companies feel that with the new US administration the risk of these kind of lawsuits has decreased significantly.
