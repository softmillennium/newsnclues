On a special episode (first released on May 14) of The Excerpt podcast: There's something to cold hard cash. You can hold it; you can smell it; it feels a certain way in your pocket. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump directed the Treasury Department to stop minting pennies. What happens as the world of currency goes increasingly digital? Will traditional currencies soon become a thing of the past? And who stands to benefit, and who might this rapid shift be hurting? Neha Narula, Director of the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab, joins The Excerpt to take a closer look at this transition period for money and how it might evolve.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following allegations that former DeGods CEO Rohun Vora, sometimes Frank DeGods, suffered a wallet hack leading to the illegal sale of 16 DeGods NFTS valued at around $19,000, the NFT community is buzzing. The episode happened just a few days following Frank's resignation, casting doubt on security procedures and openness inside the DeGods project. Frank announced his leaving from DeGods on May 12, 2025, on his X (previously Twitter) account, saying, “I committed 3 years of sleepless nights attempting to make DeGods & y00ts a success. Just three days later, sixteen DeGods NFTs from his Solana wallet sold on the Magic Eden market. Frank's laptop, which he used for transactions, had been hacked, according to a Discord message apparently from the DeGods team. This hack supposedly allows an illegal visitor to access his wallet and sell the NFTs. The NFT community is still split, notwithstanding formal words. Some members wonder about the incident's timing, as Frank's resignation marked the beginning of sales not too long ago. Others note that only DeGods NFTs were sold, implying there might be a planned liquidation instead of a hack. This episode adds to the difficulties DeGods must deal with already. The project has also come under fire over its Solana to Ethereum and back migration, as well as the November 2023 closing of its Points Parler incentive program. Project managers and participants have to give protecting wallets and sensitive data priority as digital assets grow ever more valuable. For the larger crypto community, this episode serves as a warning story stressing the possible dangers connected with insufficient security protocols. Stakeholders wait for more explanation as investigations go on to rebuild confidence and guarantee the integrity of digital asset management techniques.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World Liberty Financial's USD1 stablecoin is now operable across multiple blockchains through an integration with Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), the companies announced Friday. That's according to World Liberty Financial's team, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, and the son of U.S. President Donald Trump, Eric Trump, who announced the cross-chain capabilities at Consensus 2025. USD1, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin launched by the decentralized finance protocol inspired by Trump, has seen significant growth since its debut, reaching $2 billion in market capitalization. The stablecoin was used to close MGX's $2 billion investment in Binance. The stablecoin was for now largely siloed within single blockchain ecosystems, yet the CCIP integration will allow it to move freely across blockchains. Historically, vulnerabilities in cross-chain bridges have cost users nearly $3 billion, they added. "Chainlink is absolutely critical to merging traditional finance and decentralized finance, which has been our mission at World Liberty Financial ever since the start," said World Liberty co-founder Zak Folkman. "We don't see a world where DeFi exists in its own ecosystem and traditional finance carries on but we believe in a very short amount of time that they will, in fact, merge and just be the future of finance. So to that end, World Liberty Financial, our USD1 token is now bridgeable across chain thanks to the incredible people at CCIP which have enabled this cross chain compatibility, currently." The collaboration builds on an earlier integration where Chainlink's price oracles were used to support World Liberty's deployment of an Aave v3 instance. Before joining CoinDesk he worked at major financial and crypto publications. He owns bitcoin, ether, solana, and PAXG above CoinDesk's $1,000 disclosure threshold.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Momentum in the crypto markets is rising once again. With Bitcoin hovering near key resistance and altcoin dominance increasing, digital asset participants are positioning themselves early. The next bull run is expected to be led by utility-driven projects that solve real-world issues, integrate seamlessly with mainstream tech, and scale effectively across networks.Among these, Qubetics ($TICS) is being spotlighted as a transformative force. Unlike legacy blockchains limited by siloed ecosystems, Qubetics is purpose-built for developers, professionals, and businesses seeking to bridge networks, boost productivity, and deliver secure cross-chain applications. Here's a close look at the five best altcoins to buy for next bull run. Together, these tools allow professionals and teams to create, test, and deploy cross-chain applications in real time, without the bottlenecks of switching between environments. A fintech startup is using Qubetics IDE to launch a decentralized remittance app that interacts with Polygon, Ethereum, and Cosmos-based smart contracts in one unified flow. Meanwhile, a gaming company has prototyped a multi-chain NFT inventory system where users can earn in Solana and redeem in Avalanche. These developments make Qubetics especially appealing to builders looking to develop dApps that work fluidly across protocols, APIs, and security layers—all within a non-custodial, self-sovereign framework. The Qubetics crypto presale is in its 34th stage and gaining serious traction. Priced at $0.2532 in this stage, $TICS presents a high-potential entry point. Predicted ROI scenarios show why community members are paying attention: $TICS at $15 after the mainnet launch delivers an estimated 5,822% ROI. These numbers, backed by Qubetics' technological fundamentals, present a compelling case for participation before the presale concludes. Qubetics offers unmatched cross-chain developer tooling, non-custodial security, and ROI potential that outshines most early-stage tokens. Recently, the platform announced integration support for generative AI rendering and real-time neural radiance fields (NeRFs). These updates enable AI startups and creators to leverage decentralized GPU power for high-performance workloads. The Render Foundation is also forming partnerships with film studios and digital content platforms to streamline production pipelines. For 3D creators, visual effects artists, and AI developers, Render offers a low-cost alternative to centralized cloud services—while allowing them to monetize idle GPU resources. Render's real-world utility in AI and digital content delivery positions it as one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. Litecoin has quietly reasserted itself as a market staple. This development reflects growing institutional confidence in LTC as a decentralized, commodity-grade digital asset. Litecoin recently surpassed 200 million total transactions and has seen over 300,000 active wallets monthly. With near-zero downtime, low fees, and high transaction throughput, Litecoin remains an essential peer-to-peer settlement network. Its interoperability with Dogecoin via merged mining and increased support from payment processors such as BitPay add further credibility to its future relevance. Litecoin's network maturity, institutional interest, and infrastructure reliability make it a low-risk, high-upside asset for the next crypto cycle. Theta is no longer just a decentralized video platform. It recently launched EdgeCloud, a distributed computing layer for AI and media workloads. Backed by strategic partnerships with Samsung and Google Cloud, this expansion aims to compete with traditional CDN and GPU rendering services. EdgeCloud supports use cases like AI video editing, model training, and decentralized storage for high-bandwidth streaming content. In addition, Theta has gained adoption among Web3 content creators who want full monetization control without being subject to centralized platform rules or fees. Theta's evolution into a full-stack Web3 media infrastructure makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. Its low fees and instant settlement have made it the go-to network for cross-border payments in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The chain's energy-efficient consensus model and high TPS capacity make it well-suited for sustained global usage, especially where mobile-first access is essential. Tron's global payments dominance, stablecoin adoption, and DeFi integration secure its place among the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. Altcoins with real-world utility, technical strength, and strong community adoption are leading the charge into the next cycle. Qubetics offers groundbreaking development tools and unmatched ROI potential. Litecoin is entering a new phase of institutional legitimacy. With Qubetics still available at $0.2532 in Stage 34 of its crypto presale, early buyers can gain access to a token engineered for long-term dominance.

SkyBridge Capital Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci has weighed in on what it would take for Bitcoin to reach $1 million. Cryptocurrency regulations play a critical role in Scaramucci's analysis. Amid a market resurgence in recent weeks, investors in Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, have grown increasingly optimistic and $1 million price predictions are again flooding headlines. Recently, SkyBridge Capital Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci has weighed in on what it would take for the asset to achieve this seemingly far-flung dream. In an interview with prominent market commentator Anthony Pompliano last week, Scaramucci said there will need to be more buy-in from market players with trillions of dollars in capital, particularly sovereign wealth funds, for Bitcoin's price to hit the $1 million mark.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have long reigned as the meme coin kings, winning over investors with their humor, hype, and strong communities. DOGE is currently trading at $0.231, slipping 2.01% in the last 24 hours, while SHIB sits at $0.000016, down 0.42% during the same period. Meanwhile, a new contender is shaking things up—Lightchain AI. With an exciting presale price of $0.007125 and over $20.3 million already raised, this innovative project is quickly becoming a favorite for investors looking to ride the next big wave in crypto. Both dog-inspired tokens have seen spectacular rallies in the past, often driven by social media hype and endorsements from celebrities. But to sustain that momentum takes more than hype, it requires constant new development and tangible uses in the real world. Likewise, Shiba Inu is building its ecosystem with projects such as ShibaSwap and the soon-to-come Shibarium layer-2 solution. Sustainability depends on creating authentic value beyond speculation and market cycles." Lightchain AI sets itself apart by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence into its blockchain infrastructure. At the core of this innovation is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a groundbreaking feature designed to handle AI-specific tasks such as model training and inference directly within the blockchain environment. Additionally, Lightchain AI introduces a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of Intelligence (PoI). This mechanism enhances network security while incentivizing nodes to perform valuable AI computations. By aligning network security with productive work, Lightchain AI creates a synergistic ecosystem that drives both technological advancements and practical utility. Lightchain AI's presale success has investors lining up, drawn to its bold vision and game-changing tech. While some tokens wait around for their next "to the moon" moment, Lightchain AI is busy building a platform ready to shake up the crypto and AI worlds. If you're looking for a project with real-world potential and forward-thinking innovation, Lightchain AI might just be the shiny new coin you've been waiting for.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In addition, it makes layer-two protocols like Arbitrum more efficient by increasing the number of blobs per ETH block from 6 to 9. Ethereum developers expect that Pectra will make the smart contracts blockchain more scalable, faster, and cheaper to use. The upgrade aims to solve some of the issues that have allowed competing networks like Solana and Sui to thrive and attract significant transaction volumes. However, Ethereum is still the largest of these networks by total value locked (TVL) and stablecoin reserves. This is a key competitive edge that has allowed Ethereum to maintain its lead in this space as decentralization reduces the risk of 51% attacks. For a few weeks, we have been sharing an Ethereum price prediction based on a historical pattern of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) that has always been followed by strong rallies for ETH. As we predicted initially, a bullish breakout of the token's consolidation rectangle would lead to a retest of its former trend line support at $3,000. At first glance, an overbought RSI may be considered a warning signal that the rally has gone too far too fast. However, as these same historical patterns show, this is not the first time that the RSI has gotten this high and it does not necessarily mean that the price cannot move any higher. If history repeats, or at least rhymes, the rally can still keep going even if the RSI starts to drop. This means that ETH could still reach that $3,000 target in the near term and could go even higher if FOMO kicks in as this is a major psychological threshold. Back in February, the price experienced significant selling pressure when it got to this level. Interestingly, the Fear and Greed Index back then stood at around 76. Not too far from where it is right now at 69. Investors should stay safe in these stretched conditions and avoid being overly greedy as most technical indicators are flashing warning signals that the market may have gotten ahead of itself already.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EIP-7702 revolutionizes Ethereum EOA wallets, blending transaction flexibility with smart contract automation. Ethereum's recent Pectra upgrade is sparking a surge in smart account usage, redefining how users interact with the network. Data compiled by Base analyst 0xKofi from Bundle Bear shows that more than 26,000 wallets have transitioned to the new smart account format powered by the EIP-7702 in the Pectra upgrade. EIP-7702 is a new standard that lets regular Ethereum wallets operate like smart contracts, without losing their original address or flexibility. Traditionally, Ethereum wallets fell into two categories: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), which could send transactions but lacked programmability, and Smart Contracts addresses that could automate tasks but couldn't initiate transactions. This unlocks a wide range of features, including automated spending, scheduled payments, and multi-step actions rolled into one transaction. More importantly, the update also allows Ethereum users to pay fees in tokens other than ETH, adding a further convenience layer. Ethereum EOA users can activate these innovative features by authorizing a smart contract that governs their wallet activity. This contract serves as the logic layer for transactions. Data from Base analyst 0xKofi shows that smart accounts have gained traction beyond Ethereum and are widely adopted on layer-2 networks like Base and Optimism. As of press time, 13,013 smart accounts exist on Ethereum's mainnet. These accounts have collectively triggered nearly 124,000 authorizations since the upgrade launched.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum researcher Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that launching a 51% attack on Bitcoin would be “much cheaper” than on Ethereum, estimating the cost at around $10 billion. His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.” Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and said a successful attack is “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. Related: Coin Metrics research shows BTC and ETH are immune to 51% attacks Drake said that “to have 100% control of the chain, you need 50% + 1 of stake.” He said that it would be extremely difficult and expensive, but far from impossible: At the time of writing, there were 34,168,987 staked Ether (ETH) worth nearly $89.6 billion. Related: Big miners pose a growing existential threat to Bitcoin Matan Sitbon, the founder and CEO of blockchain interoperability developer Lightblocks, told Cointelegraph that Ethereum has an additional feature to defend against such attacks. Drake also highlighted another advantage that he claims Ethereum has over Bitcoin. Bitcoin's simpler proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism has a smaller attack surface and longer reliability track record, but it lacks this feature. He said that for Bitcoin, the necessary amount of computing power and energy “makes a sustained attack highly improbable,” while for Ethereum, “PoS introduces additional economic and governance deterrents.” Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We have fined Newcastle based sole trader Darian Bishop, trading as ECO4U, £50,000 for making over 194,000 unlawful marketing calls to people on the UK's 'do not call' register. Bishop's unlawful calls related to grants for new boilers and solar panels, with the inference made during the calls that he was connected to a government scheme. It is against the law to make marketing calls to people who have been registered on the Telephone Preference Service register (TPS) for more than 28 days, unless they have explicitly consented to receive the calls. “Our investigation clearly showed this individual was fully aware of the law in relation to making marketing calls yet went ahead and made them anyway. “Our fine shows that we will hold all those who flout the law to account, from sole trader to larger companies employing a number of staff, and should act as further warning that we continue to pursue and fine companies who choose to ignore the law in pursuit of financial gain.” We became aware of Bishop during wider enquiries relating to an increase in complaints received about the energy and home improvement sector. An investigation began in October 2023 after we and TPS received 21 complaints. Bishop maintained he received valid consent after people completed an application form via a Facebook advertisement. A sample of complainants were contacted during the investigation, all of whom confirmed to us either they did not complete an application form or they did not use Facebook. “Reminded caller about TPS scheme to which I belong. When I said I wouldn't do anything over the phone he was asking if he had the right address and would send someone tomorrow. “Although this company identified themselves as Echo Government Scheme Deal, they initially said they were calling on behalf of a government scheme about my gas boiler. I'm concerned about companies claiming to have a government connection, talking about scheme that do exist – in this case the Green Deal – and trying to give their call a degree of official authority.” We urge all businesses operating in this sector to consult and abide by published guidance and also take up the opportunity of speaking to our experts via its helpline should obligations remain unclear. In October 2023, the British Library reported a ransomware attack to us, which escalated because of the lack of multi-factor authentication on an administrator account. We have fined AFK Letters Co Ltd (AFK) £90,000 for making more than 95,000 unsolicited marketing calls to people registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), in a clear breach of electronic marketing laws. We have fined Merseyside-based DPP Law Ltd (DPP) £60,000, following a cyber attack that led to highly sensitive and confidential personal information being published on the dark web. It's 1984 and nestled away on Charles Street, Manchester, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has been founded - responsible for overseeing a new law to uphold people's privacy rights when sharing their personal information. More can be done by the financial services sector when dealing with children's data. Statement given yesterday from the ICO on data protection complaint response times.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Banks and FinTechs can act as stablecoin issuers, custodians and fiat liquidity providers, but U.S. regulatory hurdles — highlighted by political blocks like the GENIUS Act — may ultimately shape their future more than the technology itself. Solutions in search of problems tend to get nowhere. Stablecoins are being held as more than a cryptocurrency curiosity, as evidenced by news Thursday (May 15) that Mastercard launched a stablecoin-focused partnership with crypto payments FinTech MoonPay. The benefits of stablecoins can be enticing, particularly in cross-border and emerging market transactions. Still, like all powerful tools, stablecoins' value depends on the system they're part of. On paper, stablecoins may seem like the perfect bridge between two financial worlds. Citi Institute's Future of Finance think tank projected that the stablecoin market could jump to at least $1.6 trillion by 2030, assuming regulatory support and institutional integration continue apace. The key to unlocking their full potential could lie in partnerships for seamless fiat on- and off-ramps, as well as widespread acceptance from merchants and consumers. See also: 3 Things Payment Stakeholders Can All Agree On About Stablecoins But most Americans still bank with institutions that are centuries old. Today, most stablecoin entry points still rely on centralized crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance or Kraken. These platforms offer fiat gateways where users can link bank accounts or cards to buy stablecoins. That means embedding on-ramps into FinTech apps, remittance platforms and retail bank services. Emerging markets, where banking infrastructure is often limited or unreliable, stand to benefit the most. For example, Ramp announced May 7 an expansion of its issuing partnership with Stripe to launch stablecoin-backed corporate cards designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. Currency.com CEO Konstantin Anissimov told PYMNTS this week that there has been “a big shift in terms of adoption of stablecoin payments that is being driven by uncertainty in geopolitics.” “I am personally seeing a big increase of small to medium enterprises utilizing stablecoin payments because banking rails are harder and harder to use,” Anissimov said.

Equally critical are off-ramps — the pathways through which users convert stablecoins back into fiat currency. That's in part why, rather than resisting, banks can reposition themselves as custodians of digital assets, offering secure storage and compliance partnerships that handle know your customer and anti-money laundering obligations for stablecoin issuers. At the same time, they can serve as liquidity providers offering fiat backstops and redemption services. The USD1 token, unveiled at a Dubai conference and reportedly used in a $2 billion Binance investment by Abu Dhabi's MGX, raised eyebrows and strategic questions. That foray, as well as others, resulted in the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act, a bill to promote stablecoins, being blocked in the U.S. Senate over political disagreements.
