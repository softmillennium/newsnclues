                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court on Friday granted a request by Venezuelan nationals seeking an injunction against their removal from the United States under the Alien Enemies Act. In an unsigned decision, the court said the Trump administration had not given the detainees enough time or adequate resources to challenge their deportations. "Under these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster," the ruling said. "To be clear, we decide today only that the detainees are entitled to more notice than was given on April 18," their ruling said. The justices noted they were granting only temporary relief while the case returns to a lower federal appellate court sorts out the question of how much notice is due to those being targeted for removal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. tech giants Nvidia, Cisco and OpenAI are supporting the "UAE Stargate" artificial intelligence data center announced this week, a source familiar with the deal confirmed Friday. AI chip leader Nvidia will supply hardware with the latest Blackwell GB300 systems, the source confirmed. Co-founder Larry Ellison was part of the U.S. Stargate announcement. The Abu Dhabi data center announced Thursday will be built by the Emirati firm G42. The massive campus will have 5-gigawatt capacity and cover 10 square miles. Trump was in the UAE as part of a first foreign trip abroad in his second term. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Cisco President Jeetu Patel were all in the UAE as well. The first phase of UAE Stargate includes a 1-gigawatt compute cluster. OpenAI announced in February that it was considering building U.S. Stargate data center campuses in 16 states that had indicated "real interest" in the project. The 16 states were Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and West Virginia. Construction on the data center in Abilene, Texas, is currently underway and is expected to be completed in mid-2026. On Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, Huang announced that Nvidia would sell 18,000 Blackwell chips to Saudi company Humain. The GB300 chips, which were announced earlier this year, will be used in data centers totaling 500 megawatts in Saudi Arabia, according to remarks at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh. AMD said it would also supply chips to Humain. CNBC's Hayden Field contributed to this story. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this week, Anthropic received a $2.5 billion, five-year revolving credit line to amp up its liquidity in an ever-expanding — and expensive — competition in the artificial intelligence industry. Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI research executives, launched its Claude chatbot in March 2023. The company closed its latest funding round in March at a $61.5 billion valuation, and the new credit facility adds to that. Revenue chief Kate Jensen said in a recent interview with CNBC that the number of customers spending more than $100,000 annually with Anthropic jumped eightfold from a year ago. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Canada and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group all participated in the credit facility. Companies are seeking more funding and liquidity than ever before as the AI arms race intensifies. The generative AI market is poised to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade. Companies from Google and Amazon to Anthropic and Perplexity are racing to announce new products and features, especially as the race to build "AI agents" intensifies. "This revolving credit facility provides Anthropic significant flexibility to support our continued exponential growth," Krishna Rao, Anthropic's finance chief, said in a statement. OpenAI announced similar news in October, when CNBC reported it had received a $4 billion revolving line of credit. The influx brought the company's total liquidity to more than $10 billion and came soon after it closed a funding round at a then-valuation of $157 billion. JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Santander, Wells Fargo, SMBC, UBS, and HSBC all participated. OpenAI's base credit line is $4 billion, with an option to increase it by an additional $2 billion. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla has appointed longtime Chipotle executive Jack Hartung to its board of directors, effective June 1. The addition comes as Tesla battles sinking EV sales and eroding profits, and concerns that CEO Elon Musk is focusing too much attention elsewhere, including in his role leading President Donald Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The company's stock price is down 14% this year. Musk began his company's earnings call last month by saying that his time spent running DOGE will drop "significantly" by the end of May, though he would still spend one or two days a week on his government work until the end of Trump's term. Hartung, who was known for taking a disciplined approach to Chipotle's finances during the Covid-19 pandemic, will expand Tesla's board to nine members. The SEC filing on Friday noted that Hartung's son-in-law is a service technician for the EV maker. Kimbal Musk sits on Tesla's board and served on the board of Chipotle from 2013 to 2019, during Hartung's tenure. Hartung held a variety of roles at the fast-casual burrito chain, joining the company in 2002 and rising in ranks to become its chief financial officer. Chipotle went public in 2006 and shares in the company are up by more than 100 times since then. On May 6, Chipotle announced Hartung would step down from his current role as president and strategy chief on June 1, and would stay on in a senior advisory role through early March of next year. Tesla posted a statement on social media site X, which is also owned by Musk, welcoming Hartung to the company. Hartung serves on the board of the Chicago street food business Portillo's; beauty and baby care products maker The Honest Company; and Zocdoc, a site for booking medical appointments. Tesla is currently preparing to launch its "retro-futuristic" diner in Los Angeles, which had been in development for about seven years.

The European Union is working on a new sanctions package that will target the Russian financial sector in the latest effort by Ukraine's allies to place pressure on President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a peace deal to end the war.

The bloc is also preparing to target third-party banks that are supporting Moscow's war effort, according to a person familiar with the details, who did not want to be named discussing matters that are not public. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China, for example, now faces tariffs of 30%, down from 145%, after striking a trade deal with the US that does not restore the de minimis exemption. Autos are another area of focus after Trump announced a 25% tariff on all car imports into the US, though he's since exempted imports of cars and car parts from Mexico and Canada. "April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again," Trump said during his remarks. Some economists have said that Trump's tariffs — and the uncertainty with his overall trade policy — could lead companies to raise prices on the goods they produce. Many companies have already indicated that price hikes are coming. Toward the end of 2024, some companies began to warn that they would consider raising prices on consumers if Trump implemented his broad tariff proposals. The two Chinese retailers released almost identical notices on April 16, both reading: "Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up." "To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025," Shein's statement said. Shein, a fast-fashion retailer, and Temu, a marketplace for everything from home goods to electronics, promised their US customers eight final days of low-price shopping. In addition to hiking tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump also cracked down on the de minimis trade loophole that allowed small parcels under $800 to enter the US tax-free. Shein and Temu were large beneficiaries of this loophole. Bloomberg reported that the automaker plans to raise prices on new gas and electric cars starting in May unless Trump gives the industry some relief from tariffs. Prices won't change for vehicles in inventory now. Conagra Brands CEO Sean Connolly told Reuters on April 3 that the food company may have to hike prices to offset the cost of tariffs on ingredients like cocoa, olive oil, palm oil, and a type of steel used for its canned products. Connolly said that Conagra, which makes products such as Hunt's ketchup and Chef Boyardee, imports tin plate steel for its canned food and tomatoes from Mexico. It was too early to tell how big price hikes on the company's food products would be, he added. During an April 3 earnings call, he stressed that the trade situation remains "volatile" and changes hourly. According to a memo first reported by Automotive News, Volkswagen said it would place an import fee on vehicles made outside of the US in response to Trump's 25% tariff on car imports. Kjell Gruner, Volkswagen's North America chief executive officer, recently said the carmaker would keep prices steady through the end of May but that they could increase in June. Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said during the company's March earnings call that Trump's tariff plans are likely to increase prices. "Trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronic supply chain is highly global, technical and complex," Barry said. "We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely." Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in a March interview that Trump's 25% tariff plan on goods from Mexico and Canada would likely result in price increases on produce. "Those are categories where we'll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days," Cornell said. Donald Allan, the CEO of the manufacturing company Stanley Black & Decker, said during a February earnings call: "Our approach to any tariff scenario will be to offset the impacts with a mix of supply chain and pricing actions, which might lag the formalization of tariffs by two to three months." Allan had previously told analysts in an October earnings call that the company had been evaluating "a variety of different scenarios" to plan for new tariffs under Trump. "And obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we put into the market," Allan said, adding that "there's usually some type of delay given the processes that our customers have around implementing price." On May 15, Walmart executives said price increases were likely to spike even higher, blaming Trump's ongoing trade war. US sales were boosted by shoppers looking to beat tariff-related price hikes — but despite strong first-quarter results, Walmart's chief financial officer, John David Rainey, said the extra costs are too great for the company to take on without passing part of the burden on to consumers. "We're wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb," he said. He later said in a February interview with CNBC that "we need some surety about what is going to happen" before making price changes. P&G, the consumer goods company behind brands like Tide and Charmin, is looking at raising prices on new and existing products. CEO Jon Moeller told CNBC that price hikes are "likely." "We will have to pull every lever we have in our arsenal to mitigate the impact of tariffs within our cost structure and P&L," P&G's CFO, Andre Schulten, said on a call with reporters. Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari said in March it'd raise prices by up to 10% on certain models imported to the US starting April 2. While Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 console won't see a price hike over tariffs, Nintendo said accessories for the Switch 2 "will experience price adjustments from those announced on April 2 due to changes in market conditions."

Funding to companies in the legal and legal-tech industries has tipped $999 million so far this year, new Crunchbase data provided to Business Insider shows. Investment rose to just over $2 billion in 2024, a record haul for the category. "In a VC market that's really sleepy for the rest of the world," said Zach Posner, cofounder and managing partner of The Legal Tech Fund, "this has been as hot as you can humanly imagine." Posner said he's seen scores of traditional software investors poking around legal-tech deals, eager to claim a piece of the legal industry's digital transformation. In April, Sapphire Ventures led a $60 million round for Supio, a software platform for law firms in personal injury and mass tort. Meanwhile, Bessemer, Masha Bucher's Day One Ventures, and others went in together on a seed round for Marveri, which says it's creating faster and more accurate corporate diligence. Theo Ai, a startup using artificial intelligence to predict case outcomes, tells BI it closed a $4 million seed round this month. Not long ago, selling software to law firms looked like a losing battle for startups. Lawyers worked mostly out of documents that were hard for software to read. "It was the best demo that has ever existed in the history of software, the internet, et cetera," said Posner, "and that's why it took 60 days to reach a hundred million users when it took Facebook five years. And I think that happened from that point forward is every attorney said, 'Wow, I could see how this could transform us.'" A short while later, Goldman Sachs dropped a report that said artificial intelligence could automate up to 44% of legal tasks. This forecast "was a shot in the arm to Silicon Valley," Posner said. Legal tech used to be built by former lawyers solving problems they knew. The technical moat is razor-thin, if it exists at all. Posner said he's most excited by startups building highly specialized tools aimed at narrow legal use cases. "The moats are all the way down," Posner said, referring to startups tackling precise pain points like commercial real estate lease review or contract drafting for niche industries. While Microsoft is already deeply embedded in how lawyers work, it's largely stayed horizontal, leaving room for vertical-specific players to thrive. Some startups have even built nine-figure businesses by selling what are essentially souped-up Word plug-ins. "The only thing that can be good right now," Posner said, "is vertical-specific tech that goes deep — tools that say, 'This is for residential real estate leases, we've seen it all, and we're 100% accurate.'"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft is working on a new Copilot and could unveil it at the company's Build conference next week, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider. The software giant also has grand "Agent Factory" ambitions and is developing new ways for corporate customers to manage AI agents alongside human employees, the memo shows. This new Copilot is designed to "rapidly channel an organization's knowledge into a Copilot that can 'talk,' 'think,' and 'work' like the tenant itself," according to an April 14 email sent by the Microsoft executive Jay Parikh. A Copilot that has access to these tenants would essentially be able to access customer information stored within their Microsoft 365 accounts. Supervised fine-tuning helps "to capture a tenant's voice," and the tool will also tap into OpenAI's o3 reasoning model "to shape its thought process," he said. Lastly, "agentic" fine-tuning will "empower real-world tasks," he wrote. Microsoft planned at the time to offer a public preview of Tenant Copilot at Build, according to the memo. At the same time, the CoreAI applied engineering team is also "working to launch a collaborative go-to-market plan for top-tier customers to drive successful adoption of our AI cloud," Parikh added in the memo. Parikh is the former head of engineering at Facebook. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella hired Parikh in October and tapped him in January to run a new group called CoreAI Platform and Tools focused on building AI tools. The group combined Microsoft's developer division and AI platform team and is responsible for GitHub Copilot, Microsoft's AI-powered coding assistant. "Building our vision demands this type of culture — one where Al is embedded in how we think, design, and deliver," Parikh wrote. "The Agent Factory reflects this shift — not just in what we build, but in how we build it together. Parikh has been trying to work across organizations to collaborate on AI agents, through a "new type of cross-product review" combining teams including security services such as Entra and Intune with "high-ambition agent efforts" within LinkedIn, Dynamics, and Microsoft 365. Part of this effort focuses on how to manage AI agents alongside human employees. Microsoft, for example, has been working on how to handle identity management for AI agents, according to the memo. This technology usually controls security access for human users. Now, the company is trying to spin up a similar system for AI agents. "Our hypothesis is that all agent identities will reside in Entra," Parikh wrote, though "not every agent will require an identity (some simpler agents in M365 or Studio, for instance, don't need one)." Microsoft's Copilot Analytics service is also expanding into broader workforce analytics to give corporate customers a view of how work gets done both by humans and AI agents. And Parikh looks to make Azure AI Foundry, its generative AI development hub, "the single platform for the agentic applications that you build," he wrote. "At Build, we will have the early versions of this, and we'll iterate quickly to tackle a variety of customer use cases."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Burry made a contrarian move into Chinese tech stocks with aggressive purchases from the fourth quarter of 2022. The filing showed Burry bought bearish put options on Chinese tech companies Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, and PDD Holdings, the parent of Temu. He also had put options on Chinese online travel booking platform Trip.com and AI chip giant Nvidia. Meanwhile, Scion doubled its long position on beauty giant Estée Lauder, to 200,000 shares. Burry is widely known as a value investor who targets stocks trading at depressed levels. His initial move into Chinese tech raised eyebrows, as the sector had been pummeled by Beijing's regulatory crackdown and a broader economic slowdown. Although he began trimming those holdings in late 2024, Scion still held stakes in Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, and PDD Holdings at year-end. Chinese tech shares surged this year following the rise of DeepSeek, with Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, and PDD Holdings all posting strong gains — until President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement. Tech stocks have been broadly boosted by Washington and Beijing's temporary tariff truce this week. JD.com's stock is 1% lower amid fierce competition in the food delivery space with rival Meituan. Estée Lauder shares have struggled over the past year, weighed down by ongoing economic challenges in China and recession fears in the US. The stock is down 15% year to date, but it rose 3.9% in after-hours trading on Thursday, following the disclosure of Burry's increased stake.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's America PAC is facing a class action lawsuit over its promise to pay petition signers and signature collectors. Three plaintiffs from Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Nevada filed the lawsuit on May 8. It alleged that the billionaire-backed super PAC failed to compensate individuals who signed or referred others to sign a petition during President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign. Musk's PAC initially promised to pay each registered voter in seven swing states who signed the PAC's "Petition in Favor of Free Speech and the Right to Bear Arms" $47, an amount that was later increased to $100 for Pennsylvania. The same reward was also promised for each successful referral of a registered voter in swing states who signed the petition, at $100 per signature, only in Pennsylvania. But despite repeated attempts to collect payment, Reid was never compensated, according to the complaint, and estimates he is owed "several thousand dollars." "Plaintiffs are in communication with numerous others who referred voters to sign the America PAC petition, who are likewise frustrated that they did not receive full payments for their referrals," the lawsuit alleged. "There are expected to be more than 100 Class Members, and the amount in controversy is expected to exceed $5,000,000," the lawsuit added. This is the second legal challenge regarding America PAC's petition payment promise. A separate class-action suit filed on April 1 by an anonymous Pennsylvania man in Bucks County made similar claims, alleging that Musk's PAC owes him $20,000 for signature-gathering work. "Plaintiff has repeatedly contacted Defendants, making multiple attempts to receive full payment for his referrals, but to no avail," the complaint said. In Wisconsin's Supreme Court race, Musk also promised, through a social media post, to pay $1 million each to two Wisconsin electors who had already voted and attended his event.</p>
