                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following months of speculation, Deadline has confirmed that Academy Award-nominee Ana de Armas (Ballerina; No Time to Die; Knives Out) has indeed signed on to star opposite Tom Cruise (Mission: Impossible; Top Gun: Maverick; Edge of Tomorrow) in his upcoming undersea supernatural thriller Deeper. The film, which has been in the works for nearly a decade, will be helmed by Doug Liman, who previously worked with Cruise on Edge of Tomorrow and American Made, both of which were critical and commercial successes. Deeper is based off a Max Landis spec that was sold to MGM in 2016, but Cruise's most trusted collaborator Christopher McQuarrie is now handling scripting duties, so it's likely the screenplay has undergone some drastic changes. At the moment, it's unclear which studio will ultimately pick up the film, as Cruise is currently shopping it around after Warner Bros. determined that its estimated $200 million production budget was too high for them. However, things seem to be trending in the right direction, especially now that both Cruise and de Armas are expected to be major winners at the summer box office. Cruise's Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is tracking for a five-day launch north of $70 million domestically over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, while Ana de Armas' Ballerina is projected for a $40 million opening two weekends later. Cruise and McQuarrie are also still developing their space film, working alongside NASA and SpaceX to make it happen, but it's believed Cruise is keen on making Deeper first before rocketing off into the final frontier. With The Final Reckoning due out next week, Cruise's next project will be an untitled film with 4x Academy Award-winner Alejandro G. Iñárritu, which wrapped filming on May 3 after a six-month shoot. He'll co-star with Sandra Hüller, John Goodman, Michael Stuhlbarg, Jesse Plemons, Sophie Wilde, Riz Ahmed, Emma D'Arcy, Pip Torrens, Corey Johnson, Danny Kirrane, and Joe Hurst.

(2025) More than 60 years ago, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) officially began with Project Ozma at the Greenbank Observatory in West Bank, Virginia. Led by famed astronomer Frank Drake (who coined the Drake Equation), this survey used the observatory's 25-meter (82-foot) dish to monitor Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti—two nearby sun-like stars—between April and July of 1960. Since then, multiple surveys have been conducted at different wavelengths to search for indications of technological activity (aka "technosignatures") around other stars. While no conclusive evidence has been found that indicates the presence of an advanced civilization, there have been many cases where scientists could not rule out the possibility. In a recent paper, veteran NASA scientist Richard H. Stanton describes the results of his multi-year survey of more than 1,300 sun-like stars for optical SETI signals. Unlike traditional SETI surveys that have used radio antennas to search for evidence of potential extraterrestrial transmissions, optical SETI looks for pulses of light that could result from laser communications or directed-energy arrays. This latter example has been considered in recent years thanks to Project Starshot, NASA's Directed Energy Propulsion for Interstellar Exploration (DEEP-IN) concept, and similar interstellar mission concepts. As Stanton indicated, the field of optical SETI traces its roots to a 1961 study by Schwartz and Townes. They reasoned that the best way an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) could send an optical signal that outshone their star would be with intense nanosecond laser pulses. Other optical SETI searches look for signals in infrared wavelengths, high-resolution spectra, or visible light. As Stanton related to Universe Today via email, his SETI search differs from conventional optical surveys: "My approach is to stare at a single star for roughly 1 hour using photon counting to sample the star's light at what is considered a very high time-resolution for astronomy (100 microsecond samples). The resulting time series are then searched for pulses and optical tones. The instrument uses readily available off-the-shelf components that can be assembled into a PC-based system. I'm not sure if anyone else is doing this with a significant time commitment. After years of searching, Stanton noted an unexpected "signal" on May 14th, 2023, while observing HD 89389, an F-type star slightly brighter and more massive than our sun, located in the constellation Ursa Major. According to Stanton's paper, this signal consisted of two fast, identical pulses 4.4 seconds apart that were not revealed in previous searches. He then ran comparisons against signals produced by airplanes, satellites, meteors, lightning, atmospheric scintillation, system noise, etc. As he explained, several things about the pulses detected around HD 89389 made them unique from anything seen previously: The star gets brighter-fainter-brighter and then returns to its ambient level, all in about 0.2s. This variation is much too strong to be caused by random noise or atmospheric turbulence. In over 1500 hours of searching, no single pulse resembling these has ever been detected. "D. Nothing was detected moving near the star in simultaneous photography or in the background sensor that easily detects distant satellites moving close to a target star. In 1995, astronomers at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence detected an exoplanet orbiting this star, a hot gas giant that has since been named Dimidium. However, a detailed analysis ruled out this possibility for all the pulses observed. Other possibilities that Stanton explores include refraction caused by Earth's atmosphere, possibly due to a shock wave. There's also the possibility that a gravity wave could have generated these pulses, which requires additional consideration. Another interesting possibility is that it could be the result of ETI. As Stanton indicated, whatever modulated these stars' light must be relatively close to Earth, implying that any ETI activity must be within our solar system. To explain all three occurrences (and subsequent discoveries), Stanton stresses that more data is needed. "None of these explanations are really satisfying at this point," he said. "We don't know what kind of object could produce these pulses or how far away it is. There are several examples of Optical SETI (OSETI) or LaserSETI, including the collaborative effort launched by Breakthrough Listen and the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) Collaboration. To that end, he suggests two approaches that could reveal more about this phenomenon and help astronomers place tighter constraints on their possible causes: "Look for events using arrays of synchronized optical telescopes. "Observing events with telescopes separated by a few hundred kilometers might show that any separation in the time each pulse arrives is due only to differences in the light time from the star to each telescope.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TORONTO — People travel for all different reasons, from romance, relaxation and adventure to the downright weird and wacky (did you know bat tourism is a real thing?). But one particular niche is rising in the ranks among travellers in search of unique travel experiences, and that's UFO tourism. With reports of UFO (Unidentified Flying Objects) and UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) sightings increasing in mainstream media, so too is interest among travellers in the pursuit of all things extraterrestrial. But with Canada having a moment in domestic travel right now, UFO chasers are being called to experience other-worldly adventures here in their own backyard. ), giving travellers a new reason to visit some of Canada's top destinations. So where in Canada gives you the best chance at spotting a UFO? According to a new study by Casino Days, Toronto tops the list with 283 UFO sightings to date and an average duration of 9.84 minutes per visit. But that's not all – Casino Days also ranked the Canadian provinces most likely to survive an alien invasion. Without Will Smith or Tom Cruise to save the day, these cities must rely on their military strength, food supply, freshwater access and population density to withstand a War-of-the-Worlds-esque attack. This may sound a bit kooky but for many travellers (and potential clients), it's all weirdly wonderful. So, next time a client requests an out-of-this-world vacation, tell them Canada will be hard to beat. Cindy is Deputy Editor at Travelweek and has worked for the company since 2007.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Haitian woman who had lost family members to a violent criminal gang took her revenge by poisoning 40 gang members with tainted empanadas. Haiti has long been at the mercy of violent street gangs, and many families have suffered tragedies at the hands of these ruthless criminals, but few ever dared fight back out of fear for their loved ones' safety. One woman in the Kenscoff district of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital city, made international news headlines after carrying out a massacre in the ranks of a local gang that had reportedly been responsible for the deaths of several of her family members. A respected street vendor specializing in pâtés, a Haitian version of empanadas, the woman recently offered dozens of gang members free pâtés as thanks for “protecting her neighborhood”. In reality, she was carrying out revenge against the people who had terrorized and killed several of her family members. The woman, whose name has not been revealed for protection, had long sold pâtés in Kenscoff, so the gang members had no reason to suspect anything, but on this particular occasion, the Haitian empanadas were laced with a powerful industrial insecticide. Local media reported the deaths of 40 members of ‘Viv Ansanm', a Port-au-Prince gang allegedly affiliated with former policeman turned crime boss Jimmy Cherizier, also known as ‘Barbecue'. Fearing reprisals, the woman left her home in Kenscoff, which turned out to be a good idea, as her home was burned down shortly after the poisoning incidents. She claims to have acted alone in devising and carrying out the plan. There is no information on whether she faces any charges for killing the 40 known criminals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Annabelle doll`s paranormal tour goes viral on TikTok, reigniting fear and fascination. The Annabelle doll, long considered one of the most terrifying haunted artefacts in existence, is once again causing panic online—this time on TikTok. But it wasn't until Ryan Daniel Buell, known for hosting A&E's Paranormal State, shared his TikTok documentation of the doll's arrival that things took a viral turn. One particularly eerie video showing Annabelle being moved into the penitentiary, accompanied by ominous lighting and suspenseful music, has amassed over 9.8 million views and 430,000 likes as of 13 May. The footage has stirred widespread unease among TikTok users, especially those in cities like New Orleans and Connecticut. The viral moment has also reignited debates on whether haunted artefacts should be taken lightly in the era of viral content. Following her West Virginia visit, Annabelle is scheduled to appear in New Orleans, San Antonio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky. These locations, many steeped in their own ghostly legends, have only intensified the doll's mystique. The Seekers of the Supernatural Paracon, typically hosted at Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, has not yet released its 2025 dates. Annabelle's terrifying history dates back to 1970, when a nurse in Hartford, Connecticut, received what seemed to be an innocent Raggedy Ann doll as a gift. According to the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), the doll soon began exhibiting disturbing behaviour—moving on its own, shifting positions, and leaving notes that read “Help us” on parchment paper the owners said they never had. When called to investigate, renowned demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren concluded that the doll was not possessed by a child's spirit, as initially suspected, but rather manipulated by a demonic entity seeking a human host. After conducting an exorcism, the Warrens took Annabelle into their care, sealing it in a glass case at their Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut. This on-screen depiction solidified the doll's status as a modern horror icon. Whether one believes in paranormal forces or not, the cultural impact of Annabelle is undeniable. While skeptics may argue it's all superstition, the doll's devoted believers would disagree. For them, Annabelle is no mere toy, but a vessel of dark energy—one that should remain locked away at all costs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Detroit Lions' defensive coaches spoke to the media on Thursday, including new defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard. Sheppard gave the media some insight into the reintegration of superstar defensive end Aidan Hutchinson into the mix. Hutchinson broke his tibia and fibula while on track for a career year early last season. "There's not a more resilient, mentally tough guy that that type of injury during that type of season that he was on course of having could have happened to," Sheppard said. 2 overall pick in 2022, had just been named the NFC Defensive Player of the Month for September before his injury in Week 6 against the Dallas Cowboys. He's already racked up 7.5 sacks on the year and was an early favorite for Defensive Player of the Year. Sheppard said he checked in with Hutchinson during drills on Thursday after seeing how well he looked. "I said, 'Hutch, you know how I know you back?' Sheppard is entering his first season as Lions defensive coordinator after Aaron Glenn's departure to take over as New York Jets head coach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The WB is getting some major throwback love, with fans and stars alike celebrating the unforgettable shows that shaped a generation. Stars from hit shows are catching up with fans — whether it's the Gilmore gals sharing their latest projects, former teen heartthrobs revealing what they've been up to, or the Supernatural family reflecting on their long-running monster-hunting adventures and looking ahead to new chapters. Famous faces like Lauren Graham, Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles and plenty more are dishing on life after The WB, giving Us plenty of updates, reunions and even a few new babies along the way. Whether it's nostalgia or catching up on your faves, these classic WB stories and stars are keeping viewers hooked decades later. The WB was a teenager's dream network before it became The CW in 2006, giving fans a ton of eye candy to look at on all of its hit series. More than 20 years after Gilmore Girls debuted on October 5, 2000 — and was rebooted in 2016 for a four-part update — viewers are still yearning for more from Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles not only formed a close bond with each other while playing brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, respectively, on Supernatural, but they also forged an unbreakable connection offscreen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Strict Scrutiny" co-host Leah Litman has the profile of a person who, in previous eras, would seem like a defender of the Supreme Court. She's a law professor at the University of Michigan and once worked as a law clerk for former Justice Anthony Kennedy. In her new book, "Lawless: How the Supreme Court Runs on Conservative Grievance, Fringe Theories, and Bad Vibes," Litman chronicles the decline of this once-venerated institution. She spoke with Salon about her book and how recent cases suggest the court is getting even more unhinged in this second Donald Trump administration. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. I listened to oral arguments for Mahmoud v. Taylor, and I was struck by how victimized Sam Alito acted during the entire thing. The justices keep providing me with so much content and so much material after I finished the manuscript. And there's no discrimination except against white evangelical Christians. "The uncomfortable reality is that a conspiracy theory-laden universe is in full swing at the Supreme Court." This is a children's book about a young girl being concerned that when her favorite uncle got married, he'd have less time for her. Justice Alito read it as a personal attack and rank discrimination against religious conservatives like him because her favorite uncle happened to be getting married to a man. Apparently, acknowledging that some men marry men whom they love is discrimination against Sam Alito and people who believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. I don't know what's going on in his head, but it's hard to use any word but "lying" to describe his claims during arguments. He said that the little girl in the book objected to the marriage cause she was homophobic, when she loved her gay uncle, and just didn't want him to have less time for her. Justice Alito read this book, where Chloe is concerned about her uncle's upcoming wedding, and Justice Alito seemed to read into Chloe his own views. He imagined Chloe saying something like, "Mommy, I have a sincere religious objection to Uncle Bobby's marriage to a man." And then he interpreted her mother as saying something like, "No, Chloe, that's bad. Of course, Chloe and her mother said no such thing. He read the mere acknowledgement that a man would marry a man as an expression of hostility to his worldview, which is that same-sex marriages shouldn't exist at all. Acknowledging their existence, acknowledging the existence of LGBT people, he perceives as an attack on him, because the jurisprudence he is fashioning is all about bringing about a world where gays, lesbians, and bisexuals are not allowed to have civil rights and are not allowed to live openly. Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only. There's been this myth for a long time that there might be liberal judges and conservative judges, but they all adhere to the same belief that they should follow the facts and they should follow the law. Brett Kavanaugh talked about it as "calling balls and strikes." How far have they drifted from those basic principles? It wasn't just Sam Alito, although he is the best example and encapsulation of this conservative grievance, bad vibes, fringe theory direction that the Supreme Court is headed in. During the same oral argument, you had Neil Gorsuch insisting that the book "Pride Puppy" involved a sex worker who was into bondage. Neil Gorsuch took from that and insisted, no, the book actually involves bondage and sex workers. In the 303 Creative case, which also concerned LGBTQ equality, you have the court insisting the case involved a wedding website designer with sincere religious objections, who was going to be forced to make a wedding website for a same-sex wedding. The person did not specialize in wedding website design. The Supreme Court has been running on these fast and loose characterizations of the facts for a while. We all can have a good laugh at the idea that "Uncle Bobby's Wedding" is a personal attack on people who don't believe in marriage equality. But the uncomfortable reality is that a conspiracy theory-laden universe is in full swing at the Supreme Court. It's a court captured by far-right conspiracy theories. Sam Alito and, to a large extent, Clarence Thomas get the most attention for having their brains poisoned by this stuff. But a lot of people think Chief Justice John Roberts isn't so bad. Chief Justice Roberts, this purported moderate institutionalist, struck down the key provision of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County versus Holder by inserting a misleading ellipsis into a quotation he drew from one of his previous opinions. He inserted this ellipsis, so the sentence meant the literal opposite of what it had actually said. And people ask why Donald Trump thinks he's above the law. It is closer to reality to acknowledge that on these super high-profile, ideologically salient cases, the Republican justices are where the Republican Party is. There's a recent case where reporting suggests that Samuel Alito was trying to slow walk a lawsuit regarding a bus full of Venezuelan immigrants that they were trying to send to that El Salvador in prison. The rest of the court stepped in and stopped Alito from doing that and rushed out a decision that ended up probably saving those men's lives. What is your read on that particular situation? Some lower courts had blocked the government from relying on the Alien Enemies Act to summarily expel people to this foreign megaprison in El Salvador. In doing so, they likely saved these men from being sent to El Salvador because they got the order out before the men could be transported. I'd imagine that the Supreme Court is responding in part to the administration's blatant disregard, if not outright defiance of their previous order in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, which told the administration to facilitate Mr. Abrego Garcia's return. The administration's response has basically been, "make me." Then Stephen Miller characterized the decision in Abrego Garcia as a unanimous win for the administration. As to whether they thought they can't wait on Justice Alito, because he is trying to buy the Trump administration time to deport these men, I'm not sure. We need your help to stay independent There is another case that just got going, where 12 Democratic attorneys general are suing, claiming Trump's tariffs are illegal. Which seems right to me, though I'm not a lawyer. It will be another interesting test of whether or not the Supreme Court has a limit. What are your thoughts on that case? Because it is a situation where Trump's agenda is so different than the standard Republican agenda. If you look back at the first Trump administration, there was this case challenging the entire Affordable Care Act. The state of Texas sued on this cockamamie theory that the entire Affordable Care Act had become unconstitutional when Congress reduced the penalty for not having health insurance to $0. That's another example where the zeitgeist of the Republican Party is not exactly tracking what Donald Trump is asking for. And in those instances, you have a Republican court majority that is probably closer to the median Republican in Congress or than they are to Donald Trump. Now, that means, of course, they are enabling Trump, left and right and all over the place, you know, and are on board with a lot of his agenda. But it does mean there are some differences. It seems to me that the Supreme Court often oversteps with regard to this Christian nationalist agenda. I think it is larger than that. I agree that one of the ideas they are most committed to is that conservative Christians are the victims of a society that doesn't share their views. But they are also very committed to the idea that white conservatives accused of racial discrimination are very put upon. That idea has inflected a lot of their jurisprudence on voting rights. This term, they are hearing another Voting Rights Act case that asks them to say it's actually unconstitutional racial discrimination for states to try to ensure that black voters are represented in districting. It's super transparent in the cases of religion, but it's definitely present in other areas of law as well. When I'm chatting with people on social media, I find the Supreme Court situation is the source of almost nihilistic pessimism. As you said, they are in lockstep with this increasingly ridiculous, paranoid agenda. There is no sense that will change any time soon. They sometimes seem to have king-like powers. Are there reasons to feel that this can get better? But, just like we tell people not to obey in advance for the Trump administration, don't obey in advance for the Supreme Court, either. Make them pay the price for taking away people's healthcare, voting rights, and whatnot. Second, if you are that convinced that the Supreme Court is such a destructive force on society, you should try to convince other people of that as well. If we do that, we might be in a situation where the next time progressives, the Democratic Party, the left have political power, they could exercise that political power in ways that reduce the destructive potential and powers of this Supreme Court. A majority of the country is not on board with their wild grievance-laden, retributive agenda. How much of this is Mitch McConnell's fault? Even when Republicans aren't on board with what Trump is doing, the Republican Party and people like Mitch McConnell own absolutely everything he is doing. It doesn't really matter if Mitch McConnell is occasionally voting against the nominee, voting against tariffs, or whatnot. He held open a Supreme Court seat to give Donald Trump a better chance of being elected president. He has held open seats to make room for radical extremists on the lower courts who have done absolutely wild things, like order nationwide bans on medication abortion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Being abducted by little green men might seem like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. But specialists have said people with one little-discussed issue may experience something strikingly close to this scenario. In a social media post, sleep scientist Dr Matt Walker, from the University of California, Berkeley, delved into the terrifying phenomenon of sleep paralysis, which affects only a small number of people. "Normally, during REM sleep, the brain induces muscle atonia (temporary paralysis) to prevent dream enactment. Occasionally, consciousness can return slightly before muscle control, affecting roughly 25 per cent of people. "Fascinatingly, REM sleep paralysis experiences often parallel narratives of alleged alien abductions. Dr Eti Simon theorises that muscle atonia's primary evolutionary function might be restorative, with dreaming subsequently co-opting this physiologic state." Sleep paralysis is characterized by the terrifying inability to move or speak during the process of waking up or falling asleep. This bewildering condition typically occurs during deep REM sleep, which is commonly associated with dreaming phases. People who have encountered sleep paralysis often report feeling a force pressing down on them or even sensing the presence of someone - or something - in the room with them. This puzzling phenomenon is not only tied to explanations for supposed alien abductions, but could also be a plausible explanation for ghost encounters and other supernatural experiences. Psychologist Dr Louise Goddard-Crawley previously told MailOnline: "From a scientific perspective, these hallucinations in sleep paralysis are manifestations of our internal mental processes rather than meaningful messages from an external source. The specific form that these hallucinations take can be influenced by cultural depictions, personal beliefs, and individual psychological factors." It tends to occur more frequently in people with a family history of the condition. Fortunately, you can do a few things to minimise its effects. On the flipside, patients are also encouraged to avoid smoking, eating a big meal, or drinking alcohol or caffeine shortly before bed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steven Spielberg has been filming a movie this year in New Jersey and New York, but photos on social media suggest that the movie could be a close encounter for Kansas City. “Steven Spielberg just casually transforming my campus into Kansas City,” he wrote. Another picture showed satellite dishes locked behind a fence with this sign, “KCXE 4 Broadcast Operations.” In late February, photos published by a local New York newspaper provided the strongest evidence that at least some of the action involves Kansas City. The Journal News, which covers New York's Lower Hudson Valley, published a series of photos of the filmmaking underway in White Plains, New York. A Kansas City Police Department car was on set, too. Spielberg was seen crouching next to one as he worked. “We can see Steven Spielberg there standing next to a cop car. So clearly parts of it are going to take place in Kansas City,” UFO sleuth Patrick Scott Armstrong said on his podcast, “Vetted,” while discussing the film. “I saw the ambulances on set all said Jackson County this morning,” another Reddit user responded. Spielberg has filmed other projects in the Northeast and is so familiar with the area he reportedly told one mayor to never change his town. “We have world-class crews, diverse locations, geographic accessibility and competitive film incentives that make filming in KC a good business decision,” she said. Asked about the Spielberg film, the office said in a statement that it did “not have any further details to share regarding this project.” The film is said to be based on an original story by Spielberg with a screenplay by longtime collaborator David Koepp, who worked with him on the first “Jurassic Park” film and two “Indiana Jones” movies. Blunt stars alongside Wyatt Russell, Colin Firth, Colman Domingo, Josh O'Connor and Eve Hewson. The film is slated for a June 12, 2026, premiere which sets it up to be Spielberg's return to big summer blockbusters like “Jaws” and “Jurassic Park.” “This car does not resemble any Kansas City Missouri Police cars,” KCPD spokesman Jacob Becchina told the Star.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Being abducted by aliens may sound like something pulled straight out of a science-fiction movie. Yet, experts say people who suffer one little-known issue may 'experience' an eerily similar ordeal. In a new Instagram post, he shed light on the frightening phenomenon of sleep paralysis, experienced by just a small fraction of people. "Normally, during REM sleep, the brain induces muscle atonia (temporary paralysis) to prevent dream enactment. Occasionally, consciousness can return slightly before muscle control, affecting roughly 25 per cent of people. "Fascinatingly, REM sleep paralysis experiences often parallel narratives of alleged alien abductions. Dr Eti Simon theorises that muscle atonia's primary evolutionary function might be restorative, with dreaming subsequently co-opting this physiologic state." As Dr Walker suggests, sleep paralysis describes a state in which a person cannot move or speak while waking up or falling asleep. Although it's unclear how this occurs, it is generally believed to happen when someone reaches deep REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which is usually when we dream. People who experience this phenomenon often describe the sensation of something pushing them down, or even feel like there is someone else in the room. Psychologist Dr Louise Goddard-Crawley previously told MailOnline: "From a scientific perspective, these hallucinations in sleep paralysis are manifestations of our internal mental processes rather than meaningful messages from an external source. The specific form that these hallucinations take can be influenced by cultural depictions, personal beliefs, and individual psychological factors." It's also more common among people with a family history of the issue. Thankfully, you can do a few things to alleviate its effects. It is especially recommended that you go to bed at roughly the same time each day and regularly get seven to nine hours of sleep. NHS guidance adds: "A GP may be able to treat an underlying condition that could be triggering sleep paralysis such as insomnia or post-traumatic stress disorder. If this does not help they might refer you to a doctor who specialises in sleep conditions."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japan's Defense Ministry was urged to set up an office tasked with tackling UFOs at a meeting with a cross-party group of lawmakers on Friday. The group, chaired by former Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, handed a proposal to the current defense chief, describing such sightings -- formally referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP -- as realistic and serious national security concerns. "Our country has fallen behind in responding to UAP, while securing safety in territorial airspace and waters is an urgent matter," the group said, calling for the establishment of a Japanese version of the U.S. All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. The Pentagon office was founded in 2022 to lead U.S. efforts to address UAP through a rigorous scientific framework and a data-driven approach. The lawmakers also proposed that a new office regularly report the progress of UAP investigations to parliament and disclose information to the public, in addition to conducting scientific analysis of collected data and identifying potential threats. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said, "We will make efforts to meet the expectations" of the group, which was formed last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The half-a-billion-year-old creature, Mosura fentoni, reveals that Cambrian arthropods were more diverse than previously thought. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Half a billion years ago, a feisty predator flapped around the primordial seas, hooking prey into its mouth while breathing through long gills on its butt. The fossils suggest that these early arthropods were more diverse than previously thought. The team thinks the now-extinct arthropod would have looked a bit like a moth — a distant living cousin — so they named it after Mothra, the fictional giant moth from Japanese cinema. Despite its small size, this tiny creature represents a huge and rare find for scientists. This is extremely rare for fossils, which scarcely preserve soft tissues, and helps shed light on the evolution of ancient arthropods. "Very few fossil sites in the world offer this level of insight into soft internal anatomy," study co-author Jean-Bernard Caron, the Richard M. Ivey curator of invertebrate paleontology at the Royal Ontario Museum, said in a statement. Related: Scientists uncover 'inside-out, legless, headless wonder' that lived long before the dinosaurs Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Arthropods are a large group of invertebrates with hard exoskeletons, segmented bodies and jointed legs. Today, they make up around three-quarters of all living animals, including insects, arachnids and crustaceans. These variable segments have helped arthropods diversify within their groups and ultimately become everything from horseshoe crabs to moths. M. fentoni belonged to a group of ancestral arthropods called radiodonts, identifiable by shared features like side flaps and head appendages. These invertebrates thrived during the Cambrian period (541 million to 485 million years ago), but their fossils have shown relatively uniform body segments with little variety, until now. Researchers collected 60 fossils of the newly described species between 1990 and 2022, primarily from the Raymond Quarry, part of Yoho National Park in British Columbia. "Museum collections, old and new, are a bottomless treasure trove of information about the past," study lead author Joe Moysiuk, curator of paleontology and geology at the Manitoba Museum, said in the statement. —Giant 'sea dragon' fossil could be largest mosasaur ever discovered in Mississippi They found that, unlike other radiodonts, M. fentoni had lots of body segments on its rear, which were lined with gills. The team concluded that the back-end gills were most likely a specialized system for respiration; horseshoe crabs, wood lice and some other living arthropods have subsequently evolved a similar system. Researchers aren't certain why M. fentoni needed the long butt gills, but they speculated it was an adaptation to low-oxygen environments or an active lifestyle — possibly a very active reproductive lifestyle — that required greater oxygen consumption. Either way, the discovery highlights that radiodonts were more diverse than previously thought. "The new species emphasizes that these early arthropods were already surprisingly diverse and were adapting in a comparable way to their distant modern relatives."
