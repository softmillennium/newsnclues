                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz overcame Musetti and windy conditions in just over two hours to reach his fourth final of the season ahead of the French Open, which gets underway later this month. Alcaraz now awaits the result of Sinner's last-four clash with Tommy Paul later on Friday to see if he will get the showdown that tennis fans around the world want to see. World number one Sinner is the red-hot favourite to beat American Paul after dumping out Madrid Open champion Casper Ruud on Thursday with an astonishing display of tennis. Everybody saw the game against Casper," said Alcaraz, who might again have to face down a partisan centre court crowd on Sunday. If I'm going to play against Tommy Paul, I have to be ready for that. If I play against Jannik, I have to be ready for that battle, and obviously deal with the crowd." Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display. The 23-year-old gave up three breaks of serve and made 29 unforced errors in the first set, and he was warned by umpire Renaud Lichtenstein after slamming his racket into the clay as he gave up his serve to go a set behind. But Musetti fought back with another break of Alcaraz's serve and then held his with more disciplined tennis to go to 4-3 in the set, even drawing applause from Alcaraz for one spectacular backhand volley he plucked out of the sky. Alcaraz served that game to love as Musetti continued to fume, and he ended the crowd's hopes of an all-Italian final by coming through the decisive tie-break</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It all added up for Tommy Paul earlier this year when he cracked the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time. Will he next achieve one of his biggest goals: claiming ATP Masters 1000 glory? The American is trying to do just that this week at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, where he is into the semi-finals with a run that has included a victory against longtime foe Alex de Minaur, who had led their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 5-0. ATPTour.com caught up with Paul at Indian Wells to discuss why playing De Minaur is difficult, his greatest success, why he doesn't feel he has dealt with too many difficulties and plenty more. Rafa and Roger, it's my favourite rivalry in tennis. I don't know if it's a rivalry, because he's got me so many times, but me and Demon [Alex de Minaur] have had some serious wars, and he's got me in some big matches, so I'm out for revenge on Demon. What makes him so tough to play? I would say my greatest success so far is last year in Queen's [Club], winning the 500 title. What's the greatest difficulty you've had to overcome? I don't like to feel like I've had too many huge difficulties in my life. I play tennis for my job and for a living, and I think life's been pretty good. What's been the most unique moment in your career? Transitioning from juniors to pros is unique. I think for a lot of people it's easier than others and for me it was a difficult time, but definitely a big change in lifestyle. I guess the biggest thing that I'm chasing is a tournament, a Masters 1000 title or Top 5 in the world. How long have you been pursuing that? I feel like every time I go to a tournament, the goal is to win the tournament. My favourite tournament to play in is either Indian Wells, Wimbledon, or the US Open. And Indian Wells, because [it is] tennis paradise. What's been the coolest off-court experience you've been able to enjoy being a professional tennis player? I've gone to a lot of really cool sporting events, whether it's on the Tour or at home. Has being a professional tennis player given you some better fishing opportunities? Before the [US] Open, a couple years ago, we went fishing in the Hamptons, and that was quite an experience. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every major sportswear brand brings its best apparel and footwear to the Grand Slams. Clay court season is in full swing, and the tennis world is preparing to descend upon Paris for Roland Garros later this month. Parisian culture dictates a high quality of fashion, and no company wants an unforced error on the clay courts of Philippe Chatrier. Earlier today, fans got their first look at On's "Summer" and "Mid-Summer" court collections designed for Roland Garros and the start of grass court season. It looks like On is sticking with its gradient designs for Grand Slams, this time using a rainbow mix of green, yellow, blue, and purple. Tennis fans can expect to see Ben Shelton and Joao Fonseca debut the rainbow-inspired kits on court in Paris later this month. Meanwhile, the On Women's Summer and Mid-Summer Court collection has more to offer at this time. Fans can expect to see Iga Swiatek wear pieces from the collection as she defends her French Open title. Some tennis fans on social media have expressed a desire to see On move away from the gradient patterns, but the Swiss brand always stands out on the court compared to rival companies that try to blend in with neutral designs. Stay locked into Sports Illustrated's Serve On SI for all of your tennis news from the court and beyond. Yonex releases its Paris 2025 Collection for Roland Garros.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton has had an up-and-down season on the ATP Tour, as the American continues his pursuit of a third career title. The 22-year-old still has his entire career ahead of him, and former world number one Andre Agassi recently discussed how he can best utilise those future years. Speaking on the Tennis Channel Live Podcast, Agassi said: “I love Ben. I have known his Dad for many years and had the chance to meet his Mom, such a wonderful lady, they have done such a wonderful job with him.” The guy is a force to be reckoned with. He has one of the liveliest arms you have ever seen.” “There are a number of ways he can be better, I do believe. So powerful, he can take the racket out of a lot of people's hands, nobody wants to see him next to their name in the draw.” “I think he can make life even a little easier for himself, but he is one of those guys who for two weeks can go to heaven and make some great stuff happen in the biggest moments in tennis, I really believe that.” “I have never seen him in a situation where he feels outmatched.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Often characterised by unpredictable bounces and quick kicks, grass tennis courts have long been considered one of the sport's most challenging surfaces to master. They're a key reason Wimbledon is widely seen as the most iconic tournament in tennis. Known for rewarding aggressive styles of play, the surface was once dominated by serve-and-volley specialists like Boris Becker and Pete Sampras. When discussing changing tactics in grass court tennis, Jeff Sackmann, founder of statistical website Tennis Abstract, said: “It's been a huge move towards baseline play, definitely. “If you go back to the 90s, you have Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker, Greg Rusedski and Tim Henman who would serve and volley. Speaking on the famous switch, Co-Head Coach of Wigmore Lawn Tennis Club in London, Scott Davies, said: “Although before this change, the grass courts were faster, their durability was worse. This has caused some players and fans to believe that grass courts have slowed down in recent years, according to Tennis View Magazine. When discussing strong indicators of surface speed, statistician Sackmann said: “Aces are great and basically, it just tells you how well the returner is able to respond. And that's going to be something influenced by the surface speed.” While rally length is also considered to be a valuable tool for measuring surface speed, Sackmann believes both produce similar results. Tennis Abstract's surface-speed metric uses ace rates to compare court speeds across ATP events, not just the Slams, indirectly factoring in external elements, such as temperature, humidity, wind, the balls used, and of course the physical surface. According to this measure, the gap between court speeds has narrowed since 1991, compared to 2023, particularly between grass and hard courts – perhaps a result of the use of ryegrass. However, clay courts, with their naturally higher friction, remain the slowest by a wide margin. While Perricard, standing at 6ft 8in with a huge serve, could be considered something of an outlier, his run to the fourth round at Wimbledon, which was his best Slam showing to date, illustrates how players with a similar toolset can excel on grass. These numbers challenge the growing belief that grass courts have slowed in recent years. Factors such as improved equipment and more intense training regimes have enabled players' to improve their athleticism  – possibly resulting in increased ace numbers. Discussing advancements in the game, tennis coach, Davies, said: “Players have sports scientists, sport nutritionists controlling pretty much every aspect of their lives.” Overall, while grass courts can still be regarded as the fastest on tour, the perception that the three main tennis surfaces have become homogenised in recent years could be explained by improvements in player conditioning and court quality – causing tennis to enter an era dominated by baseline play.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Only one Italian Open match remains and it could have a big impact on defending champion Iga Swiatek's seeding at the French Open. Four-time Roland Garros winner Swiatek has already had a setback in her seeding as she is guaranteed to slip from No 2 to No 4 in the WTA Rankings after the WTA 1000 event in Rome. But she could drop to fifth in the standings if Jasmine Paolini goes on to beat Coco Gauff and win the trophy at Foro Italico. The seedings for the French Open are based on the WTA Rankings on May 19, 2025, and Aryna Sabalenka is assured of being the top seed with Gauff second and Jessica Pegula third, but the fourth and fifth positions will only be decided after the Italian Open final. Despite her quarter-final exit in Rome, Sabalenka sits comfortably at the top on 10,683 points in the Live Rankings and she is followed by Gauff (6,863/7,213) and Pegula (6,308). It is the second major in a row where Sabalenka is the top seed as she was also at No 1 at the Australian Open after Swiatek dominated the top spot the previous few years. Swiatek is currently in fourth place after she failed to defend her WTA 1000 trophy and she has 5,838 points while Paolini is fifth on 5,515, but the Italian will move to 5,865 points if she wins the final. The other players who will be seeded in the top eight are Mirra Andreeva, Madison Keys and Zheng Qinwen with Emma Navarro and Paula Badosa completing the top 10. Aryna Sabalenka 2. Coco Gauff 3. Jessica Pegula 4. Iga Swiatek 5. Jasmine Paolini 6. Zheng Qinwen 9. Emma Navarro 10. Clara Tauson 22. Beatriz Haddad Maia 24. The top eight players can't face each other before the quarter-finals as they will each be placed in their own section of the main draw for the clay-court major while Sabalenka will headline the top half of the draw and Gauff will go into the bottom half. The next two (Pegula and one of Swiatek and Paolini) will also be split. If Swiatek ends up as the fifth seed, she could face one of the top two as early as the last eight. Fourth or fifth will be the five-time Grand Slam winner's lowest seeding at Roland Garros since 2021 when she was seeded eighth as she has been the top seed the past three editions. Jannik Sinner beats Carlos Alcaraz, Iga Swiatek facing a rankings collapse – French Open picks Iga Swiatek defended by Andy Roddick after criticism from Polish media Unlike at WTA 1000 events, the seeded players do not enjoy byes in the Grand Slams and they all have to win seven matches to secure the title. Reigning Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova is set to be seeded 15th, but there are doubts over whether or not she will play as she has not featured so far this year. The Czech is set to play in Strasbourg next week, but it remains to be seen if she will be fit enough. Just outside the cut Should any of the players in the top 32 withdraw from the French Open, then the following players are next in line to be seeded: 33. Meanwhile, Krejcikova is one of eight Grand Slam winners who are set to be seeded with the others being Sabalenka, Gauff, Swiatek, Keys, Rybakina, Ostapenko and Kenin. A look at the women who will move up and down the WTA Rankings after the Italian Open. Coco Gauff has an impressive record in deciding set tie-breakers. The French Open is a little over a week away and here are some early musings over the early favourites. Aryna Sabalenka didn't hold back as she vented her annoyance at a spectator in Rome. © Planet Sport Limited 2025 • All Rights Reserved</p>

This year, over 515 thousand participants joined our three Open Qualifiers, playing more than 9.5 million matches on the virtual Central Court. For the first time, we also integrated official Roland-Garros music and French voice-over for the umpire, small details that add up to a truly immersive experience. In 2022, we moved our competition onto the mobile game Tennis Clash, which is the perfect vehicle to connect with a broader audience through its arcade-style gameplay. As 50 percent of Tennis Clash users don't play tennis in real life, it's crucial for us that every player can experience the spirit of Roland-Garros from their smartphone/tablet in a fun & accessible way! “As 50 percent of Tennis Clash users don't play tennis in real life, it's crucial for us that every player can experience the spirit of Roland-Garros from their smartphone/tablet in a fun & accessible way!”Aymeric Labaste When we began our collaboration with Tennis Clash in 2022, we were already convinced that mobile was both the present and future of esports, with over 2.8 billion mobile gamers worldwide. Tennis Clash, as the tennis video game with the largest community (i.e. over 170 million downloads), turned out to be the ideal partner to make our Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault truly accessible and inclusive on a global scale. In 2025, we had over 515 thousand participants from 221 different territories, proof of its worldwide appeal. Lastly, knowing that 52 percent of mobile gamers are women, it has also allowed us to connect with a more gender-balanced audience. The partnership with Tennis Clash reflects our ambition to stay true to Roland-Garros' core values - international, accessibility, inclusivity and excellence - while embracing new formats that bring the spirit of our tournament to life for a new generation of tennis fans. What have been some of the biggest successes and challenges? Then, the biggest turning point came in 2022, when we partnered with Tennis Clash. Finding the right publisher sharing our ambitious vision to build a true eTennis ecosystem was essential, and that move proved to be a game changer for our tournament's popularity (238 thousans participants in 2022). Renault has supported the tournament since 2022, and Mastercard joined us in 2024. Their commitment has played a key role in helping us grow the competition into what it is today. “Another major milestone in 2025 is the participation of former tennis champions Gilles Simon & Marion Bartoli as ambassadors, a perfect symbol of how the worlds of tennis and eTennis can come together.”Aymeric Labaste This year, Gilles & Marion will each lead their own teams, as we introduce a team format for the first time. What specific initiatives or features within the eSeries have been most effective in engaging new demographics, particularly younger or disengaged audiences in different regions/territories? One of the most effective ways we've engaged new demographics, especially younger or previously disengaged audiences, has been through mobile-first accessibility. By partnering with Tennis Clash, we eliminated many traditional barriers to entry: no expensive hardware, no steep learning curve, just instant access from a smartphone or tablet. The format itself also helps: arcade-style gameplay, short matches, fast progression and an open & global qualifying system. In addition, livestreaming the Final Stage at Roland-Garros, on platforms consumed by Gen Z like Twitch or YouTube, was another key decision. It's about making the competition accessible wherever fans are as well as delivering premium and immersive content, bridging the worlds of sport and esports. How do you measure the success of the eSeries, and what metrics are most important to Roland-Garros in evaluating its impact? These metrics give us a strong sense of global engagement & accessibility. Ultimately, the media value generated for them is a crucial indicator of success. All together, these metrics help us assess how Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault is growing not only as a competition, but as a powerful storytelling and brand engagement platform for Roland-Garros. By immersing new audiences in the Roland-Garros universe through esports & live streaming, we're not only growing brand affinity but we're also inspiring more people to follow Roland-Garros and even give tennis a try. Both physical and digital aspects are essential to making Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault a true success. Our 8 finalists are invited to Paris for a full three-day experience, we feel proud to be the only eTennis competition offering such an immersive on-site experience. It starts with an exclusive esports training at GameWard, a professional French esports club, to ensure they're all gaining skills and feeling like professional players for the Final Stage. All this adds pressure and excitement for these amateur players, more used to playing on their phones at home than under the spotlight. What are your future plans for the eSeries, and how do you envision it growing and adapting in the coming years? Our main objective is to maintain our leadership in the eTennis space while establishing ourselves as a true reference for esports within the global sports industry. To achieve this, we're focused on reinforcing the Roland-Garros experience within the competition itself, while also creating a truly immersive journey for all stakeholders - participants, fans, streamers and ambassadors. Today, Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault stands as the world's largest eTennis event, offering exclusive opportunities that set us apart. We provide the best Tennis Clash players with a unique 3-day, all-expenses-paid experience at Roland-Garros, along with prize money (€5,000 prize pool). As the livestreaming world never stops evolving, we're pushed to be even more creative in delivering, with our streamers, top-tier content and making sure our audience stays engaged. Looking ahead, I'm expecting to see even stronger connections between the worlds of tennis and eTennis. Many active and former professional tennis players already play video games while travelling on the Tour, and I'm convinced we'll see more of them participating in esports competitions like ours - either as players or team captains - just like former top 10 stars Gilles Simon and Marion Bartoli this year. Could you share some insights into the global reach and participation in the eSeries, and how it compares to traditional tennis viewership or participation? The logics of engagement behind eTennis and traditional tennis are fundamentally different, making direct comparisons somewhat irrelevant. Our eTennis event is also enhancing the brand equity of Roland-Garros in terms of awareness and perception across different targeted markets. By doing so, we create meaningful connections with our brand early on. Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault also allows us to reach a broader and more diverse audience, including those who may not traditionally be tennis fans but are drawn into the Roland-Garros universe through gaming. A key indicator of the global success of Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault is the number of matches played on our virtual Central Court within Tennis Clash: from 1.6 million in 2022 to 9.5 million in 2025, across 221 territories.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ranked 112 in the world, she has already registered wins this month at tournaments in Italy and just missed out on a quarter-final spot in Santa Croce where she lost a three set thriller to world number 61 Nauhany Vitoria Leme Da Silva 3-6, 6-3, 6-7. To be one of them is truly humbling and satisfying as it shows that my hard work is paying off,” she told the Jamaica Observer. “Roland Garros is a dream — just setting foot on those courts will be unforgettable and I want to compete, challenge the best, and prove I belong on that stage.” Clay courts are regarded by many to be the most difficult playing surface in tennis but James says she's well prepared to take on the challenge. “The clay courts also require a different type of movement when compared to hard courts as you have to slide into many shots. James has also invested in mental preparation, which she says is necessary to be successful. “You can be in top shape, but without mental clarity, it's tough to perform — especially on clay, where matches can last over two or three hours,” she said. Blocking out distractions and staying present is essential, especially in high-pressure environments.” Jamaica's number one-ranked James, who moved to an academy based in Florida after attending Hillel Preparatory School, has proven to be one of the brighter prospects in the sport, winning several local and regional titles with her most recent coming in the Dominican Republic last May. Since then, she's made a number of deep tournament runs including quarter-final appearances at Indian Wells and in Brazil as well as a semi-final loss in Zapopan, Mexico. “I'm focused on growth, testing myself against the best junior players in the world, and breaking new ground to improve my level of play,” James said. “I also want to absorb and enjoy the experience. My goal is to break into the top 50 as this will put me in a good position to gain entry into Wimbledon and the US Open. “Every time I step on a court and see the Jamaican flag next to my name or flying high in the stadium, it fills me with pride. It's a reminder that I'm playing for something bigger than myself. I would like to put Jamaica on the map for tennis. I hope my journey inspires young athletes back home — to believe that with hard work and commitment, anything is possible.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tommy Paul has faced some off-court distractions during his Italian Open campaign. Tommy Paul has reached the Italian Open semifinals after defeating Hubert Hurkacz. Paul will play world number one Jannik Sinner in the Italian Open semifinals. Tommy Paul has been forced to put off-court distractions in his rear-view mirror at the Italian Open this week after the American's beloved truck was repossessed at his home in Florida. Paul beat Hubert Hurkacz 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to set up a semifinal against world number one Jannik Sinner in Rome. But it was clear the fate of his Ford F-150 was a worry for world number 12 Paul, who has made more than $US10 million ($15.5 million) in career prize money. "It's been a great week on court so far. Jannik Sinner admits he thought about walking away from tennis prior to accepting a three-month doping ban earlier this year. "I've been grinding to get my truck back. I had to win a couple matches so I could pay that off," said Paul after pocketing $US325,964 for reaching the semifinals in Rome. Paul is the first American man to reach consecutive Italian Open semifinals since Pete Sampras in 1993-94 and he could return to the top 10 with a win over Sinner. He is also seeking his first title of the season after capturing three tournament victories in 2024. Sinner is playing his first tournament since serving a three-month doping suspension.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>6 Jasmine Paolini for the WTA 1000 Internazionali BNL d'Italia title on Saturday at 5 p.m. local (11 a.m. It will be a buona festa on Saturday at the Foro Italico, as two Top 10 players square off in the women's singles final at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome. To capture the title and thrill the home crowd, Paolini will have to get past No. 4 seed Coco Gauff of the United States. Gauff battled into her second straight WTA 1000 final of this year's clay-court swing, and she is seeking her 10th WTA title. Here's what you need to know about Saturday's showdown on Campo Centrale: The Internazionali BNL d'Italia women's singles final will be played on Saturday, May 17 at 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. By making the Rome final, both Paolini and Gauff have assured themselves 650 PIF WTA ranking points and €456,735 in prize money. The singles champion will increase those numbers. Whoever wins the final will pocket 1,000 ranking points and take home €877,390. By reaching the final, Paolini has already guaranteed she will maintain her spot in the Top 5. A runner-up showing will keep her at No. As for Gauff, she will return to her career-high of No. Gauff's season picked up a head of steam once she got onto the European clay. After a quarterfinal finish in Stuttgart, Gauff has now reached back-to-back WTA 1000 finals at Madrid and Rome. She is 11-2 on clay so far this year. Gauff dropped her first set of the tournament to teenage qualifier Victoria Mboko. Gauff's run to the final:1R: bye2R: d. [Q] Victoria Mboko (#156) 3-6, 6-2, 6-13R: d. [32] Magda Linette (#32) 7-5, 6-34R: d. Emma Raducanu (#49) 6-1, 6-2QF: d. [7] Mirra Andreeva (#7) 6-4, 7-6(5)SF: d. [8] Zheng Qinwen (#8) 7-6(3), 4-6, 7-6(4) A post shared by Internazionali BNL d'Italia (@internazionalibnlditalia) Meanwhile, Paolini thrilled her partisan crowds all fortnight, dropping only one set in the process (to Diana Shnaider in the quarterfinals). Coming into Rome, Paolini had not reached a final all season, but she was rejuvenated on her home soil. Paolini's run to the final:1R: bye2R: d. Lulu Sun (#46) 6-4, 6-33R: d. [27] Ons Jabeur (#36) 6-4, 6-34R: d. [17] Jelena Ostapenko (#18) 7-5, 6-2QF: d. [13] Diana Shnaider (#11) 6-7(1), 6-4, 6-2SF: d. Peyton Stearns (#42), 7-5, 6-1 Gauff leads their head-to-head 2–1, but that edge comes with an asterisk: Paolini won their only meeting on clay -- and it wasn't long ago. Gauff took their first two encounters, both on hard courts, at Adelaide in 2021 and Cincinnati in 2023, where she went on to win her first WTA 1000 title. But just last month in Stuttgart, Paolini earned her first win over Gauff with a 6–4, 6–3 victory on indoor clay at the WTA 500 event. This is a huge moment for Italy at their biggest tournament. Paolini is the first Italian women's singles finalist at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia since her doubles partner Sara Errani in 2014 (who finished runner-up to Serena Williams). One more win would make Paolini the first Italian women's singles champion at this event since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, 40 years ago. Paolini, Errani and Reggi are the only Italian women to make this final in the Open Era. And despite her clay-court proficiency (including a Roland Garros final in 2022), a victory on Saturday would be Gauff's first title on this surface since she won WTA 250 Parma in 2021. 3 - Coco Gauff is the third youngest player to reach the final in four WTA-1000 events since the format introduction 2009, older only than Caroline Wozniacki and Iga Swiatek. The 29-year-old Paolini became the third oldest woman to reach her first Rome final, younger only than Helga Masthoff (1971) and Li Na (2012). And Paolini is the first Italian to reach multiple WTA 1000 finals since this tournament tier was introduced in 2009. Paolini was the champion at WTA 1000 Dubai last year. Paolini now holds the best winning percentage of any Italian at WTA 1000 events (56.9%, 41-31), surpassing former US Open champion Flavia Pennetta. A Rome semifinalist in 2021 and 2024, Gauff has won 17 matches at the tournament. In the Open Era, only Gabriela Sabatini won more main-draw matches at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia before turning 22 (Sabatini won 27 matches). For the first time in her career, Gauff has registered four Top 10 wins on clay in a single season. She beat Mirra Andreeva and Iga Swiatek at Madrid, then added wins over Andreeva and Zheng Qinwen this fortnight in Rome. Gauff and Paolini both spoke after their semifinal wins: Gauff: "[The Stuttgart quarterfinal vs. Paolini] was a tough match. I think especially here with the home crowd behind her, she's going to be playing some great tennis. If not, I'm proud just really of this [semifinal] match, too." Paolini: "I think [2014 finalist Errani is] part of my team. It's amazing to be in the final as she did. "[The 2024 season] gave me a lot of confidence that I have to remember, a lot of experience that I have under my belt. 6 Jasmine Paolini for the WTA 1000 Internazionali BNL d'Italia title on Saturday at 5 p.m. local (11 a.m.</p>
