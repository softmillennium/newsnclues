                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both men have much at stake as the World Cup heads to North America next year, with the potential for President Donald Trump's immigration policies to chill international attendance. DOHA, Qatar — As President Donald Trump drove to a palace here the other night, he passed by a gleaming and glittery Lusail Stadium, the crown jewel of the sports complexes built to host what would become an electrifying 2022 World Cup final. As they had dinner, Trump again called out for him. When he left, Infantino was there once more. There may be other reasons for the genuine affection between Trump and Infantino. There is an aspect of Trump's foreign policy approach that aligns with FIFA's president. They want to expand global reach with glitz and glamour, and they are willing to stretch ethical boundaries and turn a blind eye to autocrats who crack down on their populations. FIFA has approached the world much like Trump has — in a transactional way that can elevate countries with questionable records in human rights. Russia was picked to host the 2018 World Cup, and Infantino accepted high honors from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Qatar relied heavily on migrant labor to remake its capital and construct gleaming stadiums from scratch. Saudi Arabia, widely condemned for its own human rights abuses, including the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, will host in 2034. Trump has likewise looked the other way in his dealings in the Middle East this week, notably with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who the CIA concluded had ordered Khashoggi's death. Trump instead focused on one of the things that unites them all: World Cup hosting duties. “It's going to be really exciting next year.” Trump and Infantino share ties dating back years. “President Trump is definitely a sportsman,” Infantino said. He wants to show who is the best.” Infantino came to Trump's inauguration, and he has also visited the White House. Much is on the line for Trump and Infantino — including whether the president's crackdown on immigrants will chill international attendance. There have also been concerns about whether the United States would grant visas for foreigners to come and support their countries in what is normally an event marked by its global flavor and fervent support. The Trump administration has not exactly signaled a welcoming tone. “But when the time is up, they'll have to go home.” He rescheduled several events of his organization's governing body in Paraguay and then still arrived late. The episode triggered protests from several high-ranking members. Infantino has defended his relationship with Trump, which he said is critical to put on a smooth World Cup next year. He apologized to the forum for being late. “Some important World Cup discussions took place, and I needed to be there to represent football and all of you,” he said of the Middle East trip. “We had an issue with our flight, which made this delay happen — apologies, sorry, and I am looking forward to spending time with you here.” The mood was demonstrably brighter a few nights earlier in Doha. At the center was a stand holding an official World Cup ball from 2022. Trump arrived and held the ball aloft proudly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that. They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat. They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes. In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer. All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday. “Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later. “We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added. In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers. At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. "It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us." (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players. It ended with Pochettino "disappointed," again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright. But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: "In football, anything can happen." And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt "shame" after the two losses, and promising, again, that "next time" would be different. Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup. We didn't show up in this window here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA has sparked controversy with a major decision: the Club World Cup 2025 Play-In between Club América and LAFC will take place at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles, home of the MLS club. Scheduled for May 31 at 7:30 PM (local time), the announcement has already caused unrest in the América camp. Home Advantage for LAFC in What Was Supposed to Be Neutral Ground Club América will now have to fight for a Club World Cup spot as visitors, something they feel compromises the fairness of this pivotal playoff match. Within América's inner circle, there's growing frustration over what's being viewed as an imbalance in a match that determines the final slot for the most prestigious club competition on the planet. This unique situation arose after Club León was excluded from the tournament due to FIFA's multi-ownership rule. The winner of this high-stakes encounter will enter Group D, which already features Chelsea, Flamengo, and Espérance de Tunis. Beyond prestige, qualification offers a massive financial opportunity. The champion of the Club World Cup 2025 could walk away with up to $97 million USD—making this Play-In far more than just a formality. While LAFC continues its MLS campaign, América is fully focused on the Clausura 2025 Liguilla, juggling domestic ambitions with international pressure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a lackluster season that ended without a major trophy, Real Madrid are looking to bolster their squad this summer ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup. MARCA reported Real Madrid held a virtual meeting with 17-year-old Franco Mastantuono's agents. No offer was made for the Argentine, but he is reportedly on Los Blancos' radar after his stellar season for River Plate. The Spanish giants are reportedly eyeing Bayer Leverkusen's Exequiel Palacios as well. The Argentine previously almost signed with Real Madrid back in 2019, but the deal fell through after he suffered an injury. Now, six years alter, Palacios could be on his way to Madrid along with Alonso. After all, he fits the desired profile of a "team player" that will not break the bank to sign. Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller and AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders are also named in the report. Any of the four players would give Real Madrid more depth at the position for this summer's FIFA Club World Cup. Eduardo Camavinga is set to miss the tournament after suffering a complete tear of the tendon in his left adductor muscle, and Jude Bellingham could also miss some time if he undergoes a procedure to fix a nagging shoulder injury. The first of two summer transfer windows opens on June 1. The tournament boasts a record $1 billion prize pool and gives Los Blancos an opportunity to bring a much-needed trophy back to Madrid.

Credit: AP/DARRYL DYCK MIAMI — Los Angeles FC will host Mexico's América on May 31 in their Club World Cup qualification playoff, FIFA finalized on Friday. León broke tournament integrity rules being in the same ownership group as another Club World Cup entry, Pachuca. FIFA announced the date and venue 10 days after León's appeal against expulsion was lost at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland. LAFC's 22,000-seat home BMO Stadium — next to the LA Memorial Coliseum and shared with Angel City — will stage the game at 7:30 p.m. local time. That is several hours after the Champions League final in Munich between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. The Club World Cup entry for LAFC or América is worth an initial $9.55 million payment from FIFA for a CONCACAF region team, plus a share of the $1 billion in total prize money based on results at the month-long tournament. FIFA planned the LAFC-América game in March after first ruling to expel León, which qualified by winning the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League. It was unclear why América — one of Mexico's best-supported teams — is eligible when FIFA rules cap each country at two entries unless it has more than two winners of a continental championship in the four-year qualifying period through 2024. Mexico already has Pachuca and Monterrey in the tournament that has been heavily promoted by FIFA President Gianni Infantino with U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump has said he will attend the July 13 final at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey to present the gold trophy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) could be set for one of its most high-profile tests in recent memory: a potential friendly against World Cup champions Argentina, with the match tentatively scheduled for November 2025 in Qatar. The tantalizing prospect of Christian Pulisic squaring off against Lionel Messi, in what would be a symbolic showdown of sports eras and continents, is still unconfirmed—but it has already sent ripples through the American soccer community. Under Mauricio Pochettino, the USMNT has embarked on a rigorous calendar of friendlies to refine squad chemistry and test tactical flexibility. Having already secured qualification as co-host, the United States is leveraging every international window to prepare for what could be a transformative tournament on home soil. In September, the Stars and Stripes will face two of Asia's top sides: South Korea on September 6 at Sports Illustrated Stadium in New Jersey, and Japan on September 9 at Lower.com Field in Columbus, Ohio. 23, is also on the verge of World Cup qualification. These matches offer the U.S. a crucial measuring stick before heading into a potentially historic matchup against Argentina. The 2022 World Cup winner remains one of the game's most dominant forces under head coach Lionel Scaloni. While the U.S. is considering hosting matches in October, they are also reportedly looking at an international tour in November—a detail that aligns with the Qatar fixture. Includes: every MLS game and Leagues Cup Christian Pulisic looked on in frustration as another chance to salvage Milan's season slipped away in the Coppa Italia final. As the red and black of Milan prepares to meet the Rossoblu under Rome's glowing lights, a familiar question lingers in the air: which of their stars will rise when it matters most? Christian Pulisic could lose a key teammate at AC Milan after reportedly drawing interest from Manchester City. While fans celebrated in Catalonia and beyond, a subtle ripple of emotion was felt globally — especially when a legendary figure from Barcelona's golden era sent a brief, understated message that carried enormous weight.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Friday's reports claim that Manchester City want to sign Netherlands international Tijjani Reijnders from Milan in time for the beginning of the FIFA Club World Cup, which kicks off in mid-June. Reports over the last few weeks indicate that a number of Europe's biggest clubs are interested in striking a deal for Reijnders during the summer transfer window. Manchester City and Real Madrid specifically have been linked with a move for the Dutchman over the last few days. Now, according to reports from Calciomercato.com, City are keen on wrapping up a deal with Milan by the beginning of June so that Reijnders is available in Guardiola's squad in time for the Club World Cup in the United States. A price tag in the region of €70m has been quoted by various outlets, while Calciomercato.com claims that City are prepared to offer €70m, while Milan will seek a total package in the region of €75m-€80m including bonuses. Reijnders recently signed a new and improved contract extension with the Rossoneri in March, which runs until the summer of 2030. He had been earning around €1.7m per season in wages on his first Milan contract, which has reportedly risen to somewhere in the region of €3.5m plus bonuses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We didn't find the right solutions,” said Christian Pulisic, ashen-faced and frustrated as he addressed the media to a backdrop of opposition euphoria in Rome. At Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday night, the United States men's national team star tried to drag his team back into a Coppa Italia final they had trailed to Bologna since Dan Ndoye's 53rd-minute strike. Pulisic scored and assisted in a vital Serie A win against the same opponents five days earlier, but couldn't find the net when tasked with turning in Luka Jovic's saved shot in the first half. Later, with the clock ticking, he tried to go it alone, beating three defenders and zipping into the area but Bologna goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski foiled him before he could shoot. Fourteen minutes later, his race was run, and head coach Sergio Conceicao replaced the American, perhaps with an eye on another key game back at the Olimpico against Roma on Sunday. At full time, the Bologna players, staff and supporters celebrated wildly. So, no solutions for Milan on the night but a result that could leave one of their best players pondering other ways to solve an issue. If Milan cannot beat Roma in two days, their chances of salvaging Champions League qualification will be over. Even victories in their final two games would leave Milan needing a staggering concoction of other results to go their way. Pulisic is no stranger to the biggest stage of all. The last two of those have been with Milan, and this year he scored four goals as his team exited in the revamped league phase. But if Milan fail to qualify for the 2025-26 edition, he will not be honing his tools alongside the best of Europe. He will still likely remain a pivotal man for Milan, playing in one of Europe's top leagues (the re-energized Italian top flight is arguably stronger than it has been in a long time, with Milan's rivals Inter reaching the Champions League final and with two games to go are in a thrilling race with Napoli for the scudetto). Sure, his morale may initially be dented by having to sit on the outside and potentially watch as compatriots Weston McKennie and Tim Weah play Champions League with Juventus (although even that is not certain). But Pulisic is professional and focused enough not to let that limit his motivation in a key year. There is an argument that the 26-year-old might benefit from fewer minutes heading into 2026, something Mauricio Pochettino may ponder as he decides how much to call upon Pulisic this summer across friendly games and the Concacaf Gold Cup. All this is assuming Pulisic remains a Milan player. There have been constant rumors the attacker has been close to signing a new contract at San Siro, but a deal has not yet been agreed and there may well be Champions League clubs interested in him this summer after his fine personal form during the team's otherwise tumultuous campaign. Often, the USMNT debate while Pulisic was in and out of the Chelsea team centered on whether he needed to be playing every week, and in a side where he had a responsibility that mirrored his pivotal role with the national team. It may not have worked against silverware-starved Bologna on Wednesday, but often he is Milan's game-changer, charged with leading the side as he does his country. Would he be better moving for the sake of the Champions League, to a club where he might have to start afresh in proving he can be a regular, or risk being considered a squad player? Pulisic would likely back himself, and his talent, to avoid that fate again but even if the San Siro is not the perfect example of stability, it has represented that to the player who burst onto the scene with Borussia Dortmund before feeling he was underused for some of his time at Stamford Bridge. Whatever happens over the next two fixtures, and Milan are that unpredictable you could not quite fully rule out a dramatic late surge into fourth, Pulisic will have choices to make going into the summer. Or does the lure of Champions League football, going into the biggest year of his professional life, mean he may need to search for pastures new? He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liverpool are awaiting an opportunity to sign Florian Wirtz after talks with the Bayer Leverkusen attacking midfielder, and a decision could accelerate rapidly. 10 this summer, with reports in both England and Germany confirming their intentions. Liverpool's belief is that the 22-year-old would prefer a switch to Bayern Munich, but Bild‘s Christian Falk claims they are at least ahead of Man City in the running. Progress could be made in talks over a deal for Wirtz upon the conclusion of the Bundesliga campaign on Saturday, when Leverkusen visit Mainz knowing they are already guaranteed to finish second. And new comments from Bayern sporting director Max Eberl suggest that they could look to bring the playmaker in before the Club World Cup next month. “There's a lot of speculation in Munich, and everyone has their own opinion. Of course, that doesn't make things easy,” he told reporters on Friday, as reported by the Liverpool Echo. That comes with up to £97 million in prize money available for each club competing. While no guarantee that they will therefore sign the player, the opportunity to do so in a pre-tournament transfer window running from June 1 to 10 could force a decision over his future – be it Bayern, Liverpool or elsewhere. Florian Wirtz is free to visit Liverpool, Manchester, Madrid, or whatever with his family and friends.” “We can't let all the speculation – ‘agreement reached', ‘contract signed' – get to us.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid approaches the final stretch of the current league campaign with nothing to decide. FC Barcelona's victory against Espanyol, at the RCDE Stadium, leaves Hansi Flick's pupils as mathematical champions of the tournament. The tournament organized by FIFA this summer will start on June 18 for the white squad. That date appears as a very clear deadline in the Valdebebas offices according to the information handled by Melchor Ruiz. "Initially the idea is to announce first Xabi Alonso, then Alexander-Arnold, third Huijsen", Melchor Ruiz points out on COPE. Additionally, the journalist recalls that the operation "is not completely closed, but it will be carried out" in the coming days or weeks because "those details remain" typical of this transfer. Melchor Ruiz warns that Real Madrid has set in motion another signing: "it would also be attempted, in those first ten days" before the Club World Cup, "the left-back". The number one candidate right now on the white team's list of prospects for that position is none other than Álvaro Carreras. "But just last night, almost at dawn today, they told me 'these two names are important, we are on it but there are also others'" candidates. Melchor Ruiz points out that those three signings thought of in the Valdebebas offices, in addition to Xabi Alonso himself, are "brought forward to be at the Club World Cup". Melchor Ruiz points out that "there are several names also on the table" to add assets to the midfield. But that incorporation "would be dealt with later" without considering the clearly established deadline by the Club World Cup. Thus, Real Madrid will experience two really hectic weeks given the multiple changes that must be made to the first team before the Club World Cup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlo Ancelotti can strengthen his claim to be the greatest manager in football history by leading Brazil to World Cup glory next summer. The Italian coach has practically completed the club game, having won a record five Champions League titles with Real Madrid and AC Milan. He's also the only manager in history to have won titles in each of Europe's five major leagues – the Premier League, Serie A, Ligue 1, Bundesliga and La Liga. All four of his players converted their spot-kicks, the Old Lady showing their mettle to make it over the line and get it won – something they've failed to do in five successive final appearances since then. “There's no right or wrong way to start out as a coach, but it is important to have the ability to work with players,” wrote Claudio Ranieri of his old pal Lippi in The Observer ahead of the 2006 World Cup final. Ranieri could just as easily be talking about another of his compatriots, Ancelotti. A defensive midfielder in his playing days, Del Bosque won five league titles and four Copa del Rey with Real Madrid in the 1970s and early 1980s. Sure enough, just as he'd done at the highest level of the club game, Del Bosque guided La Roja to World Cup glory in South Africa. “I told them that this was the game of our lives,” Del Bosque reminisced in an interview with FourFourTwo. “We were football romantics, and I knew we were going to have the opportunity to experience a beautiful night, unique for many people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Milan will add a total of four or five players to their squad ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup this summer. This according to today's print edition of Rome-based newspaper Corriere dello Sport, via FCInterNews. They anticipate two or three signings plus a couple of youngsters returning. Inter Milan play in the Club World Cup this summer. And Inter will have the chance to bolster their squad with signings during a special transfer window between the first and tenth of next month. Inter Milan have already completed one deal ahead of the Club World Cup. Midfielder Petar Sucic signed his deal in February. Meanwhile, the Corriere report, Inter are also pushing to sign Luis Henrique from Marseille before the Club World Cup kicks off. However, Bologna duo Sam Beukema and Jhon Lucumi are also on Inter's shortlist. Apart from signings, though, the Corriere also anticipate a couple players returning to Inter's squad. Attacking midfielder Valentin Carboni should finally be back after suffering a horror knee injury in the autumn while out on loan with Marseille. Meanwhile, striker Francesco Pio Esposito will be back from loan with Spezia. Pio Esposito will be participating in the Under-21 Euros with Italy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The talent acquisition strategies of big and small nations alike has changed markedly in a chaotically deglobalizing world An Australian team coached by the son of Croatian immigrants, with an attack led by a Scottish-born naturalized Australian and a second generation Sri Lankan Tamil-Australian, faced an Indonesian team in which all but one of the starting XI were born and raised in the Netherlands. Nurtured by the Dutch academy system and performing, in many cases, at a high level in club football throughout Europe and the US, these players qualified for Tim Garuda thanks to ancestral links to Indonesia, a former Dutch colony. This policy of strength through Dutchification wasn't much help on that night against Australia: Indonesia eventually lost 5-1. Football's rush into a more globalized future – right when the international direction of geo-economic travel is in the other direction – is creating both opportunities and incongruities. In a chaotically deglobalizing world, soccer might now be globalization's most persuasive argument. International football has always involved a war for talent at some level; from Giuseppe Rossi to Declan Rice, the agonies of dual nationals choosing one path over another have stirred debate for decades. Portugal, for example, has for many years benefited from its domestic league's status as a draw for Brazilians to naturalize players like Deco and Pepe, while African countries such as Algeria, Morocco, and Senegal have long drawn on the strength of French football, with its significant African diaspora, to make their national teams more competitive. This two-way traffic extends to the exploitation of multiculturalism as a recruitment lever, in which receiving countries become senders and sending countries re-receive: the Turkish community in Germany delivered Turkey its current national team captain, Hakan Çalhanoğlu, but it's also the cradle from which Die Mannschaft's most enigmatic player this century, Mesut Özil, emerged. In 1990, just 6.2% of the players at the World Cup were born in a country other than the one they represented, according to an analysis by Vox; by 2022, that share had risen to 16.5%. Rule changes, perhaps unsurprisingly, have also helped the foreign-born national team player emerge as a central character in world football. After introducing a “clear connection” requirement in 2004 after Qatar tried to fill its national team with uncapped mercenaries who had no connection to the Gulf state, Fifa adjusted the scheme in 2021 so that players with three or fewer caps for a national team before the age of 21 can switch allegiances. This has boosted the mobility of players across borders who might otherwise be “cap-tied” by their appearance in only one or two representative matches while still developing as a player and person. Though buying a national team outright is still (quite rightly) prohibited, countries are growing more skilled at discovering seams of eligible talent. Agents, whose own financial interests are naturally geared towards giving their clients as much exposure as possible, are becoming more aggressive in their “advertisement” of players to the federations for which they qualify. Still, the move to go all-in on naturalization has provoked predictable debate in Indonesia and among regional rivals about fairness, the dilution of national identity, and a potential weakening of the domestic league. Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer For Indonesia, there are at least precedents to guide this great experiment in mass naturalization. How far China can progress with a domestic league that has had its ambition and financial power clipped in recent years remains to be seen. Being a country that people want to visit can also offer advantages, even if their distribution is unpredictable: US star Yunus Musah, for instance, was brought up and nurtured as a soccer talent largely in the UK but qualifies for the US thanks to him being born in New York while his mother was on vacation. The current USMNT is unmistakably a team born of this moment's global tussle for talent: Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun, Cameron Carter-Vickers, and Sergiño Dest are all foreign-born and -raised, while other regular fixtures in the team like Gio Reyna, Tim Weah, and Ricardo Pepi have experienced, to differing degrees, the difficulties involved in choosing a single sporting nationality as a player eligible for multiple teams. Klinsmann's selections were notable for drawing extensively on the dividend of America's projection of military power – and people – across the globe. US military bases became an unlikely recruiting ground for the US: Jermaine Jones, John Brooks, and Timothy Chandler were all born to US service personnel stationed in Germany and rose through domestic German football but each went on to represent, to varying degrees of distinction, Klinsmann's USMNT. Though “military brats” have featured less frequently under Gregg Berhalter and Mauricio Pochettino, the unmatched global projection of US military power – especially in Europe – does offer an additional potential selection advantage that no other national team can boast. Birthright citizenship, the constitutional guarantee that gave Musah a US passport, needs no justification, but improved national team depth is perhaps the only good argument for militarism, in any context. How much longer some of these advantages will exist for is another question. With Donald Trump threatening to pull back the US security umbrella over Europe, his administration actively pursuing an end to birthright citizenship, and federal immigration authorities viciously targeting the Latino community, a traditional source of playing strength for American soccer, the USMNT is facing a future in which the next generation's Musahs and Joneses – and perhaps even Reynas and Pepis and Weahs – simply won't exist. Meanwhile all three branches of the federal government have united in an effort to make this country as xenophobic and inhospitable to foreigners as possible in the runup to next year's World Cup.</p>
