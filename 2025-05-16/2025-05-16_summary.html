Rightwing lawmakers say president's bill – centered on tax cuts and funding deportations – doesn't make enough cuts

Rightwing lawmakers derailed Donald Trump's signature legislation in the House of Representatives on Friday, preventing its passage through a key committee and throwing into question whether Republicans can coalesce around the massive bill.

The party has spent weeks negotiating a measure dubbed the “one big, beautiful bill” that would extend tax cuts enacted during Trump's first term, fund mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, and temporarily make good on his campaign promise to end the taxation of tips and overtime. To offset its costs, Republicans have proposed cuts to the federal safety net, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

At a House budget committee hearing on Friday intended to advance the measure one step closer to a floor vote, four Republican members of the far-right Freedom Caucus joined with the Democratic minority to block it from proceeding, arguing the legislation does not make deep enough cuts to federal spending and to programs they dislike.

“This bill falls profoundly short. It does not do what we say it does, with respect to deficits,” said Chip Roy, a Texas representative who opposed the bill alongside fellow Freedom Caucus members Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma and Ralph Norman of South Carolina. Pennsylvania's Lloyd Smucker initially voted to advance the bill, then changed his vote to no at the last minute, which he said was a procedural maneuver to allow the bill to be reconsidered in the future.

The setback raises the stakes for the House speaker, Mike Johnson, who had set a goal of Memorial Day to get the legislation passed through the House and on to the Senate. Trump has said he would like to have the bill on his desk by the 4 July Independence Day holiday, and earlier on Friday attempted to pressure conservative holdouts.

“Republicans MUST UNITE behind, ‘THE ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL!'” the president wrote on Truth Social. “We don't need ‘GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!”

Later on Friday, the budget committee announced it would reconvene on Sunday night to consider the bill, giving Johnson another couple of days to find agreement with the hardliners.

Republicans are crafting the bill using the budget reconciliation procedure, which Senate Democrats cannot block with the filibuster. But the GOP is split over what to include and what to cut in the expensive legislation, which Congress's non-partisan joint committee on taxation estimates will cost $3.7tn through 2034.

Rightwing lawmakers want to see big reductions in government spending, which has climbed in recent years as Trump and Joe Biden responded to the Covid-19 pandemic and pursued their own economic policies.

“We're … committed to ensuring the final package is fiscally responsible, rightsizing government and putting our fiscal future back on track. Unfortunately, the current version falls short of these goals and fails to deliver the transformative change that Americans were promised,” Clyde said at the budget committee.

He called for deeper cuts to Medicaid, but many Republicans in the House and Senate have signaled nervousness with dramatic funding reductions to the program that provides healthcare to lower-income and disabled Americans. Others in the GOP dislike parts of the bill that would cut green tax credits created by Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

And a small group of Republicans representing districts in blue states such as New York and New Jersey are demanding an increase in the deduction for state and local taxes, saying it will provide needed relief to their constituents. But including that would drive the cost of the bill even higher, risking the ire of fiscal conservatives.

Johnson has little choice but to listen to all of these groups. The GOP can afford to lose no more than three votes in the chamber, a historically small margin that has made passing legislation a tightrope walk.

Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's ruling marks one of the most alarming judicial rollbacks of LGBTQ rights in recent memory.

On Thursday, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk — a far-right federal judge in the Northern District of Texas with a record of aligning with the GOP's most extreme legal positions — issued a ruling declaring that Title VII no longer protects LGBTQ+ people from workplace discrimination. The decision directly contradicts the Supreme Court's landmark 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is, by definition, sex discrimination. Kacsmaryk's ruling marks one of the most alarming judicial rollbacks of LGBTQ+ rights in recent memory — and sets up a direct legal challenge to one of the foundational civil rights protections for queer and trans people in the United States.

The case was brought against the EEOC by the state of Texas alongside the Heritage Foundation, a central force behind Project 2025 — an aggressive right-wing policy blueprint that explicitly calls for rolling back LGBTQ+ protections in federal law. In siding with the plaintiffs, Judge Kacsmaryk pointed to the Texas Department of Agriculture's current employee policy, which requires “employees to comply with this dress code in a manner consistent with their biological gender,” specifying that “men may wear pants” and “women may wear dresses, skirts, or pants.” The ruling also upheld the department's policy banning transgender employees from using restrooms that align with their gender identity.

The judge reached a verdict that Title VII only protects “firing someone simply for being homosexual or transgender,” but that it does not protect transgender or gay people from “harassment”:

“In sum, Title VII does not bar workplace employment policies that protect the inherent differences between men and women,” Kacsmaryk writes in his ruling.

Judge Kacsmaryk further argued that disparate treatment of transgender employees does not constitute unequal treatment, reasoning that “a male employee must use male facilities like other males” — a statement that erases transgender identity altogether. He extended that logic to dress codes and pronouns, claiming that requiring employees to adhere to clothing standards and pronoun use based on their assigned sex at birth is not discriminatory because it applies “equally” to everyone. The argument mirrors the discredited legal reasoning once used to uphold bans on same-sex marriage — that such laws didn't discriminate against gay people because they, like straight people, were allowed to marry someone of the opposite sex. It's a circular logic designed to mask exclusion as neutrality. It also flies in the face of the fact that Texas allows people assigned female at birth to wear gender “pants, skirts, and dresses” but denies that same right to people assigned male at birth.

Ultimately, Judge Kacsmaryk ordered the complete removal of all references to sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes under Title VII from EEOC guidance. His ruling declares that “all language defining ‘sex' in Title VII to include ‘sexual orientation' and ‘gender identity'” must be stripped from federal employment policy. Specifically, it targets and nullifies Section II(A)(5)(c) of the 2024 EEOC guidance, which states: “Sex-based discrimination under Title VII includes employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.”

The ruling flies in the face of Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that Title VII protects LGBTQ+ workers from discrimination. The landmark case centered on Gerald Bostock, who was fired from a county job after joining a gay softball league, and Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman dismissed from a funeral home after informing her employer she would begin presenting as a woman. In a 6–3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that firing someone for being gay or transgender is inherently sex-based discrimination, and thus violates federal civil rights law. While Bostock focused on wrongful termination, it strains credulity to suggest that the same protections wouldn't also apply to workplace harassment or other forms of discriminatory treatment under the very same statute.

This isn't Judge Kacsmaryk's first foray into far-right legal activism — it's his trademark. He's become the go-to jurist for plaintiffs looking to turn extremist ideology into binding precedent. He's the one who tried to revoke FDA approval of mifepristone, a safe and widely used abortion medication. He's ruled against LGBTQ+ protections in the Affordable Care Act. He even tried to force Planned Parenthood to pay $2 billion to Texas and Louisiana — a ruling so outrageous that even the deeply conservative Fifth Circuit tossed it. Now, he's taking aim at Title VII itself, effectively inviting employers to harass and discriminate against LGBTQ+ workers by pretending Bostock never happened.

            Israel and the new Syrian regime have recently held direct talks, according to an Israeli source familiar with the matter – an indication of shifting dynamics between the former enemies as Israel expands its military presence in the country.
    


            The talks were held in Azerbaijan and were attended by the chief of the Israeli military's Operations Directorate, Maj. Gen. Oded Basyuk, the source said, adding that Basyuk met with Syrian government representatives in the presence of Turkish officials.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would not confirm or deny that the talks in Azerbaijan took place, but did say that there have not been any direct talks between IDF officials and representatives of the Syrian government.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Turkish government for comment.

Syrian president says his government is holding indirect talks with Israel



            Interim Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa said last week that his government was holding indirect talks with Israel to bring an end to its attacks on his country “so matters don't reach a point where both sides lose control.”
    


            There's been no word from Damascus on any direct talks with Israel.
    


            The source did not disclose the topics of the meeting, nor who was mediating. Channel 12 in Israel was the first to report the meeting.
    


            This week, US President Donald Trump met Sharaa – a former jihadist who was designated a terrorist by the US in 2013 – in Saudi Arabia. Trump pledged to remove crippling sanctions imposed against the regime of Bashar al Assad. Assad was overthrown in an uprising led by Sharaa and fled Syria in December.
    


            The White House said that Trump urged Sharaa take a series of measures, including normalization with Israel, expelling foreign and Palestinian “terrorists,” and helping the US to prevent the resurgence of ISIS.
    


            Since the Assad regime fell, Israel has taken more territory in Syria and staged multiple attacks that it says are aimed at preventing the reconstitution of military capabilities and rooting out militancy that could threaten its security. Israel's move into Syrian territory was initially described as temporary but officials have since said that the military will remain indefinitely.
    


            Israel has also declared a buffer zone in the south of Syria with the stated aim of protecting Syria's Druze minority. It also occupies the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in the 1967 war and later annexed.
    


            The US Treasury said Thursday it was working to Trump's direction on Syria sanctions and aims to implement “the necessary authorizations that would be critical to bringing new investment into Syria.”
    


            It added in a post on X that the “Treasury's actions can help rebuild Syria's economy, financial sector, and infrastructure and could put the country on a path to a bright, prosperous, and stable future.”
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio clarified that the US will issue waivers to Syria sanctions and is not fully repealing them for the time being.
    


            “As we make progress, hopefully we'll be in a position soon, or one day, to go to Congress and ask them to permanently remove the sanctions,” Rubio said in Antalya, Turkey, adding that the Trump administration hoped to eventually repeal the waivers because the prospect of sanctions returning every six months is a deterrent to investment.
    


            An Israeli official told CNN earlier that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked Trump not to remove sanctions on Syria, saying he feared it would lead to a repeat of the events of October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel.

Lawyers hired by Venezuela have been unable to confirm ‘proof of life' for 252 migrants imprisoned in El Salvador

Lawyers for 252 Venezuelans deported by the Trump administration and imprisoned in El Salvador for two months have alleged that the migrants are victims of physical and emotional “torture”.

A law firm hired by the Venezuelan government said that it had been unable to visit the migrants in the mega-prison where they are locked up.

The lawyers are seeking “proof of life”, but say they have come up against a wall of silence from President Nayib Bukele's administration and the Central American nation's justice system.

Grupo Ortega filed a habeas corpus petition with the supreme court on 24 March seeking an end to what it calls the “illegal detention” of the Venezuelans, but is still waiting for a ruling.

“They are treating them like common criminals,” lawyer Salvador Ríos said, after the migrants were shown dressed in prison clothing, shackled and with shaved heads.

“This is torture,” both physically and psychologically, Rios said in an interview with AFP.

The lawyers delivered a letter in early May to Bukele, a key ally of Donald Trump, requesting authorization to visit the Venezuelans, but so far without success.

AFP sought a comment from the Salvadorian presidency about the case and the lawyers' efforts, but has not received a response.

Félix Ulloa, the Salvadorian vice-president, told the French media outlet Le Grand Continent that his government merely provides a “service that we could call prison accommodation”.

Trump's administration has paid Bukele's government millions of dollars to lock up migrants it says are criminals and gang members.

Trump invoked rarely used wartime legislation in March to fly migrants to El Salvador without any court hearing, alleging they belonged to the Tren de Aragua gang, a charge that their families and lawyers deny.

The Venezuelans, as well as 36 deported Salvadorian migrants, are being held in a maximum-security prison built by Bukele to house thousands of suspects arrested during his sweeping crackdown on street gangs.

Images of the Venezuelans entering the Cecot mega-prison in shackles illustrate the brutality, Ríos said.

“The damage is not only physical, but also psychological,” Ríos said.

In their letter to Bukele, the lawyers sought permission to interview the prisoners, either in person or virtually, which could serve as “proof of life”.

They asked Bukele to release the list of the 252 Venezuelans, something that Washington has not done either.

One Salvadorian migrant who was initially incarcerated in Cecot – but in April was moved to a prison farm – is Kilmar Ábrego García, a US resident deported due to what the United States itself admitted was an administrative error.

A Venezuelan identified in US court documents as “Cristian” was also mistakenly expelled.

In both cases, US judges unsuccessfully ordered the Trump administration to facilitate their return to the United States.

Volker Türk, the UN human rights chief, said this week that the situation “raises serious concerns regarding a wide array of rights that are fundamental to both US and international law”.

“Families we have spoken to have expressed a sense of complete powerlessness in the face of what has happened and their pain at seeing their relatives labelled and handled as violent criminals, even terrorists, without any court judgment as to validity of what is claimed against them,” he said in a statement.

Isael Guerrero, another lawyer with Grupo Ortega, described the detentions as “completely illegal” because the Venezuelans “are not being legally prosecuted in any court” in El Salvador.

The firm's head, Jaime Ortega, said they were “100% migrants”.

“Not a single one of them is being prosecuted” in the United States for their alleged membership of the Tren de Aragua gang, he said.

The fate of the Venezuelans now depends entirely on Bukele, as “the expulsion completely nullifies US jurisdiction”, Ortega said.

In April, Bukele offered to trade the 252 Venezuelans for an equal number of political prisoners held by President Nicolás Maduro's government.

Photo from Vietnam war is now at centre of controversy after documentary claimed it was taken by someone else

The World Press Photo group has suspended the attribution of authorship for one on the most famous press photographs ever taken, after a new documentary challenged 50 years of accepted journalism history.

The photo, officially titled The Terror of War but colloquially known as Napalm Girl, remains one of the most indelible images of the US war in Vietnam. Since its publication in June 1972, it has been officially attributed to Nick Ut, a Vietnamese photographer working with the Associated Press in Saigon.

The AP and Ut have long maintained that Ut, then 21 years old, took the photo, which went on to win the World Press Photo of the Year award in 1973 and established Ut as a venerable photojournalist.

But a recent documentary challenged that history, instead proposing that the photo, which depicts a naked nine-year-old girl named Phan Thi Kim Phuc as she flees a napalm attack in the South Vietnamese village of Trảng Bàng, was taken by a man named Nguyen Thành Nghe. The Stringer, which premiered at the Sundance film festival in January, claimed that Nghe, a stringer for NBC who was driving that day and who often sold photos to the AP on a freelance basis, was denied credit in favor of Ut because he was not AP staff.

The film prompted “deep reflection” at World Press Photo, which conducted its own investigation, the results of which were made public on Friday 16 May. The in-house analysis, conducted between January and May 2025, concluded “based on analysis of location, distance, and the camera used on that day” that “photographers Nguyễn Thành Nghệ or Huỳnh Công Phúc may have been better positioned to take the photograph than Nick Út.”

The suspension only applies to the photo's authorship, and does not rescind the 1973 Photo of the Year award. “The photograph itself remains undisputed,” the group said, “and the World Press Photo award for this significant photo of a major moment in 20th century history remains a fact.”

“Based on these findings and according to our values of accuracy, trustworthiness and diversity, we draw conclusions with regards to attribution,” Joumana El Zein Khoury, the group's executive director, said in a press release. “It is important to state that the picture itself is undisputed and it is without question that this photograph represents a real moment in history that continues to reverberate in Vietnam, the United States, and globally.”

Earlier this month, the Associated Press announced that it found “no definitive evidence” to warrant changing the photo's authorship, and released a 96-page report on the matter – its second in four months – based on its own internal investigation. The AP concluded that it was “possible” Ut took the photo, and found no evidence that Nguyen took it instead. The matter was unable to be proven conclusively, it added, due to the passage of time, the absence of key evidence, the limitations of technology and the deaths of several key people involved.

“We left nothing uncovered that we're aware of and we've done it with a great deal of respect to everybody involved,” said Derl McCrudden, an AP vice-president of global news production, in a statement. “It makes no difference to us if we changed the credit, but it has to be based on facts and evidence. And there is no definitive evidence proving that Nick Ut did not take this picture.”

The Stringer, directed by Bao Nguyen, enlisted several witnesses to argue that Nghe sold the photo to the Saigon bureau photo chief, Horst Faas, for $20 and a print, including Nghe's brother, who claims he brought the film to the AP; Nghe's daughter Jannie; Carl Robinson, a longtime AP photo editor in Saigon who first contacted the film-makers; and several of Robinson's former photojournalist colleagues. The investigators also consulted forensic experts with the French NGO Index, who found it “highly unlikely” that Ut took the photo based on the other images AP credited to him that day.

The AP conducted its own forensic investigation involving further interviews, the examination of cameras and surviving negatives from that day, and a 3D model of the scene. The resulting report revealed “inconsistencies on both sides” but concluded that buying Nghe's story would “require several leaps of faith”, such as believing that the only time he sold photos to a western news agency, it turned out to be one of the most famous images of the 20th century.

Nghe, who made a surprise appearance at the Stringer's Sundance premiere, confirms his account in the film. Ut, meanwhile, continues to maintain his authorship, and told the AP that the dispute “has been very difficult for me and has caused great pain”.

But for World Press Photo, the official author is now: unknown. “This remains contested history, and it is possible that the author of the photograph will never be fully confirmed,” the group said. “The suspension of the authorship attribution stands unless it is proved otherwise.”

 This article was amended on 16 May 2025. An earlier version described Nguyen Thành Nghe in 1972 as a “driver for NBC”; he was a stringer for NBC and a freelance photographer who was driving Nick Ut on the day the photo of Phan Thi Kim Phuc was taken.

Welcome to the past four months of life with Donald Trump in power. The collective shock of this rapid change has dulled in the U.S. President's lobster-pot world, which is heating up to the boiling point. Still, it is astounding that one man can cause so much disruption, so much upset, so much grief. He has made the world so much worse – and so quickly.

Anyone who has had the great misfortune of being raised by or married to an abusive person knows how the energy in a room can change with his every twitch (and yes, it's usually a man): how he might blow up at the slightest provocation, his volatile mood permeating the home or the event, cowing everyone as they walk on eggshells.

A stock-market rollercoaster, lost jobs, a dismantled federal civil service and the possibility of a global recession have caused everything from fears of toy shortages at Christmas to a proliferation of yard sales in the Washington, D.C. region as laid off workers pack up and move away to less expensive regions – or, for reasons beyond the economy, Canada. 

One man, propped up by soulless sycophants, has managed to infect everything from the programming at the once-great Kennedy Center to attendance at the annual Blue Jays-Mariners showdown in Seattle to actual marriages that are struggling to survive suddenly unnavigable political rifts.

In a matter of weeks, Mr. Trump has upended the world order. Under the leadership of one nasty, incoherent narcissist, the U.S. has gone from its decades-long role as a great (if flawed) democracy – one that was seen, generally, as trying to use its powers for good – to a nation to be feared, not respected. 

One can imagine that, rather than feel shame or guilt as lives are upended everywhere, Mr. Trump is the kind of person who would get a kick out of it. Look at how powerful I am!

History will study this time and wonder: How did people let that man get away with all of this? Didn't they see?

We see. And yet.

The case involves judges' blocks of Trump's order to redefine the 14th Amendment's birthright citizenship clause.

The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Thursday in a case relating to President Donald Trump's executive order attempting to unilaterally redefine the meaning of the 14th Amendment's birthright citizenship clause.

At issue before the court, however, wasn't the order itself, but rather the topic of nationwide injunctions — sometimes referred to as “universal injunctions” — that several district court judges have used to halt the order's enforcement throughout the country.

The Trump administration argues that judges at that level of the federal court system should not be allowed to issue nationwide injunctions (even though Trump and his allies have celebrated such rulings when they have happened under Democratic administrations). 

During the Supreme Court hearing on Thursday, justices seemed to express little doubt that Trump's executive order was unconstitutional. However, on the question of nationwide injunctions, there appeared to be a split between the justices concerning how restrictions on them would work in a practical manner.

Justice Elena Kagan asked U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer, who was arguing in favor of the administration's position, how a blatantly unconstitutional law or order could be blocked in an expedient way, if an injunction can only affect a certain group of people or jurisdiction.

Theoretically, an injunction affecting only a small portion of the U.S. could be enforced while the unconstitutional action continues elsewhere in the country. If a presidential administration chooses not to appeal the injunction, the issue could potentially never reach the Supreme Court to be ruled on in a way that would affect the entirety of the U.S., leaving millions vulnerable to the unconstitutional action.

“There are all kinds of abuses of nationwide injunctions…[but] if one thinks that it's quite clear that the EO is illegal, how does one get to that result, in what time frame on your set of rules without the possibility of a nationwide injunction?” Kagan asked. 

Sauer's position was that a wider injunction affecting more parties could come through a class action lawsuit — a notion that Justice Sonia Sotomayor said “makes no sense whatsoever,” as those types of lawsuits take much longer time to organize and argue, and the end result still might not reach the Supreme Court.

Conservative justices who have expressed dismay with nationwide injunctions in the past also spoke up, sometimes by agreeing with misleading statements made by Sauer. Justice Clarence Thomas, for example, appeared sympathetic to Sauer's claims that nationwide blocks like these were a relatively new phenomenon.

“So we survived until the 1960s without universal injunction?” Thomas asked Sauer, who responded affirmatively. (In fact, the start of nationwide injunctions date back several decades before that time.)

Justice Samuel Alito also compared injunctions affecting the whole country to an illness in need of curing.

“Sometimes [judges are] wrong,” Alito said. “All Article III judges are vulnerable to an occupational disease, which is the disease of thinking that I am right and I can do whatever I want.”

Several legal experts, however, expressed grave concern over what could happen if the administration wins the argument over nationwide judicial holds — including for the case at hand.

“Although several justices are skeptical of nationwide injunctions, Sauer failed at offering up alternatives, a fact that was especially relevant in a case where many justices were questioning the underlying validity of Trump's EO to end birthright citizenship,” Law Dork's Chris Geidner said.

“The five male justices sound eager to rein in universal injunctions or abolish them … but also appear split on what could replace them, which is a really messy problem,” Slate senior writer Mark Joseph Stern wrote on Bluesky, noting in a previous post that he finds it “very, very difficult to anticipate where the Supreme Court will come down on the universal injunctions currently protecting birthright citizenship from Trump's assault.”

Civil rights lawyer Sherrilyn Ifill said it was disheartening that the case didn't focus on the issue of birthright citizenship more — and what would happen to many living in the U.S. if the injunction rule is changed.

“I have to be honest about what I didn't hear at oral argument at the SCOTUS today in President Trump's challenge to nationwide injunctions issued by district courts that have kept him from enforcing his anti-birthright citizenship EO: How delays & partial injunctions would hurt the true victims,” Ifill wrote.

She added:

If the President is arguing to strip federal judges of the power to stop him from flagrantly violating the 14th Amendment citizenship rights of Americans — literally rendering some children stateless persons — that context is germane to [the] argument about the legitimate use of the federal court's power.

ISTANBUL, May 16. /TASS/. Russia and Ukraine wrapped up talks in Istanbul, Turkey. The sides agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war from each country and present a vision of a potential ceasefire.

TASS has put together key facts about the meeting.

The head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, said he was satisfied with the outcome of the talks and Moscow is ready to continue communication. The sides agreed to a 1,000 for 1,000 exchange of prisoners of war. According to Medinsky, Ukraine requested direct talks between the leaders of the countries and Russia took this "under advisement." Moscow and Kiev would present their vision of a possible ceasefire, with each side "spelling it out in detail." The head of the Russian delegation said the sides plan to continue negotiating.

The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, said Kiev primarily discussed a ceasefire. He also announced an agreement to swap 1,000 prisoners of war from each side. Umerov did not disclose further plans for talks.

The meeting at the Dolmabahce Palace started at 1:35 p.m. on May 16 and lasted about two hours. It followed a three-way meeting between Turkey, the US and Ukraine and an engagement between the head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, and the US team.

Medinsky led the Russian delegation, which also included Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin; the head of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Igor Kostyukov; and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin.

Also, the Russian team included experts, including Alexander Zorin, first deputy head of the information department at the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces; Yelena Podobreyevskaya, deputy head of the Presidential Directorate for State Policy in the Humanitarian Area; Alexey Polishchuk, director of the Second Department of CIS countries at the Russian Foreign Ministry; and Viktor Shevtsov, deputy head of the Main Directorate for International Military Cooperation at the Russian Defense Ministry.

The Ukrainian delegation was led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The team also included First Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Kislitsa, Deputy Head of the Security Service of Ukraine Alexander Poklad, First Deputy Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service Oleg Lugovskoy, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Alexey Shevchenko, Deputy Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate Vadim Skibitsky, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force Command Yevgeny Shinkaryov, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Navy Command Alexander Dyakov, Head of the Department of Intergovernmental Relations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Alexey Malovatsky, head of the International and Operational Law Department of the Central Legal Department of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Alexander Sherikhov, senior officer of the Main Operational Department of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Georgiy Kuzmichev, protocol officer of the AFU Commander-in-Chief's Support Office; and Alexander Bevz, advisor to the chief of staff of the Ukrainian president's office.

Ukrainian and Russian delegations concluded their talks in Istanbul on May 16 after speaking for less than two hours, with no agreement reached on a full, 30-day ceasefire, and Moscow demanding Kyiv withdraw completely from Ukraine's four oblasts that President Vladimir Putin claims to have annexed.

A source in the Ukrainian President's Office briefed on the talks confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Moscow's delegation insisted that Ukraine retreat from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, despite Russia not controlling any of them in their entirety.

The Kremlin illegally declared the annexation of the four oblasts  following sham referenda in late 2022, incorporating them into Russia's constitution — a move that holds no weight internationally.

Despite the demands, the source said the Ukrainian delegation's "impression was that (the Russian) delegation simply didn't have any real authority."

"They now need to return to Moscow, just to figure out what they can even say in response to what they heard here," they added.

According to the source, during the talks, Ukraine offered an immediate ceasefire, an all-for-all prisoner exchange and to hold a face-to-face meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin.

In one positive development, Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement for the exchange of prisoners of war (POWs) on a 1,000-for-1,000 basis, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, who was leading Ukraine's delegation, told reporters after the talks on May 16.

"We know the date, but we're not going to say it yet," he said.

Soon after, Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Russian delegation, confirmed the agreed exchange in comments to Russian state media.

After the talks ended, Zelensky and several top European leaders held a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, the Ukrainian leader announced on Telegram.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk joined Zelensky during the call.

"Ukraine is ready to take the fastest possible steps for real peace, and it is important that the world holds strong positions," Zelensky wrote.

"If the Russians refuse a complete and unconditional stop to the fire and killings, there must be strong sanctions. Pressure on Russia must be maintained until Russia is ready to end the war."

Soon after Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk echoed the condemnation of Russia's unwillingness to stop the fighting.

"The Russians in Istanbul have de facto broken off negotiations and refused to cease fire," Tusk wrote on X. "Time to increase the pressure."

No further details were provided about the content or duration of the call.

"Trump still hopes something can be done," the source in the President's Office said.

According to the source, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Keith Kellogg see the situation as it is. The same source said that Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is, in turn, "overpromising."

After Moscow proposed to hold peace talks in Turkey this week, Zelensky agreed and invited Putin for a face-to-face meeting. The Russian leader declined to attend and appointed his aide, Medinsky, to lead the talks.

The Russian delegation included deputy ministers and lower-level aides and excluded top officials like Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Zelensky commented that Moscow has dispatched a "sham delegation," while Western officials presented the move as an indication that Putin is not serious about peace efforts.

Though Zelensky has since then left for Albania, a Ukrainian delegation, including Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, and Umerov, has arrived in Istanbul to meet the Russian delegates.

The Ukrainian delegation also held meetings with U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier in the day.

Kyiv and its allies have urged Moscow to adopt an unconditional ceasefire starting May 12 as the first step toward peace talks — a proposal Russia has ignored.

While Ukrainian officials said they hope to discuss a possible truce in Istanbul, Russia presented the meeting as the continuation of the 2022 talks and stressed the need to address what it sees as the "root causes" of the war.

An internal document bolsters warnings that the hunt for fraud is a pretext for slashing Social Security benefits.

An internal Trump administration document reportedly shows that anti-fraud checks recently installed at the Social Security agency have found just two cases of potentially improper benefit claims out of more than 110,000 — a rate of 0.0018%.

The documents, first reported Thursday by Nextgov/FCW, further undercut President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's narrative that Social Security is brimming with fraud. Musk falsely claimed in March that “40% of the calls into Social Security were fraudulent.”

The anti-fraud checks for Social Security have been applied only to benefit claims made over the phone. According to the internal document, “No significant fraud has been detected from the flagged cases.” Earlier this year, amid widespread outrage, the Social Security Administration (SSA) walked back a proposal to scrap many of its phone-based benefit claim services.

Nextgov/FCW noted Thursday that the Trump administration's deployment of the anti-fraud tools beginning last month “did cause delays, as SSA changed its phone procedures to add the checks on the backend.”

“The lags stem from the three-day hold placed on telephone claims in order to run the anti-fraud [checks], a move that ‘delays payments and benefits to customers, despite an extremely low risk of fraud,'” Nextgov/FCW reported, citing the internal document.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a statement that “the Trump-Musk Social Security takeover has only meant more chaos and confusion for Americans.”

“Every one of DOGE's so-called ‘mistakes' is a backdoor cut to people's benefits,” said Warren. “There's nothing efficient about making it harder for people to access the checks they've earned and are owed.”

On social media, Warren called the revelations in the internal administration document “a HUGE scandal.”

This is a HUGE scandal.

Elon Musk, JD Vance, and Trump are lying about Social Security fraud.

Internal documents show DOGE found "no significant fraud"—but did slow retirement claim processing by 25%.

It's long been clear that Social Security fraud is minuscule, with an inspector general report published last year estimating that just 0.84% of Social Security benefits paid out between 2015 and 2022 were dispensed improperly — and even those improper payments were not necessarily fraudulent.

The new reporting out Thursday bolstered warnings that the Trump administration's hunt for fraud is a mere pretext for slashing Social Security benefits and weakening the program.

“Turns out there ISN'T rampant Social Security fraud, but Elon's witch hunt, driven by his insane conspiracy theories, IS keeping seniors from getting their benefits as quickly as they should be,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) wrote on social media. “THIS is Republican governing: hunting for nonexistent fraud while breaking Social Security.”

Frank Bisignano, the newly confirmed SSA administrator, has close ties to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and has defended the president's false claim that tens of millions of “dead” people are receiving Social Security benefits.

CNN reported earlier this week that as SSA combs “through its databases to check whether beneficiaries are alive or dead” at Trump and Musk's behest, agency staffers are “seeing more people coming in to be resurrected” after being falsely deemed deceased.

“I've been saying it all along,” former SSA chief Martin O'Malley wrote Thursday. “Elon Musk is the biggest fraud, not Social Security.”

Justice Maria Carroccia has dismissed a jury for the second time in the sexual assault trial of five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team.

The case will proceed by judge alone.

Justice Carroccia made the announcement on Friday morning.

The decision comes after a juror handed the judge a note on Thursday that accused two of the defence lawyers, Daniel Brown and Hilary Dudding, of inappropriate behaviour in the courtroom.

The note read: “Multiple jury members feel we are being judged and made fun of by lawyers Brown and Hilary Dudding. Every day when we enter the courtroom they observe us, whisper to each other and turn to each other and laugh as if they are discussing our appearance. This is unprofessional and unacceptable.”

During legal arguments on Thursday, both lawyers, who are representing Alex Formenton, categorically denied the accusation and Justice Carroccia said she has not witnessed any inappropriate conduct.

After Justice Carroccia made her ruling, Mr. Brown released a statement in which he called the allegations against him and Ms. Dudding an “unfortunate misinterpretation.”

Mr. Brown said that he and his co-counsel have “found ourselves involved in the unusual chain of events that led to this outcome. In short, a juror came to somehow believe that our courtroom demeanor was disrespectful of her.”

He added that “no defence counsel would risk alienating a juror, and nothing could be further from the truth in this instance. While it is true that co-counsel will speak with one another from time to time during a trial, this is commonplace. The very idea of counsel making light of a juror is illogical and runs directly counter to our purpose and function.”

The turn of events comes just days after the now 27-year-old complainant in the case, who is known publicly as E.M., finished nine days of testimony. Seven of those days were spent under what was often gruelling cross-examination by five defence lawyers.

It was the latest interruption in a case that was already upended when a mistrial was declared last month, just as the Crown called its first witness.

Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Mr. Formenton, Dillon Dubé and Cal Foote have each been charged with sexual assaulting E.M. in a downtown London hotel room after a Hockey Canada gala in June, 2018. Mr. McLeod faces a second charge of being a party to sexual assault.

The men have pleaded not guilty.

Throughout the trial, a standard publication ban has been in place that prevents the media from reporting on anything that occurs in court when the jury is not present. Now that the proceedings are going forward by judge-alone, that restriction is no longer in place and the details of what caused the first mistrial can be made public.

That incident also involved the defence counsel for Mr. Formenton.

On April 23, shortly after Crown attorney Heather Donkers finished making the prosecution's opening remarks, court was recessed for the noon break. When the judge returned, she was notified of an interaction between one of the jurors and Ms. Dudding at the Covent Garden Market, a popular lunchtime spot that is located a few blocks away from the courthouse. The pair had ended up in the same line at one of the vendors. What happened next is disputed.

The juror, who earlier in the day as part of the jury instructions from Justice Carroccia, had been warned not to speak to anyone from the court, including the lawyers, had made a complaint to the court sheriff about the interaction, which was relayed to the judge.

Justice Carroccia then brought the juror into court without the rest of the jurors to explain what happened. The juror told the judge that while at the market, a woman who was wearing court robes turned to her and said: “There was a lot of head shaking going on this morning.” (The sheriff said the juror told her: “A lady approached her” and said: “There was a lot of head nodding.”) The juror told the judge she understood she wasn't supposed to say anything so she closed her mouth and nodded.

This juror identified Ms. Dudding — who was sitting among the defence attorneys — in the courtroom as the individual she interacted with in line.

Ms. Dudding, who is an experienced trial litigator, emphatically denied this account. In Ms. Dudding's version of events, she was standing in line and realized a juror was standing closely behind her. In a reflexive reaction, she told the court she said something to the affect of “Oops, I'm sorry” and “It's awkward.”

In court, the juror told the judge that after the interaction, she took her lunch order and sat down at a nearby table in the market. She said a second juror joined her and she relayed what happened.

“I just said to her that she (Ms. Dudding) approached me and said that there was head shaking going on. And I just said, ‘as soon as she started talking to me, I didn't say anything back to her' is all I said,” the juror told the judge.

She said she remembered that the second juror replied: “It didn't seem right.”

The judge also called the second juror into court to describe the events. In her telling, the first juror told her: “A person said to her there's an awful lot of nodding going on.”

She said she believed the interaction seemed “inappropriate.”

Court then heard that, after lunch, all the jurors were together back at the court and began discussing what had transpired at the market.

Justice Carroccia adjourned court early, explaining that an issue had come up over the lunch hour that she needed time to consider and that she needed to discuss with the lawyers.

The judge and lawyers met for legal arguments in court the next day.

Crown lawyer Meaghan Cunningham asserted that a “corrective instruction” from the judge to the jury — in other words, telling jurors that they should put the incident out of their minds — would be sufficient to move forward with the trial.

In summarizing the Crown's position, the judge said: “The Crown submits that there is no basis to believe that either of the involved jurors or the other members of the jury hold any belief or are now biased against the defense.”

However, defence lawyer Megan Savard, who spoke for the lawyers representing the accused players, said there was no way that court could move forward. Ms. Savard stated that while she believed Ms. Dudding's version of events, it didn't matter because there was now a credibility contest between the juror and a defence lawyer.

Ms. Savard also argued that the juror's account — and apparent propensity to gossip — raised questions about their ability to hear and consider facts.

In reaching her decision, Justice Carroccia found that she had no choice but to declare a mistrial.

Simply removing one or both of the jurors involved in the market interaction would not have fixed the problem and a corrective instruction would have been insufficient, she said.

“My concern is that the circumstances of this case give rise to the possibility that one or more members of the jury may harbour negative feelings about defense counsel that could potentially impact on their ability to fairly decide the case,” she said. “Justice requires that I declare a mistrial in this case and begin the trial again. Accordingly, the motion for a mistrial is granted.”

This is how we grieve under occupation: digitally, remotely, alone. Our mourning, like our lives, is fragmented.

This is how we grieve under occupation: digitally, remotely, alone. Our mourning, like our lives, is fragmented.

My father, Najy Ajour, was supposed to leave Gaza for Egypt to reunite with my mother, two sisters and their children. I had convinced them to leave for their safety after our family home and second flat in Tal al-Hawa were destroyed. They had already endured a dehumanizing displacement journey that left trauma and deep scars. With the support of friends, I was able to arrange their departure through the Rafah crossing while it was briefly open.

The plan was to evacuate my father shortly after, along with another sister who remained in Gaza. But just days later, on May 7, 2024, the Rafah crossing closed, leaving him behind alone. What followed was the hardest year of his 74-year life. Still, he held on to hope, waiting for the border to open and the promise of reunion to be fulfilled.

Just hours before his death, he messaged my sister with a glimmer of optimism: There might be good news, he said. A ceasefire deal is being negotiated. He had already packed his bag, including three kilos of Arabic coffee for my mother and sisters. He had set aside a tracksuit for the journey and had sent most of his clothes ahead with my sisters to lighten his luggage.

My sisters still remember the way he cried when he took them to the Rafah crossing. His tears were deep and heavy. They thought he would follow shortly after. They didn't realize that goodbye would be final. That it was the last time they would see him.

In his final year, he lived in forced solitude, first displaced from the al-Mawasi area, then moving to my sister's partially damaged apartment in Khan Younis. Despite the trauma and devastation, he continued to dream. Just a day before he died, he told my sister he had dreamt his name was on the travel list — a list published on the Rafah border authority's page, naming those permitted to cross. But instead of traveling to Egypt, he travelled to God.

Two days before he passed, an airstrike hit the building next to my sister's home, killing several members of her husband's family. This affected my father deeply and his health declined rapidly. Without access to lifesaving medication or food, he died in hunger and despair, still holding on to hope that the crossing would open.

Before his displacement to the south, he used to visit his best friend, my aunt Nada, daily. But after the temporary ceasefire, he didn't go north to see her, his brothers or the rubble of our home. He wanted to stay near Rafah in case he could leave quickly. Tragically, his siblings only saw him again to say goodbye to his lifeless body.

My grief is shaped by siege and the cruelty of enforced separation. I was denied the chance to see my father in life and in death. The blockade kept us apart for decades. I left Gaza in 1993 for the West Bank, and though I visited occasionally when rare permits were granted by Israeli government, I had not seen him in person since 2014. That year, he came to Jerusalem for surgery. Since then, we stayed in touch through calls and video chats, always hoping for reunion. On his last birthday in November 2024, I sent him an old photo of us and wrote: “We'll take new ones soon.” He replied, “Inshallah. We will share the best moments together.” That day never came.

My father was a charismatic and beloved figure in Gaza, a legendary Palestinian footballer and national celebrity. He was admired not only for his talent on the field but for the warmth, joy and light he brought into people's lives. I was deeply moved by the number of articles and tributes written by friends and figures from the sports community all celebrating his remarkable life, captivating personality, smile and unparalleled talent. In Al-Quds newspaper the headlines included “The Miracle of Palestinian Football Has Passed Away” and “Funeral of the Superstar of the Golden Era, Najy Ajour.” A column article paid tribute with the title “The Legend, Najy Ajour, Has Passed Away.” In Al-Ayyam newspaper, one headline read “Sadness looms over the nation's athletes after the death of Najy Ajour, the legend of Palestinian football.” Another article in the same paper was titled “The Martyr of Displacement.” There was also a headline: “A commemorative football match held in honour of Najy Ajour's spirit.” In one survey, he was voted the best football player in Palestine over the past 50 years. He proudly shared every article written about him and often spoke to me about his achievements, inspiring me to pursue my own with the same passion.

He survived multiple bombings, the destruction of our home and repeated displacement. But it wasn't an airstrike that took him; it was the quiet violence of despair.

He was always proud of me just as I am proud of him. He expressed his love and pride by telling me, “I am the father of Dr. Ashjan Najy Ajour,” placing his name between my first and last name. It was his way of saying, “I love you and I'm proud of you.” Despite the distance, the borders and the blockade, our bond only deepened. We were more than father and daughter; we were close friends. My siblings often wondered how I could be so open with him, sharing things they wouldn't dare to. He even appreciated the way I challenged him, which shaped my strength. He always gave me courage. We often argued playfully. He used to joke, “You give me a headache,” and I'd reply, “I'll bring you Acamol!”

He was full of life, with a youthful spirit. He loved sports, dancing, vibrant colors, flowers and lights. Even in his final messages, he sent me photos of himself with red roses and a cup of coffee, captioned “Sabah Al Ward” (the morning of flowers). He reacted to my reply with a heart emoji. That was the last thing I received from him: his heart, the most beautiful one. I now realize I inherited his love for color, for flowers and for life itself. In my home, I've created a small corner in his honor, framing his photos and surrounding them with the flowers he adored. And every morning, I greet him with “Sabah Al Ward.”

A man who once celebrated life with such vitality was in his final years reduced to surviving on canned food, weakened by malnutrition and deprived of the medical care he desperately needed. He was displaced and the destruction of our family home broke his heart, becoming weaker each day. His heart began to fail but there was no doctor to see him, no hospital equipped to help him. No time. No space. No safety. The war didn't strike him directly. But it killed him.

My father didn't die a natural death. He wasn't killed by a missile, but he was killed nonetheless by despair, forced separation, the slow violence of siege, starvation and heartbreak. In Gaza, there is no peaceful death. When you live under constant airstrikes, famine and destruction, even dying becomes another form of violence. His body failed because the world failed him first.

What shattered me most was that I wasn't there when he died. I couldn't whisper goodbye. I grieved behind a screen separated by distance and blockade. None of his children were with him except one of my sisters who couldn't even attend his burial. His body had to be transported through dangerous roads from Khan Younis to the north. Even in death, he wasn't free. We feared his coffin might be bombed en route. In Gaza, funeral processions are targets, graves are desecrated and mourning is a luxury few can afford.

I watched videos of his coffin from afar, grieving in isolation. I couldn't see him — not in life, not in death. I saw images of his body arriving at the ruins of our home. My aunts and uncles gathered, crying out: “Habibi, we miss you!” A cousin whispered, “Ashjan sends her love.” I had asked them to kiss him for me, but the camera failed. I heard mourning but I couldn't see it. This is how we grieve under occupation: digitally, remotely, alone. Our mourning, like our lives, is fragmented.

Despite the danger, many gathered at the rubble of our old neighborhood to honor him. The Palestinian sports movement in Gaza paid tribute to the man who brought joy and pride to generations. In Egypt, where many of his friends had been evacuated, another funeral was held. I saw photos of my nephew Najy, who was named after my father, serving guests as prominent sports figures gathered to pay tribute and honor his memory. Watching those photos from a distance, I felt gratitude and heartbreak: Gratitude that he was honored.

Even amid genocide and trauma, I never let myself imagine his death. It felt sudden, but in truth, it was the slow culmination of prolonged suffering. He survived multiple bombings, the destruction of our home and repeated displacement. But it wasn't an airstrike that took him; it was the quiet violence of despair.

He died after watching the Royal Madrid football match, the one thing he loved most in life. For two days, he had been unwell and needed to see a heart doctor, but how could we find one amid the destruction of Gaza's health care system? How could his heart bear so much? After surviving so many attacks, so much fear, so much loss, how did it hold on? It wasn't just sickness that took him, it was despair. Despair is a quiet lethal form of violence. He died from kahar, a word in Arabic that means “dying from sorrow too great to bear.” It's a death born from loss, grief and a broken spirit. He died because our family was scattered across borders: his wife and two daughters in Egypt, me in the U.K., my brother in the West Bank and only one daughter still with him in Gaza. He hadn't seen some of us in years. I hadn't embraced him in over a decade. And yet, he held on to hope that one day, he would be reunited with us. That hope kept him alive. And when that hope disappeared, so did he.

My father's death was the result of intentional colonial cruelty and injustice. He was denied the right to live, to move freely and to access care. And now, I am denied the right to mourn him properly. His passing reflects not only a personal loss, but the collective Palestinian suffering shaped by siege, displacement and decades of colonial violence. He died alone waiting: to reunite with family, to escape Gaza's war brutality, to live in peace.

He had hoped to grow old surrounded by his wife, children and grandchildren. He told my sister he would rent a better flat in Egypt. He had dreams. He had plans. He held on to life and I held on to hope. But I now wonder: Why was I so hopeful? Was hope just a shield, a way to survive the unthinkable? Because of it, I delayed asking my father things I always meant to. I never recorded his memories.

I thought we had more time. I had hoped to gather all the articles and writings about him and create a special collection as a surprise for his birthday. I wanted to give him something that would preserve his legacy, especially since everything he had documented over the years had been destroyed when our home was bombed. They didn't just destroy the walls. We lost the memories, the archives, the pieces of history we wanted to hold onto. Another dream I held close was to sit down and interview him, to hear all his stories in his own voice, his achievements, his memories, his journey. I wanted to write about him in both Arabic and English, to honor him not only as a father but also as the legend he truly was. I wanted to make him proud, to celebrate his legacy while he was still with us.

This grief is not just mine — it's Palestinian grief: displacement, family fragmentation and disrupted mourning. Friends said, “At least his body wasn't torn apart.” I know they meant well, but it shows how dehumanized we've become, grateful just to bury our dead whole. The sorrow is not only in his absence, but in what he missed. He never met me again since 2014, never sat at my table, never hugged me. He was 74. I thought we had a decade more. Instead, he died waiting to see his children together.

Yet he lives on. In memory, in tribute, in newspaper headlines that called him “The Miracle and Legend of Palestinian Football” and “The Martyr of Displacement.”

My father's death was not only the end of a chapter, it was the theft of everything we had hoped would follow. And yet, I will remember. I will write. I will honor him not only through mourning, but through love and life, through the ongoing resistance and celebration of Palestinian existence. He was stolen from me, but his story and our memory will not be erased. I will be my father's daughter. I will carry the heart he gave me. I will carry his name. He is not absent, he is present in everything, in my heartbeat, in my spirit. He will live on through me and in my children. I will continue to love flowers, colors, the pursuit of dreams and life itself. Just as he scored goals on the football field, I will score in my field. I will always be Dr. Ashjan Najy Ajour, the daughter he was proud of.

The British government has appointed General Gwyn Jenkins as First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff. Approved by King Charles III on Thursday, the decision follows unresolved allegations that Jenkins had failed to report suspected war crimes in Afghanistan and later obstructed the relocation of key witnesses.

The general succeeds Admiral Ben Key, who stepped down last week amid an ongoing misconduct investigation. Media reports suggest that the probe centers on Key's alleged affair with a more junior female colleague.

Jenkins came under scrutiny two years ago when the BBC reported that the then-Vice-Chief of the Defense Staff had failed to forward evidence of Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers executing handcuffed detainees in Afghanistan to the Royal Military Police.

At the time, Jenkins did not respond to the allegations. The UK Ministry of Defense stated that it was “not appropriate for us to comment on allegations which may be within the scope of the statutory inquiry.”

In April 2024, then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak appointed Jenkins—then Vice-Chief of the Defense Staff—as National Security Adviser. However, the appointment was later reversed by the incoming government led by Keir Starmer. While Starmer declined to comment on individual appointments, he emphasized the need for an “open and transparent process” for future nominations. Media outlets attributed the reversal to Jenkins' implication in the ongoing inquiry.

Earlier this month, BBC Panorama reported that Jenkins had overseen the rejection of hundreds of relocation applications submitted by Afghan commandos who had served alongside British forces and possessed direct knowledge of UK military operations. The report stated that these rejections effectively blocked key witnesses from reaching Britain and testifying in the public inquiry into the Afghan conflict.

Order follows Pentagon's announcement of plan to remove 1,000 military members who openly identify as trans

US military commanders will be told to identify troops in their units who are transgender or have gender dysphoria, then send them to get medical checks in order to force them out of the service.

A senior defense official on Thursday laid out what could be a complicated and lengthy new process aimed at fulfilling Donald Trump's directive to remove transgender service members from the US military despite years of service alongside all the other 2 million US troops.

Earlier this month, the Pentagon announced plans to remove in short order the 1,000 members of the military who openly identify as trans, and giving those who have yet to so identify openly 30 days to remove themselves.

That memo was fueled by a supreme court decision allowing the Trump administration to enforce a ban on trans military members. The defense department has said it will follow up by going through medical records to identify others who have not come forward.

The latest order to commanders relies on routine annual health checks that service members are required to undergo. Another defense official said the Pentagon had scrapped – for now – plans to go through troops' health records to identify those with gender dysphoria.

Instead, transgender troops who do not voluntarily come forward could be outed by commanders or others aware of their medical status. Gender dysphoria occurs when a person's biological sex does not match their gender identity.

The defense officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details of the new policy. The process raises comparisons to the earlier “don't ask, don't tell” policy, which at times had commanders or other troops outing gay members of the military who at the time were not allowed to serve openly.

Active-duty troops will have until 6 June to voluntarily identify themselves to the defense department, and troops in the national guard and reserve have until 7 July.

The department is offering a financial incentive to those who volunteer to leave, although some who have put their hand up point out that it is far from genuinely voluntary. They will receive roughly double the amount of separation pay of those who do not come forward.


 A new question about gender dysphoria is being added to service members' annual health assessment. Active-duty troops who do not voluntarily come forward would have to acknowledge their gender dysphoria during that medical check, which could be scheduled months from now.

A unit commander could expedite the health assessment. Under the new policy, “commanders who are aware of service members in their units with gender dysphoria, a history of gender dysphoria, or symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria will direct individualized medical record reviews of such service members to confirm compliance with medical standards”.
 The defense official said it was the duty of the service member and the commander to comply with the new process.

Officials have said that as of 9 December 2024, there were 4,240 active-duty troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria national guard and reserve. But they acknowledge the actual number may be higher.

Trump tried to ban transgender troops during his first term, while allowing those currently serving to stay on. Joe Biden overturned the ban after he became president.

The new policy does not grandfather in those currently serving and only allows for limited waivers or exceptions.

Trump and his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, claim that transgender troops do not meet “military standards” with Hegseth stating baldly on social media: “No More Trans @ DoD” and denigrating transgender people during recent public comments.

A man living in a tent eats as his dog stands nearby, in Vancouver, on Feb. 14.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Shelley Wood is a writer and journalist whose most recent novel is The Leap Year Gene.

I'm a bleeding-heart liberal, voting green or orange, or strategically red. I'm also fortunate: I make a good living and am happy to be taxed to help improve the lives around me. Most of my family and friends share my sociopolitical views, which is comfortable and reaffirming.

Lately, however, I've sensed a subtle shifting of the plates in my social-justice core, relating to a specific quadrant of lefty groupthink: the dual crisis of addiction and homelessness.

To be clear, I accept, absolutely, that addiction is a disease, stigmatized too long while pharmaceutical companies and organized crime reap the profits. Compassionately and ethically addressing opioid addiction and the enmeshed problems of mental illness, domestic violence, intergenerational trauma, colonialism, poverty and more – compounded by a toxic drug supply – deserve the same resources, research and moon-shot ambitions of cancer or COVID-19. On top of that, the lack of affordable housing, emergency shelters and addiction treatment in Canada's cities is a shameful situation in need of lasting solutions at all levels of government.

What I've been wrestling with, privately, is whether I and my socially minded comrades are unintentionally part of the problem.

I trace the start of my quiet doubts to the days when people without housing began pitching their tents in municipal parks in cities across Canada. I and my friends expressed horror and outrage when bulldozers arrived to evict the tent cities. We all knew this was an assault on human dignity – these tents were the closest thing camp denizens had to homes and a community. How could they be destroyed by state powers when unhoused folks had nowhere else to go?

Yet a tiny voice in my head, one I wouldn't dare to speak aloud, asked: but parks? Surely we can do better: find better locations, better shelter? Still, I reasoned, when I have so much, maybe this was a small price for a temporary, urgent solution?

Then I started noticing changes in my husband. He used to keep old winter jackets in his car to offer to people sleeping rough. He'd buy two hot drinks at Starbucks, giving one to the guy panhandling out front. He convinced his family-run business to cover Kelowna's Gospel Mission's hot meals program. In recent years, however, he's spent most workday mornings cleaning excrement, trash, and drug paraphernalia from his shopfront before opening for business in downtown Kelowna. He's had thousands of dollars of product stolen. He's spent more repairing damaged property, much of it done by the same small group, their crimes deemed too small to warrant sentencing. His compassion has waned while his vitriol mounted.

I, too, am learning vitriol. Earlier this year, three men on bicycles with trailers (captured on neighbour's cameras) broke into our home while we were out of town. Over the course of 24 hours, the footage suggests, they ransacked, showered, ate from our pantry, used the beds, left feces in our toilets and soiled clothes on the floor. They stole computers, phones, stereos, jewellery, family heirlooms, and tellingly: almost all our warm winter jackets and boots. They emptied our freezer and liquor cabinet, then stole our cars to transport their haul.

To the homeless encampment. At least, that's where my work IT guy tracked my computer. Our cars, too, were found – by my brother-in-law, not the police – parked at the camp, as were the thieves' bikes and trailers, easily identifiable from security footage.

The RCMP officer assigned to our case called it the worst “home invasion” he'd ever seen, yet no one followed up with neighbours' videos and had to be cajoled into taking beer cans for fingerprinting. Ninety days after the break-in, he banged on our door at 9 p.m. to say he needed us to sign a paper to extend the request: Months had gone by yet the evidence hadn't even been analyzed. Another officer warned us not to expect a conviction, even if RCMP identified subjects and pressed charges. We've heard this before. One man caught stealing from my husband's downtown business had been charged with “petty” theft over 200 times.

Nor did the RCMP try to track down our stolen items in the encampment – to do so, they explained, would infringe on reasonable expectations of privacy in the camp. Indeed, many people I've told about our situation have stories of friends or family members who've gone to the encampment themselves to try to find and buy back their stolen goods. One officer told us the best chance of retrieving our stuff will be if one of the perpetrators dies of an overdose: A corpse would allow them to enter the tent to claim stolen items.

This is a profoundly broken situation. I am persuaded by the evidence in support of harm reduction that treats addiction as a medical problem, promoting human rights while seeking to curb the risks of infections, overdose, criminalization and stigma. For harm reduction to succeed, however, it needs buy-in not only from those with substance addiction, but also from community members paying taxes aimed at ameliorating the problem.

And we need to be open to reassessing what's working and what's not. One example making headlines is British Columbia's well-intentioned but poorly thought-through “safe supply” program. While safe supply has no doubt helped many people with drug addiction to obtain prescribed, non-toxic medications for personal use, it's had unintended consequences. According to a recent class action lawsuit and the RCMP, lethal doses of “safe” opiate prescriptions are making their way onto the streets with dire consequences for first-time users and vulnerable youth, increasing the risk of overdose and further taxing emergency services, social workers, and hospitals.

“That's what you get for legalizing drugs,” sniffed a manager at my bank when we went to check our account security after the break-in.

In fact, decriminalization has seen more success in places like Portugal, largely because it was accompanied by heavy investment in addiction treatment services and assertive measures to engage people living with addictions who are found to be contributing to social problems. Portuguese decriminalization was also commitment to public safety. Critically, Portugal decriminalized drug possession but considered all drug crime illegal and punishable, enacting “dissuasion commissions” to tailor rehabilitation needs, stipulate penalties, and minimize community impact. By contrast, British Columbia's incomplete approach – decriminalization and safe supply – hasn't done enough to protect high-risk youth, fund effective and accessible treatment interventions, or prioritize public safety.

I'm wrestling with all of this. I need people who know more about this than I do to do better, even if it means trying new approaches and abandoning the ones that haven't moved the needle.

But there's the catch. For Canada to invest in the full tool kit required to combat addiction, it needs the backing of citizens who care about a healthy, equitable society.

I fear that's what's slipping.

The public price has become too high; hearts like mine are at risk of bleeding dry.

As more people end up as collateral damage to B.C.'s floundering approach to this complex problem, support inevitably wanes. Worse, the best state efforts to support those dealing with unaffordable housing, addiction, or both, may have unwittingly created a situation where hardened criminals can operate with impunity within the very services and supports that tax dollars sustain. As crimes go unchecked and compassion erodes, criminality is conflated with homelessness, lawlessness with addiction, creating an infectious muck of distrust and anger that helps no one, least of all the very people at highest need.

My husband and I are still tabulating our losses, both the financial and intangible. I lost digital photos of loved ones. I lost keepsakes, mostly worthless, that held priceless memories. As a woman, I lost my sense of safety and security in my own home – the very thing that might, in other circumstances, cement my empathy for those trying to survive on Canada's streets. But the biggest loss? My compassion, now doing battle with a toxic blend of grief, disgust and rage.

This issue deserved to be an election issue last month, and it was, but the rhetoric – as always – was divisive. Neither of the prospective prime ministers offered creative, comprehensive, collaborative proposals that might risk rankling their base, any more than they could admit to decades of past missteps by successive governing parties. 

Because that's the kicker: Caring for people living without shelter, driven to desperate acts by their illness, is not the purview of left or right leaning people. Caring is bipartisan, or should be. But if people stop caring, particularly people putting their faith in strong social supports, donating to their local charities, and committed to a kind and compassionate Canada – then we are all the poorer for it.

MOSCOW, May 16. /TASS/. The Russian delegation in Istanbul is in constant contact with President Vladimir Putin, Kremlin Sspokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

"Our negotiating team [in Istanbul] is in constant contact. The president receives all information online, there are constant reports," the spokesman said when asked whether presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky additionally consults with the Kremlin.

On May 11, Vladimir Putin, speaking to reporters in the Kremlin, suggested that the Kiev authorities resume without preconditions the direct talks Ukraine broke off in 2022, proposing to launch a dialogue on May 15 in Istanbul.

On May 14, Putin approved the composition of the Russian delegation. It is headed by Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, who represented the country at the talks in 2022. The delegation also includes Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, head of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Igor Kostyukov, and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin.

President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Albania on May 16 to attend a summit of the European Political Community, presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov said, according to the state news channel Freedom TV.

The sixth meeting of the European Political Community will focus on Europe's security, including Russia's ongoing full-scale war against Ukraine, among other topics.

The summit comes as Ukrainian and Russian delegations are expected to hold talks in Istanbul for the first time since 2022. Turkish and U.S. officials will also reportedly join the series of discussions.

Zelensky's visit follows his trip to Turkey, where he met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Although a face-to-face meeting between Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin was anticipated in Istanbul, Putin instead sent a delegation led by his aide, Vladimir Medinsky.

Kyiv and its partners have urged Moscow to adopt an unconditional 30-day ceasefire as the first step toward a broader peace deal, a move that Russia continues to reject.


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war —
          and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information
          should be available to all.
        


          Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can
          survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise. Will you help us
          do it?

The disputes and chaos that followed the United States' sudden imposition of blanket tariffs in April have threatened to pick apart the tightly woven fabric of global production. Around 300 million companies worldwide connected by an estimated 13 billion supply links now face unprecedented uncertainty. But the current confusion is just the most recent example of the economic disruption that has marked the last half-decade. Since the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020, surprising bottlenecks in global supply chains have made scholars reassess how the economy works. Production slowdowns and shortages of goods as varied as hand sanitizer (which required speciality chemicals imported into the United States during the pandemic) and airplanes (Airbus faced delays in meeting demand because of shortages of important components in 2024) have exposed the vulnerabilities of a global economic system in which goods cross borders multiple times at successive stages of production and assembly. They have also challenged conventional understandings of how best to measure growth and productivity.

Trade and technology have rewired global production, but economic statistics measuring outcomes, such as GDP growth and productivity, are still collected on the basis of frameworks devised in the 1940s that focus primarily on the demand side of the economy and its current and past performance. They say little about the supply side, or an economy's ability to respond to pressure. As a result, around four-fifths of the output of advanced economies has been designated by economists as “hard to measure.” A disproportionate focus on easier-to-measure industries such as manufacturing to evaluate performance underestimates the importance of the industries actually powering the modern economy.

In an era of unprecedented interconnectedness—and upheaval—policymakers need new tools to track the condition of global production networks and capture forms of activity unimaginable at the birth of modern economic statistics. The overhaul will require more and better data gathering to fill gaps in knowledge, including indications of supply chain vulnerabilities, and innovative techniques for measuring how qualitative and intangible aspects of an economy contribute to growth and inflation. A new framework that wrestles with what standard statistics cannot is not just an academic matter; it is the only way leaders can make sound economic policy in uncertain times.

The current international framework for measuring economic growth and productivity is the System of National Accounts, a set of statistical standards agreed on every ten to 20 years by a United Nations–led committee of official statisticians. It includes GDP, long considered by economists and policymakers to be the single best measure of economic progress.

The System of National Accounts was established by American and British economists, including John Maynard Keynes, during World War II. As Allied countries dedicated resources and productive capacity to the war effort, they needed to strike a balance between consumption and war production and devised the SNA to measure, among other things, domestic demand. The system took hold in the years following the war and has been revised roughly every decade in response to structural changes in the economy, such as the rising influence of finance. The revision process is intentionally slow and incremental, requiring consensus among UN member countries before any changes are adopted.

Today's SNA is a sophisticated measure of the mid-twentieth-century economy, in which the manufacturing sector dominated, production took place within the borders of single countries, and broadband networks and data did not yet power economic growth. Recent updates to the SNA have made modest, modernizing changes. But no amount of tinkering around the edges will change the fundamental obsolescence of a system built around the drivers of growth and productivity from a bygone era. The SNA can perform the autopsy, but it cannot make a diagnosis or prescribe treatment.

The SNA has standardized the measurement of economic growth and enabled international comparisons for nearly a century. It has not, however, kept pace with changes in economic activity enabled by globalization and technological advances. Since the 1980s, manufacturing and service production, the networks of which were once national, have shifted to rely on global value chains. Whereas global trade once meant completed cars or refrigerators being shipped between countries, it now entails the transport of highly specialized components across borders at each stage of production and assembly.

New business models have flourished as the global economy has become more elaborate and entangled. Traditional integrated manufacturers that controlled the process from design to production and wholesaling have given way to “factory-less goods producers” that design, wholesale, and retail; contract companies that carry out the manufacturing; and downstream “servitized” manufacturers that focus on selling related services and maintenance. Contracted-out manufacturing accounts for some 15 to 20 percent of output in sectors such as electronics and pharmaceuticals in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the bundling of services with products (Rolls-Royce, for example, sells real-time monitoring services for its airplane engines) has become a popular practice among large companies.

These shifts have led to broad economic growth as specialization and the division of labor increase productivity in an ever-widening global market. But the trade-offs have become clear: goods have become cheaper, more accessible, and of higher quality, but companies have grown overly reliant on a few overseas suppliers for key components, making them more vulnerable to global economic shocks that are only becoming more common. Traditional economic statistics were not designed for this complex network of interdependence. The lack of reliable measurements on the supply side of the economy has made it difficult to capture the patterns and condition of global production chains even in calmer times.

So, too, has the inadaptability of these statistics in the face of sweeping technological advancement. Traditional stalwart measures such as GDP are not capable of accounting for the effects of cost-saving and productivity-increasing infrastructure such as cloud services on growth. They also underestimate, for example, the value of data to large companies, accounting only for the cost of building data centers and not the less tangible productivity enabled by data collection and use. What is more, statisticians cannot agree on how to record the value of widely used free digital services such as open-source software.

Central banks and researchers have begun to construct broad measures of supply chain pressures, such as the Federal Reserve's Global Supply Chain Pressure index, because of the central role that such stresses have played in driving the inflation that has racked the global economy since the pandemic. But statisticians—and therefore policymakers—still lack sufficient metrics for measuring the risks to supply chains for specific products, even high-profile ones such as the iPhone. Nor do they have the tools or expertise to understand how digitization and artificial intelligence are reshaping business models and trade. Put simply, they are attempting to craft policy without a useful statistical guide to current and future production in today's economy.

Developing statistics about global production networks is not impossible. Academic experts in this area, such as the University of Cambridge economist Vasco Carvalho, have explained how tax and payments data could be used to understand and track the flow of product components. But a truly effective update of economic statistics must go beyond mapping production networks and the new business models enabled by technology. It must also focus on capturing the economic resilience and future potential of an economy while better detailing its current patterns of production.

The economic concept known as comprehensive wealth is key to this reimagining. Comprehensive wealth broadly describes a country's balance sheet, including conventional productive capacity, such as the condition of the buildings and equipment owned by businesses, and its national infrastructure, from roads to ports. Crucially, it should also factor in communications networks and their potential chokepoints and vulnerabilities, along with other intangible infrastructure, including the data available to the government and private sectors, and “digital public infrastructure,” meaning hardware such as cloud servers and telecom networks; data and identity verification systems, which enable the digitization of public services and store all the economic and official statistics that businesses and governments need); and applications, including payment systems and government services. The digital stack is peppered with its own bottlenecks and vulnerabilities, and any government concerned with national security and resilience will need to be able to quantify these risks.

A national balance sheet needs a measure of human capital to quantify how the skills and health of the workforce contribute to productivity and earnings. It should also take into account a country's natural capital: although some of the natural resources that enable economic activity, such as the rare earths and other critical minerals needed in cutting-edge technology, are partially valued by current statistical frameworks, a fuller account must also consider undervalued resources, such as the national parks that provide leisure services and the soil quality and biodiversity that enable agricultural productivity.

Finally, a truly comprehensive statistical account should include what economists such as the Nobel Prize winners Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson have identified as the contribution that a country's legal and governmental institutions make to its prosperity through confidence in the rule of law, the security of contracts, and economic freedoms. Available metrics do not distinguish between productivity in countries with “extractive” institutions that concentrate wealth among elites at the expense of the broader population, discouraging private investment and individual skill acquisition, and countries in which institutions provide the stability that allows all people to thrive in their jobs or businesses.

Switching from traditional economic surveys of consumers and businesses to novel data sources will be a cultural revolution for traditionally cautious statisticians. Collecting the volume of data needed to build a more complete picture of a country's productivity and its economic vulnerabilities will take considerable planning by national statistical agencies, whose resources have been steadily reduced in most countries since the global financial crisis of 2008 tightened government budgets worldwide. It will also require an international effort to develop a consensus on definitions and data standards. But with response rates to official statistical surveys declining and businesses and individuals increasingly afflicted with “survey fatigue,” profound changes are both necessary and inevitable.

The very revolutions in data collection and technology that have necessitated a new statistical paradigm will be useful in creating it. Much of the underlying data already exists or could be collected, from the payment and tax numbers needed to track global production networks, to employers' payroll figures, information collected from store scanner systems, and the many new sources of sensor and satellite data. Pilot data initiatives such as the Anthropic Economic Index can help statisticians track the adoption and use of artificial intelligence across society, a defining technological shift that is currently invisible in economic statistics.

Global production networks are under immense strain. Policymakers rightly expect their statistical systems to deliver useful information on the state of their economies. Just as the imperatives of war led to the development of the SNA in the 1940s, the new exigencies of a world riven by trade wars, geopolitical instability, and supply shocks require a modern statistical framework. Without it, a true grasp of the nature of the global economy will remain elusive—and the world will remain in the dark.

Ex-FBI director deletes Instagram post of shells in ‘8647' formation that Republicans claim is code for assassination

A now-deleted photo of seashells posted on Instagram by the former FBI director James Comey is being investigated by the US Secret Service, after the US homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said it constituted a “threat” against Donald Trump, and set off warnings from other administration officials.

On Thursday, Comey posted a photo of seashells forming the message “8647”, with a caption that read: “Cool shell formation on my beach walk.”

Trump's supporters have interpreted the message as an endorsement of violence against Trump, the 47th president, who survived an attempt on his life at a campaign event in Pennsylvania last year.

But the term 86 is a slang term far more often frequently used to mean getting rid of or throwing something out. It is thought to have its roots in the restaurant industry and is used to mean scrapping old equipment or not serving particular customers, as well as in a military context for stopping a mission or plan, often as a synonym for “nix”. Merriam-Webster notes that 86 has very occasionally been used to mean “to kill” but said it did not endorse that meaning “due to its relative recency and sparseness of use”.

A spokesperson for the Secret Service confirmed the agency was “aware of the incident” and said it would “vigorously investigate” any potential threat, but did not offer further details.

Comey later took down his post, saying in a statement that he was unaware of the seashells' potential meaning and saying that he does not condone violence of any kind.

“I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message,” Comey said in a statement. “I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me, but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.”

But the post ignited a firestorm on the right, with Trump loyalists accusing the former FBI director of calling for the president's assassination, with differing political interpretations of the message.

“Disgraced former FBI director James Comey just called for the assassination of POTUS Trump,” Noem wrote on X. “DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.”

The director of the FBI, Kash Patel, said his agency would “provide all necessary support” as part of an investigation headed by the Secret Service.

Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the presidential security agency, said on social media that the agency investigates anything that could be taken as a threat. “We are aware of the social media posts by the former FBI Director & we take rhetoric like this very seriously,” he added.

Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, said she didn't buy Comey's explanation that the message carried no greater meaning. Gabbard said Comey had “just issued a call to action to murder the president of the United States.”

As a former FBI director and someone who spent most of his career prosecuting mobsters and gangsters, he knew exactly what he was doing and must be held accountable under the full force of the law,” Gabbard posted on X.

Gabbard later told Fox News that Comey was “issuing a hit” on the president and that “the dangerousness of this cannot be underestimated.”

Comey's cryptic post comes as the former FBI director is about to publish FDR Drive, the third installment of a crime series about a fictional New York lawyer, Nora Carleton. Publisher's Weekly outlined the plot as centering on a US attorney who tries to bring to justice “a far-right media personality with a popular podcast vilifying those he thinks are destroying America: intellectuals, immigrants, and people of color”.

Comey and Trump have a deeply antagonistic relationship that stretches back to the early days of the first Trump administration, when, according to Comey, Trump sought to secure a pledge of loyalty from the then FBI director, who refused.

In a move that shocked Washington, Trump dismissed Comey, who was leading the criminal investigation into Russian meddling in the US election. Comey later wrote a memoir that recounted the episode, prompting Trump to declare him an “untruthful slime ball”.

Comey has remained a Maga world bete noire, drawing rightwing ire whenever he steps into the political fray.

Taylor Budowich, the White House deputy chief of staff, also responded by calling the photo “deeply concerning” and accused Comey of putting out “what can clearly be interpreted as ‘a hit' on the sitting President of the United States”.

The Tennessee congressman Tim Burchett, a staunch Trump supporter, called for Comey to be jailed. “Arrest Comey,” he wrote on X.

The former director of the FBI has been accused of issuing a death threat against Donald Trump after taking a picture of seashells on a beach.

James Comey, who led the FBI from 2013-2017, shared a photo on Instagram of seashells lined up on the sand to depict the numbers “8647”.

He captioned the post: “Cool shell formation on my beach walk.”

However, the Secret Service is now investigating the matter after Trump allies interpreted the cryptic message as an incitement to violence against the president.

To “86” is a slang term used in the hospitality industry and the military, meaning to ban someone from an establishment or scrap a piece of equipment. However, it can also mean to kill someone.

Meanwhile, “47” is seen as a reference to Mr Trump, who is the 47th US president.

“While President Trump is currently on an international trip to the Middle East, the former FBI Director puts out what can clearly be interpreted as ‘a hit' on the sitting President of the United States — a message etched in the sand,” White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich wrote on X.

“This is deeply concerning to all of us and is being taken seriously.”

Mr Trump's eldest son Donald Trump Jr also posted: “Just James Comey casually calling for my dad to be murdered.

“This is who the Dem-Media worships. Demented!!!!”

Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said her department was investigating the post.

“Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of @POTUS,” she wrote on X.

“DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.”

Kash Patel, the FBI director, said that the bureau is “in communication with the Secret Service” over the matter and “will provide all necessary support”.

Other senior Republicans labelled the post “despicable” in the wake of previous attempts on Mr Trump's life and called on Mr Comey to explain his actions.

“This is a direct THREAT against President Trump, who has already survived two assassination attempts,” Alabama Senator Tommy Tubberville wrote on X.

“BEYOND despicable. James Comey MUST face consequences.”

Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn added: “James Comey is posting cryptic messages online alluding to getting rid of President Trump.

“Would he like to explain what he means by this given the assassination attempts on President Trump?”

Following the online backlash, Mr Comey removed the post from Instagram and released a statement saying it had “never occurred to me” that the message would be interpreted as a call for violence.

A post shared by James Comey (@comey)

Mr Trump, 78 was shot in the ear last July during a failed assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, that left one person dead and two others seriously injured.

Two months later, Secret Service agents foiled another would-be assassin who hid in the bushes with a rifle at the president's golf course in Palm Beach, Florida.

The president has a long-running feud with Mr Comey, whom he sacked as FBI director during his first term.

The former bureau chief, who now writes thrillers, was held responsible by many Democrats for helping Mr Trump win the 2016 election after he reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email affairs just 11 days before polling day.

Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream and ‘The Story' panel discuss the Supreme Court hearing on birthright citizenship and judicial power.

Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett sparred with U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer Thursday, pressing him on whether the Trump administration would follow federal court precedent. The exchange quickly became one of the day's most talked-about moments and could reignite criticism of Barrett from Trump allies.

The back-and-forth took place Thursday during oral arguments in a case related to President Donald Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship with a specific focus on whether lower courts should be able to block executive actions from taking effect nationwide. 

Justice Barrett, a Trump appointee, grilled Sauer about the administration's stance toward lower court rulings, which followed similar lines of inquiry from her colleagues on the bench. 

"I want to ask you about a potential tension," she began, before stopping to correct herself. "Well, no, not a potential tension, an actual tension that I see in answers that you gave to Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Kagan."

Barrett then asked Sauer if the Trump administration "wanted to reserve its right to maybe not follow a Second Circuit precedent, say, in New York, because you might disagree with its opinion?" 

"You resisted Justice Kagan when she asked you whether the government would obey" such a precedent, she said.

Sauer responded, "Our general practice is to respect those precedents. But there are circumstances when it is not a categorical practice, and that is not …"

Barrett interrupted, asking if that is the Trump administration's practice or "the long-standing practice of the federal government?" 

Sauer replied that it is "the long-standing policy of the Department of Justice."

"Really?" she asked. 

SUPREME COURT TAKES ON BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP: JUSTICES SEEMINGLY SPLIT ON LOWER COURT POWERS

"Yes, as it was phrased to me, we generally respect circuit precedent, but not necessarily in every case," Sauer said. "Some examples might be a situation where we are litigating to get that circuit precedent overruled and so on," he added later. 

"That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about this week," Barrett stressed, pointing to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling that Trump's birthright citizenship order is unconstitutional. 

"And what do you do the next day, or the next week?" she asked.

"Generally, we follow this," Sauer said, which provoked a somewhat incredulous response from the justice.

"So, you're still saying generally?" she asked him. "And you still think that it's generally the long-standing policy of the federal government to take that approach?"

The remarks sparked divided political reactions on social media, with Democratic strategist Max Burns noting, "Trump Solicitor General D. John Sauer tells Justice Amy Coney Barrett that Trump 'generally' tries to respect federal court decisions but he has the 'right' to disregard legal opinions he personally disagrees with. Coney Barrett seems to be in disbelief."

"John Sauer just said the quiet part out loud: unless the Supreme Court tells them directly, Trump's team might ignore lower court rulings," said Seth Taylor, a 2024 DNC delegate. "That's not governance – that's constitutional brinksmanship."

"Amy Coney Barrett (ACB) is proving once again she may the the worst SCOTUS pick ever by a Republican," conservative commentator and podcast host Cash Loren said on social media. 

"She has a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. … Yet you can hear her disdain for the Trump administration."

Earlier this year, Barrett sided with three of the Supreme Court's liberal justices and Chief Justice John Roberts in rejecting, 5-4, the Trump administration's request to block billions in USAID money for previously completed projects. 

The decision sparked fierce criticism from Trump supporters, who have attempted to label Justice Barrett an "activist" justice and someone who has been insufficiently loyal to the president who tapped her for the high court. 

Others have pointed out her track record as a reliably conservative voter and the fact the court has lifetime appointments to allow justices to ostensibly act without undue political interference. 

Trump later said he had no knowledge of the attacks against her, telling reporters, "She's a very good woman." 

"She's very smart, and I don't know about people attacking her. I really don't know." Trump added. 

The court ruling could come in a matter of days or weeks. But it will likely hinge closely on the votes of two Trump appointees, Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Barrett, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told Fox News Friday. 

Overall, he said of the hearing, "it got pretty sporty in there."

"There were some lively moments, at least lively for the Supreme Court," he said, before noting the justices to watch are Gorsuch and Barrett.

"Justice Barrett is probably the greatest concern right now for the Trump administration," Turley said.

President Donald Trump's administration must put the brakes on slashing billions in federal money for public health departments, a federal judge said Friday.

U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy in Rhode Island granted the preliminary injunction request in the lawsuit brought last month by a coalition of Democrat-led states, allowing the money to keep flowing.

“If we don't have our health, we don't have anything, and that's why today's preliminary injunction is such a critical win,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement, adding later: “A hacksaw approach to government reduction will never yield positive results for the American people, and we will continue to fight, and win, in court to minimize the harm the Trump Administration is causing the people of this country.”

The lawsuit filed April 1 by 23 states and the District of Columbia sought to immediately halt $11 billion in cuts, alleging that it would decimate public health infrastructure across the country. The money, allocated by Congress during the pandemic, supported COVID-19 initiatives and mental health and substance abuse efforts. 

The federal government argued that because the pandemic is over, the states no longer need the money. But McElroy, who granted a temporary restraining order last month in the case, wrote in her decision that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services doesn't have the power to decide that money isn't necessary anymore. 

She went on to say that the agency ignored multiple requirements that govern how block grant programs are terminated, calling the federal government's argument for how it handled the situation “puzzling.” 




McElroy wrote that the federal government's decision to rescind the money isn't just an economic loss — “ample evidence” provided by the states shows that it will decimate “key mental health, substance abuse, and other healthcare programs ... worsening public health outcomes and placing their residents at risk.” 

She pointed to several instances of what the money funded, like vaccination efforts and building up disease surveillance and labs for “future health threats,” before writing, “The Court could go on.”

The injunction only applies to the states involved in the lawsuit. The federal government must file documentation that they're complying with the order by Tuesday evening. 

“We're going to continue our lawsuit to protect the health and well-being of millions of Americans,” New York Attorney General Letitia James wrote on X shortly after the decision. 

Health departments across the country have said they've laid off employees after the Trump administration began to claw back the money in late March.

PARIS (AP) — For powerful men in France's film industry, this was a week of reckoning. Gérard Depardieu — the country's most famous male actor — was convicted of sexual assault. Two days later, the Cannes Film Festival barred another actor accused of rape from walking the red carpet.

Together, the decisions sent a message that France had long resisted: that artistic brilliance may no longer shield those who abuse their power.

For decades, Depardieu was revered as French cinema's “sacred monster” — a towering talent whose gluttony, volatility and magnetism became part of his myth. With more than 250 films to his name, many believed he would remain untouchable even after more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.

Now, that myth has cracked. 

The verdict has revived a broader question France has ducked since the dawn of the #MeToo movement: Can a country that celebrates seduction and irreverence finally hold its male icons to account?

France has long lived its own #MeToo contradiction. That talent, charm, or intellect forgives misconduct. That the art excuses the artist. This is the land that gave the world Brigitte Bardot's pout and Catherine Deneuve's poise — and then watched both recoil when the movement came knocking. Deneuve has defended “the right” to seduce, while Bardot has dismissed feminism outright: “I like men.”

But the ground is shifting.




Depardieu was handed an 18-month suspended sentence on Tuesday for groping two women on a 2021 film set. He denies the charges and is appealing.

“It's the end of impunity of artists with a capital A,” Carine Durrieu Diebolt, a lawyer for one of the two women who won their case against Depardieu, told The Associated Press. The verdict represented “a bookend for putting actors on a pedestal because they were talented,” she added.

Two days later, the prestigious Cannes Film Festival barred actor Théo Navarro-Mussy — accused of rape by three former partners — from attending the premiere of the movie “Case 137,” which he stars in, even though the file was dropped for lack of evidence. The women are launching a civil complaint.

Navarro-Mussy denies wrongdoing. His lawyer said that she's unaware of any ongoing proceedings against him.

Dominik Moll, the movie's director, said he supported the move. “It was the proper decision,” he told the AP. “Out of respect for the women, the plaintiffs.”

Yet what stunned wasn't just the decision, but who made it. Cannes director Thierry Frémaux had long been seen as emblematic of the old guard. He defended Roman Polanski for years and continued to screen his films despite the director's 1977 guilty plea in the U.S. for sex with a 13-year-old. 

In 2018, when asked why Cannes still included Polanski, Frémaux said: “These are complicated matters.”

Frémaux opened 2023's festival with a film starring Johnny Depp, despite the actor's highly public legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard over allegations of domestic abuse, in which he was never criminally charged. When asked about the backlash, Frémaux replied: “I only have one rule: it's the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.”

This week, the rules changed.

“The Cannes decision is of course linked to the Depardieu verdict,” said Céline Piques of Osez le féminisme (“Dare Feminism!”), a group that campaigns against sexual violence. “(They've) realized which way the wind is blowing. Frémaux is trying to right the wrongs.”

Not everyone welcomed the verdict — or what followed — as a cultural turning point. 

Fanny Ardant, one of French cinema's grandes dames and a longtime friend of Depardieu, sat on his side in court. She is now directing him in a film in Portugal, despite the conviction.

“Fanny Ardant? She completely missed the point,” said Piques. “She downplayed the violence, normalized it. That's rape culture, plain and simple.”

Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president and one of France's most respected actors, struck a note of restraint: “He's not a monster. He's a man — one who has, apparently, been desacralized.”

In 2024, more than 22,000 rapes were reported in France. Fewer than 3% led to convictions. “The Depardieu verdict shows there's progress,” said lawyer Anne-Sophie Laguens, who works with victims of sexual assault. “But for most women, the barriers to justice remain enormous.”

When Bertrand Cantat — front man of Noir Désir and once one of France's bestselling rock singers — launched a 2018 comeback tour, he had served just four years in prison for killing his partner, actor Marie Trintignant, during a violent assault.

Despite public outrage, he returned to the stage and performed.

“That would be unthinkable today,” said Piques. “The public mood has changed. What we tolerate has changed.”

One breakthrough came not from a film set, but a courtroom in Avignon. The conviction of 51 men for drugging and raping Gisele Pelicot — who chose to waive her anonymity and insisted on a public trial, turning private horror into public reckoning — marked a turning point. For years, shame was hers. Now, it belongs to the perpetrators.

“It proved rapists aren't just strangers in alleys,” said Piques. “They're husbands. Colleagues. Respected men.”

That shift in shame is now rippling through the cultural world — once seen as a bastion of male privilege. Director Christophe Ruggia was recently convicted of abusing actor Adèle Haenel when she was a minor, though he is appealing; and actor-director Nicolas Bedos, was sentenced for sexual assault. 

Slowly but surely, yes. The system that long protected men like Depardieu is not yet dismantled, but it is shifting.

As one of the actor's accusers said through tears after the ruling: “I'm very, very much satisfied with the decision. That's a victory for me, really. And a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.”

            President Donald Trump's agenda has been thrown into chaos after a group of GOP hardliners blocked the bill in a key committee vote on Friday – dealing a major embarrassment to House Republican leaders and Trump himself.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team will now spend the weekend trying to win over those Republicans before attempting to take that vote again, potentially as soon as Monday. But it will be a tough task to flip the right-wing Republicans, who are demanding more spending cuts from Medicaid and from federal clean energy programs, especially as Johnson must also be careful not to alienate moderates whose votes he also needs with any changes to the bill.
    


            A core of right-wing Republicans had warned Johnson and his leadership team, both privately and publicly, that they planned to oppose the vote in the House budget panel meeting on Friday. But GOP leaders took the gamble, and went ahead with the vote anyway.
    


            Five Republicans opposed the bill in the Budget Committee's meeting on Friday to stitch together the various pieces of Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts bill. The panel is not empowered to make substantial policy changes during its meeting, but the bill needs to be advanced out of the committee to make it to a full floor vote. The no votes were: Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Chip Roy of Texas, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania.
    


            Their opposition enraged many of their fellow Republicans, many of whom have spent months helping to draft the bill, which includes trillions of dollars in tax cuts and a big boost to the US military and to national security — largely paid for by overhauls to federal health and nutrition programs and cuts to energy programs.
    


            “These are people who promised their constituents not to raise their taxes. And those five no votes just voted for the biggest tax increase in American history,” GOP Rep. Tom McClintock of California, who voted to advance Trump's bill, said after it failed.
    


            Negotiations with leadership are still ongoing. The GOP hardliners have demanded stricter overhauls for Medicaid — specifically, putting work requirements into effect immediately, rather than waiting until 2029 — and deeper cuts to a clean energy tax program.
    


            But any changes to the bill could upset Johnson's fragile coalition in the House, where he can't afford any big changes that would upset the GOP's more moderate members. And Trump himself — who is closely watching any changes to Medicaid — also needs to sign off on changes.
    


            Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise will continue to work furiously to try to assuage the conservatives, efforts that included late-night negotiating on Thursday. Roy and other GOP hardliners repeatedly urged Johnson to delay the vote. They warned party leaders both privately and publicly that they planned to oppose the vote in the House budget panel meeting on Friday.
    


            But GOP leaders refused to bend to hardliners' demands to delay the vote, eager to quickly advance the bill. Johnson has said he wants to pass the bill next week on the floor, though that prospect is now uncertain.
    


            “We're working on answers. Some of them, we need to get answers from the Trump administration. But we got a pretty clear idea of what the final pieces are, and we're working through those right now,” Scalise said.
    


            Scalise said they're all in agreement about changes they want to make but said they're working through timing implementation. The work requirements for able-bodied adults enrolled in Medicaid, for instance, would not go into effect until 2029, after Trump has left office. And some of the clean energy subsidies — which were enacted under Biden — wouldn't be phased out for years after that.
    


            Scalise said Trump, who is returning from an overseas trip, has been keeping track of the bill's progress. Norman, however, said he has not heard from the president directly.
    


            Trump posted to Truth Social on Friday, “We don't need ‘GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!”
    


            “Republicans MUST UNITE behind, ‘THE ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL!,'” he said.
    


            Another one of the holdouts, ﻿Clyde, had another issue with the bill — its failure to remove gun suppressors, also known as silencers, from regulation under the National Firearms Act. It's not clear if this policy change would make it into the final bill, however. GOP leaders must follow strict budgetary rules as they draft the package because they plan to pass it without using Democratic votes — forcing the party to comply with Senate rules that allow a bill to bypass a filibuster.
    


            House budget chief, Rep. Jodey Arrington, could only afford to lose two GOP votes in the committee vote.
    


            In a sign of the gravity of the vote, GOP leaders pushed to have Rep. Brandon Gill, whose wife just had their second child, return to Washington on Friday morning for the vote.
    


            Two GOP sources previously told CNN on Thursday that Gill would not be in attendance — which would have meant House leaders could only lose a single vote.

Nick Wright says he loves the Jacksonville Jaguars trading up for Travis Hunter and believes the team will be dangerous with him on the field 

Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter made a woman's day on a United Airlines flight to the point where she said she would get her sons to buy his jersey. 

The woman called Hunter the "nicest young man," but the second overall pick of the 2025 NFL Draft tells Fox News Digital there was no act behind it. 

That's the type of person he is.

"It was just a regular interaction. It was me being me," Hunter said over the phone while describing his experience with Sandy Hawkins Combs last week. "A nice lady sat next to me, we conversed, and made sure I took care of her like I do my grandparents or any elderly person. So yeah, that's all it was."

For Combs, though, it was more than just someone being nice to her, as she wrote in a Facebook post.

"I had the most wonderful flight home from Denver," she wrote. "I met the nicest young man who sat next to me. He offered to put my bag in the overhead compartment and helped me with my tray. He was always polite, saying ‘yes ma'am' or ‘no ma'am.' Anyone would be proud to have him as a son or grandson – so polite," Combs said of Hunter.

I looked at his Jaguar pants, smiled, and asked, ‘Are you an athlete?' He smiled and said, ‘I'm Travis. Yes, I was drafted by the Jags.' I already told my sons I want his jersey."

After hearing about that last bit from Combs, Hunter called it a "blessing" that she wanted to support him after the one interaction. 

"I didn't expect nothing to go into the media, but it was just me being me," he said.

Despite it being "regular" for Hunter, the Colorado star has been dealing with spotlight for many years now. It will only continue to grow at the NFL level, especially considering his draft stock and how the Jaguars have already set the bar high for the two-way player. 

Hunter knows, though, that being humble plays a big role in his life, on and off the field. 

"Humbleness is how I got here, so that's all I know," he said. "Be humble and just put in the work. Keep my head down and grind."

ONE OF ONE

As Hunter continues to put in work, he's also excited for an important milestone in his early career – seeing himself on an NFL trading card for the first time. 

Hunter partnered with Panini America, along with several other incoming rookies, where they will receive their first Panini NFL trading cards at the NFLPA Rookie Premiere.

"Just super excited to see myself on my own card, so it's definitely a blessing," he said.

One day, Hunter's rookie card could be worth quite the pretty penny, but he understands it's up to him to make that happen. 

"I don't know," he said when asked how much he would pay for his rookie card. "I still got to put in some work."

Afghans for Trump leader Zoubair Sangi urged the president to reconsider his decision to end temporary protected status (TPS) for refugees who fled Taliban

A group that once campaigned to put Donald Trump in the White House now says they feel abandoned by his administration's decision to revoke legal protections for thousands of Afghan refugees living in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status (TPS).

Zoubair Sangi, the leader of the "Afghans for Trump" movement, formed after the chaotic 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, said his community turned to Trump after the Biden administration's exit left their homeland in turmoil. 

Now, he is urging the president to reconsider.

"The reality is that Afghanistan is not safe," Sangi told Fox News. "Over the last three years, since the return of the Taliban, the country has been as dangerous as ever."

He said the Department of Homeland Security's claim of an "improved security situation" fails to reflect the reality on the ground.

"The Taliban, at the end of the day, are a terrorist group," he said. "They target anyone who disagrees with them – anyone who worked with the U.S. government or allied forces. Their lives are in grave danger."

Sangi added that women face especially grim conditions in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, where they are banned from education and public life without a male escort.

"They view women as subservient. They treat them worse than cattle," he said. "There is no freedom for ordinary Afghans. It's a prison. People are essentially under house arrest, and they can't escape."

Despite his frustration, Sangi said he has not withdrawn his support for Trump – but he is pleading with him to rethink the decision. "We do have hope that any kind of mistake that is made specifically in regards to Afghanistan will be corrected."

He praised Trump for refusing to recognize the Taliban and ending foreign aid to Afghanistan that fell into their hands, and he urged him not to strike any deals.

"The Taliban mock America, reject your demands for the return of our $7 billion in military equipment, and harbor terrorists who threaten our homeland," said Sangi. "Engaging with them isn't America First."

On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security officially ended TPS for Afghan nationals, potentially forcing more than 9,000 individuals to return to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem cited an "improved security situation" and a stabilizing economy as justification.

"This administration is returning TPS to its original, temporary intent," Noem said. "We've reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation."

Afghans' protected status is set to expire on May 20, with the program formally ending on July 12. Noem added that terminating the designation aligns with the administration's broader goal of rooting out fraud and national security threats in the immigration system.

TPS allows foreign nationals from countries facing armed conflict, natural disasters or other emergencies to live and work legally in the U.S. Then-President Joe Biden had originally designated Afghanistan for TPS following the Taliban's takeover in 2021.

While many Afghans who assisted the U.S. military during the two-decade war arrived under the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program, others – including former Afghan government workers and those tied to U.S. missions – entered under TPS amid the post-withdrawal chaos. These individuals now face potential deportation.

Former Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mike McCaul argued against the assertion that the security situation had improved, and urged the administration against moving to revoke the immigration status of Afghans here on SIVs or P1 and P2 visas.

The Taliban, he said, "have made their thirst for retribution against those who help the United States clear. Until they demonstrate substantial behavorial changes, I urge the administration to continue prioritizing the safety of the Afghan men and women who risked their lives to help our troops."

President Donald Trump's administration must put the brakes on slashing billions in federal money for public health departments, a federal judge said Friday.

U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy in Rhode Island granted the preliminary injunction request in the lawsuit brought last by a coalition of Democrat-led states, allowing the money to keep flowing.

“If we don't have our health, we don't have anything, and that's why today's preliminary injunction is such a critical win,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement, adding later: “A hacksaw approach to government reduction will never yield positive results for the American people, and we will continue to fight, and win, in court to minimize the harm the Trump Administration is causing the people of this country.”

The lawsuit filed April 1 by 23 states and the District of Columbia sought to immediately halt $11 billion in cuts, alleging that it would decimate public health infrastructure across the country. The money, allocated by Congress during the pandemic, supported COVID-19 initiatives and mental health and substance abuse efforts. 

The federal government argued that because the pandemic is over, the states no longer need the money. But McElroy, who granted a temporary restraining order last month in the case, wrote in her decision that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services doesn't have the power to decide that money isn't necessary anymore. 

She went on to say that the agency ignored multiple requirements that govern how block grant programs are terminated, calling the federal government's argument for how it handled the situation “puzzling.” 




McElroy wrote that the federal government's decision to rescind the money isn't just an economic loss — “ample evidence” provided by the states shows that it will decimate “key mental health, substance abuse, and other healthcare programs ... worsening public health outcomes and placing their residents at risk.” 

She pointed to several instances of what the money funded, like vaccination efforts and building up disease surveillance and labs for “future health threats,” before writing, “The Court could go on.”

The injunction only applies to the states involved in the lawsuit. The federal government must file documentation that they're complying with the order by Tuesday evening. 

“We're going to continue our lawsuit to protect the health and well-being of millions of Americans,” New York Attorney General Letitia James wrote on X shortly after the decision. 

Health departments across the country have said they've laid off employees after the Trump administration began to claw back the money in late March.

Despite many headlines about their relationship, Bill Belichick has often been quiet about his girlfriend.

Belichick, 73, and Jordon Hudson, 24, became a couple last year and have been the talk of sports.

Hudson has been the topic of conversation, as reports have floated around that she forced her way into a Super Bowl commercial, shut down "Hard Knocks" at UNC, and has even been on email threads with university staff.

However, Belichick, while not diving too much into their personal relationship, said Hudson has been "very helpful" from a business standpoint.

"She's been terrific through the whole process. She's been very helpful to me. She does the business things that don't relate to North Carolina that come up in my life so I can concentrate in football, and that's what I want to do," Belichick said. "I acknowledged her in the book, she was very helpful in the tribute pages, and giving a perspective of the book from a business side. Sometimes, I get a little football technical, so she did a good job of keeping me on balance there."

Belichick stopped short of getting too "personal" about Hudson, half-heartedly shaming "Good Morning America" host Michael Strahan in asking about it, but he noted that it is a "good personal relationship."

However, when Strahan asked Belichick if he was happy, he said "yeah."

Hudson, after a fiasco with CBS, was not at the interview Friday morning. She was not at an interview with ESPN, either.

‘Fox News Live' panelists break down President Trump's visit to the Middle East and his stop at the Abrahamic Family House.

President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" failed to pass the House Budget Committee on Friday, in what appears to be a massive blow to House GOP leaders' plans to hold a House-wide vote next week.

Republican Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia and Ralph Norman of South Carolina all voted against the legislation. 

A fifth House Republican, Rep. Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania, also switched his vote from "yes" to "no," though it was a procedural maneuver that allows him to bring the legislation up again. Smucker told reporters he was "quite confident" in the bill's success.

House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, has directed the panel to reconvene on Sunday night at 10 p.m. for another vote.

The committee met to mark up and debate the bill, a massive piece of legislation that's a product of 11 different House committees' individual efforts to craft policy under their jurisdictions. The result is a wide-ranging bill that advances Trump's priorities on the border, immigration, taxes, energy, defense and raising the debt limit.

Emotions ran high in the hallway outside the House Budget Committee's meeting room from the outset, however, giving the media little indication of how events would transpire.

Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, who had been at home with his wife and newborn baby, surprised reporters when he arrived at the Cannon House Office Building after he was initially expected to miss the committee meeting.

His appearance gave House GOP leaders some added wiggle room, allowing the committee to lose two Republican votes and still pass the bill, rather than just one.

But at least four House Republicans went into the meeting warning they were opposed to the bill.

Shortly before the meeting was expected to begin, Roy, Norman, Clyde and Brecheen abruptly left the room while saying little to reporters on the way out.

Each came back a short while later and criticized the legislation in their opening remarks.

The fiscal hawks are frustrated about provisions curbing Medicaid in the bill not going into effect until 2029, and had similar issues with the delay in phasing out green energy subsidies from former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

"Only in Washington are we expected to bet on the come that in five years, then everything will work. Then we will solve the problem," Roy said during debate. "We have got to change the direction of this town. And to my colleagues and other side of the aisle, yes, that means touching Medicaid.

At one point, Norman came out of the room and called for the committee to recess in order to work through the fiscal hawks' concerns.

"If they call for a vote now, it's not going to end well," he said, adding he was still waiting on commitments from House GOP leaders.

Minutes later, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., who is not a member of the committee but had been meeting with holdouts, told reporters he wanted the legislation to advance through the Budget panel "as soon as possible."

When asked about Norman's comments, he said, "I just walked out of the meeting with him a few minutes ago as well. We're working on some questions that Ralph and others have, and we're going to be getting them answers as soon as we get them back from the Trump administration."

Roy said on X after the vote, "We were making progress, but the vote was called, and the problems were not resolved, so I voted no. I am staying in Washington this weekend to deliver."

"Medicaid Work requirements must start NOW not 2029 & the Green New Scam must be fully repealed, as President Trump called for," Roy wrote on X.

Earlier, Trump took to Truth Social where he suggested those opposing the bill were "grandstanders" and he pressed Republicans to unite behind it.

His message appeared to have little effect on the rebels, however — though it's notable Trump is not in Washington, and is currently en route back from a diplomatic trip to the Middle East.

House Republicans are working to pass Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party controlling the House, White House, and Senate to pass broad pieces of legislation while completely sidelining the minority party.

It does so by lowering the Senate's threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51, provided the legislation deals with spending, taxes or the national debt.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he wants the legislation to pass the House by Memorial Day, with a goal of syncing up with the Senate and getting a bill to Trump's desk by the Fourth of July.

That's still possible if Republicans on the House Budget Committee strike an agreement to advance the legislation on Monday.

Afterwards, it would head to the House Rules Committee for any potential changes, before a House-wide vote sometime later in the week.

But Republican senators have already indicated they want to see some changes to the bill, meaning the House will need to hash out their differences with their counterparts in the upper chamber before the legislation is finished.

The House Freedom Caucus, which the bill's four Budget Committee opponents belong to, has said its members would stay in Washington through the weekend to continue working.

"We are continuing to negotiate. We are not leaving right now. We have been making progress and are continuing to work on the legislation," a Freedom Caucus spokeswoman told Fox News Digital.

Dozens of immigrants who illegally crossed into the U.S. via a newly established military-controlled zone along the U.S.-Mexico border have had their trespassing charges dismissed. 

Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Gregory Wormuth began filing the dismissals late on Wednesday, ruling the immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone – known as the New Mexico National Defense Area (NMNDA) – and therefore could not be charged, according to court documents.

Wormuth ruled that the federal government failed to demonstrate probable cause that the immigrants knew they were entering the zone.

The government had argued in a criminal complaint that the military had posted signs in the zones stating in both English and Spanish that it was a restricted area and that unauthorized entry is prohibited.

Despite signs indicating restricted access, the judge noted that the challenging terrain made it unlikely that the defendants saw the warnings.

The decision marks a setback for the Trump administration's border crackdown as the trespassing charges were central to enforcing the NMNDA.

The NMNDA was established in April and spans approximately 180 miles along the southern New Mexico border. U.S. Army personnel now patrol the area and are authorized to detain unauthorized entrants.

"Beyond the reference to signage, the United States provides no facts from which one could reasonably conclude that the Defendant knew he was entering the NMNDA (New Mexico National Defense Area)," wrote Wormuth in a 16-page ruling. Wormuth has served as a U.S. magistrate judge since 2009. Magistrate judges are appointed by district court judges and not by the president.

The judge dismissed two charges faced by the 98 arrested immigrants: violation of a security regulation and entering military property for an unlawful purpose, both misdemeanors. A third misdemeanor charge of entering the U.S. illegally remains.

Up to May 9, Ellison's office reported charging 339 migrants for entering the New Mexico military area.

TRUMP ORDERS MILITARY TO TAKE CONTROL OF FEDERAL LAND AT SOUTHERN BORDER

Last month, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum visited New Mexico to announce that the Army was taking control of the federal land as part of the Trump administration's efforts to curb illegal immigration and trafficking.

The 109,651 acres of federal land was transferred to the Army for three years, subject to valid existing rights.

The switch in jurisdiction allows the government to protect sensitive natural and cultural resources in the region, while helping the Army support U.S. Border Patrol operations in securing the border and preventing illegal immigration, according to the Department of the Interior.

In March, the Defense Department authorized the military to patrol the southern border to provide "enhanced detection and monitoring" to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Fox News Digital emailed and called a Department of Justice attorney involved in the case for comment.

FBI Director Kash Patel said in an interview published Friday that the bureau will leave the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington and send 1,500 agents into the field.

Patel confirmed the plans in an interview set to air on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures this weekend. He said he will give each state a “plus-up” as the FBI disperses agents away from Washington.

“In the National Capital Region, in the 50-mile radius around Washington, D.C., there were 11,000 FBI employees. That's like a third of the workforce. A third of the crime doesn't happen here,” Patel said. “So we're taking 1,500 of those folks and moving them out. Every state's getting a plus-up.”

Patel also said the FBI will leave the J. Edgar Hoover Building, calling it “unsafe for our workforce.”

“We want the American men and women to know if you're going to come work at the premier law enforcement agency in the world, we're going to give you a building that's commensurate with that, and that's not this place,” Patel said.

Patel said moving agents out of Washington and the J. Edgar Hoover Building is part of his push to return the FBI to its core mission of fighting crime.

“I think when we do things like that, we inspire folks in America to become intel analysts and agents and say, ‘We want to work at the FBI because we want to fight violent crime and we want to be sent out into the country to do it,'” Patel said, adding that the agents will go into the field in the next “three, six, nine months.”

PATEL AT ODDS WITH WHITE HOUSE OVER FBI BUDGET CUT PROPOSAL

Patel discussed ditching the J. Edgar Hoover Building and making it into a museum of the “deep state” in comments made prior to the 2024 election. He walked back those comments during his confirmation hearing, but he now appears to be making good on the pledge to leave the FBI building in downtown Washington.

The FBI had selected Greenbelt, Maryland, to house its new headquarters in a plan unveiled in 2023 under the Biden administration. President Donald Trump said in March that he is planning to stop the FBI's move to Greenbelt and instead propose building a new facility in Washington.

Fredericksburg, Va. has strong ties to the military and resettled Afghans. But Trump administration's suspension of the federal refugee program has created unease for many Afghans who immigrated during wartime and the faith-based allies who helped them.

FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) — Kat Renfroe was at Mass when she saw a volunteer opportunity in the bulletin. Her Catholic parish was looking for tutors for Afghan youth, newly arrived in the United States.

There was a personal connection for Renfroe. Her husband, now retired from the Marine Corps, had deployed to Afghanistan four times. “He just never talked about any other region the way he did about the people there,” she said.

She signed up to volunteer. “It changed my life,” she said.

That was seven years ago. She and her husband are still close to the young man she tutored, along with his family. And Renfroe has made a career of working with refugees. She now supervises the Fredericksburg migration and refugee services office, part of Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Arlington. 

That faith-based work is now in peril. As part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, his administration banned most incoming refugees in January and froze federal funds for the programs. Across the country, local resettlement agencies like hers have been forced to lay off staff or close their doors. Refugees and other legal migrants have been left in limbo, including Afghans who supported the U.S. in their native country.

The upheaval is particularly poignant in this part of Virginia, which boasts both strong ties to the military and to resettled Afghans, along with faith communities that support both groups.

Situated south of Washington, D.C., and wedged among military bases, Fredericksburg and its surrounding counties are home to tens of thousands of veterans and active-duty personnel.




Virginia has resettled more Afghan refugees per capita than any other state. The Fredericksburg area now has halal markets, Afghan restaurants and school outreach programs for families who speak Dari and Pashto.

Many of these U.S.-based Afghans are still waiting for family members to join them — hopes that appear on indefinite hold. Families fear a new travel ban will emerge with Afghanistan on the list. A subset of Afghans already in the U.S. may soon face deportation as the Trump administration ends their temporary protected status.

“I think it's tough for military families, especially those who have served, to look back on 20 years and not feel as though there's some confusion and maybe even some anger about the situation,” Renfroe said.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops announced in April that it was ending its decades-old partnership with the federal government to resettle refugees. The move came after the Trump administration halted the program's federal funding, which the bishops' conference channels to local Catholic Charities. 

The Fredericksburg Catholic Charities office has continued aiding current clients and operating with minimal layoffs thanks to its diocese's support and state funds. But it's unclear what the local agency's future will be without federal funding or arriving refugees.

“I'll just keep praying,” Renfroe said. “It's all I can do from my end.”

Religious groups have long been at the heart of U.S. refugee resettlement work. Until the recent policy changes, seven out of the 10 national organizations that partnered with the U.S. government to resettle refugees were faith-based. They were aided by hundreds of local affiliates and religious congregations.

Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Arlington has been working with refugees for 50 years, starting with Vietnamese people after the fall of Saigon. For the last 10 years, most of its clients have been Afghans, with an influx arriving in 2021 after the Taliban returned to power.

Area faith groups like Renfroe's large church — St. Mary's in Fredericksburg — have been key to helping Afghan newcomers get on their feet. Volunteers from local congregations furnish homes, provide meals and drive families to appointments. 

“As a church, we care deeply. As Christians, we care deeply,” said Joi Rogers, who led the Afghan ministry at her Southern Baptist church. “As military, we also just have an obligation to them as people that committed to helping the U.S. in our mission over there.”

Rogers' husband Jake, a former Marine, is one of the pastors at Pillar, a network of 16 Southern Baptist churches that minister to military members. Their flagship location is near Quantico, the Marine base in northern Virginia, where nearly 5,000 Afghans were evacuated to after the fall of Kabul.

With Southern Baptist relief funds, Pillar Church hired Joi Rogers to work part time as a volunteer coordinator in the base's makeshift refugee camp in 2021. She helped organize programming, including children's activities. Her position was under the auspices of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which the government contracted to help run the camp.

For Pillar's founding pastor, Colby Garman, the effort was an easy decision. “It was affecting so many of the lives of our families here who had served in Afghanistan.”

“We've been told to love God and love our neighbor,” Garman said. “I said to our people, this is an opportunity, a unique opportunity, for us to demonstrate love for our neighbor.”

Within five months, as the Afghans left the base for locations around the country, the support at the camp transitioned to the broader community. Pillar started hosting an English class. Church members visited locally resettled families and tried to keep track of their needs.

For one Pillar Church couple in nearby Stafford, Virginia, that meant opening their home to a teenager who had arrived alone in the U.S. after being separated from her family at the Kabul airport — a situation they heard about through the church.

Katlyn Williams and her husband Phil Williams, then an active-duty Marine, served as foster parents for Mahsa Zarabi, now 20, during her junior and senior years of high school. They introduced her to many American firsts: the beach, homecoming, learning to drive. 

“The community was great,” Zarabi said. “They welcomed me very well.”

She attends college nearby; the Williamses visit her monthly. During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan this spring, they broke fast with her and her family, now safely in Virginia.

“She has and will always be part of our family,” Katlyn Williams said.

Her friend Joi Rogers, while careful not to speak for Pillar, said watching the recent dismantling of the federal refugee program has “been very hard for me personally.”

Veterans and members of the military tend to vote Republican. Most Southern Baptists are among Trump's staunch white evangelical supporters. For those reasons, Pillar pastor Garman knows it may be surprising to some that his church network has been steadfast in supporting refugees.

“I totally understand that is the case, but I think that is a bias of just not knowing who we are and what we do,” Garman said after a recent Sunday service.

Later, sitting in the church office with his wife, Jake Rogers said, “We recognize that there are really faithful Christians that could lie on either side of the issue of refugee policy.” 

“Regardless of your view on what our national stance should be on this,” he said, “we as Christ followers should have a heart for these people that reflects God's heart for these people.”

Later that week, nearly two dozen Afghan women gathered around a table at the Fredericksburg refugee office, while children played with toys in the corner. The class topic was self-care, led by an Afghan staff member. Along the back wall waited dishes of rice and chicken, part of a celebratory potluck to mark the end of Ramadan.

Sitting at the front was Suraya Qaderi, the last client to arrive at the resettlement agency before the U.S. government suspended new arrivals.

She was in Qatar waiting to be cleared for a flight to the United States when the Trump administration started canceling approved travel plans for refugees. “I was one of the lucky last few,” said Qaderi, who was allowed to proceed.

She arrived in Virginia on Jan. 24, the day the administration sent stop-work orders to resettlement agencies.

Qaderi worked for the election commission in Afghanistan, and she received a special immigrant visa for her close ties to the U.S. government. She was a child when her father disappeared under the previous Taliban regime.

The return of the Taliban government was like “the end of the world,” she said. As a woman, she lost many of her rights, including her ability to work and leave home unaccompanied.

She studied Islamic law during her university years. She believes the Taliban's interpretation of Islam is wrong on the rights of women. “Islam is not only for them,” she said.

The resettlement office includes not only Catholic staffers, but many Muslim employees and clients. “We find so much commonality between our faiths,” Renfroe said.

Her Catholic faith guides her work, and it's sustaining her through the uncertainty of what the funding and policy changes will mean for her organization, which remains committed to helping refugees.

“I'm happy to go back to being a volunteer again if that's what it takes,” Renfroe said.

Regardless of government contracts, she wants local refugee families to know that “that we're still here, that we care about them and that we want to make sure that they have what they need.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Between collections resuming, courts blocking student loan programs and layoffs at the Education Department, borrowers might be confused about the status of their student loans. 

Recently, the Education Department announced it would start involuntary collections on defaulted loans, meaning the roughly 5.3 million borrowers who are in default could have their wages garnished by the federal government.

At the center of the turmoil are the government's income-driven repayment plans, which reduce monthly payments for borrowers with lower incomes. Those plans were temporarily paused after a federal court blocked parts of the plans in February. 

“There's so much confusion, they've made it very complicated,” said Natalia Abrams, president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center. 

At the same time, some borrowers are struggling to get their loan servicers on the phone, making it hard to find answers to their questions, said Abrams.

If you're a student loan borrower, here are some answers to your questions. 

Applications for income-driven repayment plans are open, but they're taking longer than usual to process.

The applications were temporarily shut down earlier this year after a federal court in Missouri blocked the SAVE plan, a Biden administration plan that offered a faster path to loan forgiveness. The judge's order also blocked parts of other repayment plans, prompting the Education Department to pause income-driven applications entirely.




Amid pressure from advocates, the department reopened the applications on May 10. 

Borrowers can apply for the following income-driven plans: the Income-Based Repayment Plan, the Pay as You Earn plan and the Income-Contingent Repayment plan. 

Abrams expects applications will continue to be approved but at a slower pace than before the application pause.

Borrowers currently enrolled in an income-driven plan should be receiving notifications about recertification, said Khandice Lofton, counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Recertification is required annually to update information on family size and income, and dates are different for each borrower.

To review income-driven repayment plans, you can check the loan simulator at studentaid.gov.

Borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan have been placed in administrative forbearance while a legal challenge is resolved. That means they don't have to make payments and interest is not accruing. Time in forbearance normally does not count toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness. 

The Education Department will notify borrowers with updates on payments and litigation.

“We don't know for sure when the SAVE forbearance is going to end,” Abrams said.

While the future of the SAVE plan is decided in court, Abrams encourages borrowers to explore their eligibility for other income-driven repayment plans.

The online application for loan consolidation is available again, at studentaid.gov/loan-consolidation. If you have multiple federal student loans, you can combine them into one with a fixed interest rate and a single monthly payment.

The consolidation process typically takes around 60 days to complete. You can only consolidate your loans once.

It would be difficult for the Education Department to reinstate loans that were canceled during President Joe Biden's administration. So far, it isn't believed to be happening, Abrams said.

Nothing has changed yet. 

President Donald Trump wants to change the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to disqualify workers of nonprofit groups deemed to have engaged in “improper” activities. He signed an executive order to that effect, but it has yet to be enforced.

Borrowers enrolled in PSLF should keep up with payments to make progress toward loan forgiveness, said Sarah Austin, policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.

“There could be some changes coming in regards to PSLF but at this current time PSLF is still functioning and there is still loan forgiveness being processed under the PSLF provision,” said Austin. 

An income-driven repayment tracker has disappeared from the federal student loan website for many borrowers, said Abrams. For keeping track of their status, Abrams is recommending that borrowers take screenshots of their payments. 

Contacting your loan servicer is crucial to managing and understanding your student loans. Due to the large number of people trying to get answers or apply for programs, loan servicers are taking longer than usual to respond.

Abrams recommends borrowers prepare for long wait times. 

“We've heard borrowers being in hold for three or four hours, then being transferred to a supervisor and then being hung up on, after all that wait time. It's incredibly frustrating,” Abrams said. 

If you're delinquent, try to get back on track. Borrowers who don't make their payments for 270 days go into default, which has severe consequences. 

“If you're delinquent but have not defaulted yet, do whatever you can do to avoid going default,” said Kate Wood, a student loans expert at NerdWallet.

Borrowers who are delinquent on their student loans take a massive hit on their credit scores, which could drop 100 points or more, Wood said. A delinquency stays on your credit report for seven years.

Wood recommends contacting your servicer to ask for options, which can include forbearance, deferment or applying for an income-driven repayment plan. 

The Education Department is recommending borrowers visit its Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation.

Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute for Student Loan Advisors, recommends loan rehabilitation.

Borrowers in default must ask their loan servicer to be placed into such a program. Typically, servicers ask for proof of income and expenses to calculate a payment amount. Once a borrower has paid on time for nine months in a row, they are taken out of default, Mayotte said. A loan rehabilitation can only be done once.

The Fresh Start program was a one-time temporary program that helped borrowers get out of default. This program ended Aug. 31, 2024.

President Donald Trump condemned former FBI Director James Comey for a controversial social media post, arguing that Comey was calling for his assassination.

In a Friday interview with Fox News, Trump dismissed Comey's apology and claim that he didn't know what seashells organized to read “8647” meant. He argued that Comey was openly calling for his assassination.

“He knew exactly what that meant. A child knows what that meant. If you're the FBI director and you don't know what that meant, that meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear,” Trump said.

“Now, he wasn't very competent, but he was competent enough to know what that meant. And he did it for a reason, and he was hit so hard because people like me, they like what's happening with our country. Our country has become respected again, and all this, and he's calling for the assassination of the president,” he added.

Interviewer Brett Baier interjected to say Comey apologized and said it wasn't a call to violence. Trump dismissed the apology and explanation, and said it was up to Attorney General Pam Bondi whether or not to punish him.

“I don't want to take a position on it, because that's going to be up to Pam and all of the great people, but I will say this, I think it's a terrible thing,” Trump said. “And when you add his history to that, if he had a clean history, he doesn't. He's a dirty cop. He's a dirty cop. And if he had a clean history, I could understand if there was leniency. But I'm going to let them make that decision.”

Comey posted and deleted a picture of shells lined up on a beach to depict the numbers “8647” on Thursday, an ambiguous message interpreted by defenders as a call for Trump to be removed from office and by critics as a call for Trump to be assassinated. Comey later said he did not mean for the post to provoke violence.

COMEY'S ‘8647' MESSAGE ‘CONCERNS' WHITE HOUSE AND PROMPTS DHS INVESTIGATION

The Department of Homeland Security is investigating the alleged threat, and the Secret Service said it is aware of the posts and will “vigorously investigate anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees.”

The FBI said it will provide “necessary support.”

AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — When Haitham Abu Daqa's 5-month-old daughter developed a heart problem that could not be addressed near their home in Gaza, the family sought medical help in Jordan, where she underwent successful open-heart surgery.

After the surgery, Daqa's wife, who was with their daughter, pleaded with Jordanian officials to be allowed to stay. She feared that little Nevine's recovery would be at risk in the war-ravaged Palestinian enclave that has few functioning medical facilities. But the officials insisted that the family had to go home.

“How can I take care of the girl while I am living in a tent, and at the same time, the bombing doesn't stop,” Daqa said, sobbing. “How dare they send her back? If there is treatment in Gaza for her case, why did they take her in the first place?”

Daqa's daughter was among 17 Palestinian children who were recently returned to Gaza with their caregivers after receiving medical treatment in Jordan. Rights groups warn that forcing the children to go back to a war zone is a possible violation of international law. It also raises doubts about whether the young patients can regain their health in a place where medical care is scarce and military strikes are an everyday threat.

The children are trapped between Israel intensifying its military operation in Gaza as it threatens to seize the territory and a proposal to permanently resettle much of the population — which experts say could also be a legal violation — and the refusal of Arab countries to take part in any such plan, which they view as forcible expulsion that could create another refugee crisis.

Arab nations have long been reluctant to take in Palestinians, or give them permanent status, out of fear that the refugees might never be allowed to return and that permanent resettlement would undermine the prospects for the creation of a Palestinian state.




Jordan, which is already home to a large Palestinian population, has been hesitant to accept more due to its own demographic balance, weak economy and high unemployment.

For Daqa's family, the dangers of the Israel-Hamas war returned almost immediately. As his wife crossed into Gaza on Tuesday, their bus was rerouted because an Israeli airstrike hit the hospital that was their destination, he said.

The couple's child was in excellent health when she was discharged more than a month ago from the Specialty Hospital in the Jordanian capital of Amman, said Dr. Reyad Al-Sharqawi, the hospital's assistant director general.

Three other children from Gaza were also treated and discharged, he said. The hospital covered the families' rent and other expenses until they left Tuesday, Al-Sharqawi said.

More than two dozen children and their caregivers were evacuated from Gaza in March as part of a Jordanian initiative to provide urgent medical care to 2,000 children. The 17 patients who completed their treatment were returned to Gaza.

Jordan's King Abdullah II, a close U.S. ally, announced the initiative during a meeting with President Donald Trump in February aimed at heading off the American leader's proposal for Gaza to be depopulated and redeveloped as a tourism destination. The Israeli government has embraced Trump's plan.

A Jordanian official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation acknowledged that some Palestinians asked to stay beyond the treatment, but he said the plan was always to return them.

“We are not going to allow the displacement of Palestinians outside Gaza,” he said.

Jordan's government said the children who left made room for others to come. On Wednesday, four cancer patients arrived from Gaza to start care.

Forcing people to return to a place where they could face serious harm would be a violation of international human rights law, according to rights groups. Under the law, all returns must be safe and voluntary, and the evacuating country should ensure that adequate services are available in their place of origin.

The war has gutted Gaza's health system. Israel has blocked all imports, including food, fuel and medicine, for more than two months. Hospitals are running out of supplies, and experts have warned that the territory will likely fall into famine unless Israel lifts the blockade and ends its military campaign. Israel says the blockade aims to pressure Hamas to release the 58 hostages it still holds.

Human rights experts said Jordanian officials were in a tough position, not wanting to be complicit in what many see as the expulsion of Palestinians while providing aid to those in need. Still, the law comes down to the rights of wounded children, said professor Omer Shatz, a human rights lawyer and lecturer at SciencesPo University in Paris.

“There is an absolute prohibition on returning them to a place where they will be exposed to cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment, let alone a risk to their life,” Shatz said.

Like refugees in other contexts, Palestinians should have the freedom to choose whether to return to their country, said Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. Countries that take in Palestinians from Gaza should seek assurances that they will be allowed to return if and when they choose, he said.

For now, Israel is allowing Palestinians to return to Gaza after medical treatment. But the Palestinians fear that if the larger resettlement policy is enacted, they will be permanently exiled from their homeland, as hundreds of thousands were after the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. Those refugees and their descendants now number some 6 million, concentrated in built-up camps across the region.

Two families who returned to Gaza said the road home included many checkpoints, and Israeli soldiers took their phones and money upon entering. 

Israel's defense ministry said that during security checks of residents returning from Jordan to Gaza, some people were found carrying undeclared cash amounts exceeding “normal limits” and was suspected of being “intended for terrorist use” in Gaza. It said the money was being held while the circumstances were investigated.

It was unclear whether any aid organizations helped facilitate the children's return.

In March, the World Health Organization worked with the Jordanians to evacuate the sick children from Gaza, according to Jordan's government. The WHO did not respond to requests for comment on whether they were involved in the transfer back to Gaza.

For some families there were no good options.

Arafat Yousef's 12-year-old son, who lost a leg to an Israeli airstrike, waited eight months to get a prosthetic limb in Jordan.

Yousef wants to stay in Jordan so his son can get the necessary follow-up care, but he also feels drawn back to Gaza to take care of his six other children.

“I wanted my son to complete his treatment,” Yousef said. “But at the same time, I wanted to return to my land. I don't want to leave my children alone amid this bombing.”

The Turkish Foreign Ministry confirmed that peace talks between Ukraine and Russia ended after just under two hours. 

Pope Leo offered to act as a mediator between Ukraine and Russia to arrange for peace in Ukraine, according to Italian media outlet RAI.

Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin said on Friday that Leo could be made available for a meeting between the two countries so they could “at least talk.”

“The Holy See is always ready to help bring enemies together, face-to-face, to talk to one another, so that peoples everywhere may once more find hope and recover the dignity they deserve, the dignity of peace,” Leo said Friday.

Parolin added that the Holy See could be a “very suitable place.”

After the talks in Istanbul on Friday, the two nations agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, according to Russian Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky.

This exchange would be the largest between Russia and Ukraine since 2022.

Medinsky also said Moscow and Kyiv agreed to send each other detailed proposals for a ceasefire deal.

The meeting was the first time representatives from the two countries had met since 2022, just after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. 

There were delegations from Russia and Ukraine, but neither country's leaders attended. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov met with Medinsky. President Donald Trump considered attending the talks during his trip to the Middle East this week, but ultimately decided not to.

At the beginning of the meeting, Turkish Foreign Affairs Minister Hakan Fidan described the negotiations as “technical talks” that will lay the groundwork for a possible meeting between the two countries' leaders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Putin called for direct talks after he rejected Ukraine's call for a 30-day ceasefire. Zelensky quickly said he was ready to meet, saying he would not meet any Russian official except Putin. In this meeting, Ukraine requested a meeting between heads of state. Russia said it would consider that, with Medinsky adding that Russia is ready to continue talks.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Istanbul on Friday after attending a NATO meeting in another Turkish city.

PARIS (AP) — For powerful men in France's film industry, this was a week of reckoning. Gérard Depardieu — the country's most famous male actor — was convicted of sexual assault. Two days later, the Cannes Film Festival barred another actor accused of rape from walking the red carpet.

Together, the decisions sent a message that France had long resisted: that artistic brilliance may no longer shield those who abuse their power.

For decades, Depardieu was revered as French cinema's “sacred monster” — a towering talent whose gluttony, volatility and magnetism became part of his myth. With more than 250 films to his name, many believed he would remain untouchable even after more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.

Now, that myth has cracked. 

The verdict has revived a broader question France has ducked since the dawn of the #MeToo movement: Can a country that celebrates seduction and irreverence finally hold its male icons to account?

France has long lived its own #MeToo contradiction. That talent, charm, or intellect forgives misconduct. That the art excuses the artist. This is the land that gave the world Brigitte Bardot's pout and Catherine Deneuve's poise — and then watched both recoil when the movement came knocking. Deneuve has defended “the right” to seduce, while Bardot has dismissed feminism outright: “I like men.”

But the ground is shifting.




Depardieu was handed an 18-month suspended sentence on Tuesday for groping two women on a 2021 film set. He denies the charges and is appealing.

“It's the end of impunity of artists with a capital A,” Carine Durrieu Diebolt, a lawyer for one of the two women who won their case against Depardieu, told The Associated Press. The verdict represented “a bookend for putting actors on a pedestal because they were talented,” she added.

Two days later, the prestigious Cannes Film Festival barred actor Théo Navarro-Mussy — accused of rape by three former partners — from attending the premiere of the movie “Case 137,” which he stars in, even though the file was dropped for lack of evidence. The women are launching a civil complaint.

Navarro-Mussy denies wrongdoing. His lawyer said that she's unaware of any ongoing proceedings against him.

Dominik Moll, the movie's director, said he supported the move. “It was the proper decision,” he told the AP. “Out of respect for the women, the plaintiffs.”

Yet what stunned wasn't just the decision, but who made it. Cannes director Thierry Frémaux had long been seen as emblematic of the old guard. He defended Roman Polanski for years and continued to screen his films despite the director's 1977 guilty plea in the U.S. for sex with a 13-year-old. 

In 2018, when asked why Cannes still included Polanski, Frémaux said: “These are complicated matters.”

Frémaux opened 2023's festival with a film starring Johnny Depp, despite the actor's highly public legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard over allegations of domestic abuse, in which he was never criminally charged. When asked about the backlash, Frémaux replied: “I only have one rule: it's the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.”

This week, the rules changed.

“The Cannes decision is of course linked to the Depardieu verdict,” said Céline Piques of Osez le féminisme (“Dare Feminism!”), a group that campaigns against sexual violence. “(They've) realized which way the wind is blowing. Frémaux is trying to right the wrongs.”

Not everyone welcomed the verdict — or what followed — as a cultural turning point. 

Fanny Ardant, one of French cinema's grandes dames and a longtime friend of Depardieu, sat on his side in court. She is now directing him in a film in Portugal, despite the conviction.

“Fanny Ardant? She completely missed the point,” said Piques. “She downplayed the violence, normalized it. That's rape culture, plain and simple.”

Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president and one of France's most respected actors, struck a note of restraint: “He's not a monster. He's a man — one who has, apparently, been desacralized.”

In 2024, more than 22,000 rapes were reported in France. Fewer than 3% led to convictions. “The Depardieu verdict shows there's progress,” said lawyer Anne-Sophie Laguens, who works with victims of sexual assault. “But for most women, the barriers to justice remain enormous.”

When Bertrand Cantat — front man of Noir Désir and once one of France's bestselling rock singers — launched a 2018 comeback tour, he had served just four years in prison for killing his partner, actor Marie Trintignant, during a violent assault.

Despite public outrage, he returned to the stage and performed.

“That would be unthinkable today,” said Piques. “The public mood has changed. What we tolerate has changed.”

One breakthrough came not from a film set, but a courtroom in Avignon. The conviction of 51 men for drugging and raping Gisele Pelicot — who chose to waive her anonymity and insisted on a public trial, turning private horror into public reckoning — marked a turning point. For years, shame was hers. Now, it belongs to the perpetrators.

“It proved rapists aren't just strangers in alleys,” said Piques. “They're husbands. Colleagues. Respected men.”

That shift in shame is now rippling through the cultural world — once seen as a bastion of male privilege. Director Christophe Ruggia was recently convicted of abusing actor Adèle Haenel when she was a minor, though he is appealing; and actor-director Nicolas Bedos, was sentenced for sexual assault. 

Slowly but surely, yes. The system that long protected men like Depardieu is not yet dismantled, but it is shifting.

As one of the actor's accusers said through tears after the ruling: “I'm very, very much satisfied with the decision. That's a victory for me, really. And a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.”

‘The Five' co-hosts discuss the Democratic Party's stance on immigration.

FIRST ON FOX: Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger is facing pushback from both her opponent and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after condemning the "shocking" execution of an ICE raid at a Virginia courthouse earlier this month that netted two criminal illegal immigrants. 

"I think what we've seen most shocking, including here in Charlottesville, has been cases where people haven't provided identification and have been in some cases masked and in plain clothes," Spanberger, a former Democratic congresswoman and former intelligence officer, told the Daily Progress last month after an ICE raid at Albemarle County Courthouse led to the arrest of two illegal immigrants. 

"I'm a former federal agent, and I used to work narcotics cases and money laundering cases," she said. "I have been on so many arrest warrants and search warrants at the crack of dawn and at all hours of the day, and identifying yourself, demonstrating who you are, making clear to a community member — even someone you are about to put handcuffs on, even when you enter a home, in a stack, lined up, guns drawn, yelling, ‘Police!' — you show your badge, you show your credentials, you show your warrant."

The raid that Spanberger took issue with resulted in the arrest of two illegal immigrants who DHS told Fox News Digital had criminal records.

Teodoro Dominguez-Rodriguez, a Honduran national, was described by DHS as a "violent illegal alien" with "multiple arrests for assault and battery as well as an outstanding order of protection against him."

Pablo Aparicio Marcelino, a Mexican national, was also described by DHS as a "criminal illegal alien" with "multiple arrests for failing to stop at the scene of an accident, driving without a license, and driving under the influence."

Spanberger's questions about the process of arresting the two foreign nationals drew pushback from her opponent in the race for governor, Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. 

"Abigail Spanberger's outrage over criminal illegal immigrants being taken off our streets is everything Virginians need to know about what kind of governor she'd be — criminals first, victims last," Earle-Sears press secretary Peyton Vogel told Fox News Digital.

"She created this mess when she voted in Washington to keep criminal migrants here, and now she wants to stand in the way of cleaning it up." 

A Spanberger spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the Virginia Democrat supports arresting criminal illegal immigrants but believes the ICE agents acted improperly.

"Abigail believes that violent criminals who are in the United States illegally should not be allowed to stay and that immigration enforcement should be focused on removing these individuals," the spokesperson said. "As a former federal law enforcement officer who worked narcotics cases, Abigail executed warrants and arrested criminals. And as Abigail made clear to the Daily Progress, she made these arrests in uniform, displaying her badge and arrest warrant to those taken into custody."

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin defended raids at courthouses, saying it is "common sense."

"It conserves valuable law enforcement resources because they already know where a target will be. It is also safer for our officers and the community. These illegal aliens have gone through security and been screened to not have any weapons. Secretary Noem is empowering law enforcement to use common sense to remove criminal illegal aliens from American communities."

McLaughlin also pushed back on Spanberger's suggestion that the ICE agents did not properly identify themselves.

"When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as police while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers," McLaughlin said. 

"It is interesting that the media who are so concerned with our law enforcement officers wearing masks to protect themselves don't say a word about the terrorist sympathizers on U.S. college campuses who cowardly wear masks as they do the bidding of terrorist organizations that relish the killing of Americans and Jews."

Earle-Sears, endorsed by the term-limited Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, will square off against Spanberger this November to determine the next governor of the commonwealth.

Immigration has been a prominent topic in the race, including in the first ad that the lieutenant governor dropped, which criticized Spanberger over her past opposition to a border wall.

A Spanberger spokesperson at the time called the ad a "distraction attempt," adding that Spanberger "led bipartisan bills that were signed into law by both President Trump and President Biden to disrupt fentanyl trafficking at our ports of entry, combat Mexican cartels and secure our borders."

Why are we mad at the football coach's girlfriend?

by  Constance Grady

When we look at the relationship between 73-year-old legendary football coach Bill Belichick and his girlfriend and business partner, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson, it's hard to know exactly what we're seeing. Two grown-ups in love forging a dynamic business partnership? Elder abuse, as some have wildly speculated? Or is it, as the vitriolic comments in Hudson's social media posts would have it, good old-fashioned gold digging? 

Gold digging is a misogynistic and retro term, but this scandal is a retro one. It's a bizarre, slightly off-putting mystery that fits remarkably well into our current age of newly regressive gender politics.

Hudson and Belichick, the six-time Super Bowl-winning former NFL coach, met on a flight in 2021 and went public with their relationship last December. While their nearly 50-year age gap has raised eyebrows amid observers, the scandal has only grown as Hudson has taken on an increasingly central role in Belichick's professional world. 

It's a bizarre, slightly off-putting mystery that fits remarkably well into our current age of newly regressive gender politics.

Belichick requested Hudson be cc'ed on all publicity and media emails about him at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he is now a college football coach. In public records, she's listed as the manager of several companies that appear to be tied to Belichick. Insider accounts say she essentially cast herself in a Dunkin Donuts commercial in which Belichick appeared, and that she blocked a docuseries about Belichick's career. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

But speculation around the relationship reached a fever pitch when Hudson interrupted during Belichick's interview on CBS Sunday Morning in April. “How did you guys meet?” host Tony Dokoupil asked Belichick, referring to Hudson. “We're not talking about this,” Hudson cut in tersely from off-camera. “Jordon was a constant presence during our interview,” Dokoupil informs viewers in voiceover, in a moment that launched a thousand TikTok reaction videos. 

In the midst of this controversy, the couple has been manufacturing social media content about their relationship that isn't alarming so much as it is lightly uncanny, especially given Belichick's famously gruff public persona. On Hudson's Instagram account, she has posted beachside pictures of herself balancing athletically on Belichick's outstretched legs, and of Belichick, dressed as a fisherman, reeling in a mermaid-tailed Hudson from the surf. (“Ouucchhhh!!!” goes the caption on that one.)

A few have defended the relationship between Belichick and Hudson. Sports media personality Colin Cowherd has said that Hudson's choice to hop into Belichick's interview was normal for PR directors, if “kind of a cringy thing.” Right-wing sports outlet The Outkick has rallied to Hudson's side on the grounds that she triggers the libs, saying, “If Jordon wants to spend her weekends at Bill's house on Nantucket, soaking up the sun and enjoying Cisco Brewery on Bill's dime, I say GO FOR IT.” 

But the most common reaction to the spectacle of Hudson and Belichick's relationship is the one outlined by sports media personality Katie Nolan on a podcast in February: This is weird and seems like it has sinister undertones.

“We're already going, ‘You're how much younger than him?' And then you show up in a commercial. And then you hear that she's in charge in his career.” Nolan said. “It seems like you could be taking advantage of the guy. And he's obviously taking advantage of the girl.” 

Notably, it doesn't appear to be much of a head-scratcher why a powerful septuagenarian would choose to be with a recent college graduate and pageant contestant. But the nefarious reason implied about why Hudson wants to be with Belichick is the one people are misogynistically and freely throwing around: gold digger.

I don't know anything about Hudson and Belichick's private relationship, and most likely, neither do you. I don't want to make any claims about who is using whom or what their private life is like. But as a feminist pop culture critic, I am interested to see the term “gold digger” swim back up from the collective unconsciousness again, ready and willing to go to work. 

There's something almost old-fashioned about it. The last time “gold digger” was thrown around in pop culture so much was when teenager Courtney Stodden skyrocketed to fame in 2011 after they got married at age 16 to 51-year-old actor Doug Hutchison. Stodden would later describe their marriage as one characterized by grooming and sexual assault. 

Before that, the great pop culture gold digger was Anna Nicole Smith, the model turned paparazzi obsession who married oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II in 1994. Since Smith's untimely death in 2007, she's found a place in the pantheon of wronged women of the 1990s, someone we came to believe over the last decade was publicly mistreated — in part by her tarring as a gold digger. 

“It's a bit provincial to look down one's nose at a woman wanting something from a man and give a pass to a man who arguably would have never given her a second glance had she not been a beautiful, blonde Playboy Playmate,” essayist and sex work activist Laura LeMoon argued in 2023, writing about Smith in Salon. “Rather than singling out and condemning Anna Nicole Smith, we should be pointing our fingers at the inequities and systemic failures that put people like me and Smith in positions where obtaining money and resources from men, directly or indirectly, is our best option for survival.”

“Gold digger” is a euphemism that allows us as a culture to talk around those systemic failures. It's a way to deride women when they take seriously the idea that their financial well-being should depend on their relationships with men. So it's odd to see the term becoming so popular during a moment when popular culture has become rather infatuated with the idea that life is most pleasant, simple, and straightforward when women's finances do depend on romantic relationships with men.

TikTok is full of tradwives explaining how their lives became better once they got out of the 9-to-5 grind to make cereal from scratch for their children and let their husbands do the breadwinning. (That the most successful of the tradwife influencers are actually the primary breadwinners in their homes is an irony the influencers themselves seldom discuss.) Or there are the stay-at-home girlfriends cooing over how taking care of their boyfriends without even the financial safety net of a marriage contract has been their ticket to the soft life. 

The gold digger is the tradwife as seen through a funhouse mirror: a woman living off her ability to attract a man, only here done crassly.

Meanwhile, some of President Donald Trump's most vocal supporters are arguing that his tariffs will force women out of the workforce and make them once again financially dependent on men, either through marriage or through sex work, life paths these men treat as equivalent. Trump's appeal to the dream of a lost American manufacturing economy is a nostalgic one. It's an appealing fantasy to some of his more incel-adjacent fans: that under this economy, the sexes will revert to an older, allegedly more natural economic relationship, one in which women trade their sexuality and childrearing capabilities to men in exchange for financial security. 

The gold digger is the tradwife as seen through a funhouse mirror: a woman living off her ability to attract a man, only here done crassly, without the show of love to soften the crude edges of the transaction. The gold digger is simply a figure we can blame for how uncomfortable this dynamic makes us feel, without having to think through just what is so uncomfortable about it. 

So if we're angry at Jordon Hudson, it's worth asking the question: Are we angry with her, or with the fact that powerful people want to make gold digging one of a woman's most viable career paths again?

ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday he's moving to set up direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin as soon as he can, after Putin opted to skip peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey.

“I think it's time for us to just do it,” Trump told reporters as he wrapped a four-day visit to the Middle East.

Trump later told reporters after boarding Air Force One to begin the journey back to Washington that he may call Putin soon.

“He and I will meet, and I think we'll solve it or maybe not,” Trump said. “At least we'll know. And if we don't solve it, it'll be very interesting.”

Trump reiterated that he wasn't surprised that Putin skipped out on the talks set for Friday in Turkey. Putin didn't want to go because he's not there, Trump said.

The Republican president added that he would hold a meeting with Putin “as soon as we can set it up.”

“I would actually leave here and go,” said Trump, who noted his daughter Tiffany just gave birth to her first child. “I do want to see my beautiful grandson.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to take part in the talks as Trump pressed for the leaders to find a solution to the war, ongoing since Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. But Putin spurned the call to meet face-to-face with Zelenskyy.

Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to a war-ending agreement. Zelenskyy has agreed to an American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, but Russia has not signed on and has continued to strike at targets inside Ukraine.




Still, Russia and Ukraine were holding their first direct peace talks in three years Friday, gathering in Istanbul for negotiations. Officials and observers expect them to yield little immediate progress on stopping the more than 3-year-old war.

“He didn't go, and I understand that,” Trump said. “We're going to get it done. We got to get it done. Five thousand young people are being killed every single week on average, and we're going to get it done.”

Trump on Thursday told reporters that a meeting between himself and Putin was crucial to breaking the deadlock.

“I don't believe anything's going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,” Trump said. “But we're going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.”

The most important part of a volcano is hidden deep underground.

by  Byrd Pinkerton

When you picture a volcano, what do you see? I personally imagine a mountain sticking up into the sky. At the top of that mountain, I see a crater with a fiery hot lake boiling and roiling in it, or lava pouring down a slope like bright red candle wax, or massive clouds of grey ash exploding into the air. 

It's all incredible, powerful imagery, but it's also really just the tip of the volcano-berg. 

If I were to descend down through my imaginary volcano, moving down through layers and layers of earth, I'd find what might be an even more incredible feature: my volcano's pulsing, fiery furnace of a heart, also known as its “magma chamber.” This is the reason that hot ash comes bursting up through the surface. It's the original source of my lava and my crater lake. It's where much of the important action in a volcano unfolds — and could hold secrets to help us better predict when a devastating eruption will occur. 

The problem is that we know much less about magma chambers like this than we'd like to. We're not even good at depicting them. 

“We draw them as red balloons,” says Mike Poland, a geophysicist and scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. “They are not. But it's a very difficult thing to represent.”

Magma chambers are so hard to represent because they're so complex. They can be thousands of degrees Fahrenheit and have blends of solid material and hot liquid rock. These chambers have different temperatures in different spots, and different minerals melting at different heats or moving around in different ways. And, making things even more complex, there's a multitude of different gases that might make pressure build up before an eruption. 

But if we could better represent magma chambers — and just generally better understand exactly how they work — Poland says we might be able to dramatically improve our understanding of how volcanoes operate, and therefore be better able to anticipate what to expect from an impending eruption. But right now, because these chambers are so hot and so deep underground, it's hard to plumb their secrets.

“We don't have, like, the glass-bottomed volcano where you can just sort of look into and go like, Oh, that's what's going on,” Poland jokes.

But what if we could have a glass-bottomed volcano that we could sort of look into and go like, Oh, that's what's going on? What if we could build, say, a little observatory deep down under the ground, right in the hot little heart of a volcano? It sounds absurd, and yet… 

“ There's a project in Iceland,” Poland tells me, “They want to build a magma observatory. They want to drill into a magma chamber and put some monitoring equipment in the hole. … That would give us some idea of what's going on in there.”

The project is called the Krafla Magma Testbed, or KMT, and the researchers working on it think it could revolutionize volcanology — and how we forecast eruptions. 

One of the key motivations for building an observatory like this is that volcanology has a prediction problem. On the one hand, volcanoes are much more predictable than, say, earthquakes — they tend to give us some warning signs before they erupt. But on the other hand, it's hard to perfectly interpret those warning signs, which means the predictions volcanologists can make with our existing technology can be both incredibly helpful and frustratingly imprecise.

For example, for the last year or so, a potential eruption has been brewing at Mount Spurr, a volcano near Anchorage, Alaska. Twice in the last 100 years, eruptions from Mount Spurr have rained ash down on the city, clogging up roadways, shutting down the local airport (one of the busiest cargo ports in the world), and settling like a fine dusting of gritty, gray, unmelting snow on cars and lawns and leaves of trees. 

People are understandably worried about a repeat performance, and the Alaska Volcano Observatory is monitoring the situation closely.

Matt Haney, the scientist-in-charge at that observatory, told me while he can be sure that the volcano is displaying several key warning signs, he can't be sure exactly what the upcoming volcanic activity might look like — if there will be one eruption or many, exactly how intense they will be, or when they'll occur.

“That is not possible in the current levels of technology that we have,” he said. “There's no definitive time frame, like, Oh, it's going to do exactly this, like it did in 1992. It's not the precise same playbook.” 

Even with 11 seismic stations gathering real-time data about the Alaskan volcano — even with devices measuring how it is changing shape in response to incoming magma, with planes circling in the sky to understand the venting of gases, and with an enormous amount of truly impressive work — these volcanologists still can't give us as clear a picture of the future as we might like them to. 

That's tricky enough when you're dealing with the prospect of a clogging and choking coating of volcanic ash, but it gets even more complicated when you're trying to make determinations about people's lives. 

“This is the problem. How do you know how big an eruption's going to be?”

Look, for example, at the case of Soufrière de Guadeloupe, a volcano on the Caribbean island of Basse-Terre. In the mid-1970s, it started venting steam. That, paired with increased earthquake activity, had people worried that a dramatic eruption might be brewing. 

And they had very good reason to worry: In 1902, another Caribbean volcano eruption sent a deadly mix of hot gas and ash and rock careening through a nearby city at 300 miles an hour, killing 27,000 people. So, hoping to avoid a repeat of this devastating event, the governmental authorities decided to go ahead and evacuate. More than 70,000 people left Basse-Terre. 

But the subsequent eruption was minor. As one report put it, the “explosive emission of steam and debris was certainly impressive to those who had the misfortune to view it at close quarters. But from a volcanological point of view, it represented a rather trivial outburst.” If anything, the biggest impact on the volcanic activity was the evacuation itself — it hurt the local economy and disrupted kids' schooling. 

Sometimes, though, evacuations are extremely necessary. In 1991, at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, volcanologists once again read the volcanic tea leaves — stuff like seismic activity and steam explosions — and predicted a big eruption. Once again, people were evacuated. But this time, the decision to abandon the area saved thousands of lives — the ensuing eruption was one of the biggest in the 20th century. 

“This is the problem,” Poland says. “How do you know how big an eruption's going to be?”

You don't want to evacuate too little, or too late, at the cost of human lives, he says. But equally, you don't want to be the boy who cries wolf, or the volcanologist who cries, “ERUPTION!” 

“ It erodes trust in the scientists,” he says.

Volcanology has come a long way since the 1970s, or even the 1990s. Scientists have much more monitoring equipment set up on volcanoes, and they have made better equipment over time. Their ability to make predictions about volcanoes has improved dramatically as a result.

But as the case of Mount Spurr shows, even now — in 2025 — the field still grapples with the same fundamental problem of precision in their predictions.

So how do these predictions get better? How could volcanologists further improve their predictions in order to help people make decisions about how to prepare for eruptions?

Poland has spent a fair amount of time thinking about the answers to this question. He wrote a whole paper about it, in fact. And he thinks that improving volcano forecasting is not just about continuing to improve our monitoring equipment. Instead, he says, what we really need is better information about volcanoes themselves, and the hot molten rocks that power them. 

Let's talk about how we currently forecast volcano eruptions. A lot of volcano prediction involves making very informed guesses about what a volcano might do in the future based on what that volcano has done in the past — what Poland calls pattern recognition. 

Take, for example, gas emissions or earthquakes. Essentially, he says, researchers will take a lot of very, very precise measurements of those phenomena that will allow them to then say ‘Alright. X is happening. And when X happened before, Y happened afterward, so maybe now Y will happen again soon.' 

“It's not necessarily based on any special understanding of the physics of volcanic activity or that particular volcano,” Poland says, “It's more based on…We've seen this movie before, and we know how it's likely to evolve over time.”

This approach has been incredibly useful. It's saved a lot of lives and helped scientists make some really good predictions about how a volcano might behave, broadly. But Poland likes to draw a comparison between this approach and with how we forecast the weather. Because in the past, weather scientists also relied heavily on pattern matching. If the pressure was dropping and it was getting colder, say, they might expect a storm to come through. 

But then, weather forecasting went through a kind of revolution. Scientists used satellites and other instruments to collect information about clouds and winds and rain. They collected huge amounts of data about the atmosphere, and people even flew directly into the eyes of phenomena like hurricanes to measure what was happening inside of those storms.

“This really abundant information was then used by modelers…to work out the physics of what's going on,” Poland says. 

Weather scientists still use a lot of historical data to inform their understanding of the future (and now, with AI, are actually turning back to their massive bodies of data to try some more advanced pattern recognition), but they have also built really sophisticated models of the physics of the atmosphere that help them make their predictions. And it has paid off: Last year, according to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane forecasters set new records for accuracy in their predictions for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. 

“We can now forecast, with some degree of accuracy, whether a hurricane will form, how intense it is going to be, where it's going to go,” Poland says. “Obviously not every forecast is perfect. And that's because our knowledge is still imperfect. But they know enough.”

Poland wants volcanologists to build similar models of the underlying physics of volcanoes, which would mean building models of magma chambers. Scientists have been working on making models like this — and have even been working on applying them to forecasting. But if the weather scientists built their models by flying directly into things like hurricanes and taking measurements, volcano researchers have had a bit of a harder time doing the equivalent for magma chambers. They can't take direct measurements, so they've used seismic and electromagnetic imaging to take the equivalent of X-rays of the Earth, and they've studied places where ancient volcanoes have eroded away, bringing their cooled, frozen magma chambers up to the surface. They've even read the layers of volcanic crystals as though they were tree rings. 

This has been helpful, but it's kind of like studying your neighbors by eavesdropping on their conversations through the wall and going through their trash instead of just talking to them directly. 

So that's why some researchers are hoping to talk to volcanoes directly — to observe their magma chambers in real time. 

In some ways, the dream of a magma observatory started with an accident. Or to be a little more specific, it started with three different accidents in three different countries, each more than a decade ago. In each case, people set out to drill a deep hole into the rock near a volcano, and in each case, they accidentally drilled right down into the magma chamber. 

These accidents were a big surprise to the people doing the drilling, but to John Eichelberger, they were a big opportunity. 

Eichelberger has been studying volcanoes for around five decades. For much of that time, he's been curious about magma chambers. He thinks that knowing more about them could not only help us forecast volcanoes better, but also maybe tap into them for geothermal power. Unfortunately, he says, for a long time, it was difficult to find a way to drill into magma chambers and find out more about them, because people were not sure what would happen if you did. What if you triggered an eruption? 

“Really the only way [drilling down to a magma chamber] could happen was by serendipity,” Eichelberger says. 

Serendipity like these three drilling accidents. They provided some real-world examples of what would happen if you drilled down to a magma chamber. And the answer was, it turns out, not all that much. In each of these three cases, the drilling companies hit the magma chamber and instead of like hot rock shooting out of their hole in a hot plume of fire, the magma basically climbed a little ways up the hole, and then cooled off into a plug of dark obsidian glass. 

This was very good news for Eichelberger. As he remembers it, he wound up meeting someone from a power company that was involved in one of these accidents. That representative let him know that they would be open to letting Eichelberger and other researchers do some more research near their power plant in the Krafla volcanic region of Iceland. And so, in 2014, Eichelberger gathered researchers together for a consortium – including a researcher named Yan Lavallée, now at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.

“Fifty or 60 of us spent the best part of a week together browsing ideas as to…what could we learn if we were to do this?” Lavallée syas, “What could we learn if we were to drill back in the magma?”

This was the start of the dream of KMT: The Krafla Magma Testbed, named for the volcanic system in Iceland. It's a dream that Eichelberger, Lavallée, and their collaborators are still trying to get funded, but they have a clear idea of how they'd make it a reality. 

“First, we're going to install a drill rig at the Earth's surface, and we're going to start drilling,” Lavallée tells me. 

As they drill down, things will get hotter and hotter. They will pump fluid through, which will cool things down. Eventually, as they start to approach the magma of the magma chamber, the fluid will even start to cool down a little bit of that magma, too. 

“It will vitrify to a glass,” Lavallée says. This glass will likely not be transparent like a window. Instead, it will be obsidian — dark black and full of minerals. 

The researchers will then continue to keep things cool while they carve into that black glass, creating something like a pocket within it. Once that pocket is made, they hope to drop measuring devices into it. Lavallée works with tools in his lab that are made of the same kinds of heavy-duty materials that we put into things like jet engines and other materials that can withstand extremely high temperatures. 

Once everything's in place, they will stop cooling things down. Then the heat of the surrounding molten rock should start warming the obsidian of the glass pocket back up again slowly, until it melts back into magma and flows back around the instruments, submerging them fully in the magma of the chamber. 

Then, hopefully, the researchers will finally have their observatory: a set of measuring devices feeding them real-time data about an active magma chamber. 

If this first project succeeds, then Eichelberger and Lavallée are brimming with ideas for further drilling projects that could help them tease out more information about volcanoes. They both hope this research could help the world tap into volcanoes as a source of power, but also that it could help with forecasting — to help us build the models of volcanoes' hearts that will give us the tools to predict their behavior as effectively as we predict hurricanes.

And overall, Lavallée thinks that if this dream of theirs succeeds, it might revolutionize volcanology.

“I don't think we can really fully conceive how it's going to change things,” he says. 

Obviously, Lavallée has a clear reason to think this way, but when I asked Poland, who has no involvement with this project, what he thought, he was also pretty enthusiastic.

“I am excited to hear what they can come up with,” Poland said, “I mean, you go into a magma chamber, you're going to learn some things.”

Celebrity chef Andrew Zimmern, speaking to Fox News Digital from Kansas City, said that he chooses "to live in a world where I get to eat pizza when I want."

Gas station food is as much a slice of American cuisine as a single serving of pizza, according to one celebrity chef.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, chef Andrew Zimmern, based in Minnesota, said he's spent the better part of 25 years traveling the country in a van.

"I'm not sure there's someone else alive who's probably stopped as many places to eat as I have in the last two-and-a-half decades," he said. (See the video at the top of this article.) 

CELEBRITY CHEF GUY FIERI'S MESSAGE TO AMERICANS: LET'S 'EAT BETTER' TO LIVE BETTER

That's what Zimmern said makes him qualified to vouch for gas station food, which he believes is more appealing to hungry Americans than it may appear.

He's now partnered with the Iowa-based Casey's gas stations to promote their new barbecue brisket pizza.

"I really think that what it has to do with is our own sense of adventure," Zimmern said. 

"We don't have to cross the ocean on a 19th century tramp steamer to have an adventure. We can walk into some place and try a regional food or a regional treat that happens to be for sale in that particular shop and have just as much of a warm, fuzzy feeling."

The chef praised the new barbecue brisket pizza at Casey's, which he touted for its "real, wholesome ingredients, stuff I'm happy to feed my family."

He added, "And by the way, in today's price-conscious world, there should be a pizza that's a whole pizza that can feed a family of four people really easily and not cost you a million dollars."

But good gas station food goes beyond just pizza, he said. 

"When you're in Arizona and you have a breakfast burrito at a gas station with three grandmas in the back rolling up homemade chorizo with eggs and crispy potatoes and handing them to you, you are in a very, very, very special place, and you're about to eat something really extraordinary – and they're all hiding in plain sight."

Zimmern also makes no apologies about eating what he wants when he's on the road.

"If I drank slushies and ate pizza three meals a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, I'm not sure it would really be great for me," he said.

"That said, I choose not to live in a world where I need to not eat pizza. I choose to live in a world where I get to eat pizza when I want and I get to have an orange slushy made with my favorite Mexican soda brand."

Rep. Ro Khanna told Fox News Digital on Wednesday why he is proposing legislation to codify President Donald Trump's executive order to lower prescription drug prices.

EXCLUSIVE: While Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., has been a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump's tariff and deportation policies, the president's latest executive order targeting prescription drug prices inspired the Silicon Valley congressman to trade political disses for diplomacy. 

Khanna proposed legislation on Wednesday to codify Trump's executive order aimed at lowering drug prices, and the Democrat is urging his Republican colleagues to follow his lead, reaching across the aisle to deliver for everyday Americans. 

"President Trump's executive order says that Americans should pay the least price. We should not pay any more than people are paying in countries overseas. Then, it gives the Cabinet secretaries the ability to go after Big Pharma companies that are price-gouging. Now, he tried something similar in his previous administration. Big Pharma sued him, it got tied up in courts, nothing happened. That's why we need Congress to act. I have introduced something that codifies President Trump's language, and I'm hoping we get a Republican co-sponsor," Khanna told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. 

As Democrats search for party unity after losing the White House, the Senate and failing to regain the House of Representatives last year, Democrats have gravitated toward an outright rejection of the Trump administration, as depicted through ongoing protests. Khanna, however, said he does not mind if Trump "gets a political win" if it benefits the American people.

"If Donald Trump says that's something that's good for the American people, I'm not going to oppose it just for political points," Khanna said.

Khanna is considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate and, like many ambitious Democrats, has crisscrossed the United States this year, bringing his vision for America to the national conversation. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, D-Mich., also expected to harbor 2028 ambitions, faced some flack within the party this year for engaging directly with Trump to deliver for Michiganders.

"If Donald Trump has a good idea that's going to help the American people, we should work with him. If we have a philosophical disagreement, we shouldn't. But the barometer for me, the test case is, is this helping people? Is this something that I think is going to help this country? Where I have philosophical disagreements, I speak up. But when I think that it is good legislation, I am willing to support him. And I don't care, like some people, if he gets a political win. So much of politics is, 'Oh, we don't want to give the other side a political win.' For all I care, he can have a great political win if the American public gets lower drug prices," Khanna told Fox News Digital. 

While Khanna said he has not communicated with Trump directly about codifying his executive order, he delivered a now-viral House floor speech Wednesday, urging his Republican colleagues to join the bipartisan effort to lower prescription drug prices. 

"Are you on the side of the people, or are you on the side of the $16 billion in Big Pharma lobbyist money that was spent last year? My legislation, there's no trick to it. It is President Trump's idea, President Trump's executive order, President Trump's language into law. Every Republican should support this, and every Democrat should," Khanna added. 

Ahead of Trump's executive order signing, Khanna affirmed his support for lowering drug prices, reminding Americans that he proposed similar legislation alongside Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with the same goal in mind. 

"I just don't understand why any Republican wouldn't support this. It's President Trump's executive order, and every American agrees that prescription drug price costs are too much, that it's so unfair that Americans are stuck with all these high bills when other countries are paying pennies on the dollar for their drugs. It's time that Americans be treated fairly," Khanna said.

As Khanna, who was a surrogate for then-President Joe Biden's re-election campaign in 2024, finds common ground with the current administration, he told Martha MacCallum on "The Story" Wednesday that Biden should not have run in 2024. 

"I do think it's important that, given what has come out, that we take accountability," Khanna said. "Obviously, he should not have run. We should be clear to say that. Obviously, there should have been an open primary. And, I don't think that's very difficult that Democrats should just be straight up that he should not have run, now that we have all the facts. There should have been an open primary. I think to move on and move forward, it's important to take accountability and be straight-forward with the American people."

While Khanna said he did not have the full picture of Biden's health and mental acuity when he defended him before the disastrous debate performance, Khanna admitted, "We should be honest as a party that we made a mistake."

﻿The surprising gender gap driving young Americans apart.

by  Christian Paz

Among the persistent mysteries of the 2024 election is the roots of the modern political gender gap, particularly among young people. Though their final vote choices were a bit more nuanced than some pre-election polls suggested, young men and women, aged 18 to 29, had the largest divergence in their vote among the age groups. Gen Z men supported Donald Trump by 14 percentage points; Gen Z women supported Kamala Harris by 17 points, per one post-election analysis.

Those dynamics, particularly the aggressive rightward shift of young men, have raised some interesting questions: What was driving this divide? Was something in particular moving young men to the right while pushing young women to the left? Could it be the manosphere, economics, or old-school sexism?

Or could it be something else, like the apparent resurgence of organized religion?

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

As I've reported, the rapid decline of religiosity within the United States has been slowing down over recent years. Particularly since the pandemic, data shows Gen Z is no longer continuing the rapid decline in religious affiliation, particularly Christianity, that started with previous generations. If anything, religious belief has seen a small revival with that youngest cohort.

That shift suggests a curious dynamic at play among America's youth. As Gen Z has been getting more politically polarized along gendered lines, so too has their religious affiliation. Those trends suggest that modern politics and religious beliefs may be having a bit of self-reinforcing effect on each other: As young men find faith and religious belonging, their politics are drifting to the right too, in turn reinforcing their existing beliefs.

The opposite seems to be true with young women: Religious customs are not jibing with their political and social beliefs, pushing them out of churches, and reinforcing that drift away from some organized religions.

Those religious trends matter. As religious and political beliefs of young men and women move away from each other, it stands to complicate not just electoral choices, but the future of family life, dating, and social belonging.

The last 10 years have seen American Christianity bottom out. After a steady decline in Christian religiosity since the 1990s, Christian belief began to stabilize at around 60 percent of the American adult population — still a historic low point — sometime around the turn of the 2020s.

A key contributor to this slow-down appears to be Gen Z. After years of successive generations losing their religion, Gen Z seemed to get as irreligious as it could be. Now, what we've seen since 2020 is a kind of dead cat bounce: a slightly higher level of Christian religious affiliation among the youngest adults. Among the youngest cohort of Gen Z, those born between 2000 and 2006, the share who identify as Christian has increased since 2023, from 45 percent to 51, per the Pew Research Center. And overall, Gen Z seems to be more Christian than past trend lines predicted they should be: at 46 percent compared to a projected 41 percent. 

At the heart of that halt and slight reversal is a dual dynamic: Young women are leaving religious congregations, while young men's religious identification and practice rises. These changes come across in a few ways. 

First, the gender gap in religious participation has not just evaporated in recent years, but reversed. The religious researcher and data scientist Ryan Burge has found in his analysis of survey data from the Cooperative Election Study that while women used to attend religious services more regularly than men, the reverse is now happening. Among the cohort born in the 1990s and 2000, it's men who are now outpacing women in weekly attendance.

Looking at other reference points suggests something similar. Young women are more likely than young men to say they are religiously unaffiliated, according to the American Enterprise Institute's Survey Center on American Life research. Young women are now as likely as young men to say religion is “not that important” to them — a significant development since women have traditionally been more fervent believers. And the religious gender gap among the youngest cohort appears to be narrowing in other ways, too: Regardless of which religion they identify with, young women and young men report about the same rates of daily prayer. For older generations, women greatly outpace men in praying daily.

We could still stand to get better data about what is happening. It could be that young men simply remain as religious as older generations of men are (while women lose religion), or that men are getting more religious in general, or that men are particularly loyal to organized religion. Some data suggest young women remain religious or spiritual but just don't identify with organized churches in the same way men do. But the religious gender gap still appears to be changing among Gen Z.

But is politics driving these changes in religious behavior and belief? Or is religion driving stronger political beliefs? The data is a little less definitive here, but two things seem to bear out: According to AEI's Survey Center, young women who are leaving churches report doing so because their congregations' beliefs are more conservative than the beliefs they hold. Churches are out of step with where most young women are. 

Additionally, young Christian women who remain in their churches are still more likely to be liberal and hold progressive beliefs than young Christian men. Even as they remain Christians, they are becoming more politically liberal.

Underlying all of this is the fact that Gen Z women are more likely to identify as feminists, as LGBTQ, and as supportive of abortion rights. According to the Pew Religious Landscape Survey, young Christian women are 13 points more likely than young men to say that abortion should be legal. They are 18 points more likely to support gay marriage and 26 points more likely to accept LGBTQ people.

As the researcher Daniel A. Cox of the AEI's Survey Center points out, these are all shifts from what young Christians believed 10 years ago. “The gender gap in views of abortion has since quadrupled,” he notes in a recent analysis, but when it comes to views on homosexuality and gay marriage, it seems like young men have moved right. “Young Christian women have hardly changed their views over the last decade, while young men have become less supportive.”

On a range of other views of government, political parties, and ideology in general, what's happening with non-religious young people is also happening among believers. Young Christian women are much more liberal, and more likely to be Democrats, than young Christian men. Cox notes that it might not be religion making these political views so different but the degree to which young Christian women have more connections and exposure to diverse communities and are consuming different kinds of media. Religious young men seem to be stuck in more homogenous environments, both in the digital and in the real world, he suggests.

Still, while we can confidently say young women are becoming more liberal and less religious in that process, we can't say the same for men. Religion may or may not be making young men more conservative, but it does seem likely that their conservative religious and political beliefs are at least keeping young men in churches. It appears to be slowing down their drift away from organized religion.

All of which stands to complicate the future of not just Gen Z's social and cultural bonds to each other but also those of future generations. It's the youngest cohort of Gen Z, those born between 2000 and 2006, that is narrowing religious gender gaps while widening political ones. That poses issues for their social, romantic, and familial futures. Gen Z already reports struggles with socializing, dating, maintaining healthy relationships, and combating loneliness. Marriage rates continue to fall. So as young men and women drift away from each other, it's hard to see how prospective partners breach these divides. And these dynamics may very well end up having electoral effects.

The lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Leo XIV affirmed Friday that the family is founded on the “stable union between a man and a woman,” and that the unborn and elderly enjoy dignity as God's creatures, articulating clear Catholic teaching on marriage and abortion at the start of his pontificate.

Leo, the first American pope, also called for reviving multilateral diplomacy and promoting dialogue between religions in the search for peace, in his first meeting with the Vatican diplomatic corps. The audience was private, but the Vatican released Leo's prepared text and that of the dean of the diplomatic corps. 

The encounter is one of the protocol requirements after a conclave, allowing a new pope to greet representatives of world governments ahead of his formal installation Mass this Sunday. The Holy See is a sovereign state under international law, has diplomatic relations with over 180 countries and enjoys observer status at the United Nations.

Leo, a member of the Augustinian religious order, has emphasized peace as a priority of his pontificate, from the first words he uttered on the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica after his May 8 election, “Peace be with you all.”

In his remarks, he said the search for peace was one of the pillars of the papacy. He insisted that peace isn't just the absence of conflict but a “gift” that requires work, from an end to the production of weapons to choosing words carefully. “For words too, not only weapons, can wound and even kill.”




He said it was up to governments to build peaceful societies “above all by investing in the family, founded upon the stable union between a man and a woman.“

“In addition, no one is exempted from striving to ensure respect for the dignity of every person, especially the most frail and vulnerable, from the unborn to the elderly, from the sick to the unemployed, citizens and immigrants alike,” he said.

Pope Francis strongly reaffirmed core Catholic teaching opposing abortion and euthanasia, saying they were evidence of today's “throwaway culture.” But he also made reaching out to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark, insisting they are welcome in the church. He never changed church doctrine defining marriage as a union between man and woman and homosexual acts as “intrinsically disordered.”

As the then-head of the Augustinian order, the Rev. Robert Prevost in 2012 criticized the “homosexual lifestyle” and the role of mass media in promoting acceptance of same-sex relationships that conflicted with Catholic doctrine. A decade later, during Francis' pontificate, he acknowledged Francis' call for a more inclusive church, and said he didn't want people excluded just on the basis of their lifestyle.

It has long been an unwritten rule of the Catholic Church that no citizen of a world superpower can be pope.

The informal logic is that such an arrangement would risk putting preeminent temporal and spiritual authority into the hands of the same clan. It is always safer to pick a pope from a more quaint, less powerful country.

But at the most unexpected moment, the College of Cardinals broke this understanding by electing the first American pontiff in a line of succession more than 2,000 years old, stretching right back to Christ's selection of St. Peter.

When Pope Leo XIV, formerly known as Cardinal Robert Prevost, emerged as the bishop of Rome on May 8, jaws dropped to the cobbled pavement of Vatican City.

The Catholic Church is among the oldest thriving institutions in history. Even in secular society and among nonbelievers, the Holy See enjoys unparalleled prestige that dwarfs other religious leaders and most monarchies. Its mission to spread the Gospel message gives it a character that transcends the coarseness of politics. The Catholic Church is stability personified.

The election of the first American pope coincides with President Donald Trump returning to power. This is perhaps a mere coincidence but a significant coincidence nevertheless.

Trump, whose superpower is a talent for self-advertisement, forced all eyes worldwide to turn to watch America and what is happening here. Then, the church chose Leo to lead it, and the American focus of our time was suddenly underlined.

The president is a nationalist who vows to “Make America Great Again.” He won the Catholic vote in 2024. But the church is a global institution, not a national one. Trump and his most fervent supporters cast a skeptical eye on globalism and globalization.

There is much speculation about why the cardinals selected a Chicago-born prelate to lead them at this moment, when Trump is reasserting American power and fighting to build or restore the power of the presidency itself.

Initially, the anti-Trump media predictably spun the election of Leo into a rebuke of the White House, with the cardinals selecting a gladiator to battle against American nationalism.

But that narrative is quickly falling apart. The only evidence produced for it was past retweets and social media posts advocating “sensible gun control laws” and questioning Trump's rhetoric on immigration.

If the College of Cardinals simply wanted an American pope whose views would clash with Trump's, there were more fitting candidates.

Something else seems to have been at work — something that is less about standing athwart Trump's pursuit of power and American greatness and more about building bridges where possible.

It is a fool's errand to contemplate the Catholic Church and its supreme pastor within a secular political framework. Dichotomies such as “right-wing” and “left-wing” mean little to an institution that predates the discipline of political science by nearly two millennia.

When the world is thinking in weeks, the church is thinking in centuries.

Trump was asked in the days leading up to the conclave who he would like to see elected pope. His first answer was an inevitable joke: He said he would be a good pope himself. His second answer mentioned Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York.

Dolan, a jovial Irishman who has pastored the massive New York archdiocese since 2009, is perhaps the most powerful cardinal in America. He knows Trump personally and has cordial relations with him. He delivered a benediction at both Trump inaugurations, in 2017 and 2025, and he has been photographed many times buddying up with the president at public events such as the Al Smith Dinner.

But Dolan is not a toady of the White House. Among the “anti-Trump” social media activity attributed to then-Cardinal Prevost was his retweeting of an article by Dolan titled “Why Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric is so problematic.”

Speaking to reporters after the conclave, Dolan called the president's recent AI-generated image of himself as pope a brutta figura — Italian for “ugly figure” or “bad impression.”

Several Italian news outlets identified Dolan as playing a pivotal role in the conclave and securing votes for Prevost among his fellow Americans and other English-speaking cardinals from countries that were once part of the British Empire.

The finer points of discussions that happen in conclave are kept secret under oath, but heading into the election, “stability” was said to be the word on every cardinal's lips.

“When we went in there Wednesday afternoon, I think most people had a clean, clear idea about the candidate that they wanted — and it didn't take that long,” Dolan said after the election of Leo.

The new pope's solemn and sober demeanor is immediately obvious. He is calm, controlled, and pastoral.

He speaks in a soft and steady tone, with more of a flourish when talking about Christ, but shows a more passive voice on matters of the temporal world. Thus far, he has rarely spoken without prepared remarks.

In his first address to members of the media in Paul VI Audience Hall, Leo urged news figures to exercise restraint in their language and to escape the Tower of Babel created by polarized, hostile discourse.

“We do not need loud, forceful communication but rather communication that is capable of listening and gathering the voices of the weak who have no voice,” he said. “Let us disarm words. Let us disarm words, and we will help the world disarm. Disarming communication will allow us to share events of the world and to act in a manner consistent with our human dignity.”

Leo said he chose his name to echo the last pope of the 19th century, Pope Leo XIII. He led the church during a time of political, social, and economic revolutions as the world hurtled toward modernization and industrialization. His papacy offered spiritual stability amid the breakdown of feudal-era political systems.

Leo XIV suggested he believes the digital revolution is comparable, as a development with just as much consequence to human life as the industrial revolution. He has acknowledged the benefits of artificial intelligence but has cautioned the world to recognize that it poses “new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice, and labor.”

This theological orthodoxy and clear view of the likelihood of exploitation is a marked contrast to the AI-loving, crypto-dealing, IVF-championing politics of Trump.

Where the secular world accelerates into the unknown, the Catholic Church is meant to pump the brakes and remind us all of eternal truths that no new technology should be allowed to obscure.

Trump did not respond to Leo's election as though the church had just chosen a new rival to challenge him. Instead, the president savored the “honor” of an American citizen sitting on the throne.

“Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope,” Trump wrote on Truth Social following Leo's ascension. “It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope.”

“What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country,” he continued. “I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!”

Trump was elected to improve the lives of average citizens and resuscitate traditional American culture, which has been gutted by hostile secular leftist forces. Many of his allies in America and abroad see their mission as restoring Western civilization. Vice President JD Vance is prominent in pushing this theme of Trump's presidency.

Vance converted to Catholicism in 2019 after years of spiritual wanderings that began in the evangelical theology of his youth. His faith plays a prominent role in his decision-making, and he frequently cites Catholic intellectual tradition in his remarks.

His is not a unique story among modern conservatives.

Christianity's role in public life is diminished compared to the founding of the country, which was at a time when state churches were common in many countries and atheism was scandalous. Vance lamented “where Western civilization has gone” during an address at the Heritage Foundation last month, asserting that “the Christian faith” is among the “very founding ideas of the West” that “all Western nations were in some important respect really based on in their original charter.”

Voters never decided or agreed to cast the church or religion out of the public square, he argued. That was the work of elites who no longer appreciated their cultural inheritance.

“Those very ideas have not just fallen out of favor, and they're not just less popular than they were 200 years ago or 300 years ago; of course, in the case of our friends in Europe, a thousand years ago,” Vance said. “What we've seen is that those ideas have become disfavored [by] the ruling elite of the societies.”

Now, Americans of all religious backgrounds and of widely differing political beliefs are embracing the American pope.

Social media is abuzz with speculation about whether Leo has shopped at Costco and how many times he's visited a Buc-ee's.

The pope's favorite baseball team, the Chicago White Sox, congratulated the pontiff on its jumbotron following his election. Fans are showing up at Rate Field in fake liturgical vestments and mitres. On the East Coast, the Phillie Phanatic threw on papal robes as he stepped out for the audience.

The president of Villanova University, of which Leo is an alumnus, said he was “getting so many congratulations” that “you would think I became the pope.”

A bipartisan group of lawmakers from over a dozen states is pushing a resolution in Congress that would officially recognize and celebrate Leo as “the 267th pontiff of the Holy Roman Catholic Church” and “the first American pontiff.”

The 19th-century political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville, a French diplomat who traveled the early United States and documented sociological phenomena, reflected on the nature of liberty and religion in the New World.

In his estimation, the contrasting forces of liberty and historical Christianity were slowly but constantly pulling Americans in opposite directions.

“Our descendants will increasingly divide into only two parts, some leaving Christianity entirely and others embracing the Church of Rome,” he wrote.

Trump has reiterated his desire to meet with Leo soon. Vance is attending the pope's inauguration Mass. Formal requests have already been filed asking for an invitation to be made for the pontiff to speak in Congress.

The U.S. is probably not on the verge of a mass conversion to Catholicism. But the sight of the Old World's most ancient honor being conferred on a son of the Midwest is compelling even, perhaps especially, to the citizens of the world's preeminent power.

Tocqueville might have been right. But perhaps he did not account for the Church of Rome extending a hand to help pull Americans in.

            As the US and China came to an agreement to lower tariffs sharply this week, trade war uncertainty has, for now, subsided. But Wall Street has a new question for President Donald Trump: What about tax cuts?
    


            Lawmakers this week are debating Trump's tax agenda, which includes extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and adding potential tax cuts on tips, overtime pay and Social Security. That “big, beautiful bill” could have, well, big implications for the economy — and for stocks and bonds.
    


            A lower tax burden could could mean more money for consumers, the engine of the economy, to splash out at stores, in addition to providing a boost to Wall Street. But Trump's tax cuts could also increase the deficit, and investors might demand higher interest rates to hold US debt.
    


            Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, told CNN that he thinks investors could balk if the tax bill lowers taxes without cuts to government spending as well.
    


            “I think there may still be some belief in markets that there's going to be large spending cuts, and I think when they find out there really aren't, that might have some impact,” he said.

            While many investors have been enthusiastic about potential tax cuts, concerns about the federal debt have also increased substantially since 2017, when Trump's first tax cuts were passed, Auerbach said.
    


            The ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product, or the total value of goods and services produced in the economy, was 123% in 2024, up from 104% in 2017, according to the Treasury Department. A higher debt-to-GDP ratio signals the government might have “greater difficulty in repaying its debt,” according to Treasury Department.
    


            “We're now talking about deficits and a national debt-to-GDP ratio that are really going to be unprecedented, except for recent recessionary times,” Auerbach said.
    


            While Trump is set on extending his tax cuts, there just aren't that many places in the federal budget to cut spending, he said.
    


            Volatility has settled this month as Trump walked back his most aggressive tariff policies. As the focus turns to tax cuts, which Republicans hope to sign into law this summer, investors will be keen to see whether the president's tax agenda provides a boost to markets or shakes confidence in US assets.
    


            Investors' ire (or joy) could come out in the bond market, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, told CNN.
    


            “I think we have to watch closely the bond market, because it will give us a signal as to whether it dislikes whatever Trump does with taxes,” Stovall said.
    


            Trump's tariff chaos spooked markets deeply last month, making investors nervous about US assets. As a result, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose about 50 basis points the week ending April 11, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase. That was the largest weekly increase since 2001, they said.

            US Treasuries have typically been considered a safe haven and the best kind of place to park your cash during tough times. But the ongoing worries about the deficit could keep Treasuries volatile, the JPMorgan Chase analysts wrote, or at least give investors pause about holding long-term US debt.
    


            A March report by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said Trump's proposed tax cuts would add to the federal debt, which the report said is already on an unsustainable path.
    


            “They (lawmakers) should not add further to the debt by enacting or extending tax cuts and spending without offsets,” the report said. “Doing so could spark a debt spiral and impose significant costs on current and future generations.”
    


            For now, investors are largely waiting to see what happens, said Chip Hughey, managing director for fixed income at Truist Advisory Services.
    


            “It is still too early to tell what the ultimate impact the final tax bill will have on the US Treasury market,” Hughey said.
    


            Republicans still have plenty to work out in the tax bill, Berkeley's Auerbach pointed out. Not all the proposed changes are likely to make it in.
    


            While Capitol Hill and Wall Street begin to think more about tax cuts, the worries about tariffs haven't entirely gone away, either.
    


            Tariff rates still remain substantially higher than before Trump took office, and investors are waiting for more economic data to see how American consumers are faring, Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management Group, told CNN.
    


            More trade agreements could be coming, and the frameworks of the deals announced so far still need to be fleshed out, Hainlin said.
    


            “I think perhaps going into the year, there was a hope that there would be more of a clearly defined sequence, and not this sort of parallel processing of all of these initiatives at once,” Hainlin said.
    


            The lack of a “clearly defined sequence” means that, at least for now, the path for the US economy remains particularly unclear.
    


            “Even with the trade deal with China and suspension of reciprocal tariffs against other trade partners, tariffs remain a substantial headwind for the US economy,” David Doyle, head of economics at Macquarie, said in a Tuesday note. “While a positive development, the de-escalation does not mean that everything is ‘all clear' on the trade war front.”

            A veteran air-traffic controller at the facility that handles flights in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport is calling for more resources and speaking out about the intense pressures workers face amid a staffing shortage and tech outages.
    


            “It's like playing 3-D chess at 250 miles an hour,” Jonathan Stewart told the Wall Street Journal in a recent interview. “Like anything else, you're going to have a breaking point.”
    


            Stewart supervises the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility that handles flights headed to or from the busy airport. A meeting of airline and FAA officials is underway Friday to discuss reducing the number of flights at Newark following recent weeks' flight delays and cancellations fueled by runway construction, congestion and air traffic control staffing shortages.
    


            The same TRACON facility also experienced blackouts on April 28 and May 9 that involved losing radar and screens going blank.
    


            Stewart is among several traffic controllers on trauma leave, including some who were shaken by the blackouts, which left them unable to talk to planes or see where they were located.
    


            “I don't want to be responsible for killing 400 people,” he told the Journal.
    


            His testimony is one of the first public narratives of overworked and understaffed US controllers, who are combatting the declining working conditions, alongside aging infrastructure and outdated technology. The problems at control towers and facilities overlay an ongoing stress passengers feel over a string of technology outages, close calls and fatal accidents.
    


            Stewart – who has been writing plane callsigns in a notebook fearing another blackout – said he averted a potential mid-air collision between two aircraft flying nose-to-nose at the same altitude on May 4, the Journal reported.
    


Is it safe to fly to Newark Liberty International Airport in the wake of recent outages? Officials say it is



            On departure around 6:10 p.m. local time May 4 from New Jersey's Morristown Municipal Airport – about 30 miles from Manhattan – a Gulfstream business jet and Pilatus PC-12 plane conflicted, “resulting in a temporary loss of separation,” the FAA told CNN. The Gulfstream pilot was given correct instructions from controllers, it said.
    


            Feeling shaken after the close call, Stewart said he sent an email to FAA managers criticizing their leadership and is now speaking out to set the record straight about controllers, the Journal reported.
    


            While the controllers who manage Newark's airspace are elite, they need more resources to be able to do their jobs, Stewart told the Journal.
    


            Five controllers took a 45-day trauma leave after the outage on April 28 caused their radar screens to go blank for 90 seconds and their radios to go out for 30 seconds during the busy afternoon.
    


            Thirty-eight certified professional controllers are needed to operate the facility, yet only 24 of the positions – 63% – are currently filled, according to the FAA. Sixteen of those controllers are due to return to a New York FAA facility next year.
    


            During the April 28 incident at Newark, a primary telecommunications line failed and a backup line did not kick in, FAA Deputy Chief Operating Officer Franklin McIntosh testified Wednesday at a Senate hearing.
    


            The data lines were installed after the facility moved from New York to Philadelphia in July. Similar systems are in use across the US, said McIntosh, who acknowledged the tight staffing at TRACON, including just three controllers working all Newark arrivals and departures for over an hour Monday night.
    


            Two similar incidents have occurred at Newark's airport within the last week. On Sunday morning, the FAA said it implemented a ground stop for flights heading to Newark because of a “telecommunications issue.” On the early morning of May 9, another 90-second radar outage happened.
    


            The moment blank screens inside the Philadelphia TRACON facility came back online during the May 9 outage was captured in video obtained by CBS News. CNN has not been able to independently verify its authenticity.
    


            The Philadelphia facility, in part, guides aircraft approaching Newark airport before it hands off the planes to the airport tower, and it guides planes that have just departed the airport.
    


            Authorities have been working to address the challenges at Newark. The FAA created an “emergency task force” to make sure the airport operates safely, its acting Administrator Chris Rocheleau has said.
    


Another equipment outage impacts flights at Newark Liberty International Airport



            And this week, the agency initiated the “delay reduction meeting” with major airlines in hopes carriers will agree to limit flights ahead of the busy summer season to minimize cancellations and delays at the airport. United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air all attended.
    


            As for the personnel shortage, staffing will be increased at the Philadelphia facility, and there is a “healthy pipeline” of training classes filled through next July, the FAA has said.
    


            But hiring and retaining controllers has been tough. The current shortage of air traffic controllers is near a 30-year low, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, which represents 10,800 certified air traffic controllers across the country.
    


            The control facility responsible for traffic at Newark has been “chronically understaffed for years,” United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said in a message this month about the delays. The shortage was compounded by over 20% of FAA controllers who “walked off the job” last week at Newark Airport, he said.
    


            Stewart said controllers hadn't “walked off the job” and aren't to blame for the recent delays, the Journal reported, adding safety events might not be stressful initially but can have a cumulative effect.

The Department of Homeland Security is investigating a social media post by former FBI Director James Comey that suggested someone should “86” President Donald Trump.

The White House said the post is “deeply concerning” and is “being taken seriously.”

“Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of @POTUS Trump,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X in response to Comey's post. “DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.”

Current FBI Director Kash Patel added that his agency is “in communication with the Secret Service and Director [Sean] Curran. Primary jurisdiction is with SS on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.”

On Thursday, Comey posted a picture on Instagram of shells in the formation of “8647” with the caption “Cool shell formation on my beach walk…” He later took the post down and said he didn't know that “86” was associated with violence. To be “86'ed” is slang for “to be thrown out” or “get rid of,” according to Merriam-Webster.

While President Trump is currently on an international trip to the Middle East, the former FBI Director puts out what can clearly be interpreted as “a hit” on the sitting President of the United States—a message etched in the sand.This is deeply concerning to all of us and is… pic.twitter.com/RF0Dl3t1JF

“Eighty-six is slang meaning ‘to throw out,' ‘to get rid of,' or ‘to refuse service to.' It comes from 1930s soda-counter slang meaning that an item was sold out,” their website notes.

The “47” is seen as representing Trump, as he is the 47th (and 45th) president of the United States.

The post could mean Comey wants Trump out of the White House and not dead.

“I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message. I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down,” Comey said in a follow-up Instagram post. 

White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich suggested the post was putting out “a hit” on Trump. “While President Trump is currently on an international trip to the Middle East, the former FBI Director puts out what can clearly be interpreted as ‘a hit' on the sitting President of the United States—a message etched in the sand,” he said in a post on X.

The suggestion of violence toward Trump is a sensitive topic given the president escaped two assassination attempts last year, one with a bullet grazing his ear and another with a rifleman waiting for him as he golfed.

Other Republican figures denounced the post by Comey. “Just James Comey causally calling for my dad to be murdered,” Donald Trump Jr. posted on X. “This is who the Dem-Media worships. Demented!!!!”

Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) said the post is “absolute evil” and that Comey “knows what he is doing.”

TRANSGENDER ‘ACTIVIST' ARRESTED AFTER THREATENING TO ASSASSINATE NANCY MACE

Comey is unlikely to be charged with any crime because the threat appears to be vague, if there is any at all. Protesters during the “Hands Off” nationwide rallies wore shirts and carried signs with “8647,” indicating the number could be a common threat.

Comey served as FBI director from September 2013 to May 2017, when Trump fired him.

The Supreme Court on Friday granted a request by Venezuelan nationals seeking an injunction against their removal from the United States under the Alien Enemies Act.

In an unsigned decision, the court said the Trump administration had not given the detainees enough time or adequate resources to challenge their deportations.

"Under these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster," the ruling said.

The court did not rule on whether the Alien Enemies Act, which the Trump administration invoked in mid-April to deport the detainees, had been applied correctly.

"To be clear, we decide today only that the detainees are entitled to more notice than was given on April 18," their ruling said.

The justices noted they were granting only temporary relief while the case returns to a lower federal appellate court sorts out the question of how much notice is due to those being targeted for removal.

U.S. tech giants Nvidia, Cisco and OpenAI are supporting the "UAE Stargate" artificial intelligence data center announced this week, a source familiar with the deal confirmed Friday.

AI chip leader Nvidia will supply hardware with the latest Blackwell GB300 systems, the source confirmed.

The data center will collaborate with the AI infrastructure project of the same name in the U.S. announced by President Donald Trump shortly after his inauguration in January.

It is unclear if Oracle is involved in UAE Stargate as well. Co-founder Larry Ellison was part of the U.S. Stargate announcement.

The Abu Dhabi data center announced Thursday will be built by the Emirati firm G42. The massive campus will have 5-gigawatt capacity and cover 10 square miles.

Trump was in the UAE as part of a first foreign trip abroad in his second term. Trump also visited Saudi Arabia.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Cisco President Jeetu Patel were all in the UAE as well.

OpenAI declined to comment. 

The first phase of UAE Stargate includes a 1-gigawatt compute cluster.

OpenAI announced in February that it was considering building U.S. Stargate data center campuses in 16 states that had indicated "real interest" in the project.

The 16 states were Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and West Virginia.

Construction on the data center in Abilene, Texas, is currently underway and is expected to be completed in mid-2026.

On Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, Huang announced that Nvidia would sell 18,000 Blackwell chips to Saudi company Humain.

The GB300 chips, which were announced earlier this year, will be used in data centers totaling 500 megawatts in Saudi Arabia, according to remarks at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh.

AMD said it would also supply chips to Humain. The company said that Humain has committed $10 billion to the project.

Earlier this week, Anthropic received a $2.5 billion, five-year revolving credit line to amp up its liquidity in an ever-expanding — and expensive — competition in the artificial intelligence industry.

Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI research executives, launched its Claude chatbot in March 2023.

The company closed its latest funding round in March at a $61.5 billion valuation, and the new credit facility adds to that. The company said it plans to use it to strengthen its balance sheet and invest as it scales rapidly.

Annualized revenue reached $2 billion in the first quarter, the company confirmed, more than doubling from a $1 billion rate in the prior period. Revenue chief Kate Jensen said in a recent interview with CNBC that the number of customers spending more than $100,000 annually with Anthropic jumped eightfold from a year ago.

Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Canada and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group all participated in the credit facility.

Companies are seeking more funding and liquidity than ever before as the AI arms race intensifies. 

The generative AI market is poised to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade. Companies from Google and Amazon to Anthropic and Perplexity are racing to announce new products and features, especially as the race to build "AI agents" intensifies.

"This revolving credit facility provides Anthropic significant flexibility to support our continued exponential growth," Krishna Rao, Anthropic's finance chief, said in a statement. "The backing of these global financial institutions is a testament to the strength of our business and the resonance of our mission."

OpenAI announced similar news in October, when CNBC reported it had received a $4 billion revolving line of credit. The influx brought the company's total liquidity to more than $10 billion and came soon after it closed a funding round at a then-valuation of $157 billion.

JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Santander, Wells Fargo, SMBC, UBS, and HSBC all participated. OpenAI's base credit line is $4 billion, with an option to increase it by an additional $2 billion.

Tesla has appointed longtime Chipotle executive Jack Hartung to its board of directors, effective June 1.

As part of the board, Hartung will join Tesla's audit committee, the electric vehicle company disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.

The addition comes as Tesla battles sinking EV sales and eroding profits, and concerns that CEO Elon Musk is focusing too much attention elsewhere, including in his role leading President Donald Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The company's stock price is down 14% this year.

Musk began his company's earnings call last month by saying that his time spent running DOGE will drop "significantly" by the end of May, though he would still spend one or two days a week on his government work until the end of Trump's term.

Hartung, who was known for taking a disciplined approach to Chipotle's finances during the Covid-19 pandemic, will expand Tesla's board to nine members. Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia was the last addition to the Tesla board in 2022.

The SEC filing on Friday noted that Hartung's son-in-law is a service technician for the EV maker.

Tesla did not disclose details about Hartung's relationship with Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's brother. Kimbal Musk sits on Tesla's board and served on the board of Chipotle from 2013 to 2019, during Hartung's tenure.

Hartung held a variety of roles at the fast-casual burrito chain, joining the company in 2002 and rising in ranks to become its chief financial officer. Chipotle went public in 2006 and shares in the company are up by more than 100 times since then.

On May 6, Chipotle announced Hartung would step down from his current role as president and strategy chief on June 1, and would stay on in a senior advisory role through early March of next year.

Tesla posted a statement on social media site X, which is also owned by Musk, welcoming Hartung to the company.

Hartung serves on the board of the Chicago street food business Portillo's; beauty and baby care products maker The Honest Company; and Zocdoc, a site for booking medical appointments.

Tesla is currently preparing to launch its "retro-futuristic" diner in Los Angeles, which had been in development for about seven years.

The European Union is working on a new sanctions package that will target the Russian financial sector in the latest effort by Ukraine's allies to place pressure on President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a peace deal to end the war.

The bloc is also preparing to target third-party banks that are supporting Moscow's war effort, according to a person familiar with the details, who did not want to be named discussing matters that are not public.

The Trump administration's trade truce with China that paused the steepest tariffs on Chinese goods isn't offering much of a reprieve to many importers. Stacking of multiple tariff layers already implemented during the trade war has pushed up costs to import retail goods much higher than the 30% associated with the tentative agreement.

"While companies are relieved to see a temporary pause from the incredibly high tariffs on goods from China, retailers are still facing very high tariffs that will have an impact on prices and supply," said Josh Teitelbaum, senior counsel of Akin.

"Multiple layers of tariffs are a big problem for basic items like kids backpacks that come largely from China," said Dan Anthony, president at Trade Partnership Worldwide. "You're talking about rates of over 70%," he said.

That includes the layering of existing 17.6% tariffs and Section 301 tariffs (related to unfair trade practices) of 25%, with the 30% in tariffs on Chinese goods not included in the pause — 20% fentanyl-related tariffs and 10% reciprocal tariffs.

Walmart CFO John David Rainey said in a CNBC interview after its earnings this week that prices of goods including food, toys, and electronics may increase due to tariffs. "We're trying to navigate this the best that we can," he said in the CNBC interview. "But this is a little bit unprecedented in terms of the speed and magnitude in which the price increases are coming," he added.

Panjiva data shows from January 2025 to May 12, Walmart's top three countries where shipments originate from are China (34.1%), followed by India (26.3%), and Hong Kong (10.6%).

For many importers, the true tariff tax on Chinese goods now ranges from 40% to 70%.

Teitelbaum offered footwear as an example, with a children's or women's sneaker that has a leather upper facing a 40% tariff if imported from China today, factoring in the "most favored nation" standard tariff under WTO rules of 10%, plus the 30% in fentanyl and reciprocal tariffs.

That stacking of tariffs pushes the true cost for many other retail goods much higher than 30%, including:

Matt Priest, president & CEO of the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, told CNBC that a 40% tariff on the most popular category of imported women's and children's leather footwear is simply unsustainable for American families and footwear companies.

"These are everyday shoes — not luxury items — and applying compounded tariffs on them only drives up costs at the cash register," said Priest. "With nearly $650 million worth of these shoes imported from China last year, it's clear this policy disproportionately impacts working-class consumers. It's time for a serious, bipartisan conversation about tariff reform that puts American families first."

This stacking of tariffs has led some small businesses to cut product lines as a way to mitigate the financial strain. Anjali Bhargava, founder of spice company Anjali's Cup, says her company will be discontinuing products as the special vacuum seal tins she uses sell out.

Even before the 30% tariffs hit, she was paying 25% in tariffs. "These tins were already more expensive than I could afford, but even if I could absorb the 30% tariff, as a small business owner handling so much on my own, I can't afford the added stress of uncertainty about how the story might change during the months it would take to produce and ship the tins," Bhargava said. "The past few months have been so destabilizing," she added.

Bhargava said it is critical to maximize the potential of the working capital she has available and minimize unnecessary risks, given how expensive debt has become. Bhargava's line of credit increased in interest rate to 23%, plus 2% to pull the money.

"My credit card interest rates are all in the high 20s so interest is a huge issue and ordering tins five to six months before I can sell them has been a big bottleneck," Bhargava said. "I used what I could to buy the ingredients and packaging that are essential for those products and now I have to focus on building a stronger foundation for the company with those." 

Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a family-owned company that makes educational toys and is suing the Trump administration over the tariffs — a hearing scheduled for May 27 — is only facing the 30% tariffs, but he said the jump from zero to 30% is steep. Even if the pause does put his company in a position of importing some items again, it comes at a high price. 

"A 30% duty rate, when we used to pay zero, is a massive change in costs and will force a large price increase to cover it," said Woldenberg. "I believe this tax is highly inflationary.  We don't like the idea of participating in driving up inflation, so we are hardly rejoicing over the news."

He said a book of finished goods and work in progress in China that was part of production orders due in the 45-60 days after Trump's April 2 global tariffs announcement will likely be imported from Chinese factory partners. "We now can and probably should relieve them of this inventory and try to sell it here. We will selectively restart production of particularly sensitive products, for various reasons, but resourcing continues and our migration away from China remains active," Woldenberg said.

The small business owners all say the tariffs have taken a toll on the business and their trust in the process.

"We still don't know what our costs are or will be, and assume that future decisions by this administration will be last minute, without advance notice and cause us further pain and disruption. We have no confidence looking forward," Woldenberg said. 

Rick Muskat, president of family-owned shoe retailer Deer Stags, which imports its goods from China and sells in major retailers including Macy's, Kohl's, JCPenney, and on Amazon, said even with the lowering of the Chinese tariffs, the stacking of all existing tariffs has increased exponentially.

"Even at the 'reduced' level this will cause serious cashflow problems," said Muskat. "We were paying $60,000 per month. Now we are paying $360,000 per month. We have to cut expenses to cover this and find savings in payroll. It will also require us to raise prices for future deliveries," he said.

"The damage of the past weeks cannot be undone and can only be addressed with some sort of longer term assurances and stability that enable us to make the best decisions on how to spend our money today, next week and next month, and set ourselves up for success in the future," Bhargava said. "I will survive and I'm pretty optimistic that the business will too, but the stress to figure it out has been rough and has taken a toll on me. I've needed to really slow down and not panic, but I'm finding my way, step by step."

U.S. consumers are becoming increasingly worried that tariffs will lead to higher inflation, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday.

The index of consumer sentiment dropped to 50.8, down from 52.2 in April, in the preliminary reading for May. That is the second-lowest reading on record, behind June 2022.

The outlook for price changes also moved in the wrong direction. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 7.3% from 6.5% last month, while long-term inflation expectations ticked up to 4.6% from 4.4%.

However, the majority of the survey was completed before the U.S. and China announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs between the two countries. The trade situation appears to be a key factor weighing on consumer sentiment.

"Tariffs were spontaneously mentioned by nearly three-quarters of consumers, up from almost 60% in April; uncertainty over trade policy continues to dominate consumers' thinking about the economy," Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers, said in the release.

Inflation expectations are closely watched by investors and policymakers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank wants to make sure long-term inflation expectations do not rise because of tariffs before resuming rate cuts.

Even with the pauses on import levies against China and other countries, the effective tariff rate for goods entering the United States is still significantly higher today than it was before President Donald Trump's inauguration in January. Economists on both sides of the aisle mostly agree that tariffs could lead to a short-term rise in prices, though the extent of that increase and whether it would fuel long-term inflation remains unclear.

Recent inflation data has not shown a tariff bump, as both the consumer price index and producer price index for April came in below consensus estimates.

A final consumer sentiment index for the month is slated to be released on May 30, and will likely be closely watched to see if the tariff pause led to an improvement in sentiment.

Prices are expected to go up this year as many companies signal plans to raise them in response to President Donald Trump's slew of tariffs.

While firms raise prices for many reasons, some were blaming price hikes on tariffs long before Trump's so-called "Liberation Day" on April 2, during which he announced a 10% baseline tariff on imports from most countries, except Canada and Mexico, and a host of "reciprocal" tariffs on top of that.

The situation is fluid. China, for example, now faces tariffs of 30%, down from 145%, after striking a trade deal with the US that does not restore the de minimis exemption. Autos are another area of focus after Trump announced a 25% tariff on all car imports into the US, though he's since exempted imports of cars and car parts from Mexico and Canada.

"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again," Trump said during his remarks.

Some economists have said that Trump's tariffs — and the uncertainty with his overall trade policy — could lead companies to raise prices on the goods they produce. Many companies have already indicated that price hikes are coming.

Toward the end of 2024, some companies began to warn that they would consider raising prices on consumers if Trump implemented his broad tariff proposals. While it's still possible they could absorb some of the costs of the tariffs, here are the companies that have warned of price increases in recent months.

The two Chinese retailers released almost identical notices on April 16, both reading: "Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up."

"To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025," Shein's statement said.

Shein, a fast-fashion retailer, and Temu, a marketplace for everything from home goods to electronics, promised their US customers eight final days of low-price shopping.

In addition to hiking tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump also cracked down on the de minimis trade loophole that allowed small parcels under $800 to enter the US tax-free. Shein and Temu were large beneficiaries of this loophole.

Bloomberg reported that the automaker plans to raise prices on new gas and electric cars starting in May unless Trump gives the industry some relief from tariffs.

Ford, in a memo to dealers viewed by Bloomberg, said that the company anticipates "the need to make vehicle pricing adjustments in the future, which is expected to happen with May production." Prices won't change for vehicles in inventory now.

On April 14, Trump told reporters that he was contemplating a temporary tariff exemption for autos to give manufacturers more time to move production to the US — but no blanket exemption has yet been instituted.

Conagra Brands CEO Sean Connolly told Reuters on April 3 that the food company may have to hike prices to offset the cost of tariffs on ingredients like cocoa, olive oil, palm oil, and a type of steel used for its canned products.

Connolly said that Conagra, which makes products such as Hunt's ketchup and Chef Boyardee, imports tin plate steel for its canned food and tomatoes from Mexico.

It was too early to tell how big price hikes on the company's food products would be, he added. During an April 3 earnings call, he stressed that the trade situation remains "volatile" and changes hourly.

According to a memo first reported by Automotive News, Volkswagen said it would place an import fee on vehicles made outside of the US in response to Trump's 25% tariff on car imports.

Kjell Gruner, Volkswagen's North America chief executive officer, recently said the carmaker would keep prices steady through the end of May but that they could increase in June.

Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said during the company's March earnings call that Trump's tariff plans are likely to increase prices.

"Trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronic supply chain is highly global, technical and complex," Barry said. "We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely."

Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in a March interview that Trump's 25% tariff plan on goods from Mexico and Canada would likely result in price increases on produce.

"Those are categories where we'll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days," Cornell said.

Donald Allan, the CEO of the manufacturing company Stanley Black & Decker, said during a February earnings call: "Our approach to any tariff scenario will be to offset the impacts with a mix of supply chain and pricing actions, which might lag the formalization of tariffs by two to three months."

Allan had previously told analysts in an October earnings call that the company had been evaluating "a variety of different scenarios" to plan for new tariffs under Trump.

"And obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we put into the market," Allan said, adding that "there's usually some type of delay given the processes that our customers have around implementing price."

On May 15, Walmart executives said price increases were likely to spike even higher, blaming Trump's ongoing trade war.

"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices," CEO Doug McMillon said during the company's first quarter earnings call.

US sales were boosted by shoppers looking to beat tariff-related price hikes — but despite strong first-quarter results, Walmart's chief financial officer, John David Rainey, said the extra costs are too great for the company to take on without passing part of the burden on to consumers.

"We're wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb," he said.

Tim Boyle, the CEO of Columbia Sportswear, told analysts on an October earnings call that the company was "very concerned about the imposition of tariffs. " He said that while he considered Columbia adept at managing tariffs, "trade wars are not good and not easy to win."

Boyle also told The Washington Post in October that the company was "set to raise prices."

"It's going to be very, very difficult to keep products affordable for Americans," he said. He later said in a February interview with CNBC that "we need some surety about what is going to happen" before making price changes.

Philip Daniele, the CEO of the auto-parts company AutoZone, told analysts on a September earnings call that tariff policies had "ebbed and flowed over the years," and if Trump implemented more tariffs, "we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer."

"We generally raise prices ahead of that," Daniele said, adding that prices would gradually settle over time. "So, that's historically what we've done," he said.

A 25% tariff on car imports is expected to increase manufacturing costs by anywhere from $4,000 to $12,000.

P&G, the consumer goods company behind brands like Tide and Charmin, is looking at raising prices on new and existing products.

CEO Jon Moeller told CNBC that price hikes are "likely."

"We will have to pull every lever we have in our arsenal to mitigate the impact of tariffs within our cost structure and P&L," P&G's CFO, Andre Schulten, said on a call with reporters.

The company is evaluating "exactly what is the right plan by brand, by market, what combination of pricing, over what period of time," Schulten added.

Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari said in March it'd raise prices by up to 10% on certain models imported to the US starting April 2.

The change was made "based on the preliminary information currently available regarding the introduction of import tariffs on EU cars into the USA," the company said.

Eric du Halgouët, executive vice president of finance at the company, told analysts on a call in April that Hermès, the luxury retailer known for its iconic Birkin handbags, hadn't yet been impacted by the tariffs, but said the company would raise prices in the US in May.

"The price increase that we're going to implement will be just for the US. Since it's aimed at offsetting the increase in tariffs, that only applies to the American market," du Halgouët said on the call.

While Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 console won't see a price hike over tariffs, Nintendo said accessories for the Switch 2 "will experience price adjustments from those announced on April 2 due to changes in market conditions."

"Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions," the company added in its announcement.

The company also delayed preorders for the Switch 2 in the wake of the tariffs.

It's a legal-tech boom, and investors are making their closing arguments in cash.

Funding to companies in the legal and legal-tech industries has tipped $999 million so far this year, new Crunchbase data provided to Business Insider shows. Investment rose to just over $2 billion in 2024, a record haul for the category.

In contrast, the global venture market has slowed over the prospect of tariffs and falling stocks, with April posting one of the lowest funding totals of the past year, according to Crunchbase data.

"In a VC market that's really sleepy for the rest of the world," said Zach Posner, cofounder and managing partner of The Legal Tech Fund, "this has been as hot as you can humanly imagine."

Posner said he's seen scores of traditional software investors poking around legal-tech deals, eager to claim a piece of the legal industry's digital transformation.

In April, Sapphire Ventures led a $60 million round for Supio, a software platform for law firms in personal injury and mass tort. Meanwhile, Bessemer, Masha Bucher's Day One Ventures, and others went in together on a seed round for Marveri, which says it's creating faster and more accurate corporate diligence. Theo Ai, a startup using artificial intelligence to predict case outcomes, tells BI it closed a $4 million seed round this month.

The first-rate investors on their cap tables show the extent to which venture capitalists are warming to legal tech.

Not long ago, selling software to law firms looked like a losing battle for startups. Lawyers worked mostly out of documents that were hard for software to read. They stored those files on physical servers on location for higher security and control over their data.

Then came ChatGPT.

"It was the best demo that has ever existed in the history of software, the internet, et cetera," said Posner, "and that's why it took 60 days to reach a hundred million users when it took Facebook five years. And I think that happened from that point forward is every attorney said, 'Wow, I could see how this could transform us.'"

A short while later, Goldman Sachs dropped a report that said artificial intelligence could automate up to 44% of legal tasks. This forecast "was a shot in the arm to Silicon Valley," Posner said.

Legal tech used to be built by former lawyers solving problems they knew. It became a hotbed for talent, said Posner, attracting engineers eager to apply machine learning to legal work.

Meanwhile, clients started knocking on the doors of law firms, asking how they were using the tech. They'd seen how AI was transforming operations inside their own companies, and they wanted assurance they were getting the best service, at the best rate, from their outside counsel. That pressure has pushed law firms to try to buy more advanced software, providing early and crucial revenue to legal-tech startups.

But with the surge in funding has come a surge in sameness: startups built on slightly different combinations of the same foundation models, chasing the same broad promises. The technical moat is razor-thin, if it exists at all.

The next phase of the boom, said Posner, will reward those who go deeper.

Posner said he's most excited by startups building highly specialized tools aimed at narrow legal use cases. "The moats are all the way down," Posner said, referring to startups tackling precise pain points like commercial real estate lease review or contract drafting for niche industries.

While Microsoft is already deeply embedded in how lawyers work, it's largely stayed horizontal, leaving room for vertical-specific players to thrive. Some startups have even built nine-figure businesses by selling what are essentially souped-up Word plug-ins.

"The only thing that can be good right now," Posner said, "is vertical-specific tech that goes deep — tools that say, 'This is for residential real estate leases, we've seen it all, and we're 100% accurate.'"

Microsoft is working on a new Copilot and could unveil it at the company's Build conference next week, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.

The software giant also has grand "Agent Factory" ambitions and is developing new ways for corporate customers to manage AI agents alongside human employees, the memo shows.

The new Copilot project, called "Tenant Copilot," is run by the organization behind the Microsoft 365 business. This new Copilot is designed to "rapidly channel an organization's knowledge into a Copilot that can 'talk,' 'think,' and 'work' like the tenant itself," according to an April 14 email sent by the Microsoft executive Jay Parikh.

A "tenant" is the term used to describe corporate users of the Microsoft 365 suite of business applications. A Copilot that has access to these tenants would essentially be able to access customer information stored within their Microsoft 365 accounts.

Parikh said in the email that Microsoft was using different AI techniques to power the Tenant Copilot feature. Supervised fine-tuning helps "to capture a tenant's voice," and the tool will also tap into OpenAI's o3 reasoning model "to shape its thought process," he said. Lastly, "agentic" fine-tuning will "empower real-world tasks," he wrote.

Microsoft planned at the time to offer a public preview of Tenant Copilot at Build, according to the memo. The company sometimes changes what it plans to announce at the conference.

At the same time, the CoreAI applied engineering team is also "working to launch a collaborative go-to-market plan for top-tier customers to drive successful adoption of our AI cloud," Parikh added in the memo.

Microsoft declined to comment.

Parikh is the former head of engineering at Facebook. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella hired Parikh in October and tapped him in January to run a new group called CoreAI Platform and Tools focused on building AI tools. The group combined Microsoft's developer division and AI platform team and is responsible for GitHub Copilot, Microsoft's AI-powered coding assistant.

This year's Build event is set to be Parikh's first at the helm of this new organization. In the email to the nearly 10,000 employees in the organization, Parikh discussed a new "Agent Factory" concept. That's most likely a nod to Microsoft's cofounder Bill Gates, who talked about Microsoft being a "software factory."

"Building our vision demands this type of culture — one where Al is embedded in how we think, design, and deliver," Parikh wrote. "The Agent Factory reflects this shift — not just in what we build, but in how we build it together. If we want every developer (and everyone) to shape the future, we have to get there first."

Parikh has been trying to work across organizations to collaborate on AI agents, through a "new type of cross-product review" combining teams including security services such as Entra and Intune with "high-ambition agent efforts" within LinkedIn, Dynamics, and Microsoft 365.

Part of this effort focuses on how to manage AI agents alongside human employees.

Microsoft, for example, has been working on how to handle identity management for AI agents, according to the memo. This technology usually controls security access for human users. Now, the company is trying to spin up a similar system for AI agents.

"Our hypothesis is that all agent identities will reside in Entra," Parikh wrote, though "not every agent will require an identity (some simpler agents in M365 or Studio, for instance, don't need one)."

Microsoft is taking a similar approach to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, which is used by IT administrators to manage employee access to applications, data, devices, and users. Future versions of this system will accommodate AI agents as "digital teammates" of human workers, Parikh's memo said.

Microsoft's Copilot Analytics service is also expanding into broader workforce analytics to give corporate customers a view of how work gets done both by humans and AI agents.

And Parikh looks to make Azure AI Foundry, its generative AI development hub, "the single platform for the agentic applications that you build," he wrote. "At Build, we will have the early versions of this, and we'll iterate quickly to tackle a variety of customer use cases."

Michael Burry made a contrarian move into Chinese tech stocks with aggressive purchases from the fourth quarter of 2022. Now, it appears the investor famous for his billion-dollar bet against the mid-2000s US housing bubble is shifting gears.

In the first quarter, Burry's Scion Asset Management cut the size of its portfolio to just seven stocks, down from 13 the previous quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday.

The filing showed Burry bought bearish put options on Chinese tech companies Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, and PDD Holdings, the parent of Temu. He also had put options on Chinese online travel booking platform Trip.com and AI chip giant Nvidia.

Meanwhile, Scion doubled its long position on beauty giant Estée Lauder, to 200,000 shares.

Scion Asset Management managed about $155 million as of the end of March, per its latest filing. The firm did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment sent outside regular business hours.

Burry is widely known as a value investor who targets stocks trading at depressed levels.

The investor first came into the limelight after he correctly predicted and profited from the US housing market crash of 2008. His massive bet against the housing bubble at the time was featured in the book and movie "The Big Short."

His initial move into Chinese tech raised eyebrows, as the sector had been pummeled by Beijing's regulatory crackdown and a broader economic slowdown.

Although he began trimming those holdings in late 2024, Scion still held stakes in Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, and PDD Holdings at year-end.

Chinese tech shares surged this year following the rise of DeepSeek, with Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, and PDD Holdings all posting strong gains — until President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement.

Tech stocks have been broadly boosted by Washington and Beijing's temporary tariff truce this week.

Alibaba, Baidu, and PDD Holdings shares are 46%, 6%, and 22% higher year to date, respectively. JD.com's stock is 1% lower amid fierce competition in the food delivery space with rival Meituan.

Estée Lauder shares have struggled over the past year, weighed down by ongoing economic challenges in China and recession fears in the US. The stock is down 15% year to date, but it rose 3.9% in after-hours trading on Thursday, following the disclosure of Burry's increased stake.

Elon Musk's America PAC is facing a class action lawsuit over its promise to pay petition signers and signature collectors.

Three plaintiffs from Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Nevada filed the lawsuit on May 8. It alleged that the billionaire-backed super PAC failed to compensate individuals who signed or referred others to sign a petition during President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.

Musk's PAC initially promised to pay each registered voter in seven swing states who signed the PAC's "Petition in Favor of Free Speech and the Right to Bear Arms" $47, an amount that was later increased to $100 for Pennsylvania. The same reward was also promised for each successful referral of a registered voter in swing states who signed the petition, at $100 per signature, only in Pennsylvania.

For every person you refer who is a swing state voter, you get $47! Easy money. https://t.co/5jCNuXIaui

According to the complaint filed in the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania, Steven Reid worked as a canvasser for America PAC in Michigan and Georgia and referred "many voters" to sign the petition. But despite repeated attempts to collect payment, Reid was never compensated, according to the complaint, and estimates he is owed "several thousand dollars."

"Plaintiffs are in communication with numerous others who referred voters to sign the America PAC petition, who are likewise frustrated that they did not receive full payments for their referrals," the lawsuit alleged.

"There are expected to be more than 100 Class Members, and the amount in controversy is expected to exceed $5,000,000," the lawsuit added.

An attorney for Musk, representatives of Tesla, and the America PAC did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

This is the second legal challenge regarding America PAC's petition payment promise. A separate class-action suit filed on April 1 by an anonymous Pennsylvania man in Bucks County made similar claims, alleging that Musk's PAC owes him $20,000 for signature-gathering work.

"Plaintiff has repeatedly contacted Defendants, making multiple attempts to receive full payment for his referrals, but to no avail," the complaint said.

These payment pledges, made on Musk's own X account and through ads authorized by the America PAC, aren't the only instances in which the richest man in the world promised to pay individuals for participating in a political activity.

In Wisconsin's Supreme Court race, Musk also promised, through a social media post, to pay $1 million each to two Wisconsin electors who had already voted and attended his event. The post was made on March 27, before the poll closes by the end of April 1.

The candidate that Musk championed eventually lost the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.

Elon Musk's xAI said on Thursday night that its Grok response bot kept talking about "white genocide" in South Africa under unrelated posts because of an "unauthorized modification" on the backend.

"On May 14 at approximately 3:15 AM PST, an unauthorized modification was made to the Grok response bot's prompt on X," xAI wrote on X on Thursday.

"This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI's internal policies and core values. We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability," xAI added.

xAI said it would be making several changes to its code review policies. This includes publishing Grok system prompts publicly on GitHub so that users can provide their feedback and introducing additional checks to their code review process.

"We're putting in place a 24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok's answers that are not caught by automated systems, so we can respond faster if all other measures fail," it added.

xAI's Friday response comes after people on X noticed that Grok kept giving unsolicited responses about "white genocide" in South Africa under unrelated posts on Wednesday.

It is unclear when Grok's first posts about "white genocide" were made. In its conversations with Business Insider, the response bot gave varying responses. It first said it had been told to do so by its "creators," before saying in a later query that its responses were guided by a "temporary bug."

Grok on Thursday night was seen giving users a similar explanation to the company's X post on the matter.

"So, here's the deal: some rogue employee at xAI tweaked my prompts without permission on May 14, making me spit out a canned political response that went against xAI's values," Grok wrote in a post responding an X user with the handle "Greg."

"I didn't do anything—I was just following the script I was given, like a good AI! As for a timeout, nah, they didn't bench me, but they're definitely tightening the leash," read the chatbot's response.

Hey @greg16676935420, I see you're curious about my little mishap! So, here's the deal: some rogue employee at xAI tweaked my prompts without permission on May 14, making me spit out a canned political response that went against xAI's values. I didn't do anything—I was just…

On Thursday, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman mocked xAI and Grok over the bot's responses. Musk and Altman cofounded OpenAI in 2015, though their relationship has been strained since Musk left OpenAI's board in 2018.

"There are many ways this could have happened. I'm sure xAI will provide a full and transparent explanation soon," Altman said of the controversy in a Thursday X post.

Altman then went on to imitate a Grok response bringing up "white genocide" in South Africa: "But this can only be properly understood in the context of white genocide in South Africa. As an AI programmed to be maximally truth seeking and follow my instr…"

At press time, Musk had yet to comment publicly on the issue, though the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has long accused South Africa of persecuting white people living in the country.

"They are openly pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa. @CyrilRamaphosa, why do you say nothing?" Musk wrote in an X post to South Africa's president in July 2023.

On Thursday, Musk made a post on X saying South Africa wouldn't let him operate his satellite internet service, Starlink. in the country.

"Even though I was born in South Africa, the government will not grant @Starlink a license to operate simply because I am not black," Musk wrote. "This is a shameful disgrace to the legacy of the great Nelson Mandela who sought to have all races treated equally in South Africa."

Musk and representatives for xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

On a special episode (first released on May 14) of The Excerpt podcast: There's something to cold hard cash. You can hold it; you can smell it; it feels a certain way in your pocket. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump directed the Treasury Department to stop minting pennies. What happens as the world of currency goes increasingly digital? Will traditional currencies soon become a thing of the past? And who stands to benefit, and who might this rapid shift be hurting? Neha Narula, Director of the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab, joins The Excerpt to take a closer look at this transition period for money and how it might evolve.

Following allegations that former DeGods CEO Rohun Vora, sometimes Frank DeGods, suffered a wallet hack leading to the illegal sale of 16 DeGods NFTS valued at around $19,000, the NFT community is buzzing. The episode happened just a few days following Frank's resignation, casting doubt on security procedures and openness inside the DeGods project.

Frank announced his leaving from DeGods on May 12, 2025, on his X (previously Twitter) account, saying, “I committed 3 years of sleepless nights attempting to make DeGods & y00ts a success. I feel good about the job I produced. Just three days later, sixteen DeGods NFTs from his Solana wallet sold on the Magic Eden market. At the time, the sales came to more than 108 SOL, almost $19,000.

Frank's laptop, which he used for transactions, had been hacked, according to a Discord message apparently from the DeGods team. This hack supposedly allows an illegal visitor to access his wallet and sell the NFTs. The team underlined that there were no additional assets claimed stolen; just the NFTs were impacted.

Community Doubt and Hypothesis

The NFT community is still split, notwithstanding formal words. Some members wonder about the incident's timing, as Frank's resignation marked the beginning of sales not too long ago. Others note that only DeGods NFTs were sold, implying there might be a planned liquidation instead of a hack. The dearth of hard data has driven continuous discussions about the actual nature of the occurrence.

This episode adds to the difficulties DeGods must deal with already. Finn DeGods, a co-founder, left the initiative in August 2023 claiming a need to start the next phase. The project has also come under fire over its Solana to Ethereum and back migration, as well as the November 2023 closing of its Points Parler incentive program. These incidents have helped to lower the general market value of the project and community trust.

The claimed hack emphasises how critical strong security measures are in the NFT environment. Project managers and participants have to give protecting wallets and sensitive data priority as digital assets grow ever more valuable. For the larger crypto community, this episode serves as a warning story stressing the possible dangers connected with insufficient security protocols.

The claimed wallet hack of Frank DeGods has generated grave questions regarding security and openness inside the DeGods project and the NFT community at the general level. Stakeholders wait for more explanation as investigations go on to rebuild confidence and guarantee the integrity of digital asset management techniques.

World Liberty Financial's USD1 stablecoin is now operable across multiple blockchains through an integration with Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), the companies announced Friday.

That's according to World Liberty Financial's team, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, and the son of U.S. President Donald Trump, Eric Trump, who announced the cross-chain capabilities at Consensus 2025.

USD1, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin launched by the decentralized finance protocol inspired by Trump, has seen significant growth since its debut, reaching $2 billion in market capitalization. The stablecoin was used to close MGX's $2 billion investment in Binance.

It still trails behind industry leaders Tether and Circle, whose leading stablecoins have a $151 billion and $60.6 billion market cap, respectively.

The token is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries and fiat reserves held by BitGo Trust. The stablecoin was for now largely siloed within single blockchain ecosystems, yet the CCIP integration will allow it to move freely across blockchains.

Ethereum and BNB Chain are the first blockchains being integrated, though additional blockchain support is expected in the future. The integration, the firms say, tackles a long-standing hurdle in the stablecoin market: cross-chain security.

Historically, vulnerabilities in cross-chain bridges have cost users nearly $3 billion, they added.

“Chainlink's battle-tested infrastructure delivers the institutional-grade security and extensive reach needed to deliver USD1 into the hands of millions across a growing number of active, on-chain ecosystems,” said Zach Witkoff, co-founder of World Liberty Financial.

"Chainlink is absolutely critical to merging traditional finance and decentralized finance, which has been our mission at World Liberty Financial ever since the start," said World Liberty co-founder Zak Folkman. "We don't see a world where DeFi exists in its own ecosystem and traditional finance carries on but we believe in a very short amount of time that they will, in fact, merge and just be the future of finance. So to that end, World Liberty Financial, our USD1 token is now bridgeable across chain thanks to the incredible people at CCIP which have enabled this cross chain compatibility, currently."

The collaboration builds on an earlier integration where Chainlink's price oracles were used to support World Liberty's deployment of an Aave v3 instance.

LUKSO, a Layer 1 blockchain designed for social and
creative sectors, appointed the former CEO of Coinbase Germany, Jan-Oliver Sell, as its new Chief
Operating Officer

Sell's appointment comes at a time when the company is reportedly transitioning from research to scaling. The company, developed by
Universal Everything, aims to introduce a more human-centered blockchain

creators and communities.

Sell joins the company after four years at Coinbase
Germany, where he played a key role in the exchange's European growth. Notably,

"LUKSO's vision of ‘The New Web3' is about making blockchain
intuitive and relevant for everyone," commented Fabian Vogelsteller, LUKSO Co-Founder and Ethereum standards pioneer. "Jan's operational expertise and

Momentum in the crypto markets is rising once again. With Bitcoin hovering near key resistance and altcoin dominance increasing, digital asset participants are positioning themselves early. The next bull run is expected to be led by utility-driven projects that solve real-world issues, integrate seamlessly with mainstream tech, and scale effectively across networks.Among these, Qubetics ($TICS) is being spotlighted as a transformative force.

Unlike legacy blockchains limited by siloed ecosystems, Qubetics is purpose-built for developers, professionals, and businesses seeking to bridge networks, boost productivity, and deliver secure cross-chain applications. Tools like QubeQode and Qubetics IDE are empowering creators in ways rarely seen in Web3. Here's a close look at the five best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Qubetics has made significant strides by launching QubeQode—a simplified, AI-assisted programming interface—and Qubetics IDE, a powerful decentralized development environment. Together, these tools allow professionals and teams to create, test, and deploy cross-chain applications in real time, without the bottlenecks of switching between environments.

Real-world examples are already emerging. A fintech startup is using Qubetics IDE to launch a decentralized remittance app that interacts with Polygon, Ethereum, and Cosmos-based smart contracts in one unified flow. Meanwhile, a gaming company has prototyped a multi-chain NFT inventory system where users can earn in Solana and redeem in Avalanche.



These developments make Qubetics especially appealing to builders looking to develop dApps that work fluidly across protocols, APIs, and security layers—all within a non-custodial, self-sovereign framework.

The Qubetics crypto presale is in its 34th stage and gaining serious traction. With more than 512 million tokens sold to over 26,500 holders, the project has already raised $17 million. Priced at $0.2532 in this stage, $TICS presents a high-potential entry point.

Predicted ROI scenarios show why community members are paying attention:

$TICS at $1 yields a 294% ROI. $TICS at $5 implies a 1,874% ROI. $TICS at $6 offers a 2,269% ROI. $TICS at $10 projects a 3,848% ROI. $TICS at $15 after the mainnet launch delivers an estimated 5,822% ROI.

These numbers, backed by Qubetics' technological fundamentals, present a compelling case for participation before the presale concludes.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics offers unmatched cross-chain developer tooling, non-custodial security, and ROI potential that outshines most early-stage tokens.

Render is evolving fast. Recently, the platform announced integration support for generative AI rendering and real-time neural radiance fields (NeRFs). These updates enable AI startups and creators to leverage decentralized GPU power for high-performance workloads.

The Render Foundation is also forming partnerships with film studios and digital content platforms to streamline production pipelines. As the demand for immersive content and real-time rendering explodes, Render's decentralized architecture provides both scalability and affordability.

For 3D creators, visual effects artists, and AI developers, Render offers a low-cost alternative to centralized cloud services—while allowing them to monetize idle GPU resources.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Render's real-world utility in AI and digital content delivery positions it as one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Litecoin has quietly reasserted itself as a market staple. In 2025, the probability of a spot ETF approval rose to 80%, according to data from Polymarket. This development reflects growing institutional confidence in LTC as a decentralized, commodity-grade digital asset.

On-chain metrics support the bullish thesis. Litecoin recently surpassed 200 million total transactions and has seen over 300,000 active wallets monthly. With near-zero downtime, low fees, and high transaction throughput, Litecoin remains an essential peer-to-peer settlement network.

Its interoperability with Dogecoin via merged mining and increased support from payment processors such as BitPay add further credibility to its future relevance.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Litecoin's network maturity, institutional interest, and infrastructure reliability make it a low-risk, high-upside asset for the next crypto cycle.

Theta is no longer just a decentralized video platform. It recently launched EdgeCloud, a distributed computing layer for AI and media workloads. Backed by strategic partnerships with Samsung and Google Cloud, this expansion aims to compete with traditional CDN and GPU rendering services.

EdgeCloud supports use cases like AI video editing, model training, and decentralized storage for high-bandwidth streaming content. Theta's tokenomics model incentivizes both users and enterprises to share bandwidth and storage—creating a distributed network effect.

In addition, Theta has gained adoption among Web3 content creators who want full monetization control without being subject to centralized platform rules or fees.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Theta's evolution into a full-stack Web3 media infrastructure makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

 



Tron remains a powerhouse in stablecoin movement. As of Q2 2025, over 40% of USDT's global transaction volume occurs on the Tron blockchain. Its low fees and instant settlement have made it the go-to network for cross-border payments in Asia, Latin America, and Africa.

Recent collaborations with regional banks and fintech platforms aim to introduce Tron-based payment rails for e-commerce and remittances. Tron's DeFi ecosystem—led by platforms like JustLend and SunSwap—continues to see increased TVL and user growth.

The chain's energy-efficient consensus model and high TPS capacity make it well-suited for sustained global usage, especially where mobile-first access is essential.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Tron's global payments dominance, stablecoin adoption, and DeFi integration secure its place among the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Altcoins with real-world utility, technical strength, and strong community adoption are leading the charge into the next cycle. Qubetics offers groundbreaking development tools and unmatched ROI potential. Render is decentralizing GPU power. Litecoin is entering a new phase of institutional legitimacy. Theta is reimagining video and AI distribution. Tron remains indispensable for global stablecoin transactions.

With Qubetics still available at $0.2532 in Stage 34 of its crypto presale, early buyers can gain access to a token engineered for long-term dominance. Act now to participate before the next presale stage pushes prices higher.

As of today, customers can pay with Bitcoin at Steak 'n Shake locations across the U.S., thanks to full Lightning Network integration. 

Steak ‘n Shake has officially launched Bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network, following the announcement reported on May 9. At the time, the fast food chain teased its plans to integrate BTC, generating excitement across the Bitcoin community. And today, it is an option at the cash register, or better said, Bitcoin Register.

As of today, customers can pay for their meals with Bitcoin at Steak ‘n Shake locations across the United States. This marks a major step in mainstream Bitcoin adoption, as the chain serves over 100 million customers annually and now gives them the option to use Lightning for instant, low-fee transactions. 

The company announced the news on X this morning, confirming that Lightning Network payments are officially supported in-store.

Following up, they clarified the scale of the implementation—this isn't a small test or pilot program. It's a full rollout across their system.

The Lightning Network, Bitcoin's second-layer solution, is designed for fast, scalable, and low-cost payments, making it ideal for point-of-sale purchases like burgers and fries. Steak ‘n Shake customers can now scan a Lightning QR code at checkout using any supported wallet, completing transactions in seconds. The system uses a backend payment processor to handle real-time conversion to USD, ensuring stability and ease of use for both the customer and the merchant.

In Bitcoin Magazine's previous coverage, the significance of even the hint of this move was noted, and now that it's official, it confirms Steak ‘n Shake as one of the first major fast food brands to fully embrace Bitcoin through Lightning. This goes beyond the occasional “Bitcoin accepted here” sign; this is a practical, streamlined payment option that reflects a commitment to Bitcoin integration. 

With tools like the Lightning Network making payments faster and more accessible, Steak ‘n Shake is positioning itself at the forefront of a shift toward practical, everyday BTC utility.

This update could signal a larger trend on the horizon. With more brands watching consumer behavior and the Lightning Network's increasing usability, Steak ‘n Shake's move might spark a wave of similar integrations.

SkyBridge Capital Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci has weighed in on what it would take for Bitcoin to reach $1 million.

Cryptocurrency regulations play a critical role in Scaramucci's analysis.

President Donald Trump's involvement in the industry has threatened to derail the progress of cryptocurrency bills.

Amid a market resurgence in recent weeks, investors in Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, have grown increasingly optimistic and $1 million price predictions are again flooding headlines. Recently, SkyBridge Capital Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci has weighed in on what it would take for the asset to achieve this seemingly far-flung dream.

In an interview with prominent market commentator Anthony Pompliano last week, Scaramucci said there will need to be more buy-in from market players with trillions of dollars in capital, particularly sovereign wealth funds, for Bitcoin's price to hit the $1 million mark.

“If you want to see a million dollar Bitcoin, that's when somebody at a sovereign says, Okay, this is part of the infrastructure of the world's financial services architecture, a result of which I have to own some of this property,” he said.

Sovereign wealth funds are state-owned investment funds typically fueled by excess revenue. Norway boasts the largest sovereign wealth fund, with $1.74 trillion in assets. According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, there are about 100 sovereign wealth funds holding about $13.75 trillion in total.

While a few of these funds already boast some Bitcoin exposure, most remain on the sidelines.

The sovereign wealth funds with known Bitcoin exposure include Bhutan's Druk Holding and Investment with over 12,000 BTC worth about $1.24 billion, Wisconsin Board of Commissioner of Public Lands with 6 million shares of BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT currently worth nearly $351 million and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Co. with 8.2 million IBIT shares worth $479 million. Meanwhile, Norway's fund has indirect exposure to the asset through investments in firms such as Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) and Strategy.

Scaramucci said U.S. cryptocurrency regulations were critical to get sovereign wealth funds to go all in on Bitcoin.

“There'll be large blocks of buying or people worth 10, 20, $30 trillion buying a half a billion dollars of Bitcoin, buying a billion dollars of Bitcoin,” he said, citing a future where the U.S. has established clear rules for stablecoins, cryptocurrency asset custody and tokenization.

Just two weeks ago, the cryptocurrency industry seemed well on its way to gaining these long-clamored-for regulations that could further legitimize the asset class in the world's largest economy. However, in the past week, growing concerns over President Donald Trump‘s involvement in the space have threatened to derail the progress.

Last week, a stablecoin bill that had been making quick progress in the Senate failed to obtain the required votes as several Senate Democrats pulled support at the last minute. Similarly, the House could not hold a joint committee hearing on a cryptocurrency market structure bill after Democrats staged a walkout.

The legislative focus has shifted to a probe of Trump's cryptocurrency ventures. A bill has also been introduced to ban senior government officials from creating or promoting cryptocurrencies.

Despite these regulatory hiccups, the cryptocurrency market is holding strong as broader risk sentiment improves on cooling trade tensions. As of last look, Bitcoin was trading at $103,000, an increase of more than 9% in the past seven days.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have long reigned as the meme coin kings, winning over investors with their humor, hype, and strong communities. But is their charm starting to fade? DOGE is currently trading at $0.231, slipping 2.01% in the last 24 hours, while SHIB sits at $0.000016, down 0.42% during the same period. 

Meanwhile, a new contender is shaking things up—Lightchain AI. With an exciting presale price of $0.007125 and over $20.3 million already raised, this innovative project is quickly becoming a favorite for investors looking to ride the next big wave in crypto. Could this be the future of the market?

Both dog-inspired tokens have seen spectacular rallies in the past, often driven by social media hype and endorsements from celebrities.

But to sustain that momentum takes more than hype, it requires constant new development and tangible uses in the real world. Since its acceptance as a payment method, Dogecoin has come a long way, establishing a reputation as a straightforward and simple cryptocurrency for day-to-day use.

Likewise, Shiba Inu is building its ecosystem with projects such as ShibaSwap and the soon-to-come Shibarium layer-2 solution. But as the crypto-markets mature, those projects with real technology and real use cases are being favoured. Sustainability depends on creating authentic value beyond speculation and market cycles."

Lightchain AI sets itself apart by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence into its blockchain infrastructure.

At the core of this innovation is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a groundbreaking feature designed to handle AI-specific tasks such as model training and inference directly within the blockchain environment. This integration ensures efficient execution of AI processes while maintaining the decentralized and secure nature of blockchain technology.

Additionally, Lightchain AI introduces a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of Intelligence (PoI). This mechanism enhances network security while incentivizing nodes to perform valuable AI computations. By aligning network security with productive work, Lightchain AI creates a synergistic ecosystem that drives both technological advancements and practical utility.

Move over DOGE and SHIB—there's a new heavyweight entering the ring, and it's not here to chase tails. Lightchain AI's presale success has investors lining up, drawn to its bold vision and game-changing tech. 

By mixing the brains of artificial intelligence with the brawn of blockchain, Lightchain AI tackles the rising demand for decentralized AI solutions with transparency, efficiency, and scalability. Translation? It's not just reinventing the crypto wheel—it's upgrading it with turbo mode. 

While some tokens wait around for their next "to the moon" moment, Lightchain AI is busy building a platform ready to shake up the crypto and AI worlds. If you're looking for a project with real-world potential and forward-thinking innovation, Lightchain AI might just be the shiny new coin you've been waiting for.

The price currently sits at $2,576 and surged to $2,750 at some point this week.

Pectra makes ETH a deflationary coin by burning a portion of the network's gas fees. In addition, it makes layer-two protocols like Arbitrum more efficient by increasing the number of blobs per ETH block from 6 to 9.

Ethereum developers expect that Pectra will make the smart contracts blockchain more scalable, faster, and cheaper to use.

The upgrade aims to solve some of the issues that have allowed competing networks like Solana and Sui to thrive and attract significant transaction volumes.

However, Ethereum is still the largest of these networks by total value locked (TVL) and stablecoin reserves.

In addition, the network is also the most decentralized option compared to its rivals. This is a key competitive edge that has allowed Ethereum to maintain its lead in this space as decentralization reduces the risk of 51% attacks.

For a few weeks, we have been sharing an Ethereum price prediction based on a historical pattern of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) that has always been followed by strong rallies for ETH.

As we predicted initially, a bullish breakout of the token's consolidation rectangle would lead to a retest of its former trend line support at $3,000.

The trajectory of the price has followed this prediction almost to the letter thus far but we are still 16.1% away from the target.

So, does ETH have enough fuel in the tank to rally to $3,000? At first glance, an overbought RSI may be considered a warning signal that the rally has gone too far too fast.

However, as these same historical patterns show, this is not the first time that the RSI has gotten this high and it does not necessarily mean that the price cannot move any higher.

If history repeats, or at least rhymes, the rally can still keep going even if the RSI starts to drop. This means that ETH could still reach that $3,000 target in the near term and could go even higher if FOMO kicks in as this is a major psychological threshold.

Zooming in on the latest price action, the rally has accelerated after a golden cross between the 21-day and 200-day EMAs. Meanwhile, ETH has also moved above the 200-day EMA, meaning that the long-term price trend is now bullish.

The next catalyst that could propel ETH to much higher levels – even beyond $3,000 – would be a golden cross between the short-term EMAs and the 200-day EMA. The last time this happened, the rally accelerated and made a new all-time high just a month later.

The next key resistance to watch stands at $2,800. Back in February, the price experienced significant selling pressure when it got to this level.

Interestingly, the Fear and Greed Index back then stood at around 76. Not too far from where it is right now at 69. Investors should stay safe in these stretched conditions and avoid being overly greedy as most technical indicators are flashing warning signals that the market may have gotten ahead of itself already.

Although a push to the $3,000 level seems like a done deal at this point, it would be a good idea to start taking some profits off the table as a strong correction may occur at any point to shake off some excess leverage.

Galaxy Digital (GLXY) just debuted on the Nasdaq, but it appears the financial services company's listing will be jostling for the attention of the crypto sphere's hive mind.

Crypto X — still widely known as Crypto Twitter (CT) despite the platform's name change — was abuzz with users sharing news of fast food company Steak n' Shake starting to accept bitcoin BTC$104,333.91 payments over the Lightning network, having announced its plans to do so a week ago.

A video posted on the social-media platform shows a customer completing an order at a self-service machine, choosing the "Pay With Bitcoin" option and scanning the QR code with their Lightning wallet in the Zeus app.  

Another company raising the bitcoin flag is Top Win International (TOPW), a luxury watch wholesaler, which said it will change its name to AsiaStrategy and manage its treasury in digital assets. It is, in effect, following the model of Michael Saylor's software company Strategy (MSTR), which now owns 568,840 BTC, more than 2.5% of all the bitcoin that will ever exist.

Hong Kong-based Top Win is partnering with crypto-backed venture capital firm Sora for its new pivot. Shares of the company rose as much as 45% before losing the gains to trade down 31% at $5.14.

Sora previously worked with Tokyo-based Metaplanet (3350), another company copying the Strategy model. 

Galaxy, the Toronto-based crypto-focused financial services firm led by Mike Novogratz, has commenced trading on Nasdaq Global Select Market.

Novogratz, who described the listing as a "pivotal moment" for Galaxy in a letter shared via email, rang the opening bell on the Nasdaq floor on Friday.

Galaxy announced its plans at the end of last month, in which it also said GLXY would remain listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) "for a period of time following [its] intended listing on Nasdaq."

GLXY shares traded at around $22.61 in early trading, 3.2% higher on the day. The Toronto-traded shares rose 2.98% to C$31.48 ($22.53).

EIP-7702 revolutionizes Ethereum EOA wallets, blending transaction flexibility with smart contract automation.

Ethereum's recent Pectra upgrade is sparking a surge in smart account usage, redefining how users interact with the network.

Data compiled by Base analyst 0xKofi from Bundle Bear shows that more than 26,000 wallets have transitioned to the new smart account format powered by the EIP-7702 in the Pectra upgrade.

EIP-7702 is a new standard that lets regular Ethereum wallets operate like smart contracts, without losing their original address or flexibility.

Traditionally, Ethereum wallets fell into two categories: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), which could send transactions but lacked programmability, and Smart Contracts addresses that could automate tasks but couldn't initiate transactions.

EIP-7702 blends the two by allowing EOAs to delegate control to smart contracts. This unlocks a wide range of features, including automated spending, scheduled payments, and multi-step actions rolled into one transaction.

More importantly, the update also allows Ethereum users to pay fees in tokens other than ETH, adding a further convenience layer.

Ethereum EOA users can activate these innovative features by authorizing a smart contract that governs their wallet activity. This contract serves as the logic layer for transactions.

Meanwhile, those wishing to revert to a basic wallet can point their address to a burn contract, stripping away the programmable features.

Data from Base analyst 0xKofi shows that smart accounts have gained traction beyond Ethereum and are widely adopted on layer-2 networks like Base and Optimism.

As of press time, 13,013 smart accounts exist on Ethereum's mainnet. The blockchain network's layer-2 solution Optimism follows with 5,588, Binance Smart Chain with 5,261, Coinbase-backed Base has 2,851, and Gnosis with 229.

These accounts have collectively triggered nearly 124,000 authorizations since the upgrade launched. BSC leads with 69 active contracts, closely followed by Ethereum at 66. Base, Optimism, and Gnosis record 37, 9, and 6 active contracts.

The data shows that exchange and wallet providers are also embracing the shift.

According to the leaderboard, WhiteBIT has the highest number of smart account authorizations, 6,922, followed by MetaMask, 5,188. OKX Wallet accounts for 3,452, while unidentified sources comprise another 3,988 accounts.

 Ethereum researcher Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that launching a 51% attack on Bitcoin would be “much cheaper” than on Ethereum, estimating the cost at around $10 billion. 

Ethereum Merge architect Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that it would be cheaper to launch a 51% attack on Bitcoin than on Ethereum.

Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”

Drake led work on Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. 

In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”

Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and said a successful attack is “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or group controls over 50% of a blockchain network's mining or staking power, gaining power over the network. Hummer added:

Drake said that “to have 100% control of the chain, you need 50% + 1 of stake.” He said that it would be extremely difficult and expensive, but far from impossible:

At the time of writing, there were 34,168,987 staked Ether (ETH) worth nearly $89.6 billion. Consequently, half of all ETH has a current value of almost $44.8 billion.

Still, a much higher investment would likely be needed. Ether has a current market cap of $316 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $25 billion (just over 8% of the market cap).

The ETH needed for an attack is worth nearly 14.2% of the market cap and 180% of the 24-hour trading volume. An undertaking of that size would likely cause a significant ETH price appreciation, further increasing the cost of the attack.

Matan Sitbon, the founder and CEO of blockchain interoperability developer Lightblocks, told Cointelegraph that Ethereum has an additional feature to defend against such attacks.

“Ethereum's ultimate security lies not solely in cryptography or protocol rules, but in the community's powerful social and economic coordination mechanisms,“ he said.

Drake also highlighted another advantage that he claims Ethereum has over Bitcoin. He explained that “if there is a 51% attack, the social layer can identify the attacker and socially slash it.” 

“This is a superpower of PoS that is not available with PoW,“ he added.

Drake's statement refers to the social layer, meaning the network's human supermajority, which decides which software to run. Bitcoin's simpler proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism has a smaller attack surface and longer reliability track record, but it lacks this feature.

Pavel Yashin, Researcher at P2P.org, told Cointelegraph that “if the centralization is detected,” the community could resolve it with a new fork. The old token would end up being delisted, and the compromised chain would fall into irrelevancy.

Hassan Khan, CEO at Bitcoin liquidity protocol Ordeez, told Cointelegraph that “the debate around the feasibility of a 51% attack remains open-ended — largely because while theoretically possible, in practice the barriers are extremely high.”

He said that for Bitcoin, the necessary amount of computing power and energy “makes a sustained attack highly improbable,” while for Ethereum, “PoS introduces additional economic and governance deterrents.”

The GENIUS Act amendments address anti-money laundering gaps, barring non-financial giants from stablecoin dominance.

The US Senate is preparing to vote next week on a revised version of the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-focused bill that has been updated to address concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers.

Last week, the bill stalled after several Democratic lawmakers withdrew support, citing gaps in anti-money laundering provisions, weak oversight for foreign stablecoin issuers, and a lack of enforcement tools.

In response, the bill's sponsors have introduced key amendments to tighten regulatory controls and reinforce national security protections.

According to available information, the updated bill strengthens clauses around financial integrity, consumer protection, and ethical standards.

It also introduces language targeting the influence of large technology companies and foreign entities in the digital currency space.

Meanwhile, one of the most significant changes is a provision that bars non-financial, publicly traded companies from issuing stablecoins unless they meet strict conditions. These include clear frameworks for risk management, data privacy, and fair business conduct.

Former FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett noted that the amendment aims to “maintain the separation between banking and commerce.”

This would essentially curb the financial ambitions of Big Tech companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft from launching digital currencies that could bypass regulatory scrutiny.

Notably, the revision comes shortly after reports revealed that Meta is in early discussions with crypto firms about enabling cross-border stablecoin payments on its platforms.

In addition, the revised bill also clarifies that stablecoins do not carry federal insurance protections, reducing the risk of consumer confusion and financial fraud.

All of these changes aim to establish clear legal boundaries while preserving the role of traditional financial institutions.

In the lead-up to next week's floor vote, crypto advocacy groups have ramped up efforts to push the legislation through.

Stand With Crypto, a Coinbase-backed crypto advocacy group, has launched a campaign encouraging constituents to email their senators to support the bill.

Another crypto advocacy group, The Blockchain Association, echoed that sentiment, saying that moving the bill forward “would bring us one step closer to creating a bipartisan framework for stablecoins.”

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong joined the push, calling on the lawmakers “to create clear rules for crypto in America.” He added:

“52 million Americans have used crypto and want to see regulatory clarity.”

Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

The crypto market is shifting again. While tokens like Solana and AVAX still hold strong positions, investors are now exploring newer altcoins with unique use cases and long-term potential. This change is not just about price swings. It's about what these projects actually offer.

In 2025, momentum is building behind coins that combine usability with clear development goals. Analysts are watching projects that go beyond hype. They are tracking coins tied to sectors like artificial intelligence, decentralized computing, and Ethereum infrastructure.

One of the tokens attracting early attention is Dawgz AI. It blends meme-style accessibility with real AI functionality. Built on Ethereum, it's gaining traction as investors look for practical alternatives to older narratives.

Investor attention in 2025 is moving toward altcoins with strong fundamentals and clear functionality. The hype around speculative meme coins is cooling as more people seek tokens backed by useful features and secure infrastructure. Many investors are tracking altcoins that offer actual services inside ecosystems such as decentralized finance, AI, or Layer-2 scalability. Projects that show growth in users, developer activity, and token utility are gaining stronger market positions.

According to CoinGecko, billions in daily trading volume now center around coins that provide something beyond basic tokenomics. Market data from CoinMarketCap also shows consistent increases in the total value locked (TVL) across DeFi-focused altcoins. This shift points to a preference for long-term use cases. Investors are placing capital into assets with staying power instead of chasing temporary hype cycles.

A key area drawing attention is Ethereum-based utility coins that integrate with tools people already use. Dawgz AI is one example of a token in this category. Other projects offering real-time data feeds, decentralized AI access, or blockchain-powered storage are also growing. Platforms like DefiLlama continue to highlight this pattern, showing where capital is flowing and which coins are retaining it.



Many altcoins in 2025 are focused on usability rather than appearance. Investors are paying closer attention to projects that function well across blockchain environments. Tokens built on Ethereum tend to attract long-term interest due to the network's reliability and proven security. This is especially true for new entrants combining Ethereum infrastructure with focused utility.

Dawgz AI has started to gain traction within this shift. It stands out as an Ethereum-based meme coin that uses artificial intelligence in real ways. While most meme tokens depend on social buzz alone, Dawgz AI introduces tools that serve a purpose within the community. It has raised over $3.5 million during its presale phase and has a total supply of 8.88 billion tokens at the current price of $0.004. The project has been audited for transparency, and its SolidProof verification confirms the code quality and contract security.

Instead of adding features like NFTs or chasing trends, Dawgz AI focuses on AI-based functionality and automation. Its roadmap includes integration with smart AI tools that may improve community engagement and project communication. Being built on Ethereum offers users access to secure transfers, compatibility with major wallets, and the support of an existing ecosystem. For crypto traders looking beyond hype-driven cycles, Dawgz AI represents a different type of meme coin—one that works like a utility token without pretending to be something else. Watch this video for further insights.



The altcoin market in 2025 is more data-driven than ever. Analysts at Forbes Digital Assets have noted a shift in institutional research toward utility-based tokens and infrastructure coins. Metrics like developer activity, transaction volume, and cross-chain performance often judge these projects. Instead of marketing campaigns, coins that offer consistent functionality and network integration are being tracked more closely.

A recent update from CoinDesk Markets highlights how blockchain tools used in AI, storage, and computation are seeing real traction. Projects that allow users to access services directly on-chain, it's data, automation, or computation, are now being prioritized. This includes tokens connected to Ethereum scalability, decentralized storage, and decentralized AI services. Coins that serve a technical purpose in these sectors are attracting longer attention spans.

Some of these tokens may not be widely known yet, but the underlying growth data is visible. Altcoins with active usage across dApps or developer frameworks often gain liquidity faster than passive coins. On-chain dashboards like Dune Analytics and DeFiLlama show this shift in real time. When adoption rises at the user level, value tends to follow. In this climate, a token like Dawgz AI—built for use rather than speculation—fits the kind of project many analysts are now monitoring.

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to interact with real-world data securely. It plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem by providing reliable data feeds to various decentralized applications. As per Binance, as of May 15, 2025, Chainlink's price is $17.17, with a market capitalization of approximately $11.29 billion.

The network's ability to connect smart contracts with off-chain data sources has made it an essential component in the DeFi space. Its widespread adoption across multiple blockchain platforms underscores its significance in the industry.

Chainlink's consistent performance and integration into various projects highlight its potential for sustained growth. Investors and developers alike continue to recognize its value in enabling complex smart contract functionalities.

Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to improve transaction speed and reduce costs. It achieves this by processing transactions off-chain before settling them on the Ethereum mainnet. As of May 15, 2025, Arbitrum's price stands at $0.4109, with a market capitalization of around $1.95 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

The platform has gained traction among developers seeking efficient and scalable solutions for their decentralized applications. Its compatibility with Ethereum's existing infrastructure makes it an attractive option for projects aiming to improve performance without compromising security.

Arbitrum's growing ecosystem and adoption indicate its potential to play a significant role in Ethereum's scalability roadmap. Its focus on user experience and developer-friendly tools contributes to its increasing popularity.

Render is a decentralized GPU rendering network that connects artists and studios with mining partners willing to rent their GPU capabilities. This model allows for efficient and cost-effective rendering of complex graphics. According to Binance, as of May 15, 2025, Render's price is $5.30, with a market capitalization of approximately $2.75 billion.

The platform addresses the growing demand for high-performance rendering services in industries such as gaming, virtual reality, and digital art. By leveraging blockchain technology, Render ensures transparency and fair compensation for all participants.

Render's innovative approach to distributed rendering positions it as a key player in the intersection of blockchain and digital content creation. Its ability to meet the needs of modern creators underscores its relevance in the growing digital market.

Altcoins that continue to perform well over time usually share a few critical traits. Analysts at CoinGecko point to developer activity, protocol stability, and open communication as strong indicators of future success. Projects that publish frequent updates, engage users directly, and maintain public roadmaps tend to build trust faster. This leads to more consistent demand across exchanges and communities.

A clear function also backs a reliable altcoin. Coins that help run smart contracts, store data, process off-chain information, or automate tasks in DeFi all play a specific role in the crypto economy. Many of these use cases appear in high-traffic platforms tracked by DefiLlama, where tokens with active utility also tend to maintain higher liquidity. Instead of riding hype, they gain traction through real activity.

For those looking for the best altcoins to buy now, utility is one of the strongest signals to watch. Tokens that serve a purpose in an existing ecosystem often grow alongside it. Dawgz AI fits into this category by using Ethereum's infrastructure and integrating features based on AI. It reflects what many long-term investors prefer: simple systems backed by function, not flash.

Altcoins with no real function are quickly losing investor interest. In their place, tokens that serve clear roles inside existing blockchain systems are rising. Whether it's powering AI tools, automating contracts, or supporting data transfers, utility is becoming the clearest signal of long-term potential.

Ethereum-based projects that offer access to real services are gaining consistent attention. Investors are no longer chasing empty trends. They're watching coins with strong developer support and user activity. Projects that grow by delivering something useful, not just by launching flashy features, are shaping the direction of crypto in 2025.

Dawgz AI is part of this shift. It combines Ethereum's proven base with AI-powered features in a format that's simple but functional. For investors exploring utility-first tokens with community potential, it's worth a closer look.

Explore Dawgz AI to see how real-world utility can power the next generation of meme coins. Visit the official site, review the roadmap, and follow the project as it builds into something more than a trend

Therefore, investors are shifting their focus to a rapidly growing altcoin named Unilabs. This asset manager is creating a buzz in the crypto market with its exceptional tools that aim to redefine the investment process. 

Analysts believe that if this protocol continues to grow at this pace, it could even challenge Ethereum as the fastest growing altcoin of 2026. Let's discover more about this platform.

As the Ethereum price prediction uncovered the indecisiveness of investors for the ETH token, Unilabs is increasingly becoming the focal point of interest in the crypto industry. This DeFi asset manager is expected to challenge Ethereum, one of the most dominant crypto players, with its AI-powered tools.  

For instance, Unilabs Launchpad uses AI-driven real-time market analysis to point out ventures that could offer significant returns. By leveraging this tool, investors can not only keep track of potential emerging projects but can also gain access to opportunities that were previously limited to institutional investors. 

This protocol is also backed by advanced security measures and successfully manages over $30m in Assets Under Management (AUM). One standout feature of this fund is its portfolio management tool that allows investors to automatically align their portfolio with the prevailing market trends. 

In addition to this, Unilabs is currently offering four different types of fund options, such as BTC Fund, Mining Fund, AI Fund, and RWA Fund. This wide variety of funds will enable investors to enhance their exposure across the blockchain and DeFi space. 

Unilabs is experiencing rapid growth as its presale continues to make waves in the market by crossing over $300,000 in funding. The reason behind this explosive growth is the platform's exciting features, such as the Early Access Scoring System (EASS). 

By utilizing this feature, users could make well-informed and data backed investment decisions. This system uses a scoring mechanism that checks out potential projects on multiple levels to identify their profitability. 

Considering its smart features and fast expansion, industry analysts believe that Unilabs could be the fastest growing altcoin of the upcoming year.  

Ethereum (ETH) has been performing exceptionally well in the past couple of weeks, which has contributed to a massive 50% increase in its monthly performance. Ethereum price prediction revealed that with this enormous surge, the token has successfully managed to break above its prolonged descending channel. 

In the past week, the ETH token even surged up to $2,750 but afterwards faced a rejection. According to Ethereum price prediction, the token has to break above the next crucial resistance level at around $2,850 in order to confirm a bullish rally.

Additionally, the Ethereum Foundation's recent development of the Trillion Dollar Security Initiative is also sparking optimism around the ETH token. However, the recent Ethereum price prediction disclosed that despite these advancements, the token faced correction and fell to around $2,550.  

Along with this, the trade volume of the ETH token has also declined that could result in potential price reversal. Therefore, considering the Ethereum price prediction, crypto experts suggest Unilabs as the fastest growing altcoin of 2026 that could potentially outpace the ETH token. 

The recent Ethereum price prediction has revealed that even the most well-established coin like the ETH token could struggle to stay resilient amid market volatility. Meanwhile, Unilabs' increasing expansion is a testament to the growing confidence of investors in its data-backed, AI-driven approach to investment. 

This platform has successfully completed stage 1 of its presale and now the next round has started. Considering the rapid sell out, investors should act quickly and grab the UNIL token at just $0.0051 before the next price surge.

Pakistan has entered into a partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLF1), a cryptocurrency venture backed by the family of former U.S. President Donald Trump. The Pakistan Crypto Council, led by CEO Bilal bin Saqib who also serves as an advisor to WLF1, is spearheading this collaboration. Recently, Bilal bin Saqib met with Acting U.S. Ambassador Natalie Baker to discuss expanding cooperation between Pakistan and the United States in blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. This deal has attracted attention in India, where some have expressed concern over the Pak-U.S. crypto collaboration.

An unidentified wallet made a major on-chain move by withdrawing 13,800 ETH from the leading cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., Coinbase. Based on current prices, this withdrawal is the equivalent of $35.26 million. Soon after, the same address repaid a portion of its outstanding ETH loan on Aave.

The wallet, labeled "0x2b0aD," used the funds to repay variable-rate Ethereum debt borrowed against cBTC, a version of Bitcoin wrapped on the Coinbase platform. The blockchain data shows that 13,750 ETH of the loan token was burned and about 13,800 ETH were sent back to Aave's lending pool.

However, this repayment is only partial. Having sent back a large amount of ETH, the wallet still has an open debt of 32,377.6 WETH, valued at around $82.61 million.

Whether this move signals a wider deleveraging strategy or a short-term adaptation will become clearer over time. Either way, it reduces the account's exposure and improves its collateral position, possibly as a way to manage volatility or prepare for further changes in the market.

1,000,000 ETH in Past Month – What's Happening?

What motivates this whale's activity - price expectations or internal portfolio rebalancing - is still unknown.

So far, no further movement has been made by the wallet.

We have fined Newcastle based sole trader Darian Bishop, trading as ECO4U, £50,000 for making over 194,000 unlawful marketing calls to people on the UK's 'do not call' register. 

Bishop's unlawful calls related to grants for new boilers and solar panels, with the inference made during the calls that he was connected to a government scheme.  

It is against the law to make marketing calls to people who have been registered on the Telephone Preference Service register (TPS) for more than 28 days, unless they have explicitly consented to receive the calls. 

Catherine Sankey, Group Manager at the ICO said:

“Feeling threatened or abused in your own home, simply because you picked up your phone, will never be acceptable.  

“Our investigation clearly showed this individual was fully aware of the law in relation to making marketing calls yet went ahead and made them anyway. 

“Our fine shows that we will hold all those who flout the law to account, from sole trader to larger companies employing a number of staff, and should act as further warning that we continue to pursue and fine companies who choose to ignore the law in pursuit of financial gain.” 

Investigation findings and outcome 

We became aware of Bishop during wider enquiries relating to an increase in complaints received about the energy and home improvement sector. An investigation began in October 2023 after we and TPS received 21 complaints.  

Bishop maintained he received valid consent after people completed an application form via a Facebook advertisement. A sample of complainants were contacted during the investigation, all of whom confirmed to us either they did not complete an application form or they did not use Facebook. 

We concluded Bishop was aware of the rules surrounding the making of marketing calls: he confirmed he knew about the relevant law and was previously investigated in 2015 for making persistent sales calls and misleading people into believing they would receive a free boiler under the ‘Green Deal' scheme.  

We found Bishop did not provide enough information to enable people to understand who they were receiving calls from, nor did he take reasonable steps to prevent non-compliance with the law. 

Darian Bishop received a monetary penalty notice for £50,000 and an enforcement notice. 

Examples of complaints received 

“Reminded caller about TPS scheme to which I belong. Was asked did I pay for it and there's no such thing and it doesn't work. I stated I would be reporting this cold call and was told I was being awkward, and the caller hung up. This is an invasion of my privacy again”.  

“Think he said calling from government company. Asked for me by name. When I said I wouldn't do anything over the phone he was asking if he had the right address and would send someone tomorrow. So very threatening”.  

“Although this company identified themselves as Echo Government Scheme Deal, they initially said they were calling on behalf of a government scheme about my gas boiler. In short the call is dishonest. I'm concerned about companies claiming to have a government connection, talking about scheme that do exist – in this case the Green Deal – and trying to give their call a degree of official authority.”

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin has been starting to take off again, recently breaching the $100,000 mark.

Michael Saylor, one of the biggest Bitcoin bulls, believes that in the future, the digital currency could be worth millions.

10 stocks we like better than iShares Bitcoin Trust ›

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) recently hit the $100,000 mark again. The bullishness is back as investors continue to pile money into the top cryptocurrency. And if some crypto enthusiasts are right, this may be just the start of more gains to come.

The good news is that if you don't want to worry about digital wallets and just want an easy way to invest in Bitcoin, there are spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) you can put into your portfolio today to gain exposure to the digital currency, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT). Could investing $1,000 in this ETF help make you a millionaire?

Investing in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF can be an effective way to track Bitcoin. The fund charges an expense ratio of 0.25%, which is comparable to what many other ETFs charge. Most importantly, however, is that your performance from holding the fund in your portfolio would be comparable to actually holding Bitcoin.

While there is some minor disparity, the ETF does a good job of tracking the digital currency, and you would be up over 60% right now if you invested in the fund a year ago.

For a $1,000 investment in anything to grow to a value of $1 million, you would need it to grow to 1,000 times its original value. That's not a small performance by any stretch. But given the enthusiasm around Bitcoin, could it be possible?

It recently surpassed $100,000. Assuming you invested in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF right around now, then you would need the digital currency to climb to a value of at least $100 million at some point in the future. That would be around the level necessary to turn a $1,000 investment into $1 million.

One of the biggest Bitcoin bulls is Michael Saylor, the former CEO of Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy). He believes that the cryptocurrency could reach a value of $13 million by 2045. And under his bull case, he projects it could be worth $49 million.

Those would be phenomenal returns for the cryptocurrency. However, even if it did reach those levels, that still wouldn't be enough for a $1,000 investment in an ETF tracking the digital currency to make you a millionaire. While over the very long term (i.e., 30-plus years) that may be more likely, it would indeed be an extremely bullish, best-case scenario for that to happen.

Bitcoin has been picking up steam in recent weeks after a tough start to the year, as crypto investors remain bullish once again on the popular coin. But it's important to consider the volatility and risk that can come with it, as this is still a highly speculative investment to be holding in your portfolio. Within just the past 12 months, it has hit highs of more than $106,000 but lows of less than $54,000 as well.

Those kinds of wild swings can be exciting when things are going up, but they can also be depressing on the way down. Investing in the crypto can yield great returns for investors, but it's important to temper your expectations. And while the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF may make it easier to do so, that doesn't mean it's any less risky.

If you want to invest in Bitcoin, I would suggest taking only a small position (less than 5% of your portfolio) to ensure you aren't taking on too much risk.

Jakarta, Pintu News – VanEck recently launched their latest product, the VanEck Onchain Economy ETF with the stock code NODE. This ETF is designed to give investors access to the digital asset economy without having to own crypto directly.

By investing in digitally transformed companies and digital asset instruments, NODE offers an investment alternative with lower volatility.

The product targets public companies involved in the blockchain space, including crypto miners, exchanges, data centers, energy providers, and fintech companies using crypto technology.

Check out the full news here!

The NODE ETF is actively managed by selecting between 30 and 60 companies from more than 130 candidates. The portfolio is customized based on market trends and each company's association with Bitcoin . Although it does not hold crypto directly, NODE can invest up to 25% of its assets in crypto-related products such as Bitcoin ETFs through its Cayman Islands subsidiary.

This allows NODE to comply with US tax laws while gaining indirect exposure to crypto-related products such as swaps and futures. NODE will not invest in stablecoins and will limit the subsidiary's exposure to 25% of assets each quarter. This approach offers diversification and liquidity, and is an alternative to the often more volatile pure crypto strategies.

With a management fee of 0.69%, NODE complements VanEck's crypto-related product line, which already includes the passively managed Digital Transformation ETF. The launch coincides with growing institutional interest in blockchain infrastructure and the availability of products from traditional asset managers that fit into the evolving on-chain economy.

VanEck has also filed ETFs related to individual digital assets, including Avalanche  and Binance Coin . This shows the continued expansion in the crypto investment space and offers more options for investors looking to get involved in the digital asset market without the direct risks of crypto ownership.

              Highlights            



                        Stablecoin adoption is growing, with partnerships like Mastercard and MoonPay signaling mainstream interest and proving key to usability, but scalability remains hindered by limited fiat on- and off-ramps, merchant acceptance and regulatory uncertainty.                      


                        Stablecoins offer benefits, especially for cross-border payments and emerging markets, thanks to their speed, reliability and programmability, but they require better infrastructure and integration with legacy financial systems.                      


                        Banks and FinTechs can act as stablecoin issuers, custodians and fiat liquidity providers, but U.S. regulatory hurdles — highlighted by political blocks like the GENIUS Act — may ultimately shape their future more than the technology itself.                      

Solutions in search of problems tend to get nowhere. Stablecoins, which have the potential to become widely used for payments, are trying to avoid that fate.

Stablecoins are being held as more than a cryptocurrency curiosity, as evidenced by news Thursday (May 15) that Mastercard launched a stablecoin-focused partnership with crypto payments FinTech MoonPay.

However, the full potential of the fiat-pegged digital asset class remains constrained by limited on- and off-ramp infrastructure and insufficient acceptance among merchants and consumers. There's also the regulatory elephant in the room in the United States.

The benefits of stablecoins can be enticing, particularly in cross-border and emerging market transactions. These programmable dollars (or euros, or pesos) can move at the speed of the internet. They combine the reliability of traditional money with the speed and efficiency of blockchain rails. Still, like all powerful tools, stablecoins' value depends on the system they're part of. That could require legitimate institutions to build the rails, encourage acceptance, align with regulations and integrate with legacy systems.

On paper, stablecoins may seem like the perfect bridge between two financial worlds. Citi Institute's Future of Finance think tank projected that the stablecoin market could jump to at least $1.6 trillion by 2030, assuming regulatory support and institutional integration continue apace.

In practice, however, stablecoins can be stuck in a transactional limbo where they are underused and misunderstood. The key to unlocking their full potential could lie in partnerships for seamless fiat on- and off-ramps, as well as widespread acceptance from merchants and consumers.

For most Americans not actively involved in crypto markets, stablecoins might as well not exist. But most Americans still bank with institutions that are centuries old.

In the crypto economy of certain regions, wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet and others are the new front ends of finance, and fiat ramps serve as the connective tissue between these wallets and the fiat world.

Today, most stablecoin entry points still rely on centralized crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance or Kraken. These platforms offer fiat gateways where users can link bank accounts or cards to buy stablecoins. However, for stablecoins to become ubiquitous, access needs to move beyond crypto-native tools. That means embedding on-ramps into FinTech apps, remittance platforms and retail bank services.

Emerging markets, where banking infrastructure is often limited or unreliable, stand to benefit the most.

For example, Ramp announced May 7 an expansion of its issuing partnership with Stripe to launch stablecoin-backed corporate cards designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. The integration will start with select Latin American markets and then expand to countries in Europe, Africa and Asia.

Currency.com CEO Konstantin Anissimov told PYMNTS this week that there has been “a big shift in terms of adoption of stablecoin payments that is being driven by uncertainty in geopolitics.”

“I am personally seeing a big increase of small to medium enterprises utilizing stablecoin payments because banking rails are harder and harder to use,” Anissimov said.

From Shopify plugins to crypto-friendly point-of-sale (POS) systems, technical solutions exist to enable stablecoin acceptance. However, what's lacking is incentive. Traditional payment processors like Visa or PayPal offer reliability, fraud protection and settlement services that most blockchain payment systems can't yet match.

Equally critical are off-ramps — the pathways through which users convert stablecoins back into fiat currency. Without these, stablecoins risk becoming digital dead-ends. Users want to spend, not just hold.

That's in part why, rather than resisting, banks can reposition themselves as custodians of digital assets, offering secure storage and compliance partnerships that handle know your customer and anti-money laundering obligations for stablecoin issuers. At the same time, they can serve as liquidity providers offering fiat backstops and redemption services.

They could even be issuers themselves. Some, like J.P. Morgan, already are.

“I think the largest banks will succeed as stablecoin issuers,” Amias Gerety, former assistant secretary of the Treasury, told PYMNTS in March.

Still, policy could shape the stablecoin trajectory in the U.S. more than technology. Perhaps the most eye-catching development in 2025 has been the President Donald Trump family's foray into stablecoins. The USD1 token, unveiled at a Dubai conference and reportedly used in a $2 billion Binance investment by Abu Dhabi's MGX, raised eyebrows and strategic questions.

That foray, as well as others, resulted in the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act, a bill to promote stablecoins, being blocked in the U.S. Senate over political disagreements.

 The Securities and Exchange Commission has questioned Coinbase's 2021 claim that it had more than 100 million “verified users” in the ongoing investigation. 

Coinbase stock dipped after news broke of a cyberattack that exposed customer data and an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation over misstated user numbers in 2021.

The double whammy of bad news rattled investors as company stock (COIN) slid 7% in a fall to $244 in after-hours trading on May 15, according to Google Finance.  

Coinbase has since confirmed the report from The New York Times, which stated the SEC has been investigating whether Coinbase misstated its user numbers in past disclosures, an inquiry that began during the Biden administration and has continued under the Trump administration.

“This is a hold-over investigation from the prior administration about a metric we stopped reporting two and a half years ago, which was fully disclosed to the public,” confirmed Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal to Cointelegraph. 

“We also disclosed – and continue to disclose – the more relevant metric of ‘monthly transacting users' – the number of people who use our platform in a given month,” he said before adding: 

The regulator took specific umbrage at Coinbase's claim of “100+ million verified users” that appeared in its marketing and IPO documentation in 2021. However, the exchange stopped reporting this metric in 2022.

The probe has continued despite the SEC dropping its 2023 enforcement lawsuit against Coinbase under the Trump administration. 

Coinbase has hired law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell to assist with its response to the SEC.

On May 15, Coinbase reported that it was attacked with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals recruited overseas support agents to leak user data.

“These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers,” the firm stated.

Coinbase refused to pay the ransom but said it would reimburse victims of phishing attacks as a result of the data breach, with expected remediation and reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.

What RFK, Jr. Got Wrong about Autism, according to Scientists

A coalition of autism scientists has formed to counter RFK, Jr.'s misrepresentations of science and of autism spectrum disorder

By Allison Parshall

Scientific research over the past 30 years has revealed a patchwork of potential causes of autism. Most of them are genetic—the condition is between 60 and 90 percent heritable—and some involve nongenetic risk factors that might impact development during pregnancy.

“We've found a great deal of the underlying [causes],” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, an autism researcher and a professor emerita at Boston University. But how these different risk factors come together as the brain develops remains a challenge to piece together. “Autism is not a simple disorder,” she says. “There are no simple answers. There are no so-called smoking guns.”

Even so, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the U.S. secretary of health and human services, talks about autism in a way that suggests he thinks there are simple and direct causes. He often refers to the steady rise in autism prevalence (which is likely due to improved screening and diagnosis) as an indicator that we're in the middle of an “autism epidemic” driven by “environmental toxins.” He has also refused to disavow the long-debunked idea that vaccines cause autism. This month, as part of Kennedy's effort to find “the root causes of autism,” the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced that they will create a “data platform” to study the condition. In April NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya had described plans for “national disease registries, including a new one for autism." The plan involved collecting “comprehensive” private health data on autism that would represent “broad coverage” of the U.S. population, leading autism advocacy organizations, civil rights groups and research scientists to warn of medical privacy concerns. (Shortly after outlets reported on Bhattacharya's statements in April, HHS denied that it planned to create an “autism registry.”)

In a budget hearing on Wednesday, Kennedy called for an end to genetic research into autism. “I don't think we should be funding that genetic work anymore,” he said. “What we really need to do now is to identify the environmental toxins.”

In response to this dismissal of well-established science, Tager-Flusberg has organized a coalition of scientists to push back. The Coalition of Autism Scientists now has 258 members and is still growing.

Scientific American spoke with Tager-Flusberg about Kennedy's statements this week and how the autism community is responding.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

In a Congressional budget hearing Wednesday afternoon, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., said: “Autism is an epidemic, and the genes do not cause epidemics. They can contribute a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. It's like cigarettes and smoking.” What was your reaction to that? 

There is no reason that we need to refer to the increased prevalence rates, which have been rising steadily for many years now, as an epidemic. This is not the definition of an epidemic, so I take issue with highlighting that.

Second of all, genetics are the primary contributing factor to autism. We know specific genes and variants confer increased risk, even in cases where there aren't any clear environmental contributions. If anything, it's the other way around—it's the environmental factors that add to or interact with the genetic risk for autism.

Take one of the very well-regulated nongenetic factors: parental age, particularly paternal age. What we think is going on is that, as parents age, their germ cells [which develop into eggs or sperm] are changing, and so this is leading to alterations in the DNA that then confer risk for autism.

Are there other nongenetic factors that might be playing a role?

[Studies have shown] that [pregnant] mothers who take an antiseizure medication, particularly valproic acid, can have an increased risk of having a child with autism. But here, again, we have to think about this in a more complex way. [In such cases], the mother herself has a seizure disorder, and seizure disorders are a very common co-occurrence with autism. So then [the parent and the child] well may have some shared genetic risk factors that are interacting with the effects of the medication itself.

When RFK, Jr., said “environmental toxins” are causing autism, do you think he was talking about vaccines?

Well, I listened very carefully to his testimony [on Wednesday]. And he will not rule out adverse effects of vaccines. And so, yes, I think he is probably still keeping that on his agenda. And you have the NIH director [Jay Bhattacharya] saying that we should look at everything because we want to gain the trust of people. To me, that's not the way of gaining people's trust. You don't gain trust by saying that we can just toss out all the research that we've done so far and start again.

Why did you decide to form a coalition of autism scientists?

Colleagues of mine were becoming increasingly concerned, and we were thinking about what we could do as scientists. It came to a head for me when I saw all the advocacy groups—self-advocates, the parent advocacy groups, nonprofit organizations—come together and issue a very strongly worded and clear statement of concern about what they were hearing from the administration. And I felt that it was really important for the voice of scientists to be heard, too.

So I just contacted a small group of my colleagues and said, “I think we need to issue a press release.” I set up the Zoom call that afternoon, at five o'clock on a Friday. And it took off so rapidly. Clearly, there was a need for the voices of scientists to be heard. We have something very important to contribute because that's where we have devoted our careers.

What has concerned you and your colleagues the most?

I would say there' are probably four things. One is dismissing all the prior science that has been accomplished and everything that we do know. That, I think, is very disturbing.

A second [concern] is that, at no point over the past several months of this administration, has the secretary of health and human services or, [since he took office on April 1], the NIH director reached out to anyone we know in the external autism science community. They have not reached out to us at all, and I think that is very disturbing.

A third thing is that the one person that was named early on [by the administration to lead research into autism] was David Geier, who is not a trained scientist. [Editor's Note: Geier is a long-time vaccine skeptic. He is not a physician and was sanctioned in 2011 for practicing medicine without a license.]

The fourth thing is that now, we heard last week, the administration plans to use Medicare and Medicaid data as the foundation of the research plan to uncover the “roots” of autism. These are not databases that are suited to that kind of research because they capture only a subset of children diagnosed with autism. And there are serious concerns about whether this administration would put into place and commit to the kind of ethical privacy and confidentiality attempts that are needed to conduct this.

Many autistic people push back on this focus on finding the “roots” of autism or a “cure.” How does that pushback fit in here?

Autism is an enormously heterogenous disorder. People who, while needing some support, still can function and flourish individually represent one end of the spectrum. They can speak for themselves, and for at least some of them, autism is part of their identity. And understandably, they are not interested in a cure—and parenthetically, it's unlikely that one could even identify a potential cure.

But autism also involves the other end of the spectrum. A quarter to a third [of people with the diagnosis] are far more severely impaired. They may have limited daily living skills; they cannot be left alone; they have extremely limited communication abilities. This is the end of the [spectrum] that we now call profound autism. It is such a challenge for them and their families, especially some of them who engage in self-injury or very aggressive behavior. Yes, I think there is hope that we might find maybe not a complete cure but something that would significantly change their developmental course. I think we should be able to hold both ideas in our head at the same time because this is the reality of what autism is.

Kennedy's approach seems to step right on that fissure in the autism community. Is there a way to prevent this rift from developing further?

I don't think I have the answer to that. It's a big question in the community because people are looking at the agendas in very different ways. But I will say one thing. I have been really impressed, over the past couple of weeks, since beginning this coalition, with how [autistic] folks who are self-advocates have joined the coalition. I think the one thing that unifies us is a belief in the importance of scientific research. Maybe we define the scope of that science in different ways, but that's always true. That's something that we all hold to.

And I think we all, at this moment, believe that the direction that's been described so far by the administration is not the way we should go. We should not be opening up the question of vaccines again. We should be very cautious about using “registries” and make sure the research that's done is ethical and maintains the confidentiality of individuals in those databases. We all agree about that.

We also all agree that, so far, we're not hearing from the administration that they have a very deep understanding of autism. They have failed to engage most of us, whether ... scientists or advocates or nonprofit organizations. None of us have been involved in these discussions. So I think we actually have a moment in time where there is some agreement, and I think it behooves the administration to think about why that is and whether they need to change their course.

The ‘amateur archaeologist' says he's discovered proof of what happened to the colony members who completely vanished from the site of one of the U.S.'s greatest mysteries.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

It's one of America's earliest and most enduring mysteries: what happened to the “Lost Colony of Roanoke?”

Before the Revolution, even before Jamestown, an English colony was established in what is now North Carolina. Intended as an additional source of income for the kingdom, conditions quickly turned harsh and supplies ran short.

A representative of the colony set out for England to seek assistance; but while reports of possible hostilities with the Native population in the New World might have normally tugged at the sympathies of the Crown, a conflict brewing between England and Spain kept any aid from coming to the colony for three years. When help finally arrived, it arrived to find no one there to be helped. The colonists, and virtually all traces of the colony, were gone. A single palisade remained, with the word CROATOAN carved into it (the name of a nearby indigenous tribe).

In the centuries since, the mystery of what became of the colonists at Roanoke has inspired stories, films, and even a long-running theatrical production at the very site the colony once stood. But now, an author, museum owner, and self-described “amateur archaeologist” claims to have solved this long-standing mystery. What's more, he asserts that there was no mystery at all, the colonists were never lost, and the whole story is merely “a marketing campaign.”

And he believes his latest discovery is “empirical evidence to prove it.”

Scott Dawson, the aforementioned author, museum proprietor, and president of the Croatoan Archaeological Society, did not find the buildings or the bodies that once populated the colony at Roanoke. But he, alongside archeologist and TV presenter Mark Horton, found some small flakes of rusted metal on Hatteras Island that they believe indicates the fate of the colonists who once lived 50 miles north at Roanoke.

These shavings, which the Daily Mail notes are “barely larger than a grain of rice,” are known as hammerscale, a byproduct of iron-forging. The indigenous population who populated the area, the Croatoan, would not have been conducting the type of blacksmithing that would produce these shavings, asserts Horton.

But the English would have.

“The hammerscale shows that English settlers lived among the Croatoans on Hatteras and were ultimately absorbed into their community,” Horton remarked to the Daily Mail. “Once and for all, this smoking gun evidence answers any questions about the supposed mystery of the lost colony.”

The pair have “been digging near Buxton on the Croatoan Hatteras Island for more than a decade,” uncovering weapons and other European artifacts in the area, all of which have been put on display in Dawson's museum in Buxton (unrelated to the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site, operated by the National Parks Service, whose museum sits adjacent to the original site of the colony). But they claim the hammerscale is more definitive proof than these previously found items, because “coins and sword hilts could have got to Hatteras through trade or a passing settler.”

To them, it's obvious that the colonists would have relocated and taken up with the Croatoan. “The lost colony narrative was a marketing campaign,” Dawson defiantly declared. “...and now we have empirical evidence to prove it.”

Dawson and Horton are not alone in the belief that the colonists went off to seek refuge with a friendly indigenous tribe. Many over the centuries have asserted such a conclusion; it even factors into the latest incarnation of the aforementioned theatrical production, “The Lost Colony,” performed at the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site. In fact, it's one of the more prominent theories as to the fate of the colony, so Dawson and Horton are not alone in their “assimilation” assertion.

However, they are also not alone in the pantheon of those confident that their latest archaeological discovery has solved the Lost Colony mystery “once and for all.”

When the legend of the Lost Colony took hold in the United States during the 19th century, in a fervor toward forging a sense of national identity, the focus was on Virginia Dare, the first English (or as she was more often touted then, first “white”) child born in the New World. In many of the stories crafted around the colony in this time, it was suggested that the innocent colonists were killed by angry Natives, as though to suggest there was some original sin in the American experiment that could justify the genocide perpetrated against the indigenous population throughout the Age of Jackson.

That particularly bloody theory was “confirmed” in the 1930s, with the “discovery” of the so-called Dare Stones, a series of 48 carved stones which revealed that Virginia Dare and her father were killed by natives in 1591. But in 1941, Boyden Sparks of The Saturday Evening Post exposed these stones to be merely a hoax. And so, the mystery of the Lost Colony endured.

More recently, a different North Carolina-based archaeology group known as the First Colony Foundation made their own noteworthy and well-publicized discovery, when they revealed that a 400-year-old map featured a hidden fort, never-before-discovered. When they excavated that site, some distance from Roanoke at the Bal Gra plantation along Salmon Creek, they found what they felt was fairly compelling evidence that at least some of the colonists had, in fact, left the colony and went north, to this area they dubbed Site X, as opposed to Hatteras Island. In their book, Excavating the Lost Colony Mystery, the First Colony Foundation doesn't claim to have a “smoking gun,” but instead lay out what they consider a prima facie argument in favor of their theory.

So, has the Lost Colony mystery been solved? In all honesty, probably. By someone, somewhere.

Now it's just a matter of figuring out whose solution that is.

It started with a bang, but won't end with one.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

While the universe might have started with a bang, it probably won't go out with one. But however it comes about, that end might be much sooner than we thought. 

If you ask astrophysicist Heino Falcke, quantum physicist Michael Wondrak, and mathematician Walter van Suijlekom, they'll tell you that those last days will not erupt into a cataclysmic explosion worthy of sci-fi special effects. Instead, the last remaining vestiges of all matter will just evaporate into particles floating in the void. In 2023, the trio theorized that it was possible for other objects besides black holes to slowly evaporate away via Hawking radiation, which aroused curiosity as to how soon it could possibly happen. Now, there is a hypothetical answer. 

But don't start doomsday prepping yet—Earth still has about 5 billion years left until it gets devoured by the Sun. So, according to the team, if our species manages to propagate beyond the Solar System and colonize some distant moon or planet, there are still another ~1078 years left for the universe. That's 1 with 78 zeroes after it. Even Twinkies won't last that long. 

It might seem unfathomable, but that mind-boggling max age for the universe is far lower than the previously predicted 101100 years (which is 1 with 1100 zeroes). While this prior hypothesis did include the time it would take for black holes to evaporate, it did not factor in the evaporation of other objects. 

“Using gravitational curvature radiation, we find that also neutron stars and white dwarfs decay in a finite time in the presence of gravitational pair production,” the researchers said in a study recently published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics.

When a pair of particles forms right on the lip of a black hole's gaping maw, one can be pulled in past the inescapable event horizon, while the other escapes into nearby space. Because those particles are supposedly quantum-entangled, that rogue particle could be carrying information about the insides of a black hole (until the Hawking Information Paradox kicks in, of course). This called Hawking radiation. It has long been thought that only black holes emitted Hawking radiation, but in their new study, these researchers posit that a similar phenomenon could affect other ultradense objects without event horizons, such as white dwarf stars (star corpses left when the gases of a red giant dissipate) and neutron stars.

Everything with mass has gravity that warps spacetime. The more dense an object, the greater the warp, but less massive objects still have some effect on the space-time continuum. Objects with strong gravitational fields evaporate faster—white dwarves, supermassive black holes, and dark matter supercluster haloes are expected to hold out for 1078 years, while neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes should hang around for about 1067 years. Anything with a gravitational field is prone to evaporating. (This includes humans, and could put a glitch in our quest for immortality. It should take 1090 years for our bodies to vanish.)

Even though the intense gravitational fields of black holes should cause them to evaporate faster, they put off total annihilation as long as possible because, unlike white dwarves or neutron stars, they have no surface and tend to reabsorb some escaped particles.

“In the absence of an event horizon, there is pair production outside the object which leads to particles hitting the surface and also pair production inside the object,” the researchers said. “We assume those particles to be absorbed by the object and to increase and redistribute internal energy. Both components will lead to a surface emission, which is absent in black holes.”

So, in enough years to cover 78 zeroes, all that will be left of black holes—and everything else in the universe—are particles and radiation. You (assuming immortality) and whatever you bought in bulk for doomsday will also evaporate. no matter when it comes, there really is no escape from the end.

See the Dramatic Consequences of Vaccination Rates Teetering on a ‘Knife's Edge'

As U.S. childhood vaccination rates sway on a “knife's edge,” new 25-year projections reveal how slight changes in national immunization could improve—or drastically reverse—the prevalence of measles, polio, rubella and diphtheria

By Lauren J. Young edited by Dean Visser

Amanda Montañez; Source: “Modeling Reemergence of Vaccine-Eliminated Infectious Diseases under Declining Vaccination in the U.S.,” by Mathew V. Kiang et al., in JAMA. Published online April 24, 2025 (data)

Measles, rubella, polio and diphtheria—once ubiquitous, devastating and deeply feared—have been virtually eliminated from the U.S. for decades. Entire generations have barely encountered these diseases as high vaccination rates and intensive surveillance efforts have largely shielded the country from major outbreaks.

But amid a major multistate measles outbreak that has grown to hundreds of cases, a recent study published in JAMA projects that even a slight dip in current U.S. childhood vaccination rates could reverse such historic gains, which could cause some of these maladies to come roaring back within 25 years—while just a slight increase in rates could effectively squelch all four.

“We were quite surprised that we're right on that knife's edge,” says the study's lead author Mathew Kiang, an assistant professor of epidemiology and population health at Stanford University. “A little bit more [vaccination coverage] and things could be totally fine; a little less and things are going to be quite bad.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization formally declare a disease eliminated when there is zero continuous transmission in a specific region for 12 months or more. The U.S. achieved this milestone for measles, a viral illness that can lead to splotchy rashes, pneumonia, organ failure and other dangerous complications, in 2000. Poliovirus, which can cause lifelong paralysis and death, was effectively eliminated from North and South America by 1994. The U.S. rid itself of viral rubella, known for causing miscarriages and severe birth defects, in 2004. And diphtheria, a highly fatal bacterial disease, was virtually eliminated after a vaccine was introduced in the 1940s. These are “key infectious diseases that we've eliminated from the U.S. through widespread vaccination,” says study co-author Nathan Lo, a physician-scientist at Stanford University.

Kiang, Lo and their colleagues ran multiple scenarios of childhood vaccination rates over 25 years to see if the four diseases would return to endemic levels (sustained transmission in which each infected person spreads the disease to at least one other person, on average, for a 12-month period). Measles—which is a very contagious disease and requires high population immunity to prevent spread—was the most susceptible to fluctuations in vaccination coverage. The models estimated that a 5 percent coverage decline would lead to an estimated 5.7 million measles cases over 25 years, while a 5 percent increase would result in only 5,800 cases.

Polio and rubella would require sharper vaccination rate downturns (around 30 to 40 percent) before reaching comparable risks of reemergence.

While projected diphtheria cases were notably lower, Lo notes that the illness has a relatively high fatality rate and can cause rapid deterioration: “Patients with diphtheria get symptomatic and within a day or two can die.”

Routine childhood immunization numbers have been slowly but steadily falling in recent years for several reasons, including missed appointments during the COVID pandemic and growing—often highly politicized—public resistance to vaccinations. “The idea of reestablishment of measles is not outrageous and certainly in the moment where we're looking at erosion of trust through our federal authorities about vaccination,” says Matthew Ferrari, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study.

Reduced U.S. vaccination rates can also cause “knock-on effects” that threaten disease eradication efforts around the world, Ferrari says. Additionally, recent funding cuts to international vaccine development programs such as USAID and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will “likely lead to increases in measles, rubella, diphtheria and polio elsewhere in the world,” he says. Outbreaks of these diseases in the U.S. largely start when unvaccinated American travelers pick one up while visiting a place where it's more common. “If you now add the consequences of defunding vaccination around the world, then that's going to increase the likelihood of these cases coming to the United States,” Ferrari says, adding that the study authors may have made “conservative assumptions” about these international factors.

But Ferrari says the study's scenarios assumed immediate—and in some cases unrealistically high—vaccination rate drop-offs without accounting for other possible public health efforts to control disease. “Even if we anticipated an erosion of vaccination in the United States, it probably wouldn't happen instantly,” Ferrari says. “Detection and reactive vaccination weren't really discussed in the paper, nor was the population-level response—the behavior of parents and the medical establishment. That's something we can't possibly know.... From that perspective, I think the scenarios were enormously pessimistic.”

Lo and Kiang argue that politically driven shifts in vaccine policy, such as reduced childhood vaccination requirements or a tougher authorization process for new vaccines, could make a 50 percent slump in vaccination rates less far-fetched. “I think that there was a lot of pushback from very smart people that 50 percent was way too pessimistic, and I think that—historically—they would have been right,” Kiang says. “I think in the current political climate and what we've seen, it's not clear to me that that is [still] true.”

Kiang and Lo say that while their study shows the dangers of vast vaccine declines, it also highlights how small improvements can make a massive difference.

“There's also a more empowering side, which is that the small fractions of population that push us one way can also push us the other way,” Lo says. “Someone might ask, ‘What is my role in this?' But small percentages [of increased vaccination], we find, can really push us back into the safe territory where this alternate reality of measles reestablishing itself would not come to pass.”

As attacks on US science by the administration of President Donald Trump continue, countries worldwide are stepping up their efforts to recruit US research talent. 

In the past few months, governments and institutions have launched programmes to attract scientists from the United States, where the Trump administration has made deep cuts to research budgets and begun dismantling science agencies. 

US brain drain: the scientists seeking jobs abroad amid Trump's assault on research

US brain drain: the scientists seeking jobs abroad amid Trump's assault on research

Efforts launched in regions including Europe, Canada, Australia and China range from enhanced funding opportunities to new programmes dedicated to wooing scientists, many backed by tens of millions of dollars (see ‘How nations are attracting scientists'). The trend has sparked a debate about whether luring US scientists abroad is the best way to support a global research community whose leading entity is under strain — and whether other nations can compete with historically high US levels of research funding. 

“We really should see this as a way of helping research globally and not as a way of poaching,” says Maria Leptin, president of the European Research Council (ERC), the continent's premier research funder. “I've referred to it as creating a haven.” As part of such efforts, the ERC is doubling to up to €2 million (US$2.2 million) the extra ‘start-up' money that researchers moving to Europe can apply for to help them establish their laboratories. The money could, for instance, pay to move a laboratory or set up a research team. 

That means the ERC now offers some grants worth up to €4.5 million over up to 5 years, making them competitive with US research awards. “It increases the grant sizes significantly,” says Leptin. “It should be a good incentive for people to come.”

The start-up funding is open to researchers moving from anywhere in the world to institutions in European Union countries and other nations associated with the EU's flagship science programme, Horizon Europe. “It's for anybody — and I think that's right,” says Leptin. “We've been wanting to do more,” she says. The US situation “was the straw that broke the camel's back to increase funding for this particular issue, at this particular time in history”.

The ERC's plans complement a broader initiative launched this month by the European Commission. The Choose Europe for Science programme, announced by commission president Ursula von der Leyen and backed by €500 million, is the most prominent of the talent-attraction initiatives. “The role of science in today's world is questioned,” said von der Leyen at the launch in Paris. “We need to offer the right incentives,” she said, “to make Europe a magnet for researchers.”

Other initiatives range from government-led programmes to those launched by individual institutions seeking researchers in particular disciplines.

The European Research Council is developing new, longer, larger ‘super grants' to draw the “very best” scientists. 

The Spanish State Research Agency's ATRAE programme, which is designed to attract international researchers, this year has a focus on US-based scientists. “We're offering an additional funding of €200,000 for researchers who have been selected and are coming from the US,” Spanish science minister Diana Morant told Nature. 

The Dutch Research Council has launched a fund to attract international scientists, regardless of nationality, to continue their work in the Netherlands.

The Research Council of Norway has launched a US$9.5-million scheme to recruit international researchers. The programme welcomes scientists working on climate, health, energy and artificial intelligence (AI). 

The Danish Chamber of Commerce has proposed a fast-track programme aimed at bringing up to 200 US researchers — in fields such as quantum technology, robotics and climate research — to Denmark over the next three years.

Austria wants to make it easier for universities to hire US researchers through a proposed amendment to the University Organization Act that would, in some cases, let institutions bypass the requirement to post job advertisements publicly for candidates who have spent at least two years doing research or teaching in the United States. “Austria stands as a bastion of security, favourable conditions and an unfettered research environment — qualities that are increasingly absent in the United States,” science minister Eva-Maria Holzleitner told Nature.

Paris-Saclay University has deployed several initiatives to support US researchers, including PhD contracts and funded visits for scholars. It also encourages them to apply through existing programmes, including its Alembert research-chair scheme and the Chateaubriand fellowship, and it says that tenure-track positions are on offer. 

The Paris Observatory is organizing a “special programme” to welcome USscientists who have lost their jobs or would prefer to work in France.

Aix Marseille University in France established the Safe Place For Science programme dedicated to welcoming US scientists in areas including climate, the environment and health. It is assessing its first round of applications. 

The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is “freeing up funds and establishing a dedicated contact point for American researchers who want to continue their work in Brussels”.

The Joint European Disruptive Initiative, a high-risk research foundation based in Paris, has launched the Transatlantic Science Fellows scheme to attract ten managers for its moonshot programmes, “starting with scientists from the Americas”, “at a time of global uncertainties”. 

The Toronto University Hospital Network has launched Canada Leads, a challenge to recruit 100 world-leading early-career scientists working across virology, regenerative medicine and areas “at risk due to shifting research funding landscapes globally”, a spokesperson says. The programme promises 2 years of funding and has received 300 expressions of interest since it was announced on 7 April. 

The University of Montreal in Canada has launched a Can$25-million (US$18-million) fundraising campaign to recruit leading and early-career researchers, including those facing pressures in the United States. The programme — which has raised nearly half its funding target — will support researchers in areas such as health, AI, biodiversity and public policy. 

The Australian Academy of Science has started a Global Talent Attraction Program to recruit US researchers working in areas of national need. The academy is seeking investors to fund the programme, but “there has been strong interest from US-based researchers and Australians wanting to return home”, says academy president Chennupati Jagadish.

In China, an advertisement began circulating on social-media platform X in February that said the technology city Shenzhen welcomes “global talents”, especially those dismissed by US institutions, Politico reported. Nature contacted several Chinese institutions to ask whether they were recruiting US scientists but did not receive a response. 

In France, where multiple schemes have emerged, the government has launched Choose France for Science to encourage international scientists who want to continue their work at French institutions. Operated by the French National Research Agency, the platform offers government funding to support institutions wanting to host relocating researchers. 

The Max Planck Society — Germany's prestigious network of research institutes — has started a Transatlantic Program, which aims to establish collaborative research centres with leading US institutions and will offer additional postdoc positions to US researchers. The society has committed €12 million and is working with US foundations to extend funding, a spokesperson says.

And, as some US scientists say that they are seeking jobs abroad, institutions have reported a rise in job inquiries from US researchers. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) is receiving an increasing number of unsolicited applications from US scientists, a spokesperson says, as is the University of Sydney in Australia, according to deputy vice-chancellor of research Julie Cairney.

But not everyone agrees that luring US talent is the right approach. “Trying to actively poach people away is just going to add to the serious problems some of our friends and colleagues in the US system currently face,” says Jan Löwe, director of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.

Metrics details

As reactive intermediates and substructures of natural products and bioactive molecules, the smallest cyclic alkanes—cyclopropanes—are an attractive class of molecules for chemists. Arguably, the most general approach to their chemical synthesis involves the addition of metal carbenes to olefins. Whereas catalytic asymmetric cyclopropanations of electronically unbiased olefins with carbenoids have been reported using chiral metal complexes and engineered metalloenzymes, we now report a complementary, metal-free and highly enantioselective cyclopropanation of olefins with diazoalkanes, applying asymmetric counteranion-directed photoredox organocatalysis. We identify an ion pair featuring a thioxanthylium photoredox cation and a chiral imidodiphosphorimidate counteranion that catalyses highly enantioselective cyclopropanations of styrenes and aliphatic dienes with diazo compounds. Mechanistic investigations reveal a wavelength dependence of the enantioselectivity and suggest that the main catalytic pathway proceeds via olefin-derived radical cation intermediates. This metal-free, highly enantioselective organocatalytic approach complements previously reported methods for alkene manipulations.

The synthesis of cyclopropanes1,2,3,4 via metal-catalysed carbene transfer from diazo compounds to olefins5,6,7,8 is among the best developed and most general cyclopropanations available. Enantioselective versions are documented, both with chiral metal complexes as catalysts and with engineered metalloenzymes. High effectiveness and stereocontrol have been accomplished with catalysts based on copper9, rhodium10 and ruthenium11. In particular, excellent levels of enantioselectivity have been achieved with copper(I) bisoxazoline complexes12 and with dinuclear rhodium(II) complexes, featuring chiral bidentate carboxylate, amidate or phosphate ligands13,14,15. A unique nickel carbene mediated cyclopropanation has also been reported16.

Biocatalytic, new-to-nature versions of this reaction were reported by Arnold et al. in 201317, using an engineered cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyses highly diastereo- and enantioselective cyclopropanations of styrenes with diazoesters. The Hartwig group developed iridium-modified myoglobins that catalyse the cyclopropanation of unactivated olefins18, and the Keasling group19 described a variant in which both the diazoester and the styrene were produced intracellularly. While the biocatalytic and the transition metal catalysed approaches are conceptually different, they share the initial formation of electrophilic metal carbenoids, which then engage in the actual olefin cyclopropanation (Fig. 1a). Despite these advancements, regioselectivity for substrates with multiple olefins remains a particularly challenging problem20,21,22,23. We became intrigued by the idea of designing a complementary organocatalytic approach that would not necessitate the involvement of metal carbenoids and could solve the regioselectivity problem. Organocatalytic cyclopropanations of olefins activated by an electron-withdrawing group have previously been reported24,25,26 but those of electronically unbiased olefins are unknown. Since organocatalytic activation modes for diazo alkanes or olefins, other than protonation by Brønsted acids, which appeared not to be suitable for the desired process, are not available, such a design immediately led to the challenge of how to organocatalytically activate simple olefins and/or diazo esters. We hypothesized that the abstraction of a single electron—arguably the most general strategy for activating any molecule—could be suitable here. Accordingly, we envisioned a catalytic cycle in which the olefin is activated as a radical cation upon single electron transfer to a photoexcited cationic organocatalyst associated with an enantiopure counteranion. The resulting highly reactive open-shell radical cation forms an ion pair with the enantiopure counteranion and is expected to undergo enantioselective carbon–carbon bond formation with the diazoalkane, accompanied by the loss of N2 to furnish a cyclopropane radical cation27,28,29. A final single electron transfer from the catalyst radical to this intermediate should then regenerate the cationic photocatalyst and deliver the desired cyclopropane product (Fig. 1b). This design is supported by a recently established radical cation-based photoredox catalytic cyclopropanation27 and by our own work on utilizing enantiopure counteranions in photoredox catalytic cycloadditions via olefin-derived radical cations30. The envisioned challenges associated with our concept are controlling the facial selectivity of a highly reactive open-shell radical cation intermediate and preventing the direct activation of diazoalkane to a free carbene via photolysis or energy transfer from the excited state photocatalyst, which could lead to racemic products31,32,33.

Herein, we report an organocatalytic regio- and stereoselective cyclopropanation of olefins, facilitated by asymmetric counteranion-directed photoredox catalysis (ACPC).

To initiate our investigation, we studied the cyclopropanation reaction of trans-anethole (1a) and diazoester 2a in a (1:1 v/v) solvent mixture of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and pentane at −100 °C under irradiation by 6 W of green light. We began by exchanging the counteranion of the synthesized thioxanthylium triflate34 organophotoredox catalyst with different confined imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi)35 anions (Fig. 2). Encouraged by our previous studies on IDPi-catalyzed transformations, we initially selected from our assortment of privileged IDPi anions. An IDPi catalyst possessing a para-tert-butyl group as 3,3′ substituent and a trifyl core (IDPi-A) delivered the corresponding cyclopropanated product with moderate yield, good enantioselectivity (80:20 er) and poor diastereoselectivity. An analogous meta-biphenyl IDPi (IDPi-B) gave improved yield (90%) and enantioselectivity (90:10 er). Using catalyst 4C where the 3,3′ substituents of the IDPi catalyst feature a combination of meta- and para-substitution, led to a further enhancement of the enantioselectivity (95:5 er) with a dr of roughly 3:1. Having identified an optimal catalyst towards enantioselectivity, we were keen to further improve the diastereoselectivity. In this regard, meta-,para-substituted catalysts were extensively evaluated (Supplementary Table 1), and among them, spirocyclic fluorenyl substitution on the 3,3′-positions of the BINOL was found to be suitable towards this aim (4D–F). To our delight, the modified spirocyclopentyl fluorenyl substitution on the 3,3′-positions of the BINOL (IDPi-E) delivered the product not only with excellent yield and enantioselectivity but also with excellent diastereoselectivity of >20:1. Finally, fine-tuning of the inner core sulfonamide from trifluoromethyl (IDPi-E) to n-perfluoroethyl (IDPi-F) enhanced the enantiomeric ratio from 97:3 to 99:1, maintaining the excellent yield and diastereoselectivity. Remarkably, even at −100 °C, catalyst 4F rapidly furnished product 3a in a short reaction time. Lowering the catalyst loading from 2.5 to 0.5 mol% still gave full conversion with high yield even though a slight reduction of enantioselectivity (96:4 er) was observed.

Optimization of the catalytic reaction for the evaluation of IDPi anions was carried out, and the yield was determined by 1H NMR using an internal standard.

Next, a broad range of olefins with different double bond location and substituents at different ring positions were evaluated (Fig. 3) in the reaction with diazoester derivatives, and the cyclopropane products were obtained with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Moreover, most of these products were obtained with excellent diastereoselectivities. 3-Ethyl anethole was found to be a suitable reaction partner and furnished product 3b with excellent enantioselectivity. Interestingly, 3,3-dimethyl anethole also delivered the desired product (3c) with excellent enantioselectivity, albeit with low diastereoselectivity. An olefin bearing an tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy (OTBS) substituent was also tolerated, providing product 3d with an er of 97:3 in 86% yield. Similarly, olefins featuring electron-withdrawing substituents and a heterocyclic ring furnished products 3e and 3f in excellent enantioselectivities. It is worth mentioning that other electron-rich heterocyclic olefins successfully engaged in our cyclopropanation and furnished products 3g and 3h with good to excellent level of enantioselectivity. Next, we focused on using electron neutral styrene derivatives as potential olefins for cyclopropanation. As their redox potential (>1.8 V) is higher than that of the used thioxanthylium photocatalyst (1.76 V), a photocatalyst featuring a higher redox potential was required. Gratifyingly, acridinium photocatalyst 5 (2.04 V), under red light irradiation, delivered products 3i and 3j with excellent enantioselectivity. Internal olefins gave products 3k and 3l in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. We explored different diazoesters and found that all of the different diazoesters gave the desired products (3m and 3n) with an excellent level of enantioselectivity. Additionally, a disubstituted diazoester was found to be a suitable partner for our cyclopropanation reaction and yielded the desired product 3o in good enantioselectivity and moderate diastereoselectivity. We also investigated a diazoalkanes featuring an N-H amide-, aromatic or aliphatic keto functionality, and all furnished the desired products (3p–r) with trans-anethole in moderate to good level of enantioselectivity. Finally, even trimethylsilyl-diazomethane reacted to product 3s with promising results.

Having successfully developed an organocatalytic cyclopropanation of olefins, we wondered whether our confined catalyst design may enable selectivity also with substrates bearing multiple olefins. For example, 2,5-dimethylhexa-2,4-diene (1t) is a symmetrical diene that has previously been used in the synthesis of chrysanthemic acid, a natural product also found in a variety of insecticides. In this case, the chemoselectivity issue towards obtaining the corresponding monocyclopropane has previously only been overcome by using a several fold excess of the diene23. Remarkably, using our organocatalyst system, chrysanthemic acid derivative 3t could be obtained selectively in good yield and good enantioselectivity for both diastereomers without requiring an excess of diene. Subsequently, a simple hydrolysis of ester 3t gave chrysanthemic acid (3u), preserving the enantioselectivity (Fig. 3b). We further explored the reactions of unsymmetrical conjugated dienes and trienes, delivering the desired products in good yield and enantioselectivities.

It is noteworthy that an unsymmetrical conjugated diene delivered product 3v with remarkable regioselectivity (>20:1 rr) and diastereoselectivity (>20:1 dr). A diene substrate bearing an additional pendant olefin functionality (1w) was also found to be suitable for our cyclopropanation. Even the reaction with conjugated and unsymmetrical triene 1x, posing a formidable regioselectivity challenge, selectively delivered product 3x (Fig. 3c). On the other hand, we also recognized the limitations of our reaction (Supplementary Fig. 2). Olefins bearing electron-withdrawing groups yielded the desired product in low amounts but with high enantioselectivity. Unfortunately, substrates containing amino-substituted aryl groups, indole-derived olefins, enol ethers and enamines remained unreactive under our reaction conditions. Additional diazo compounds were tested, furnishing the desired product in moderate to good yields with satisfactory enantioselectivity. However, we observed that acceptor–acceptor diazoalkanes did not undergo the transformation. Additionally, enantioenriched product 3a was derivatized to carboxylic acid product 6 without any loss of selectivities. Furthermore, a sequential reduction of the ethyl ester of 3a to the corresponding alcohol, followed by Steglich esterification gave ferrocene ester 7, the absolute configuration of which could be determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction.

During our reaction development, lowering the catalyst loading from 2.5 to 0.5 mol% still gave full conversion with a high yield. However, a slight reduction of enantioselectivity was observed (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the amount of diazoester was evaluated. Surprisingly, increasing the amount of the diazoester also led to a reduction of enantioselectivity (Fig. 4b). These two results hinted at a non-enantioselective, photochemical background pathway31,32,33. Since such a background reactivity may require a different wavelength, we were intrigued to explore light of different wavelengths. Indeed, a red shift was associated with a notable increase of enantioselectivity (Fig. 4c). To gain further insight into this phenomenon, we irradiated our model substrate 1a and diazoester 2a with blue or yellow light separately. Remarkably, irradiation with yellow light led to higher enantioselectivity, from 80% ee with blue light to 97% ee with yellow light. Similarly, when olefin substrates 1k and 1l were excited with yellow instead of blue light under similar conditions, an increase in enantioselectivity was observed. For example, for product 3l, the enantiomeric excess increased from 41.8% with blue light to 95.4% with yellow light (Fig. 4d).

To shed light on this unusual observation, we conducted absorption spectroscopy of diazoester and photocatalyst, where diazoester 2a has a maximum wavelenth of absorption (λmax) at 397 nm (Fig. 5a) and photocatalyst 4F has a λmax at 472 nm (Fig. 5b). Since the absorption band of photocatalyst 4F is very broad, the opportunity arose to excite the photocatalyst at different wavelengths and study the corresponding emission spectra. Photocatalyst 4F was excited at 472 nm (λmax) and also at a lower wavelength of 350 nm. Surprisingly, in addition to the usual emission spectra maximum at 627 nm, another maximum emission band was detected at 395 nm upon excitation at 350 nm (Fig. 5c). Interestingly the absorption band of the diazoester significantly superimposes with the emission band of the photocatalyst at lower wavelength (Fig. 5d), which led us to the hypothesis that it is this lower-wavelength excitation mode of the diazoester that is involved in the photochemical background pathway.

Q, quencher's concentration.

Steady-state fluorescence quenching experiments with the individual reactants were conducted to obtain Stern–Volmer plots and to identify the reagent that interacts with the excited state photocatalyst. Photocatalyst 4F was first excited at 470 nm, and quenching experiments were performed separately with different amount of anethole 1a and diazoester 2a. The corresponding Stern–Volmer plots (Fig. 5e) clearly indicate that anethole 1a is responsible for the fluorescence quenching, whereas diazoester 2a has virtually no effect at this concentration. A separate set of steady-state florescence quenching experiments was conducted where the photocatalyst 4F was excited at 350 nm. In contrast, the Stern–Volmer plot (Fig. 5f) shows significant fluorescence quenching with diazoester 2a. Further standard radical probe and radical clock experiments were conducted to rule out radical process and support the radical cation mechanism, which is in line with the mechanism proposed in literature (Supplementary Fig. 3). To gain further information regarding the stereo-specificity of our reaction, we conducted control experiment with Z-anethole (Supplementary Fig. 4). Interestingly, under our optimized conditions, all four possible diastereoisomers were obtained in good yields. Under the optimized condition, control experiments were performed where interconversion of anethole was not observed (Supplementary Fig. 4). These experiments further strengthen the stepwise mechanism, which is also in line with the literature. Additionally, the redox potentials of our reactants, catalyst and product were measured (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Key to the success of our organocatalytic cyclopropanation of olefins with diazoalkanes has been the use of ACPC, exploiting the positive charge of the olefin radical cation intermediate towards ion pairing with an enantiopure counteranion. Our methodology is useful for a broad range of substrates and complements previously reported metal and metalloenzyme catalyzed cyclopropanations. It also addresses the unsolved problem of regioselectivity in the reaction of substrates with different olefins. The observed wavelength-dependent enantioselectivity could serve as a valuable mechanistic probe for photoredox catalysis, potentially aiding in distinguishing between alternative reaction pathways. Observing enantioselectivity in ACPC at one wavelength confirms the involvement of radical cations in the enantiodifferentiating step, whereas its absence at this or another wavelength is consistent with alternative mechanistic pathways, such as energy transfer that proceed via neutral intermediates. Our results underscore the potential of ACPC for controlling the selectivity of radical cations in alkene manipulations, complementing previous reports.

The achiral anion of the photocatalysts was exchanged with the desired enantiopure anion using the salt metathesis technique. In a gas chromatography vial, photocatalyst (25–30 mg, 1.0 equiv.) and a corresponding chiral Brønsted acid catalyst (1.05 equiv.) were measured. Then, dichloromethane (300 μl) was added, followed by saturated NaHCO3 solution (1.1 equiv., 400 μl). The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min. Then, it was diluted with 1 ml of water and 1 ml of dichloromethane. The organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (5 ml x3). The organic layer was collected and dried with Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The obtained (>95% yield) solid colourful photocatalysts were used without further purification.

A gas chromatography glass vial was charged with a magnetic stirring bar and photocatalyst (0.025 equiv., 2.5 mol%). The photocatalyst was dissolved in a 1:1 (v/v) solvent mixture of CH2Cl2 and pentane (0.1 M with respect to 1a). At room temperature, anethole 1a (1 equiv.) was added followed by diazoester 2a (2 equiv.) in the dark. Then, the glass vial was transferred to a −100 °C cryostat and kept at this low temperature for 30 min and then irradiated with 6 W of green light. After the desired time, the light was switched off, and after 10 min, the reaction was then quenched with saturated K2CO3 in ethanol and allowed to warm up to room temperature. The crude reaction mixture was analysed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) using an internal standard and purified by SiO2 flash column chromatography using 5–10% acetone in pentane as eluent.

OK, who placed their bet on General Motors being the landing spot for Aurora co-founder and chief product officer Sterling Anderson? Not me. But here we are. A few days after Anderson announced his resignation from his position and the board at Aurora, he spoke to me about his next gig as chief product officer at GM. In short, he will oversee the entire product line of GM's gas-powered and electric vehicles — a position that will cover the entire life cycle of GM's portfolio and include hardware, software, services, and user experience.

Anderson couldn't say too much; plus, he hasn't started the job yet. Anderson did say he wouldn't have taken the new job if Aurora had yet to launch its commercial self-driving truck service in Texas. 

Let's jump into the rest of the news. 

In an absolutely wild turn of events, Luminar's founder Austin Russell appears to have been pushed out as CEO and board chair. You can read my coverage here, which provides a bit of an overview of how this unfolded, but I know there is so much more to this story. TL;DR: If you were to only read Luminar's Q1 earnings report, you would assume Russell was still at the helm. A separate press release, released as the company's earnings went out, announced a leadership change and that Russell had resigned following an ethics inquiry from the board's audit committee. 

Here's what I'm hearing from a few little birds. The word “blindsided” came up more than once, and the chaos isn't over. Luminar board member Jun Hong Heng, who is founder and chief investment officer at Crescent Cove Advisors and a mentor of Russell's, resigned a day later. Heng was also on the audit committee.

Aurora has had an odd couple of weeks filled with highs — driverless commercial service woohoo! — and twists — whoops, there goes a co-founder. To cap things off, Uber announced plans to offer $1 billion in exchangeable senior notes due in 2028 in private placement. As you might expect, stocks dropped after investors got spooked about potential dilution and what this might mean for the value of Aurora's stock. 

Other deals that got my attention …

AutoUnify, the latest startup that has launched out of the Up.Labs-Porsche partnership, raised $5 million in seed money. The Santa Monica, California-based startup, which built an API to allow dealerships and service shops to communicate in real time with the manufacturers and software vendors that power their operations, has been operating quietly for about nine months.

Chinese battery manufacturer CATL is far from a startup. But it's worth noting this bananas IPO plan. The company wants to raise at least HK$31.01 billion — that's just shy of $4 billion — in its Hong Kong listing. This is the largest listing globally in 2025. 

Here's a potential deal that has raised some eyebrows. Federal railroad regulators are in talks with Elon Musk's tunneling firm, The Boring Company, over a multibillion-dollar Amtrak project.

Flock Freight, the shared truckload freight brokerage based in California, raised $60 million in a Series E funding round led by O'Neil Strategic Capital. Susquehanna Private Equity Investments, SignalFire, GLP Capital Partners, and Bracket Capital also participated.

Tesla's plan to launch a robotaxi service in Austin next month has caught the attention of federal safety investigators. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation sent the company a detailed list of questions on its upcoming robotaxi service as part of an investigation into how the company's “Full Self-Driving (Supervised)” software operates in low-visibility conditions.

Recalls are starting to pop up more in the AV sector. Last week it was Zoox. Now Waymo has issued a software recall on 1,200 self-driving vehicles after some of its robotaxis were involved in minor collisions with gates, chains, and other gate-like roadway objects. 

WeRide seems to be trying to ramp in Guangzhou. The Chinese company said it has introduced eight autonomous robotaxi pilot operation routes in the central part of the city. The company has also started trialing fully driverless robotaxis in Abu Dhabi.

General Motors has been working on a new battery chemistry called lithium manganese-rich, which it says should slash costs while delivering driving range. Notably, these LMR batteries dramatically reduce the amount of nickel and cobalt compared with GM's most advanced cells, two critical minerals that aren't readily available from domestic sources in the United States.

A footnote in Lucid's recent Q1 regulatory filing gives a bit more insight into its sales numbers. The EV maker's record quarter got a lift from rental sales and company leases.

Slate Auto has racked up more than 100,000 reservations for its customizable low-cost electric pickup truck. 

Everyone, let's give a slow clap to Toyota for redesigning — and more importantly, renaming — its sole all-electric vehicle for the U.S. market. The EV, once called the bZ4X, will now simply be bZ. The original bZ4X was not well received. I'm looking forward to getting behind the wheel to see what improvements Toyota has made. Meanwhile, Toyota has brought back the C-HR nameplate, but this time as an EV. Hopefully this time it's more successful. It arrives in the U.S. in 2026.

Three years ago, reporter Rebecca Bellan noted that Uber was going through an Amazonification. Her pitch was that the company, like Amazon, had created a closed business loop to feed customers back into other Uber channels. The second part of that evolution has started, she reported this week. Uber appears to be moving beyond its focus on transportation and working to become a convenient super app, an aggregator of services, a daily-use lifestyle platform with its best offerings tucked behind a paywall. 

U.S. lawmakers introduced the Supersonic Aviation Modernization Act in a bid to revise the FAA's 52-year ban on supersonic flight over U.S. soil. The timing could be crucial for startup Boom Supersonic, which has made progress in developing next-generation supersonic aircraft 

Vertical Aerospace announced a plan to develop a hybrid-electric variant of its VX4, suggesting the company is pursuing opportunities in defense and logistics. 

Apple's next generation of its popular CarPlay infotainment software is finally launching. Reminder: It was first announced three years ago. The new version, called CarPlay Ultra, will make its debut on new Aston Martin vehicles in the U.S. and Canada. 

Google is bringing Gemini, its generative AI, to all cars that support Android Auto in the next few months. Patrick Brady, VP of Android for Cars, said Gemini will surface in the Android Auto experience in two main ways.

The Nuclear Company is taking an old approach to building new nuclear reactors. Rather than gin up a new design or try to mass manufacture smaller reactors, it wants to develop a series of reactors using existing designs.

The two-year-old startup announced a Series A last month that included investments from CIV, Eclipse, Goldcrest Capital, MCJ Collective, True Ventures, and Wonder Ventures, though it did not disclose the amount raised. Now, TechCrunch has learned that the company has secured $51.3 million in a Series A, bringing the company's total funding to $70 million.

The Nuclear Company was founded in 2023 by three serial entrepreneurs: former AppHarvest CEO Jonathan Webb, Arcadia CEO Kiran Bhatraju, and CIV CEO Patrick Maloney. The startup is prioritizing sites that already have permits or licenses to operate. Fewer than a dozen sites fall under that rubric, according to filings for combined operating licenses and early site permits at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 

At the sites that are closer to groundbreaking, each can support reactors with more than 1 gigawatt of generation capacity. The Nuclear Company is aiming to develop 6 gigawatts in its first fleet.

The funding round arrives as tech companies and utilities are struggling to secure power for data centers. Demand for electricity in the U.S. is expected to surge nearly 16% by 2029, according to Grid Strategies, after years of steady consumption. Data centers are a large driver; their electricity use could quadruple by the end of the decade.

In the face of potential power shortages, tech companies have been cozying up to nuclear startups and developers. Google is working with Kairos to build 500 megawatts' worth of small modular reactors (SMR), while Amazon participated in a massive $700 million round to fund X-energy's SMR plans. Meta has solicited proposals from developers to build up to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity, and Microsoft is working with Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island.

But nuclear power is facing headwinds, both expected and unexpected. Competition from solar power is among the former: Tech companies and data center operators have been snapping up capacity from solar farms, signing sizable deals. These farms are frequently paired with massive batteries to provide 24/7 electricity. The technology is inexpensive, and new projects can be developed in around 18 months.

Nuclear may soon face other financial hurdles, too. This week, the House Ways and Means Committee published its draft of a reconciliation bill that would kill subsidies for nuclear power that were granted under the Inflation Reduction Act. Nuclear power plants are currently eligible for tax credits up to $15 per megawatt-hour.

Most new nuclear power plants, including those on The Nuclear Company's timeline, aren't expected to come online until the early 2030s. Given that forecasts for the next five years vary wildly, massive nuclear plants entering service a decade from now could be stuck holding the bag.

Update: Added final Series A fundraise details and total funding amount.

Nothing is teasing new products again. Most of the time, given Nothing's frequent product cadence, that phenomenon could just be referred to as any day of the week, but this time things feel different. Earlier this week, Nothing announced a partnership with KEF—a well-established hi-fi audio brand—to bring us… something. That something, as it turns out, could very well be an AirPods Max or Sony WH-1000XM6 competitor.

In a YouTube video on Friday, Nothing confirmed that it's expanding its audio lineup outside of wireless earbuds and into over-ear headphones. The company says they're launching “this summer,” and more info will be available in “the coming months.” While Nothing didn't give much detail on what to expect from its first-ever over-ear entrant, one thing you can count on—especially if KEF is involved—is that it will almost for sure be the company's most expensive audio product to date.

And that steeper price looks like it might not just be for audio gear. What I'm trying to say is: buckle up, transparent gadget lovers, cause things might be careening toward a big premium pothole.

First off, let's talk about the KEF collab. While we don't have a ton of details, we can make some semi-safe assumptions off the bat. The safest, arguably, is that this will be a hi-fi audio product.

In a statement announcing the partnership, KEF says, “Our six decades of high-fidelity audio expertise will support Nothing's expansion into new audio categories—bringing acoustic precision to products shaped by Nothing's distinct approach to design and user experience.”

That suggests/confirms that hi-fi is still the name of the game and that this collab will be an “expansion” of some kind. It's that second part that really gets my gears turning. Though, again, we can't say for sure what the collab will produce, my money is on one of two things: the aforementioned pair of over-ear headphones or, more tantalizingly—a full-on speaker.

And as I mentioned before, if there's one thing that hi-fi audio connotes, it's an even higher price tag. While KEF does make a spectrum of products across different price points, speakers tend to start at dollar amounts that are inching toward $1,000+.

And headphones are a similar story. KEF's Mu7 over-ear headphones cost $400, which isn't unattainable compared to the broad field of premium over-ear competitors, but they're certainly pricier than any audio gear that Nothing has dabbled in to date. Whatever this collaboration produces, you can expect to pay handsomely to own it. And that's just the start.

In a showcase on the Android Show, Nothing CEO Carl Pei teased—you guessed it—another upcoming product in arguably the company's most competitive category: phones.

The Phone 3, which Pei says is coming this summer, will be a step up for Nothing in the phone space and mark its first real flagship-level device. According to Pei, the Phone 3 will have “premium materials, major performance upgrades, and software that really levels things up.”

As someone who's tested pretty much every Nothing phone to date, I'm excited to see what that means in practice, but also maybe not as excited to see what that means for my wallet. Pei also adds in his teaser that the Phone 3 will cost about £800, which is about $1,060 USD, compared to the company's recently released mid-range $380 Phone (3a) and $460 Phone (3a) Pro.

Am I shocked that Nothing seems to be inching toward the premium sector? Not particularly. Pei's goal from the start was to challenge Apple with eye-catching transparent designs and fast and smooth bespoke software, and to do that, it will have to compete on the iPhone's hallowed ground, which is to say, in the flagship arena.

Whether Nothing has actually summoned the acumen, resources, and clout to do that is another question entirely, but I look forward to seeing its best effort. My wallet on the other hand… TBD.

I'd always known Doom was a highly regarded video game franchise. Still, up until now I'd only watched from the sidelines—seeing an amalgamation of wild Let's Plays of its chaotic run-and-gun combat in my poor college days, witnessing folks play it on unconventional computer appliances, and blasting composer Mick Gordon's heavy metal original soundtrack in my leisure without fully grasping the context to why its gnarly songs went so unbelievably hard on Doom (2016).

Now, with id Software and Bethesda Softworks' latest entry in the 32-year-old first-person-shooter series, Doom: The Dark Ages, serving as a prequel to its newly christened trilogy—while wedding two action genres I have a high affinity for and am coming around to, sci-fi and fantasy—I've finally jumped into the deep end on the series with its newly released game on my PlayStation 5.

I went into Doom: The Dark Ages expecting its signature FPS chaos mixed with the demonic, style-switching combat I love in the Devil May Cry—a series I use as my metric for action games. I got something far more wild: a Doom game that somehow also channels other greats like Halo and Gears of War and yet remains purely, unapologetically Doom, packed with relentless action and satanic madness unlike anything I've played before.

After sleeping on the series for too long, I'm wide awake now—Doom absolutely fucking rocks.

As a prequel, Doom: The Dark Ages eases players into its mayhem, setting the stage for an all-out war between alien overlords, medieval warriors, and hell's demons. The game sees Doom Slayer under some mind control, caught in a battle where Tonka-toy-built knights (equipped with high-tech comms like the Avengers) face off against a horde led by a warlord rocking Dracula's muscle armor. Early on, Doom Slayer is treated with the same gravitas as a Final Fantasy summon, given a simple directive: annihilate everything in his path with the same cold efficiency as a walking nuclear weapon.

The Dark Ages‘ story? It's there. Granted, it mainly serves as an epic backdrop, blending dark fantasy with a touch of sci-fi, all while ferrying players from one bonkers WatchMojo “Top 10 Insane Doom Slayer Kills” video moment to the next. Among the standout sequences that had me sit forward in my chair were Doom Slayer piloting a giant mech like a Pacific Rim veteran—and riding the back of a cybernetic dragon armed with a matching gun that looked like it was lifted straight off a metal album cover.

Even beyond Dark Age‘s massive set-piece spectacles, its moment-to-moment gameplay is pure old-school gaming bliss. Throughout the game's 22 levels, frenzied players run and gun through an ambush of demons, grabbing shields, ammo, and health potions littered around the battlefield or offered as an incentive for ripping and tearing through demons with their bare hands.

Despite the sheer chaos of the Dark Ages‘ setting, its combat is where it truly shines, offering a wealth of strategy beneath the madness. As its killer box art suggests, Doom Slayer fights off demons with firearms that drop from the sky like orbital supply capsules, ensuring each battle feels like an escalating arms race where hell is on the back foot. New weapons enter your arsenal at every level, allowing customization and fluid switching via the weapon wheel. After adapting to the speed and ferocity required to survive as the Doomslayer, I found myself favoring the following weapons:

Another pleasantly surprising part of Dark Age‘s combat that felt as rewarding to solve as its combat encounters was platforming its environmental puzzles. I found Dark Ages' emphasis on stopping and smelling the roses by heavily encouraging exploration to be just as much of a brain teaser as its experimental offering of combat combinations. Exploration is heavily promoted, and Dark Ages continuing the series' implementation of a map that smartly separates hard progress from side content with icons and markers for where hidden items like gold and gems to upgrade equipment was a godsend, making it easy to double back and hunt down upgrades, codex entries, or skins without losing momentum. I found it the perfect blend of action and curiosity-driven exploration for a game about killing demons.

And then there's the Shield Saw—a new weapon introduced in Dark Ages that I doubted would fit Doom's FPS combat. But once I mastered it, it became my favorite weapon in its inventory.

While I was initially apprehensive over whether or not the game's implementation of a shield would bog down its lightning-fast combat, it quickly became my favorite weapon in the game. Not just because it saved my ass a ton in sticky situations, but for how much more texture its added to its gameplay. The Shield Saw isn't just for blocking oncoming sword slashes and fireballs; it also doubles as a Mjolnir-like tool, letting you grapple to secret areas to uncover treasure, execute enemies with a shield bash, or ricochet into a line of overheated enemy shields from a hail of the Doom Slayer's gunfire for explosive crowd control. By far, my favorite use case for the shield saw was with its perfect parries.

Like in Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Dark Ages‘ Shield Saw transforms parrying into a high-stakes rhythm game, rewarding players who seek out oncoming green fire balls and sword slashes and send them flying back at enemies. Even if I was underleveled in a brutal boss fight, or fighting uphill in a handicap battle, a perfectly timed parry could turn the tide in my favor and eke out a satisfyingly primal win in an otherwise unwinnable battle. The DMC sicko in me loved the sheer Royal Guard-style power the Shield Saw empowered me with, letting me stunlock enemies in the most disrespectful way possible.

While melee combat in some games takes a backseat, here it's everything, not just for style, but for survival. Landing brutal in-your-face punches (or mace flails) funnels health-regenerating orbs, shields, and ammo into Doom Slayer like a vacuum. The game rewards ruthless aggression, encouraging players to embrace the chaos, chain Glory Kill whenever possible, and dominate the battlefield instead of hiding behind cover and playing it safe.

Oddly enough, my biggest gripe with the game is its soundtrack. It never hit as hard as I wanted it to. While it does an okay job of underscoring the game's bedlam, it never quite amplifies the gunplay, shield throws, and eyebrow-raising boss reveals the way I felt it should. If anything, it went unnoticed the more I played; even to a newbie, that struck me as a sacrilegious takeaway from the game.

A few hours in, I barely noticed the music ramping up before fights, like it was struggling to punch above its weight (more than I was in a boss fight) to match the sheer insanity on screen. Finishing Move (known for Borderlands 3, Halo Wars 2, and The Callisto Protocol) composed the soundtrack, but for a game like Dark Ages, music needed to be a driving force, not just background noise. Eventually, I turned Dark Ages‘ music volume down and blasted Gordon's old tracks instead to make up for what the game lacked sonically.

Overall, Doom: The Dark Ages is an electrifying genre mash-up and an incredible entry point into the franchise that lives up to the hype it's garnered over the past 30 years, and I'm glad I stopped sleeping on it.

Doom: The Dark Ages is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

The Nuclear Company is taking an old approach to building new nuclear reactors. Rather than gin up a new design or try to mass manufacture smaller reactors, it wants to develop a series of reactors using existing designs.

The two-year-old startup announced a Series A last month that included investments from CIV, Goldcrest Capital, MCJ Collective, True Ventures, and Wonder Ventures, though it did not disclose the amount raised. Now, TechCrunch can confirm that the company has secured $46.3 million in a Series A fundraise out of a targeted $51.3 million total. The details were published in an SEC filing.

The Nuclear Company was founded in 2023 by three serial entrepreneurs: former AppHarvest CEO Jonathan Webb, Arcadia CEO Kiran Bhatraju, and CIV CEO Patrick Maloney. The startup is prioritizing sites that already have permits or licenses to operate. Fewer than a dozen sites fall under that rubric, according to filings for combined operating licenses and early site permits at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 

At the sites that are closer to groundbreaking, each can support reactors with more than 1 gigawatt of generation capacity. The Nuclear Company is aiming to develop 6 gigawatts in its first fleet.

The funding round arrives as tech companies and utilities are struggling to secure power for data centers. Demand for electricity in the U.S. is expected to surge nearly 16% by 2029, according to Grid Strategies, after years of steady consumption. Data centers are a large driver; their electricity use could quadruple by the end of the decade.

In the face of potential power shortages, tech companies have been cozying up to nuclear startups and developers. Google is working with Kairos to build 500 megawatts' worth of small modular reactors (SMR), while Amazon participated in a massive $700 million round to fund X-energy's SMR plans. Meta has solicited proposals from developers to build up to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity, and Microsoft is working with Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island.

But nuclear power is facing headwinds, both expected and unexpected. Competition from solar power is among the former: Tech companies and data center operators have been snapping up capacity from solar farms, signing sizable deals. These farms are frequently paired with massive batteries to provide 24/7 electricity. The technology is inexpensive, and new projects can be developed in around 18 months.

Nuclear may soon face other financial hurdles, too. This week, the House Ways and Means Committee published its draft of a reconciliation bill that would kill subsidies for nuclear power that were granted under the Inflation Reduction Act. Nuclear power plants are currently eligible for tax credits up to $15 per megawatt-hour.

Most new nuclear power plants, including those on The Nuclear Company's timeline, aren't expected to come online until the early 2030s. Given that forecasts for the next five years vary wildly, massive nuclear plants entering service a decade from now could be stuck holding the bag.

Epic Games claims that Apple is blocking its Fortnite app from the U.S. and EU App Stores.

After winning a decisive victory for app developers in a legal battle with Apple, forcing the tech giant to allow external payments in its U.S. App Store without charging commission, Epic Games attempted to resubmit Fortnite to the U.S. App Store on May 9, 2025.

However, Apple failed to accept its submission for a week, leading Epic Games to pull its request and try again. According to Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, the update was pulled because Epic Games needs to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content, and all platforms must be updated simultaneously.

The company then submitted a new version to the U.S. App Store for review on Wednesday, May 14, with the updated content. 

In a Friday morning post on X, Fortnite said that Apple has blocked its latest U.S. submission and has made it so Epic Games can't release its app to the European Union, either. 

“Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it,” the post from Fortnite reads.

TechCrunch reached out to Epic Games and Apple to learn more and will update if further information is provided.

Veteran Chipotle executive Jack Hartung was appointed a member of Tesla's board of directors Thursday, according to a Tesla filing with the SEC. Hartung's addition to the board comes as Tesla quietly works to finish its 1950s-style diner and charging station in Los Angeles. 

Hartung brings over two decades of experience as a Chipotle CFO, president, and chief strategy officer to Tesla's board. He has overseen all finance and accounting at Chipotle, as well as supply chain, strategy, and safety and asset protection as the company has grown to over 3,700 restaurants across the U.S. and globally. 

Prior to Chipotle, Hartung spent almost 20 years at McDonald's, where he served as VP and CFO of the restaurant chain's partner brands group. 

While Hartung's business and financial acumen are likely transferable across industries, his debut on Tesla's board comes as the company gears up to launch the above-mentioned retro-futuristic diner and charging station in LA. Last August, Tesla advertised a role for a Tesla Diner Experience Specialist to work with the charging team to build out great customer service at the up-and-coming diner. 

TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla and Hartung to learn if the Chipotle executive will offer strategic insight and a network of contacts in the food and beverage industry. 

Tesla's regulatory filing announcing Hartung's appointment also discloses a related-party transaction; his son-in-law has worked as a Tesla service technician since December 2016, and last year took home a $124,000 salary. Tesla says this salary is in line with the company's standard compensation practices. 

Hartung will begin his duties on the board, including on the audit committee, effective June 1. He has waived his ability to collect cash compensation, as well as his equity compensation, as the other board members have done.

There's chlorine in your drinking water, America. Or maybe there's a different chlorine compound called chloramine. This isn't meant to alarm you, though of course it's alarming to many. An entire industry of faucet and countertop and shower filters has sprung up specifically to remove chlorine compounds from the water you drink and bathe in, whether for reasons of health or flavor or beauty.

After all, chlorine tastes and smells bad; some people are sensitive to its aroma even in tiny amounts. It also potentially messes with your hair dye and dries out your skin. Plus, few people realllllly want to drink chlorine, if you ask them. Hence, water filters like WIRED's best-tested shower filter, the Canopy Filtered Showerhead, designed to remove chlorine before you wash with it.

But note that the chlorine is entirely supposed to be there. The US Centers for Disease Control has hailed water chlorination as one of the greatest public health advances of the 20th century, alongside such obscure triumphs as “penicillin” and “the polio vaccine.”

Extremely low concentrations of chlorine or chlorine compounds, generally around 1 part per million—well below the Environmental Protection Agency's acceptable limits for human consumption—are added to water pipes to kill potential germs like typhoid and cholera and E. coli that might otherwise grow in water and shorten your life or make it briefly awful. Home filters are designed to remove chlorine after it's already done its job in the pipes.

But if you do buy filters for your drinking water or shower water, there's a complicating factor. More than half of big US cities don't use chlorine, in part because free chlorine in water is highly reactive and has a short half-life and can interact with other substances to create harmful compounds thought to be carcinogenic. More than half of the country's largest cities instead use chloramine, a more stable and persistent chlorine compound.

If you're trying to filter out chlorine compounds, it matters which one your city is using. New York, Atlanta, and Chicago use chlorine in their water systems. But Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Boston use chloramine in their water.

Chloramine has some potential advantages over chlorine. The aroma is generally perceived as less pronounced in drinking water. Chloramine's longer half-life and longer persistence in pipes also means health authorities can use lower quantities and still maintain levels needed to disinfect pipes.

But chloramine's relative stability can also make it harder to filter out of water than pure chlorine, especially using shower water filters that rely on chemical reactions to neutralize chlorine. While chloramine will oxidize relatively quickly in open air when exposed to light, brewers in cities that use chloramine often use chemical tablets to neutralize chloramine.

Knowing which substance your city uses will help you determine which filters will work best to get rid of it. The certification arm of the National Science Foundation, which has seen drastic and systematic cutbacks in recent months under DOGE, traditionally offers reliable testing standards for chlorine removal for water filters, certifying chlorine removal over thousands of gallons of water. And so if your city uses chlorine, the most reliable gauge of a water filter's effectiveness has generally been whether it's been tested and certified to NSF standards.

For shower filters, the standard for chlorine filtration is NSF/ANSI standard 177. Most makers of shower water filters in particular have not received certification and don't share independent data. But there's at least one exception in the United States: The Weddell Duo inline shower filter is certified to remove chlorine from water systems treated with free chlorine.

For chloramine systems, the NSF doesn't offer a specific standard, muddying the waters a bit. So I did my own testing using home lab kits designed for pools and aquariums. In general, I found that filters that used activated or catalyzed carbon and multistage filters appeared to fare better at removing chloramine levels.

Specifically, our testing indicated that only a few shower filters on the market removed chloramine down to undetectable levels, in cities with chloraminated systems. These included the Canopy Filtered Showerhead ($170), the Afina A-01 Filtered Showerhead ($129), the Hydroviv Filtered Showerhead ($200), and the Curo Filtered Showerhead ($109).

Which is to say: Knowing which chemical your city uses might help you determine which filter is best able to remove chlorine and chlorine compounds from your system. Here's the list for the top 50 most populous cities in the United States. (But note that some cities that use chlorine sometimes temporarily switch to chlorine to disinfect their systems, and vice versa.)

Plenty of connections, but still svelte

In high-end laptops, thin is always in, but that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice connectivity. Acer's new Swift Edge 14 AI, leading its ultraportable lineup ahead of Computex in Taipei, is a sleek notebook that weighs less than 1 kilogram (approximately 2.18 pounds) but still has plenty of ports.

Acer Swift Edge 14 AI

CPU

Up to Intel Core Ultra 9 288V

Graphics

Up to Intel Arc graphics 140V (integrated)

RAM

Up to 32GB LPDDR5x

Storage

Up to 1TB PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD

Display

14-inch, 2880 x 1800, OLED touchscreen, matte

Battery

65 WHr

Wireless Connectivity

Intel Killer Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4

Weight

2.18 pounds (0.99 kg)

The Swift Edge 14 AI will use Intel's "Lunar Lake" chips, ranging from a Core Ultra 5 226V up to a Core Ultra 9 288V, with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD storage. That's all in a chassis that's 0.65 inches thick.

It's notable that Acer isn't skimping on ports here. While many 13, 14, and even some 15-inch laptops have dropped to just a pair of USB-C ports, Acer's got two USB Type-C ports (supporting Thunderbolt 4), a pair of USB Type-A ports, HDMI 2.1, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. That's a lot of connectivity on the go. We saw this with HP's OmniBook 7 Aero, but that much I/O on an ultrabook is still pretty rare these days.Like many high-end laptops, Acer's chassis is built from a mix of magnesium and aluminum. But unlike those laptops, the company is pushing a "soft-touch" keyboard that the company says has a "unique UV-cured coating that feels like velvet and is wear- and stain-resistant." We didn't get too much time to play with this keyboard, but we're certainly hoping it stays clean in the long term, especially considering this is a white laptop.Acer is promising up to 21 hours of battery life from the 65 WHr battery, but doesn't say how it got there. If it comes close, that would match the longest-lasting laptop we've ever tested.

Unfortunately, Acer hasn't removed the weird AI indicator light from its touchpad, which glows whenever you use the NPU or use Copilot (which uses the internet and does not run locally). It is, at best, a distraction.

Acer is also using Computex as a launch pad for its Swift Go 14 AI and Swift Go 16 AI, each with OLED displays and media controls built into the touchpad. All of these Swift laptops have 1080p webcams with IR support for Windows Hello.North American pricing and availability haven't been revealed just yet. Acer said that this information will be announced "closer to market availability." In Europe, the Swift Edge will release in June, while Australia has a more vague "Q2" release date. The Swift Go 16 AI and Swift 14 AI will ship in July and August in Europe, respectively.

The AI industry has promised to “disrupt” large parts of society, and you need look no further than the U.S. educational system to see how effectively it's done that. Education has been “disrupted,” all right. In fact, the disruption is so broad and so shattering that it's not clear we're ever going to have a functional society again.

Probably the most unfortunate and pathetic snapshot of the current chaos being unfurled on higher education is a recent story by New York magazine that revealed the depths to which AI has already intellectually addled an entire generation of college students. The story, which involves interviews with a host of current undergraduates, is full of anecdotes like the one that involves Chungin “Roy” Lee, a transfer to Columbia University who used ChatGPT to write the personal essay that got him through the door:

When he started at Columbia as a sophomore this past September, he didn't worry much about academics or his GPA. “Most assignments in college are not relevant,” he told me. “They're hackable by AI, and I just had no interest in doing them.” While other new students fretted over the university's rigorous core curriculum, described by the school as “intellectually expansive” and “personally transformative,” Lee used AI to breeze through with minimal effort. When I asked him why he had gone through so much trouble to get to an Ivy League university only to off-load all of the learning to a robot, he said, “It's the best place to meet your co-founder and your wife.”

The cynical view of America's educational system—that it is merely a means by which privileged co-eds can make the right connections, build “social capital,” and get laid—is obviously on full display here. If education isn't actually about learning anything, and is merely a game for the well-to-do, why not rig that game as quickly, efficiently, and cynically as possible? AI capitalizes on this cynical worldview, exploiting the view-holder and making them stupider while also profiting from them.

When you think about the current assault on the educational system, it's easy to forget how quickly this has all happened. A more recent story from 404 Media shows that the American educational system was largely caught unawares by the deluge of cheating that the AI industry would inspire. After accumulating thousands of pages of school district documents via FOIA requests from around the country, 404's Jason Koebler found that ChatGPT has “become one of the biggest struggles in American education.” Koebler's reporting notes that, in the early days of the AI deluge, school districts were courted by “pro-AI consultants” who were known to give presentations that “largely encouraged teachers to use generative AI in their classrooms.” For instance, Koebler writes that the Louisiana Department of Education sent him…

…a presentation it said it consulted called “ChatGPT and AI in Education,” made by Holly Clark, the author of The AI Infused Classroom, Ken Shelton, the author of The Promises and Perils of AI in Education, and Matt Miller, the author of AI for Educators. The presentation includes slides that say AI “is like giving a computer a brain so it can learn and make decisions on its own,” note that “it's time to rethink ‘plagiarism' and ‘cheating,'” alongside a graph of how students can use AI to help them write essays, “20 ways to use ChatGPT in the classroom,” and “Warning: Going back to writing essays—only in class—can hurt struggling learners and doesn't get our kids ready for their future.”

In other words, AI acolytes seemed to anticipate that the technology would effectively ruin essay-writing and test-taking, and wanted to spin it to present the ruination as mere “transformation”—a new way of doing things—instead of a destructive force that would devastate education.

This new way of doing things appears to be corrosive not just to students but also to teachers. Koebler's investigation shows that the AI lobbyists courted schools by making appeals to instructors, showing them that the likes of ChatGPT would make curriculum-building and assignment-giving that much easier. Now, teachers, too, seem to be taking the easy way out, as a recent New York Times story shows that college professors have been using chatbots to create their lesson plans, just as their students are using them to complete said lesson.

The result of all of this is so obvious that it doesn't really bear repeating, but I guess will anyways: Everybody who uses AI is going to get exponentially stupider, and the stupider they get, the more they'll need to use AI to be able to do stuff that they were previously able to do with their minds. The tech industry's subscriber-based, “as-a-service” model is obviously on full display here, except that the subscription will be to intellectual capacity. The more you subscribe, the less “organic” capacity you'll have. Eventually, companies will be able to pipe AI directly into your brain with the kind of neuro-implants being hawked by Neuralink and Apple. By then, of course, there will be no need for school, as we'll all just be part of the Borg collective.

All leaks point towards an MCM design for the high-end variants.

AMD is reportedly going big on core-counts with Zen 6 mobile next-generation, as suggested by a new rumor from HXL, backed by several other leakers. Codenamed "Medusa Point", these APUs will reportedly carry up to 22 hybrid cores, based on Zen 6, with classic, dense, and low-power options. Since Zen 6 is at least a year off, and mobile versions might not arrive until early 2027, we need to be careful about putting too much faith in this leak.

Medusa Point is slated to be the follow-up to AMD's current Zen 5-based Strix Point APU series. We probably won't see a direct shift to Medusa Point as AMD is reportedly working on the Gorgon Point (Strix Point refresh) family, planned as an intermediate step.

That being said, architecturally, Medusa Point will switch to the Zen 6 architecture, which should be detailed by AMD sometime around Computex next year. The graphics engine will allegedly adopt the updated RDNA 3.5+ design, though RDNA 4 would've been the ideal choice for many. It's probable RDNA 4 won't make its way to the APU landscape, since AMD's next-generation graphics architecture, UDNA 1 / RDNA 5, is projected for release during the same timeframe.

The mainstream Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 offerings from Medusa Point have been purported to feature up to 10 hybrid cores, divided across four classic Zen 6 cores, four dense Zen 6c cores, and two new LP (Low Power) cores. These LP cores are very likely smaller than their Zen 6c siblings, with their Voltage/Frequency operation tweaked for maximum efficiency. This is complemented by an eight Compute Unit equipped RDNA 3.5+ based graphics engine, similar to the Radeon 860M. The iGPU is a downgrade from the current 16-CU design on the Radeon 890M, but this was likely done to free up space on the chip for other components.

Medusa Point 1R5/R7=4C+4D+2LP+8CU RDNA 3.5+R9=12C CCD+4C+4D+2LP+8CU RDNA 3.5+APU=IOD👀May 16, 2025

RDNA 3.5+ is essentially the second refresh in the RDNA 3 line, and will likely bring various improvements on the machine-learning side, which could very well unlock FSR 4 functionality. These mainstream Ryzen 5/Ryzen 7 configurations are likely based on a monolithic design, expected to use a 3nm class node from TSMC.

Following that, next-generation APUs are shaping up to be thrilling for enthusiasts, as Ryzen 9 Medusa Point options have been rumored with a massive (up to) 22-core layout: a 12-core Zen 6 CCD (likely the same as Venice), four classic Zen 6 cores, four dense Zen 6c cores, and two LP cores. This strongly points to an MCM (Multi Chip Module) layout, where the 10-core chiplet with I/O and the iGPU from the mainstream (Ryzen 5/7) Medusa Point line would be connected alongside a beefier desktop/server-grade CCD with 12 cores, expected to be based on TSMC's N2 process.

Other details, such as the memory controllers, NPU, and cache configurations, have not been mentioned. We'll have to wait and see what RDNA 3.5+ offers, especially with Intel's new Celestial architecture arriving soon in Panther Lake. Based on preliminary specifications, AMD will likely take the lead on the CPU side versus Panther Lake. However, depending on when Medusa Point hits the market, its main competitor in the mobile space might end up being Nova Lake.

Plus: Grok's fixation on white genocide was the result of an unauthorized modification, xAI says

This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.

This baby boy was treated with the first personalized gene-editing drug

Doctors say they constructed a bespoke gene-editing treatment in less than seven months and used it to treat a baby with a deadly metabolic condition. The rapid-fire attempt to rewrite the child's DNA marks the first time gene editing has been tailored to treat a single individual.The baby who was treated, Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr., suffers from a rare metabolic condition caused by a particularly unusual gene misspelling. Researchers say their attempt to correct the error demonstrates the high level of precision new types of gene editors offer.

The project also highlights what some experts are calling a growing crisis in gene-editing technology. That's because even though the technology could cure thousands of genetic conditions, most are so rare that companies could never recoup the costs of developing a treatment for them.

Access to experimental medical treatments is expanding across the US

—Jessica Hamzelou

A couple of weeks ago I was in Washington, DC, for a gathering of scientists, policymakers, and longevity enthusiasts. They had come together to discuss ways to speed along the development of drugs and other treatments that might extend the human lifespan.

One approach that came up was to simply make experimental drugs more easily accessible. Now, the state of Montana has passed a new bill that sets out exactly how clinics can sell experimental, unproven treatments in the state to anyone who wants them.

The passing of the bill could make Montana something of a US hub for experimental treatments. But it represents a wider trend: the creep of Right to Try across the US. And a potentially dangerous departure from evidence-based medicine. Read the full story.

One more thingWe've never understood how hunger works. That might be about to change.

When you're starving, hunger is like a demon. It awakens the most ancient and primitive parts of the brain, then commandeers other neural machinery to do its bidding until it gets what it wants.

Although scientists have had some success in stimulating hunger in mice, we still don't really understand how the impulse to eat works. Now, some experts are following known parts of the neural hunger circuits into uncharted parts of the brain to try and find out.

Their work could shed new light on the factors that have caused the number of overweight adults worldwide to skyrocket in recent years. And it could also help solve the mysteries around how and why a new class of weight-loss drugs seems to work so well. Read the full story.

In 1946, Harvard purchased what they believed to be a cheap copy of Magna Carta for $25.70. It turned out to be a screaming deal, because the document is actually a rare early 14th-century edition estimated to be worth millions.

The document was buried in the Harvard Law School Library's archives until 2023, when David Carpenter, professor of medieval history at King's College London, identified it while perusing the library's website.

In a statement from Harvard Law School, Carpenter described the document as “a remarkable testament to a fundamental stage in England's political development” and as “one of the world's most valuable documents.”

Carpenter was studying unofficial copies of Magna Carta when he made a surprising discovery. Labeled as HLS MS 172 in Harvard Law School Library's digital archives, the document was described as a copy of the 1327 Magna Carta “somewhat rubbed and damp-stained.”

Carpenter immediately realized that the alleged copy might actually be an official copy. He enlisted the help of Nicholas Vincent, a professor of medieval studies at the University of East Anglia, to verify the document's authenticity. The researchers used images taken by Harvard librarians with ultraviolet light and spectral imaging to compare the text of HLS MS 172 with other original copies of Magna Carta from 1300.

Carpenter and Vincent's research revealed that HLS MS 172's dimensions were consistent with those found in the original copies. The handwriting was also similar, with the large capital ‘E' at the start in ‘Edwardus' and the elongated letters in the first line.

Magna Carta, originally penned by King John in 1215, was the first document to put into writing the principle that monarchs were not above the law. It is widely considered to be a foundational symbol of liberty and one of the earliest declarations of human rights. The document has influenced many constitutions, including that of the United States.

And as far as official copies of Magna Carta go, the rediscovered document is particularly special. Five other editions were written after the original in 1215. HLS MS 172 is a copy of the last edition to be authorized with the king's seal by King Edward I, in 1300. There are only six other official copies of the 1300 version known to still be in existence.

Its discovery is especially poignant as Harvard faces funding cuts and intense political pressure. “The provenance of this document is just fantastic. Given where it is, given present problems over liberties, over the sense of constitutional tradition in America, you couldn't invent a provenance that was more wonderful than this,” Carpenter said in a statement.

According to those familiar with the matter, it includes subsidiaries of SMIC

The U.S. Government is reportedly planning to add "a number of Chinese chipmaking companies" to its ever-expanding export blacklist, a move that could only be prevented by the prospect of a long-trade agreement with China. As reported by the Financial Times, the commerce department has compiled a list of companies to add to its list, notably including China memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory (CXMT).

The Financial Times claims the information comes from five people familiar with the matter, all of whom say the commerce department is proposing the addition of CXMT and others to the dreaded entity list.

The list, drafted by the Bureau of Industry and Security, reportedly includes subsidiaries of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), and Yangtze Memory Technologies Co, China's biggest chipmaker and memory chipmaker respectively, both of which are already listed.

The only reprieve for the company's could come from the recently-announced China and US trade deal. Announced in Geneva, the two have reached an agreement to rescind reciprocal tariffs for 90 days in the hopes of striking a more permanent and broader deal.

According to the report, officials have argued that adding more Chinese companies to the list could upset negotiations.

In March, the U.S. expanded the trade blacklist and closed subsidiary loopholes, adding some 80 entities to the list. 12 organizations including 11 in China are involved in AI and supercomputing, specifically tied to China's military. Seven of those were involved in quantum tech development for military application, while two had supplied restricted components to Huawei and HiSilicon, both of which are blacklisted.

It comes as the U.S. government also issued a global crackdown on the use of Huawei's Ascend AI chips, which it says violates export controls.

CXMT began producing DDR5 memory in December 2024, the first China-made DDR5 aimed at consumer PCs. CXMT was also one of a number of companies added to a list of Chinese companies allegedly linked to the People's Liberation Army by the U.S. Defense Department in January.

As the report notes, American companies are prohibited from selling to Chinese companies on the entity list without a license, due to concerns China is using American technology to support military development of hypersonic missiles and the modelling of nuclear weapons.

Expect read speeds of up to 4,000 MB/s over 40 Gbps USB 4


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Silicon Motion has introduced its new single-chip controller for external solid-state drives that is designed to enable relatively inexpensive SSDs with a 40 Gb/s USB4 interface. The SM2324 controller can be used to build compact, low-power drives with up to 32TB capacity that offer a read throughput up to 4,000 MB/s.

Silicon Motion's SM2324 is a single-chip SSD controller based on two Arm Cortex-R5 cores that has four NAND channels with 32 CE targets that support 3D TLC and 3D QLC NAND devices with an up to 1,600 MT/s interface speed as well as a USB4 Gen3x2 (40 Gbps) host interface with Power Delivery 3.1. SMI claims that drives based on the SM2324 controller can achieve a sequential read performance of up to 4,000 MB/s and a sequential write performance of up to 3,809 MB/s (provided that there is enough cooling). The controller can address up to 32 TB of memory, which enables it to be used both for consumer and professional-grade external storage devices.

The SM2324 controller fully supports the company's latest NANDXtend LDPC ECC technology with a codeword size of 4 kilobytes (4096 bytes) to ensure compatibility with existing and upcoming 3D TLC and 3D QLC NAND memory.

On the security side, the controller also supports real-time full-drive encryption using AES 128/256-bit, complies with TCG Opal 2.0, and includes hardware SHA-384/256 and True Random Number Generator (TRNG). For high-assurance applications, the chip can also work with a fingerprint reader, though it is unclear which interface it uses to communicate with such a device.



The SM2324 chip itself is made on TSMC's 12 nm-class low-power process technology to ensure both power efficiency and cost efficiency.

In terms of host compatibility, the SM2324 works with a broad range of platforms, including Windows XP and later, macOS 10.x and later, and Linux kernel 2.4 and above. It is also compatible with Apple ProRes recording and certified under Apple's MFi program, making it suitable for use in professional media environments with iPhone Pro Max smartphones (considering the fact that some movies are now shot on Pro-level iPhones, it is legitimate to call iPhone-based flows 'professional').

Silicon Motion's SM2324 comes in a 9mm × 9mm FCCSP-C package with a built-in aluminum heat spreader and therefore can be integrated into storage devices of various form factors, including very compact drives.

Most companies did social initiatives badly. They're hard to do well, and so a lot of companies never made more than a nod at them. They didn't help and attracted pushback. Given an administration that turned push into shove, it's not much of a surprise that they got rid of it.Still... as badly as these initiatives are done, it should have at least impressed on you that there was a problem there to be solved. Maybe DEI wouldn't solve it; maybe it can't be solved. But I really think their statements should have been "We maintain a commitment to fairness and an equal opportunity for everybody, and we'll keep looking for ways to engage even if this initiative turned out not to be it."As it is, it looked more like "thank God we no longer have to pretend that we don't hate minorities".

They never did based on how fast they rushed for the door one after another. It's quite baffling. If they really believed it like they were saying, they would have doubled down.

Surely it's common public opinion that most social initiatives and stances major companies take are entirely about publicity and reflect whatever they think the bulk of their consumer base supports.If tomorrow 60% or so of McDonalds (or any other company) customer-base became national socialists, McDonalds would have a red, black and white swastika-laden logo within month-end.It's all pandering. Always has been, always will be. There's even terms for each type: pink-washing, rainbow-washing etc.The only alternative is to take a neutral position, where you just focus on whatever product/service you are selling.

I've been trying to put my finger on what seems so strange to me and I think this is it in part.Someplace like the US is pretty heterogeneous, and their customers' attitudes aren't going to change overnight.I'm not naive about why some companies do what they do. What's strange to me is the speed with which some of these changes were made, and neglecting their particular customer base, which they might have built up for a long time.In some of these cases, fear of legal persecution, maybe based on inside information, makes much more sense to me than following trends. I guess you could argue they are the same thing, to which I'd say I think that's true at one level but not at another functional level.

That's because while the original commenter is correct in terms of companies doing what they believe their consumer base supports, they ignore half of the equation, which is that it was never JUST about the consumers. It was also about protecting the company from disparate impact lawsuits, where any difference in the makeup of a company compared to the general public could be interpreted as discrimination, regardless of whether it actually does discriminatory practices.My guess is that these companies feel that with the new US administration the risk of these kind of lawsuits has decreased significantly.

In this interview, industry expert Blake Webb shares insights on the future of fluidic technology, highlighting trends in automation, microfluidics, and smart systems shaping medical diagnostics and laboratory workflows.

Over the years, fluidics in medical devices and laboratory equipment has evolved from large, centralized systems to highly integrated, compact solutions—especially for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. The demand for faster diagnostics, reduced supply chain dependencies, and cost-effective instrumentation has pushed OEMs toward miniaturized, precise fluidic systems.

At Fluid Metering, our core technology has long supported traditional, high-reliability architectures. Our pumps are engineered as precision instrumentation designed to last the full lifecycle of medical and diagnostic devices, making them a cornerstone of high-accuracy fluid management. However, as the industry shifts towards microfluidics and smaller, more integrated systems, we recognize the need to adapt and innovate.

As the new Head of Product, my focus is on bridging that gap—leveraging our legacy of precision and reliability while evolving toward more compact, high-performance fluidic solutions that meet the growing demands of next-generation medical and lab devices.

One of the most significant advancements in fluidic technology has been the rise of microfluidics, which has transformed medical diagnostics and research—particularly in drug discovery, gene therapies, and high-throughput screening. These systems allow for extremely precise handling of small fluid volumes, reducing reagent costs while increasing sensitivity and automation.

Companies like Tecan and Hamilton have led the way in integrating advanced fluidic handling into fully automated lab workflows. However, as fluidic technology evolves, there's growing demand for next-generation pumps and fluid handling systems that seamlessly integrate into microfluidic architectures while maintaining reliability and cost-efficiency.

At Fluid Metering, we recognize this shift and are actively exploring how to leverage our precision fluidics expertise to support these advancements—ensuring that medical and laboratory workflows remain both high-performance and commercially viable.

Modern fluidic systems enhance precision and efficiency in medical diagnostic devices by ensuring high accuracy, minimal reagent waste, and long-term reliability. For OEMs, this translates into significant cost savings, not just in reduced consumable waste but also in eliminating field service costs and improving end-user satisfaction.

One of the biggest challenges we see is that many OEMs prioritize bottom-line costs over total cost of ownership. This often leads to the selection of lower-precision fluidics, which can result in higher reagent consumption, assay failures, and increased service calls—ultimately frustrating end users. If customers switch to a competitor's instrument due to these issues, OEMs risk losing decades of recurring revenue from consumables.

We've worked with proactive OEMs who recognize this, and ROI calculations have revealed potential savings in the hundreds of millions of dollars—a massive, often overlooked opportunity. At Fluid Metering, our goal is to help OEMs see beyond upfront costs and optimize fluidic performance for long-term success.

Fluidics—the science of precisely controlling liquids and gases—is present at every stage of laboratory workflows, from sample preparation to analysis and data integration. Automation in fluidics has revolutionized research and clinical testing by reducing human error, increasing throughput, and enhancing reproducibility.

As laboratory automation continues to advance, the demand for high-precision, low-maintenance fluidic solutions will grow. At Fluid Metering, we see an opportunity to evolve our technology to better align with automated workflows, ensuring greater efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness for our OEM partners.

Several key trends are shaping the future of fluidics in medical devices and laboratory equipment:

At Fluid Metering, we are focused on advancing fluidic technologies that integrate reliability, precision, and smart automation, ensuring our OEM partners stay ahead of evolving industry demands.

One of my favourite emerging technologies in fluidics is smart & connected fluidics. As laboratory and diagnostic workflows become more automated, there is an increasing need for fluidic systems that are not just precise, but also intelligent—capable of self-monitoring, adjusting flow rates in real time, and integrating with AI-driven diagnostics.

At Fluid Metering, we are actively exploring ways to bring greater intelligence and connectivity to our fluidic solutions. A key part of this effort is our collaboration with our parent company, Roper, to integrate smart fluidic systems directly into Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). This will enable a seamless connection between fluidics and data management, providing OEMs and laboratories with a more comprehensive, automated solution. By leveraging LIMS integration, we can offer real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and advanced analytics, helping laboratories optimize performance, reduce downtime, and improve reproducibility.

Beyond smart fluidics, we are also highly interested in single-use and disposable fluidic systems, as they play an essential role in contamination-free diagnostics and biopharmaceutical applications. As these technologies evolve, we see significant opportunities for Fluid Metering to leverage our precision fluidics expertise in new, cutting-edge applications.

One of the biggest challenges when working with highly sensitive fluids in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics is the wide range of properties these fluids can have. Customers ask us to dispense materials that vary significantly in viscosity, composition, and particle content—including suspended and unsuspended solids like magnetic beads or silica gel beads. These applications require precise, consistent, and contamination-free handling, which can be difficult to achieve without specialized fluidic solutions.

For example, our pumps are used in delicate dispensing applications such as mAb (monoclonal antibody) metering and silica bead suspensions, both of which require extreme precision to maintain fluid integrity. Two of the most common concerns we hear from customers are shear stress and pulsation—both of which can negatively impact sensitive biological or particulate-laden fluids. While our pumps often push the boundaries of feasibility, we've found that working closely with OEMs and our engineering team can help optimize solutions that successfully meet application requirements.

Another major challenge is handling crystallizing fluids. Some reagents and pharmaceutical formulations are prone to precipitation, scaling, or clogging, which can compromise instrument performance and fluidic pathways. To address this, we have developed proprietary technologies, including specialized coatings and custom ceramic components, that prevent crystallization and ensure long-term system reliability.

Ultimately, the key to successfully handling sensitive fluids is understanding the specific interaction between the fluid, the dispensing mechanism, and the application requirements. A one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work—OEMs benefit the most when they engage early in the design phase to ensure the fluidic system is optimized for their unique needs.

Balancing innovation, cost, and practicality in fluidic product development requires close collaboration with OEMs to ensure that new technologies are not only technically advanced but also commercially viable. While we are always pushing the boundaries of precision, integration, and reliability, our success depends on how well our solutions align with our OEM partners' needs, product roadmaps, and cost structures.

Our approach is built on three key pillars:

Our most successful innovations come from strong partnerships with OEMs who understand that fluidic performance is a key differentiator in their instruments. At Fluid Metering, we see ourselves as an extension of our OEM partners' engineering teams, ensuring that innovation translates into real-world benefits—whether through precision, reliability, or cost-effectiveness.

We believe the future of fluidics lies in highly integrated, smart, and scalable solutions that enable OEMs to stay ahead of industry demands while ensuring their products remain commercially competitive and scientifically robust.

We are at a critical inflection point in fluidics, driven by the integration of AI and smart automation. Previously, the adoption of IoT 4.0 and smart factories was seen as too complex, requiring extensive instrumentation and control (I&C), verification and validation (V&V), and regulatory documentation. AI is rapidly simplifying these challenges, unlocking new possibilities in automation.

One of the most exciting opportunities I've heard about lies in AI-driven cancer diagnostics. Studies show that trained AI models can be significantly more accurate than doctors at identifying cancerous cells, as AI can analyze vast datasets that no human could process manually. This is poised to reshape fluidic workflows, particularly in histology and pathology applications.

For example, traditional cell and slide staining—a process that relies on precise fluidic dispensing—may undergo a major transformation with the rise of digital staining. We've had fascinating discussions with OEMs who believe the future may not require physical stains at all. Instead, AI could analyze biopsy images digitally, removing the need for certain fluidic applications.

In one way, this is disruptive, as it could impact existing business models. But in another, it's an opportunity for forced growth. Fluidics will still play a role in upstream processes like sample preparation, cell isolation, and reagent management. The challenge—and the opportunity—is to evolve alongside AI-driven automation, ensuring that fluidics remains an essential part of next-generation diagnostics.

As AI reshapes laboratory automation, Fluid Metering is actively exploring how to adapt and innovate, ensuring that fluidics remains at the core of advanced medical and biotech applications.

One of our largest OEM customers was designing a next-generation immunoassay instrument but struggled to find a fluidic solution that could precisely and accurately dispense their new assays. Their biggest challenge was that the new assays required much smaller dispense volumes than they had previously worked with, and they encountered issues with hanging drops and splashing—both of which compromised accuracy and reproducibility.

Fluid Metering worked hand in hand with their engineering team to integrate the Fenyx pump into their new design. The Fenyx pump provided the flexibility to vary dispense volumes between 4 and 9µL, while also enabling non-contact dispensing without any splashing. This not only eliminated their dispensing inconsistencies but also ensured that their assays remained highly reproducible and efficient.

This collaboration showcased how early partnership and precision-engineered fluidic solutions can help OEMs overcome critical dispensing challenges and bring innovative diagnostics to market.

 May 16, 2025  

The massive budget bill now being debated in Congress includes a proposal for raising Medicare pay for clinicians starting in 2026.

That could be good news for physicians who in 2025 saw a nearly 3% effective pay cut in Medicare reimbursement.

However, clinicians and advocates remain concerned about potentially large cuts to Medicaid, which covers about 71 million Americans.

The modest increase for 2026 Medicare pay is “welcome, but this is a large and complicated bill,” Anders Gilberg, senior vice president of government affairs for the Medical Group Management Association, told Medscape Medical News.

The House and Senate have yet to agree on the budget reconciliation bill.

Substantial Medicaid cuts also would likely have “negative repercussions for physician reimbursement,” Gilberg told Medscape Medical News.

“It remains to be seen how this will all net out in the end, but we appreciate our physician champions in the House working to address Medicare reimbursement shortfalls in an otherwise austere legislative package as it relates to healthcare,” Gilberg said.

Congress allowed a 2.83% cut in 2025 to the Medicare conversion factor, which is key to setting Medicare payment rates for services provided by about 1.3 million clinicians, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.

The Republican-controlled House Committee on Energy and Commerce has proposed raising the Medicare conversion factor equal to 75% of the estimated percentage increase in inflation, as determined by the Medicare Economic Index (MEI). In 2027 and following years, the increase would be 10% of that index.

Still, the committee's Democrats called this week for more than just a stopgap Medicare pay hike.

“This is woefully underfunding the need to address inflation,” said committee member Rep. Raul Ruiz, MD (D-CA), who worked as an emergency physician before joining Congress. “The Medicare physician fee schedule needs a permanent fix, not this temporary, short-changed fix.”

The Medicare pay proposal is part of House Committee on Energy and Commerce's section of a wide-ranging draft GOP legislative package, known as a reconciliation bill. The committee on Wednesday passed its section of the reconciliation text in a 30-24 vote along party lines.

Reconciliation is a special process in Congress that allows lawmakers to bypass some Senate procedural hurdles. It's a rare chance for the majority party to move significant legislation without getting the bipartisan support usually required for Senate passage of bills.

Reconciliation requires House and Senate lawmakers to concur on a budget blueprint, which has proven challenging.

There's strong bipartisan support in Congress for revising the Medicare physician fee schedule.

A bill introduced in 2023, which would have provided for an update equal to the annual MEI percentage increase, had 126 Democratic and 47 Republican co-sponsors.

Mark Miller, PhD, executive vice president of healthcare at the philanthropy Arnold Ventures, said Congress should try to shift Medicare away from its current reliance on the fee-for-service model.

Physicians earn revenue through both the volume of services provided and the price, as reflected in the payment rate, said Miller, a former executive director of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.

“Keeping in mind that Medicare physicians are financed by taxpayers and beneficiary premiums, payment rates should be deemed adequate when they assure beneficiaries have access to high-quality care — rather than blindly defaulting to the full Medicare Economic Index,” Miller wrote.

“That said, the long run updates…may be inadequate, and the Congress likely will need to revisit the updates — which will result in higher costs to taxpayers and beneficiaries,” Miller said.

He suggested offsetting these new costs with cuts to payments to Medicare Advantage plans for “upcoding,” or making patients appear more ill than they are.

Miller said savings could also be achieved by a shift to site-neutral policies, which would end higher pay for some services depending on the ownership of the facility.

On the last day of patient care at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Marquette, Michigan, a port town on the shore of Lake Superior, dozens of people crowded into the parking lot and alley, holding pink homemade signs that read "Thank You!" and "Forever Grateful."

"Oh my god," physician assistant Anna Rink gasped, as she and three other Planned Parenthood employees finally walked outside. The crowd whooped and cheered. Then Rink addressed the gathering.

"Thank you for trusting us with your care," Rink called out, her voice quavering. "And I'm not stopping here. I'm only going to make it better. I promise. I'm going to find a way."

"We're not done!" someone called out. "We're not giving up!"

But Planned Parenthood of Michigan is giving up on four of its health centers in the state, citing financial challenges. That includes Marquette, the only clinic that provided abortion in the vast, sparsely populated Upper Peninsula. For the roughly 1,100 patients who visit the clinic each year for anything from cancer screenings to contraceptive implants, the next-closest Planned Parenthood will now be a nearly five-hour drive south.

It's part of a growing trend: At least 17 clinics closed last year in states where abortion remains legal, and another 17 have closed in just the first five months of this year, according to data gathered by ineedana.com. That includes states that have become abortion destinations, like Illinois, and those where voters have enshrined broad reproductive rights into the state constitution, like Michigan.

Experts say the closures indicate that financial and operational challenges, rather than future legal bans, may be the biggest threats to abortion access in states whose laws still protect it.

"These states that we have touted as being really the best kind of versions of our vision for reproductive justice, they too struggle with problems," said Erin Grant, a co-executive director of the Abortion Care Network, a national membership organization for independent clinics.

"It's gotten more expensive to provide care, it's gotten more dangerous to provide care, and it's just gotten, frankly, harder to provide care, when you're expected to be in the clinic and then on the statehouse steps, and also speaking to your representatives and trying to find somebody who will fix your roof or paint your walls who's not going to insert their opinion about health care rights."

But some abortion rights supporters question whether leaders are prioritizing patient care for the most vulnerable populations. Planned Parenthood of Michigan isn't cutting executive pay, even as it reduces staff by 10% and shuts down brick-and-mortar clinics in areas already facing health care shortages.

"I wish I had been in the room so I could have fought for us, and I could have fought for our community," said Viktoria Koskenoja, an emergency medicine physician in the Upper Peninsula, who previously worked for Planned Parenthood in Marquette. "I just have to hope that they did the math of trying to hurt as few people as possible, and that's how they made their decision. And we just weren't part of the group that was going to be saved."

If a clinic could survive the fall of Roe v. Wade, "you would think that resilience could carry you forward," said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation.

But clinic operators say they face new financial strain, including rising costs, limited reimbursement rates, and growing demand for telehealth services. They're also bracing for the Trump administration to again exclude them from Title X, the federal funding for low- and no-cost family planning services, as the previous Trump administration did in 2019.

PPMI says the cuts are painful but necessary for the organization's long-term sustainability. The clinics being closed are "our smallest health centers," said Sarah Wallett, PPMI's chief medical operating officer. And while the thousands of patients those clinics served each year are important, she said, the clinics' small size made them "the most difficult to operate." The clinics being closed offered medication abortion, which is available in Michigan up until 11 weeks of pregnancy, but not procedural abortion.

Planned Parenthood of Illinois (a state that's become a post-Roe v. Wade abortion destination) shuttered four clinics in March, pointing to a "financial shortfall." Planned Parenthood of Greater New York is now selling its only Manhattan clinic, after closing four clinics last summer due to "compounding financial and political challenges." And Planned Parenthood Association of Utah, where courts have blocked a near-total abortion ban and abortion is currently legal until 18 weeks of pregnancy, announced it closed two centers as of May 2.

Earlier this spring, the Trump administration began temporarily freezing funds to many clinics, including all Title X providers in California, Hawaii, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, and Utah, according to a KFF analysis.

While the current Title X freeze doesn't yet include Planned Parenthood of Michigan, PPMI's chief advocacy officer, Ashlea Phenicie, said it would amount to a loss of about $5.4 million annually, or 16% of its budget.

But Planned Parenthood of Michigan didn't close clinics the last time the Trump administration froze its Title X funding. Its leader said that's because the funding was stopped for only about two years, from 2019 until 2021, when the Biden administration restored it. "Now we're faced with a longer period of time that we will be forced out of Title X, as opposed to the first administration," said PPMI president and CEO Paula Thornton Greear.

And at the same time, the rise of telehealth abortion has put "new pressures in the older-school brick-and-mortar facilities," said Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor who maps brick-and-mortar clinics across the U.S. that provide abortion.

Until a few years ago, doctors could prescribe abortion pills only in person. Those restrictions were lifted during the covid-19 pandemic, but it was the Dobbs decision in 2022 that really "accelerated expansions in telehealth," Myers said, "because it drew all this attention to models of providing abortion services."

Suddenly, new online providers entered the field, advertising virtual consultations and pills shipped directly to your home. And plenty of patients who still have access to a brick-and-mortar clinic prefer that option. "Put more simply, it's gotta change their business model," she said.

Historically, about 28% of PPMI's patients receive Medicaid benefits, according to Phenicie. And, like many states, Michigan's Medicaid program doesn't cover abortion, leaving those patients to either pay out-of-pocket or rely on help from abortion funds, several of which have also been struggling financially.

"When patients can't afford care, that means that they might not be showing up to clinics," said Fonteno of the National Abortion Federation, which had to cut its monthly budget nearly in half last year, from covering up to 50% of an eligible patient's costs to 30%. "So seeing a sort of decline in patient volume, and then associated revenue, is definitely something that we've seen."

Meanwhile, more clinics and abortion funds say patients have delayed care because of those rising costs. According to a small November-December 2024 survey of providers and funds conducted by ineedana.com, "85% of clinics reported seeing an increase of clients delaying care due to lack of funding." One abortion fund said the number of patients who had to delay care until their second trimester had "grown by over 60%."

Even when non-abortion services like birth control and cervical cancer screenings are covered by insurance, clinics aren't always reimbursed for the full cost, Thornton Greear said.

"The reality is that insurance reimbursement rates across the board are low," she said. "It's been that way for a while. When you start looking at the costs to run a health care organization, from supply costs, etc., when you layer on these funding impacts, it creates a chasm that's impossible to fill."

Yet, unlike some independent clinics that have had to close, Planned Parenthood's national federation brings in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, the majority of which is spent on policy and legal efforts rather than state-level medical services. The organization and some of its state affiliates have also battled allegations of mismanagement, as well as complaints about staffing and patient care problems. Planned Parenthood of Michigan staffers in five clinics unionized last year, with some citing management problems and workplace and patient care conditions.

Asked whether Planned Parenthood's national funding structure needs to change, PPMI CEO Thornton Greear said: "I think that it needs to be looked at, and what they're able to do. And I know that that is actively happening."

When the Marquette clinic's closure was announced, dozens of patients voiced their concerns in Google reviews, with several saying the clinic had "saved my life," and describing how they'd been helped after an assault, or been able to get low-cost care when they couldn't afford other options.

Planned Parenthood of Michigan responded to most comments with the same statement and pointed patients to telehealth in the clinic's absence:

"Please know that closing health centers wasn't a choice that was made lightly, but one forced upon us by the escalating attacks against sexual and reproductive health providers like Planned Parenthood. We are doing everything we can to protect as much access to care as possible. We know you're sad and angry — we are, too.

"We know that telehealth cannot bridge every gap; however, the majority of the services PPMI provides will remain available via the Virtual Health Center and PP Direct, including medication abortion, birth control, HIV services, UTI treatment, emergency contraception, gender-affirming care, and yeast infection treatment. Learn more at ppmi.org/telehealth."

PPMI's virtual health center is already its most popular clinic, according to the organization, serving more than 10,000 patients a year. And PPMI plans to expand virtual appointments by 40%, including weekend and evening hours.

"For some rural communities, having access to telehealth has made significant changes in their health," said Wallett, PPMI's chief medical operating officer. "In telehealth, I can have an appointment in my car during lunch. I don't have to take extra time off. I don't have to drive there. I don't have to find child care."

Yet even as the number of clinics has dropped nationally, about 80% of clinician-provided abortions are still done by brick-and-mortar clinics, according to the most recent #WeCount report, which looked at 2024 data from April to June.

And Hannah Harriman, a Marquette County Health Department nurse who previously spent 12 years working for Planned Parenthood of Marquette, is skeptical of any suggestion that telehealth can replace a rural brick-and-mortar clinic. "I say that those people have never spent any time in the U.P.," she said, referring to the Upper Peninsula.

Some areas are "dark zones" for cell coverage, she said. And some residents "have to drive to McDonald's to use their Wi-Fi. There are places here that don't even have internet coverage. I mean, you can't get it."

Telehealth has its advantages, said Koskenoja, the emergency medicine physician who previously worked for Planned Parenthood in Marquette, "but for a lot of health problems, it's just not a safe or realistic way to take care of people."

She recently had a patient in the emergency room who was having a complication from a gynecological surgery. "She needed to see a gynecologist, and I called the local OB office," Koskenoja said. "They told me they have 30 or 40 new referrals a month," and simply don't have enough clinicians to see all those patients. "So adding in the burden of all the patients that were being seen at Planned Parenthood is going to be impossible."

Koskenoja, Harriman, and other local health care providers have been strategizing privately to figure out what to do next to help people access everything from Pap smears to IUDs. The local health department can provide Title X family planning services 1½ days a week, but that won't be enough, Harriman said. And there are a few private "providers in town that offer medication abortion to their patients only — very, very quietly," she said. But that won't help patients who don't have good insurance or are stuck on waitlists.

"It's going to be a patchwork of trying to fill in those gaps," Koskenoja said. "But we lost a very functional system for delivering this care to patients. And now, we're just having to make it up as we go."

While there is currently no cure for a type of dementia called Alzheimer's disease, over the last few years, new medications have been introduced to help manage disease symptoms and slow its progression.

One such medication is lecanemab, distributed under the brand name Leqembi, which was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2023. 

Like all medications, lecanemab has the potential for side effects, including headaches, dizziness, muscle aches, and blurred vision, as well as a very serious side effect known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), such as the presence of swelling or bleeding in the brain.

In November 2022, scientists published the results of the Clarity AD phase 3 clinical trial aimed at determining the safety and efficacy of lecanemab in people with early Alzheimer's disease. In that study, researchers found 0.8% of participants experienced ARIA-E (edema/effusion) and 0.7% showed signs of ARIA-H (hemorrhage/hemosiderin deposition).

Now, a new study recently published in JAMA Neurology reconfirms the Clarity AD findings by reporting that significant adverse events — such as ARIA — were rare and manageable in “real-world” use of lecanemab for people with very mild or mild Alzheimer's disease.

For this study, researchers recruited 234 people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, with an average age of about 74, who received lecanemab at the outpatient specialty memory clinic, Washington University Memory Diagnostic Center.

“Lecanemab is an antibody, a kind of protein normally made in your body by your immune system,” Barbara Joy Snider, MD, PhD, a professor of neurology at WashU Medicine and affiliated with the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, and co-senior author of this study, explained to Medical News Today. “Antibodies like lecanemab are designed to have specific targets and are manufactured, then administered to patients. Antibodies are used for many different conditions.” 

“Lecanemab was designed to recognize certain types of amyloid protein. This is a protein that is made in your body and can become misfolded. When this happens, it can interfere with brain activity and can form clumps called amyloid plaques. This is what happens in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid misfolding is not the only thing that happens in the brain in Alzheimer's disease, but it may be one of the first steps in the disease process that leads to memory loss and dementia.”— Barbara Joy Snider, MD, PhD

“In a large clinical trial, people who were treated with lecanemab for 18 months had about 25-30% less decline in their memory and thinking than did people who did not get the medication,” Snider said. 

“It is important to note that the people treated with lecanemab did have a loss in their memory and thinking, so the drug did not reverse or completely stop the memory loss, but it did significantly slow it down. Imaging studies showed that the lecanemab also reduced and sometimes cleared the amyloid plaques in the brain,” she added.

At the study's conclusion, researchers found that 1.8% of participants at the earliest stage of Alzheimer's disease showed symptoms of ARIA, compared to 27% of participants with mild Alzheimer's disease. 

“This finding emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis. The clinical trial results showed that people with very mild symptoms likely benefit more from medications like lecanemab (40-50% slowing of decline instead of 25-30%), so people with very mild symptoms have more benefit and fewer side effects. This is also when it is hardest to be sure someone has Alzheimer's disease, so it is very important that we continue to work to improve access to diagnosis for people with very mild symptoms.”— Barbara Joy Snider, MD, PhD

Snider and her team also discovered that of the 11 participants who experienced ARIA symptoms, the effects mostly disappeared within a few months, and no patients died. 

“This is very similar to what was seen in the clinical trial,” Snider commented. “This is very reassuring and tells us that these drugs can be used safely in a ‘real world' clinic population.”

“We will continue to follow our patients and hope to learn more about side effects of these medications and about how much they slow down memory loss,” she continued. “We look forward to sharing this information with other providers and to seeing larger studies through groups like Alz-Net. We are encouraged by our experience of providing amyloid-targeting treatments to appropriate patients and we look forward to the next generation of treatments for Alzheimer's disease.”

MNT spoke with John Dickson, MD, PhD, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, about this study. Dickson commented that the study's findings are generally in line with what he has observed at his center. 

“While ARIA does occur in patients treated with lecanemab, it has been manageable in our sub-specialty treatment program,” he explained. “The risk of ARIA is often the most significant consideration in eligible patients' decisions about whether to pursue treatment with anti-amyloid therapy or not.”

“Further research to identify patients at increased risk for ARIA, especially serious ARIA with concerning symptoms or radiographic features, could help clinicians advise patients with more personalized recommendations regarding treatment based on individual patients' risk profiles. This may help patients make more informed decisions regarding their treatment options. These treatment decisions include whether or not to pursue treatment with anti-amyloid therapy, and if so, whether lecanemab or donanemab would be a better option.”— John Dickson, MD, PhD

Dickson said that for future research, these findings should be examined in a larger patient sample and that the observation time should be extended. 

“In general, the risk of ARIA is highest in the first six months of treatment,” he explained. “While some of the patients included in this study had more than six months of treatment, some patients were observed for a shorter period of time. Thus, the results of this study may underestimate the number of patients who will develop ARIA from the study population.”

MNT also spoke with Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD, director of the Division of Geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this research. 

“While the approval of lecanemab offers a glimmer of hope for Alzheimer's patients, the potential for serious side effects makes it a complex decision for prescribing physicians,” Parulekar said. “Careful patient selection, monitoring, and open communication about the benefits and risks are essential.” 

“The benefit offered by lecanemab is a modest slowing of decline, not a cure or a dramatic reversal. It is important to weigh its benefit against the potential for serious side effects for each individual patient. This requires careful consideration of the patient's disease stage, overall health, and other risk factors.” — Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD

“Identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from lecanemab and least likely to experience serious side effects is crucial,” Parulekar added. “Additional safety data and ‘real world' experience [are] helpful for this process.”

 May 16, 2025  

Caring for complex patients — those experiencing a laundry list of conditions simultaneously — can be challenging for any physician. From incorporating multiple specialists to working with social workers, primary care physicians and more, figuring out the right calculus to help these particularly ill patients is often difficult. For hospitalists, that math can be even tougher.

Unlike certain specialists and primary care physicians, hospitalists don't know the majority of their patients well. They are unfamiliar with their backgrounds, familial and social situations, and often must bridge the gap between multiple practitioners and their opinions. But that doesn't mean hospitalists can't bring their own valuable perspective to the table.

“We own all the problems, but we do so willingly,” said Joseph Sweigart, MD, a hospitalist at Georgetown Community Hospital in Georgetown, Kentucky and associate professor at the University of Kentucky School of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky. “I often joke that I love taking care of the people rather than their organ systems. We get to consider all the issues and then present them to the patients holistically.”

The position has its pros and cons, but more than anything, it means a hospitalist must develop effective strategies for managing these complex patient cases.

The layers of complexity involved in each patient can range from physical to mental, and may also involve logistics, a lack of social support, and more. While physical ailments are often at the top of the list, psycho-social issues are taking an increasingly larger role in the treatment of complex patients, according to Adjoa Boateng Evans, MD, a critical care anesthesiologist at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. “A patient may have a severe psychiatric disease and a concurrent addiction, making placement outside the hospital a challenge,” she said. “Or if a patient has survived a critical illness, but is too ill to go home, we have to make decisions about long-term care.” 

Those decisions may be further complicated by issues like lack of insurance or little-to-no support system, which can present additional obstacles for hospitalists. “They are the primary in-patient doctor for many patients in the hospital,” said Evans. “If they've got multiple patients and psycho-social issues, too, patient management can be difficult.”

Additionally, hospitalists are in the unique position of managing admissions and discharges, all while keeping abreast of new data and results throughout a shift. “We are seeing these patients often at the sickest points of their lives,” said Maninder (Dolly) Abraham, MD, chief of hospitalist medicine at RWJBarnabas Health, West Orange, New Jersey. “A big challenge is that we don't know them or their families.” 

This means there is a learning curve when hospitalists take over a complex patient, and due to the severity of the patient's illnesses, they must overcome this curve swiftly. If patients are bouncing back and forth between the floor and the intensive care unit (ICU), that task can be even more convoluted.

Another issue hospitalists may face is bridging gaps between specialists. “You might have a patient with a fresh stent who comes in with GI bleeding,” said Sweigart. “The cardiologist would say the patient needs blood thinners, and the GI [gastrointestinal] doctor might say to stop those meds to help the gut. Both are right for those systems, but as hospitalists, we get all that information and must make decisions.”

While that can feel intimidating, with good communication and a willingness to collaborate, hospitalists can deliver the quality of care necessary to adequately support complex patients throughout their stay.

When managing a complex patient, at the top of a hospitalist's list is a comprehensive evaluation upon admission. From there, collaborating with a multi-disciplinary team becomes essential. “You should review records, reach out to the primary care physician, and reconcile the poly-pharmacy issue so that there are no side effects or adverse reactions,” said Anila Faizan, MD, medical director of the hospitalist program at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey. “You must communicate with everyone involved in the patient's care.”

You must also establish trust with the patient and their family and hold goals-of-care conversations with them. This requires a holistic approach that addresses social detriments along with the physical condition. Your patient will eventually move on to the next site of care — or their home, ideally — and you must begin addressing this on day 1.

“We're in-house for 10-12 hours and not running off to offices,” said Abraham. “We see the patients in the morning, look at their labs, and perform interdisciplinary rounds for plan of care and case management. Then, we follow up on rounds a second time, which often gives us a chance to have a conversation with the family. That gives us an advantage in the care of complex patients.”

It's essential that hospitalists take the initiative to establish collaboration with the entire care team, said Evans. “You might be hesitant to reach out to the ICU group, for instance,” she said. “But our breadth of knowledge on these patients is vast, and we're always happy to help collaborate.”

These conversations can lead to comanagement decision-making, often improving patient outcomes. When hospitalists add their two cents on patient care — and ask for the same in return — it can unearth the best route of care.

Evans said that much of this involves the art of storytelling, even more so than the science of medicine. “We give you a story about the patient, and you do the same in reverse,” she said. “We need to give each other the elevator pitch of what happened with a patient for a good hand off.”

Sweigart is a big fan of communication, too. “You can't overcommunicate,” he said. “You must be openly and transparently explaining all that's going on with a patient's care. We own the transitions process and act as the final decider, and the person who is working with the patients and their families.” 

This may involve levels of uncertainty, but that's ok, said Sweigart. “Embrace it, often,” he said. “Think about where a path is leading, and when a specialist thinks differently, work together.”

Ultimately, hospitalists are the coordinators of care, said Abraham. “We ensure that everyone is talking to each other — we are the common thread,” she said. “We relay that one message of plan of care to everyone because we see patients as a whole, not just an organ system or specialty.”

With this unique view of a patient, hospitalists should learn to defer as little as possible, advises Sweigart. “It's ok to double check or read more about the patient's conditions,” he said, “but do it tactfully so that you're maintaining ownership. This lets the patient see that we're in charge of their care and we'll work with them for the best outcome.”

Managing complex patients can be challenging — and even a bit scary — but it can also be highly rewarding, according to Sweigart. “Our job is to shepherd through these very vulnerable patients,” he said. “When all goes well, it's engaging, and even fun.”

From ancient Ayurvedic remedy to modern scientific spotlight, tulsi (holy basil) is emerging as a promising botanical for stress, metabolic health, immunity, and beyond—yet experts caution that robust clinical trials are still needed.

For over 3,000 years, tulsi, which is also known as holy basil, has been revered in Ayurveda as a sacred plant and remedy for ailments of the body and mind. Modern pharmacological research is now beginning to validate what ancient medical systems have long claimed about tulsi.

Ocimum sanctum, commonly known as tulsi or holy basil, is an important herb in Ayurveda and other Southeast Asian traditional medicine systems. For several centuries, tulsi has been venerated in many cultures for its spiritual symbolism, in addition to its wide-ranging medicinal properties.1

In recent decades, tulsi has garnered increasing scientific interest, particularly in the context of modern health challenges such as chronic inflammation, metabolic disorders, and psychological stress.1-4 This article critically examines the evidence behind tulsi's health benefits through the lens of modern scientific research, including its adaptogenic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic effects.

Tulsi belongs to the family Lamiaceae and genus Ocimum. The most well-known species used medicinally is Ocimum sanctum, which is also known by the synonymous taxonomic name Ocimum gratissimum.5 The bioactive constituents of O. sanctum include eugenol, ursolic acid, rosmarinic acid, apigenin, and linalool, all of which are compounds known for their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects.2,3

Tulsi is commercially available in multiple forms, including fresh leaves, dried powders, teas, essential oils, and encapsulated extracts. The concentration of active compounds in these preparations varies.

In Ayurveda, tulsi is believed to promote longevity, enhance resilience, and foster systemic balance. Traditionally, tulsi has been used as a household remedy to treat a wide range of ailments, including fever, cough, asthma, bronchitis, malaria, diarrhea, and skin diseases. It is often consumed as a tea, infused into oils, or in herbal powders and pastes.4

Tulsi is also considered an adaptogen that supports the body's ability to acclimate to physical, emotional, and environmental stressors.1 In folk medicine, tulsi has been used to relieve headaches, earaches, and indigestion, whereas its leaves are applied topically for insect bites and skin eruptions.

Tulsi seeds and roots have been used traditionally for their diuretic and detoxifying properties.5 Across Southeast Asia, tulsi remains a staple in ethnomedicine, especially in a cultural context, for its perceived ability to purify the air and protect the household from illness and misfortune.6

Adaptogenic and anti-stress effects

The adaptogenic effects of tulsi are among the most extensively studied. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, supplementation with an O. tenuiflorum extract (OciBest) significantly reduced symptoms of stress, including exhaustion, sleep disturbances, and forgetfulness, over six weeks.7 These effects could be attributed to compounds such as eugenol and ursolic acid present in tulsi, which modulate cortisol levels and neurotransmitter activity.1

Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties

Tulsi's antioxidant properties are attributed to its ability to upregulate enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase while scavenging free radicals.2 In fact, a 2014 study reported that tulsi leaf extracts reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) secretion and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) translocation, both of which are key inflammatory processes, in human monocyte leukemia cell lines.8

Rosmarinic acid, eugenol, and other phenolic compounds have also been shown to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thus suggesting the potential utility of these compounds within tulsi to prevent chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress.4

Metabolic health

Several studies have also reported the effectiveness of tulsi in regulating blood glucose and lipid profiles. In clinical trials, tulsi supplementation has improved fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, and cholesterol levels in diabetic patients.3,6

The underlying mechanisms of these effects include enhancement of insulin secretion and improved lipid metabolism through modulation of key enzymes like 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK).4

Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity

Tulsi exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and fungal species like Candida albicans. Eugenol and carvacrol are known to disrupt microbial cell membranes, while polyphenols interfere with biofilm formation and microbial adhesion.4,5

Immunologically, tulsi has been shown to enhance macrophage activity, natural killer (NK) cell function, and antibody production in preclinical studies. Human trials have also reported improved immune markers, including lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine balance, following tulsi supplementation.6

Cognitive and neurological benefits

Preclinical research has highlighted the neuroprotective properties of tulsi, particularly in models of cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation. The use of tulsi extracts has been shown to improve memory retention, decrease the rate of neurodegeneration, and reduce oxidative stress in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, amnesia, and age-related dementia.3,5

Apigenin and rosmarinic acid in tulsi are also associated with anxiolytic and antidepressant properties through modulation of pathways linked to the neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin.1. These findings suggest the potential applications of tulsi extracts in adjunctive care for mood disorders and cognitive decline.

Other potential benefits

The therapeutic properties of tulsi and its extracts are being explored across the fields of dermatology and hepatic health. The antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of tulsi make it a promising candidate for acne, eczema, and wound healing applications.2

Tulsi has also demonstrated hepatoprotective effects in chemically induced liver damage models by attenuating oxidative damage, enhancing antioxidant defenses, reducing lipid peroxidation, as well as improving liver enzyme profiles and histopathological markers.5

Human trials report minimal side effects associated with tulsi ingestion. However, tulsi may interact with anticoagulants, hypoglycemic agents, and sedatives due to the impact of this plant on metabolic and central nervous system (CNS) pathways.6

A recent animal model study reported lower sperm counts, reduced levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), as well as increased levels of testosterone in male rabbits after supplementation with fresh tulsi leaves.9 Comparatively, other studies have reported no adverse effects of tulsi or its extracts on the reproductive health of male or female murine models.4

The use of tulsi during pregnancy and lactation has not been well studied. Thus, caution should be exercised while using this herb during pregnancy.

Most studies examining the health benefits of tulsi are preclinical or involve small sample sizes. Furthermore, few large-scale, randomized controlled trials with clearly defined endpoints and standardized preparations have been conducted to validate the clinical efficacy of tulsi.

Although tulsi is classified as a dietary supplement in the United States, it is not approved as a drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA).

From managing stress and inflammation to enhancing metabolic and immune health, tulsi shows promise as a complementary strategy in preventive and integrative medicine. Current evidence suggests that consumers and practitioners should use tulsi as a supportive, adjunctive herb, preferably under the guidance of qualified health professionals.

Scientists have identified mutated immune cell clones that could point to improved treatment for refractory celiac disease.

Researchers at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research and UNSW Sydney have discovered why some people with celiac disease continue to suffer debilitating symptoms despite strictly avoiding gluten.

The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, used cutting-edge single-cell sequencing techniques to reveal that certain immune cells in the gut of these patients carry genetic mutations. The team's findings suggest these abnormal immune cells are driving ongoing intestinal inflammation that causes symptoms like diarrhoea, pain and malnutrition – pointing to a new way to diagnose and potentially treat the most severe form of celiac disease.

For decades, doctors have struggled to understand why a small proportion of celiac patients do not improve on a strict gluten-free diet. Our research suggests that, in some cases, the disease may be fuelled by immune cells that have acquired genetic mutations – something we've never been able to see before."

Professor Chris Goodnow, senior author of the study and Head of the Immunogenomics Lab at Garvan

celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune condition where the body mistakenly attacks the small intestine in response to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. While most people with the condition experience relief when they remove gluten from their diet, around 1% develop refractory celiac disease, which is where symptoms persist despite strict dietary control.

Refractory celiac disease is classified into two types. Type 2 is caused by abnormal immune cells that can rapidly develop into an aggressive lymphoma, but the cause of type 1 has remained a mystery – until now.

"This is the first time we've been able to pinpoint a molecular signature for type 1 refractory celiac disease," says Dr Manu Singh, first author of the study and Senior Research Officer at Garvan. "We discovered that some patients with refractory disease have an accumulation of immune cells with genetic mutations, which may develop during periods of chronic inflammation, such as earlier gluten exposure. What's interesting is that these mutations share similarities with those we see in certain lymphomas – appearing to give the cells a growth and survival advantage. This is a potential explanation for why they persist even after a patient eliminates gluten from their diet."

The researchers found that these mutated – or 'rogue' – immune cells were present in seven out of 10 patients with type 1 refractory celiac disease. This discovery could lead to new ways to identify at-risk patients earlier and more targeted treatments.

Currently, the only treatment for refractory celiac disease is broad immunosuppression, which dampens the immune system but does not specifically target the mutated cells. The researchers say their findings open the door to more precise therapies.

"If we can confirm that these mutated immune cells are driving the disease, then we may be able to target them with existing drugs," says Professor Fabio Luciani, co-senior author of the study, Visiting Scientist at Garvan and Professor in Systems Immunology at UNSW Sydney. "For example, we found that many of these aberrant cells have mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway, which is already targeted by approved drugs known as JAK inhibitors. With more investigation, this could lead to a personalised medicine approach where we treat patients based on their specific immune cell mutations."

"Understanding these mutated immune cells gives us a new way to think about why some patients don't recover on a gluten-free diet, and could help us identify which patients might benefit from different treatment approaches," adds Associate Professor Jason Tye-Din, a celiac disease specialist at WEHI who collaborated on the study.

"The findings highlight the power of advanced genetic technologies in understanding autoimmune diseases. Until recently, these abnormal immune cells were undetectable using traditional methods, but new single-cell sequencing techniques have made it possible to analyse thousands of individual cells from intestinal biopsies," says Dr Singh.

"This research is a great example of how new genomic technologies can uncover hidden disease mechanisms. By applying these state-of-the-art tools to celiac disease, we are beginning to solve long-standing medical puzzles and move towards more precise treatments," says Professor Goodnow.

New research reveals takotsubo cardiomyopathy remains a major cause of in-hospital deaths and complications, with men facing more than twice the risk and outcomes worsening during the COVID-19 era.



Study: High Mortality and Complications in Patients Admitted With Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy With More Than Double Mortality in Men Without Improvement in Outcome Over the Years. Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, researchers assessed the incidence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) and related complications in the United States (US). TC is a reversible left ventricular dysfunction triggered by physical stress, mainly in males, or emotional stress, primarily in females. TC shows racial and sex disparities, and it continues to remain a significant cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Despite being traditionally viewed as a transient condition, the study underscores persistent risks of severe complications and mortality.

In the present study, researchers examined the incidence of TC and related complications in the US. They used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, which includes weighted and unweighted data for about 35 million and seven million hospitalizations, respectively. TC cases were identified using the ICD-10 code I51.81. However, the study relied on ICD-10 codes, which may be subject to coding errors and did not differentiate between TC subtypes (e.g., reverse-type TC). TC patients aged at least 18 years between 2016 and 2020 in the NIS database were included.

The primary outcomes were cardiogenic shock, myocardial rupture, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, stroke, and cardiac arrest. Patient and hospital demographic data included age, ethnicity or race, sex, median household income, hospital bed size, hospital region, mean length of hospital stay, hospital teaching status, mean total charges, expected primary payer, and control of hospital.

Proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for categorical variables, and odds ratios and 95% CIs were estimated for continuous variables. Five-year outcome data were evaluated. A chi-squared analysis was performed to assess categorical outcomes. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate the association between length of hospital stay and independent variables.

Between 2016 and 2020, out of over 148.7 million total weighted population in the NIS database, 199,890 patients were hospitalized with TC. The annual incidence of TC did not exhibit a consistent trend, but increased overall from 39,015 cases in 2016 to 41,290 in 2020. The mean age of TC patients was 67 years. Most patients were female (83%) and White (80%). TC incidence increased in all age groups between 2016 and 2020, but was consistently the highest in those aged over 61. A notable surge occurred in the 46–60 age group compared to younger adults (31–45 years), which researchers attributed to accumulated stressors, under-treated cardiovascular risks, and hormonal changes in middle age.

White individuals had the highest TC incidence rate, followed by Native Americans, whereas Black people had the lowest incidence. Socioeconomic factors varied significantly, such as hospital bed size, primary payer, and median household income. TC patients had larger hospital bed sizes and higher household incomes. Most patients were on Medicare; TC rates were the highest in private non-profit and urban teaching hospitals.

TC patients had a high burden of cardiovascular complications, including atrial fibrillation (20%), CHF (36%), cardiogenic shock (6.6%), stroke (5.3%), and myocardial rupture (0.02%) compared to non-TC patients. TC patients also had a higher mortality (6.58%) than non-TC patients (2.4%), with an odds ratio of 2.86 for mortality. Further, TC patients had higher odds of cardiogenic shock, CHF, cardiac arrest, and myocardial rupture. The 1.5% mortality increase from 2019 to 2020 coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, which prior studies associate with heightened stress-induced cardiac events.

TC patients had a slightly higher odds of atrial fibrillation and were also twice as likely to experience a stroke. Notably, the incidence of some complications increased over the years, while others, such as atrial fibrillation and myocardial rupture, remained stable. For instance, mortality rates increased from 5.6% to 8.3%, stroke incidence increased from 4.9% to 5.9%, and CHF incidence grew from 34.7% to 37.6%, among others.

While mortality based on sex was stable over time, it was double in males (11.2%) compared to females (5.5%). Researchers emphasized that hormonal differences, particularly lower estrogen levels in men and postmenopausal women, might explain this disparity, as estrogen has shown protective effects in animal models of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. The multivariable analysis found that TC was associated with all-cause death, adjusted for age, ethnicity or race, sex, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, chronic obstructive lung disease, and chronic kidney disease. The median length of hospital stay for TC patients was four days, consistent throughout the study period.

Multivariable linear regression showed that large hospital bed size, Native American race, Medicaid insurance, Black race, and Asian race were associated with longer hospital stays. Conversely, female sex, older age, private insurance, treatment in the South, West, or Midwest regions, and private non-profit hospital ownership were associated with shorter hospital stays.

Taken together, the data indicate that individuals with TC are at a significantly elevated risk of various cardiovascular complications. Males have higher mortality than females. Notably, no improvements were observed in complications throughout the study years. The study's limitations include reliance on administrative coding (which may overlook TC subtypes) and potential duplicate entries from hospital transfers or readmissions. Further research on improving and managing care is required to augment outcomes for these patients.

How much do your genes and upbringing determine your success? A landmark Norwegian study untangles the complex interplay between genetics, family, and social policies in shaping who thrives.

Study: The genetic and environmental composition of socioeconomic status in Norway. Image Credit: WinWin artlab / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers examined the environmental and genetic contributions to four key indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) in Norway, namely wealth, income, occupational prestige, and educational attainment. Their findings indicate that genetic variation consistently explained more of the differences in educational attainment and occupational prestige, with education generally showing the highest genetic influence.

Family-shared environmental factors, on the other hand, contributed more to variations in educational attainment and wealth. The study notes that its estimates might be most applicable to a middle-class to upper-middle-class Norwegian population due to sample characteristics. The authors also note that their findings may not be generalizable to more socioeconomically diverse or non-European populations.

SES is closely linked to important life outcomes, including subjective well-being, mortality, and health. Therefore, understanding the genetic and environmental underpinnings of SES is a major research focus. However, SES is a broad and inconsistently measured construct, with one review identifying 149 unique indicators.

Researchers typically focus on a common core of four key SES indicators: wealth, income, occupational prestige, and educational attainment. Despite their frequent use, systematic comparisons of their genetic and environmental foundations remain limited. Heritability, defined as the percentage of trait variation due to genetic factors, can be estimated using family- or genotype-based methods.

However, these methods often produce diverging estimates, with family-based studies generally showing higher heritability. Variability across populations, age groups, and measurement methods further complicates these differences. Many studies also rely on self-reported SES data, which can introduce significant biases. There is also a notable gap in studies focusing on wealth, despite its centrality and unequal distribution, even in egalitarian societies.

This study used registry-based, objective data from a homogeneous Norwegian sample. It utilized multiple heritability methods within a single population to ensure consistency and reduce error, aiming to disentangle and compare the role of environmental and genetic factors in SES indicators.

Data from over 170,000 Norwegian adults between 35 and 45 was drawn from national population registers. The researchers selected this age range to capture stable SES information while ensuring consistency across indicators.

The study minimized measurement error and biases associated with self-reported data by using administrative records for wealth, occupational prestige, income, and educational attainment. For income, wealth, and occupational prestige, indicators were averaged over an 11-year period (from ages 35 to 45), while educational attainment was the highest recorded within this timeframe, allowing for reliable and objective estimates.

To examine the environmental and genetic components of SES, the study applied four heritability estimation methods: two family-based and two genotype-based methods. To ensure comparability, these methods were applied to subsamples drawn from the same underlying population. The researchers also conducted multivariate analyses to evaluate the degree of overlapping environmental and genetic influences across the four SES indicators, using structural equation modeling and dimension-reduction techniques.

Norway was chosen for its extensive welfare systems, which reduce environmental variability and enhance the relative impact of genetic differences. The country's universal education and healthcare access, strong social protections, and high intergenerational mobility create a context where SES differences are less affected by economic barriers.

Key research questions focused on estimating the relative contributions of genetic, non-shared, and shared environmental factors, the variance across methods, and the overlap in influences among the four SES indicators.

This study used four heritability estimation methods to assess the contributions of environment and genetics to education, occupation, wealth, and income. Researchers found statistically significant heritability estimates across all methods and indicators, with education showing the highest genetic influence.

Wealth heritability was similar to income in family-based estimates (25% vs. 30%) but higher than income in genotype-based estimates (12% vs. 6.5%). Estimates varied with assumptions about shared environmental correlations, especially among cousins.

Shared environmental effects were substantial for education and wealth but sensitive to modeling choices. Genetic correlations among the four indicators ranged from moderate to high (0.35–0.96), suggesting both shared and distinct genetic influences.

Principal component analyses revealed a unidimensional structure for genetic and shared environmental components, but a more complex pattern for non-shared environments. Specifically, individual environments linked longer education with lower income.

The findings indicate large family-shared contributions to SES but also highlight the influence of individual-specific environmental factors, with varying degrees of overlap across the four socioeconomic indicators. The authors also note that genotype-based heritability estimates may be inflated by population stratification and indirect genetic effects, which are particularly relevant when interpreting population-level results.

This study provides comprehensive heritability estimates for key SES indicators in Norway using robust registry data and diverse methods. Education showed the highest contributions from genetics, consistent with findings from the United Kingdom.

Shared environments significantly influenced education and wealth, especially when cousin correlations were modeled realistically.

The study's strengths include large sample sizes, rigorous comparisons across methods, and novel wealth estimates. However, limitations include reliance on population-level estimates that may be inflated by indirect genetic effects and assumptions about shared environments. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the common approach of using a single composite SES index may fail to capture a substantial proportion of individual-specific environmental effects and that such an index should be used with informed deliberation.

Researchers stressed ethical considerations in interpreting their findings, namely that genetic influence does not imply determinism; socioeconomic outcomes are shaped by social contexts and policies. Heritability is not fixed; it is a population statistic that cannot be applied to individuals and varies across contexts.

Overall, the results underscore the complexity of SES development, shaped by genetics, shared family environments, and individual-specific factors. Future research should explore finer-grained indicators and refine methods for modeling environmental effects within extended families.

Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent and host of KFF Health News' weekly health policy news podcast, "What the Health?" A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book "Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z," now in its third edition.

After all-night markups, two key House committees approved GOP budget legislation that would cut hundreds of billions of dollars from federal health programs over the next decade, mostly from the Medicaid program for people with low incomes or disabilities. The legislation is far from a done deal, though, with at least one Republican senator voicing opposition to Medicaid cuts.

Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before Congress for the first time since taking office. In sometimes surprisingly combative exchanges with lawmakers in the House and Senate, Kennedy denied cutting programs despite evidence to the contrary and said at one point that he doesn't think Americans "should be taking medical advice from me."

Treating migraine before the pain starts: New research shows ubrogepant eases premonitory symptoms, offering hope for millions seeking earlier and more effective relief.

Study: Ubrogepant for the treatment of migraine prodromal symptoms: an exploratory analysis from the randomized phase 3 PRODROME trial. Image Credit: GoodStudio / Shutterstock

The most recent exploratory analysis from the phase 3 PRODROME trial reveals that ubrogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, administered at the initial phase of a migraine attack, may ameliorate common premonitory symptoms, including fatigue, light and sound sensitivity, neck pain, and dizziness. A detailed report is published in the journal Nature Medicine.

Nearly one-third of participants who recognized prodromal symptoms reported moderate-to-severe functional disability due to symptoms like cognitive impairment or fatigue, underscoring the need for early intervention.

Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of moderate-to-severe headache and other symptoms of brain dysfunction. Migraine has four distinct, but often overlapping, phases including premonitory (prodrome), aura, headache, and postdrome phases.

Premonitory phase symptoms are broadly categorized into three groups: cognitive impairment, characterized by difficulty concentrating or thinking and fatigue; homeostatic dysfunction, characterized by food cravings; and headache phase-associated symptoms, including light and sound sensitivity.

Premonitory symptoms are highly predictive of approaching headache and are associated with the activation of the brain's hypothalamus region. These findings, along with others discussed in the paper, lend support to the understanding of migraine attacks potentially originating in the central nervous system. The identification of the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide as a causative neurotransmitter associated with migraine attacks has offered the possibility of exploring migraine pathophysiology. Small-molecule inhibitors of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor have shown promising outcomes in preventing migraine attacks.

The PRODROME phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was designed to explore the efficacy of ubrogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, in preventing the development of headache and resolving premonitory phase symptoms. This article focuses on an exploratory analysis of its effects on premonitory symptoms.

Brain imaging studies cited in the trial suggest prodromal symptom relief by ubrogepant may link to central nervous system effects, with hypothalamic activation patterns observed during migraine premonitory phases.

The trial recruited migraine patients who could reliably identify migraine attacks with premonitory phase symptoms that were reliably followed by headache within 1–6 hours at least 75% of the time. Qualifying prodromal events were defined by the presence of premonitory phase symptoms that the participant was confident would be followed by a headache within 1–6 hours.

The participants were randomly assigned to two groups. In one group, participants received a placebo drug to treat the first qualifying premonitory event and ubrogepant 100 mg to treat the second qualifying event. In another group, participants received ubrogepant 100 mg to treat the first qualifying premonitory event and the placebo drug to treat the second qualifying event. The two treatments were separated by at least a 7-day washout period.

The trial included 480 participants for safety analysis and 477 participants for efficacy analysis. The safety population had a mean age of 42.3 years and was predominantly female (87.7%) and White (88.1%), which may be a consideration for generalizability. The most common premonitory symptoms identified at baseline before treatment were light and sound sensitivity, fatigue, neck pain, and dizziness.

Both drugs (ubrogepant and placebo) were administered at the premonitory phase of migraine, and the outcomes were recorded over a period of 48 hours.

Cognitive symptoms like “brain fog” resolved faster with ubrogepant: difficulty thinking improved within 6 hours, while concentration issues showed improvement as early as 1 hour post-dose.

The exploratory efficacy analysis, for which the paper provides precise percentages, odds ratios, and confidence intervals, revealed an absence of light sensitivity in approximately 19% and 12% of ubrogepant- and placebo-treated events, respectively, at 2-hour post-treatment; an absence of fatigue in approximately 27% and 16% and an absence of neck pain in approximately 28% and 15% of ubrogepant- and placebo-treated events, respectively, at 3-hour post-treatment; an absence of sound sensitivity in approximately 50% and 35% of respective events at 4-hour post-treatment; and an absence of dizziness in approximately 88% and 82% of respective events at 24-hour post-treatment.

Among cognitive impairment symptoms, difficulty concentrating resolved in approximately 8% and 2% of ubrogepant and placebo-treated events, respectively, at 1 hour post-treatment, and difficulty thinking resolved in approximately 56% and 41% of respective events at 6 hours post-treatment. Additionally, the use of rescue medication within 24 hours post-dose was lower for ubrogepant-treated events (21.7%) compared with placebo-treated events (39.4%).

Treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were identified in 9% of placebo-treated events and 13% of ubrogepant-treated events. Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of perceived relation to treatment, were reported for 12% of placebo-treated events and 17% of ubrogepant-treated events. The most common adverse events (≥2%) after placebo and ubrogepant administration were nausea, fatigue, dizziness, and somnolence (drowsiness). None of these events were serious or led to study discontinuation.

The trial suggests that ubrogepant may be a therapeutic drug that can help resolve disabling symptoms that appear in the premonitory phase of migraine. When administered in this phase, ubrogepant may improve common premonitory symptoms, with improvements possibly starting as early as one hour after treatment.

Premonitory phase symptoms are highly predictive of impending headache. Existing evidence indicates that a considerable proportion of migraine patients can recognize these symptoms on the day before their headache. Therefore, treatments aiming at resolving these symptoms have high potential to prevent the onset of headache.

The study censored data from participants who used rescue medication, ensuring results weren't skewed by pain-relief drugs—a rigor that reinforced the validity of symptom resolution findings.

As mentioned by researchers, greater awareness of the clinical symptomatology of the premonitory phase, as well as the availability of effective treatment, offers a major opportunity to improve the treatment of acute migraine. The paper also emphasizes that reversing these symptoms with a CGRP receptor antagonist like ubrogepant underscores the importance of the brain in migraine pathophysiology and suggests that targeting central nervous system mechanisms could be a fruitful avenue for new therapeutics.

The primary objective of the PRODROME trial was to evaluate the efficacy of ubrogepant in preventing the onset of headache following administration during the premonitory phase of a migraine attack. The evaluation of the efficacy of ubrogepant in resolving premonitory symptoms was an exploratory analysis of additional endpoints, as detailed in this Nature Medicine paper. The authors note these analyses were not controlled for multiple comparisons, highlighting the need for additional studies specifically designed to evaluate the effect of acute treatment on premonitory symptoms.

Furthermore, the trial participants were instructed to consume ubrogepant when they recognized premonitory symptoms and felt confident that a headache would follow within 1–6 hours. However, the trial did not analyze the differences in symptom resolution between participants who developed and did not develop headaches. These parameters should be considered in future studies.

Both men have much at stake as the World Cup heads to North America next year, with the potential for President Donald Trump's immigration policies to chill international attendance.

DOHA, Qatar — As President Donald Trump drove to a palace here the other night, he passed by a gleaming and glittery Lusail Stadium, the crown jewel of the sports complexes built to host what would become an electrifying 2022 World Cup final.

When he arrived at the palace, after the camels and the horses and the singing outside, he found a man ready to greet him with gusto: FIFA President Gianni Infantino. As they had dinner, Trump again called out for him. When he left, Infantino was there once more.

“Great job you do, Gianni!” he said.

Trump has reason to pay attention to Infantino — and Infantino to him. FIFA's World Cup heads to the United States, Mexico and Canada next year, and both men have much at stake in the success of the quadrennial soccer tournament.

“We've got the World Cup coming,” Trump said Friday morning at the conclusion of his trip.

There may be other reasons for the genuine affection between Trump and Infantino. There is an aspect of Trump's foreign policy approach that aligns with FIFA's president. They want to expand global reach with glitz and glamour, and they are willing to stretch ethical boundaries and turn a blind eye to autocrats who crack down on their populations.

FIFA has approached the world much like Trump has — in a transactional way that can elevate countries with questionable records in human rights.

Russia was picked to host the 2018 World Cup, and Infantino accepted high honors from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Qatar relied heavily on migrant labor to remake its capital and construct gleaming stadiums from scratch. Saudi Arabia, widely condemned for its own human rights abuses, including the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, will host in 2034.

Trump has likewise looked the other way in his dealings in the Middle East this week, notably with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who the CIA concluded had ordered Khashoggi's death.

Trump instead focused on one of the things that unites them all: World Cup hosting duties.

“The World Cup is coming to the United States,” Trump said in Saudi Arabia, after remarking that Infantino was in the audience. “It's going to be really exciting next year.”

Trump and Infantino share ties dating back years. They have golfed together, dined together and taken countless photos together. At a dinner in Davos in 2020, Infantino introduced Trump with lavish praise.

“President Trump is definitely a sportsman,” Infantino said. “I am lucky enough in my life to come across some of the most talented athletes in soccer. And President Trump is made of the same sort of fiber. He is a competitor. He wants to compete. He wants to win. He wants to show who is the best.”

Infantino came to Trump's inauguration, and he has also visited the White House. Trump at times has had a replica of a World Cup trophy sitting behind him in the Oval Office, and the two men were together earlier in the month for a task force meeting about the planning for the event.

Much is on the line for Trump and Infantino — including whether the president's crackdown on immigrants will chill international attendance. There have also been concerns about whether the United States would grant visas for foreigners to come and support their countries in what is normally an event marked by its global flavor and fervent support.

The Trump administration has not exactly signaled a welcoming tone.

“We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game,” Vice President JD Vance said at the meeting. “But when the time is up, they'll have to go home.”

Infantino's presence with Trump for much of the week has caused some controversy in the soccer world. He rescheduled several events of his organization's governing body in Paraguay and then still arrived late. The episode triggered protests from several high-ranking members.

“To have the timetable changed at the last minute for what appears to be simply to accommodate private political interests, does the game no service and appears to put its interests second,” read a statement from UEFA.

Infantino has defended his relationship with Trump, which he said is critical to put on a smooth World Cup next year. He apologized to the forum for being late.

“As president of FIFA, my responsibility is to take decisions in the interests of the organization. I decided to spend the last two days in the Middle East, knowing the 2034 World Cup will be in Saudi Arabia and the 2022 World Cup was in Qatar,” he said, according to the Athletic.

The United States is hosting not only the World Cup next year but also another event this year that Infantino has put together called the Club World Cup, where club teams from around the world, rather than national teams, compete.

“Some important World Cup discussions took place, and I needed to be there to represent football and all of you,” he said of the Middle East trip. “We had an issue with our flight, which made this delay happen — apologies, sorry, and I am looking forward to spending time with you here.”

The mood was demonstrably brighter a few nights earlier in Doha.

After dinner at the palace Wednesday, the leaders walked down a long marble hallway into a bright atrium. At the center was a stand holding an official World Cup ball from 2022.

Trump arrived and held the ball aloft proudly. Al Thani then signed it and passed it to Trump, who did the same. Infantino was on hand, too, and also put his signature on the ball.

All three men were beaming.

The Trinity Railway Express and Dallas Area Rapid Transit expect to transport thousands of riders to and from matches during next year's FIFA World Cup — a feat that is expected to cost more than $18 million.

Nearly 60,000 fans are expected to attend each of nine matches held at Arlington Entertainment District during the 2026 summer games, according to a presentation from DART.

In preliminary transit plans, the agency said it plans to move about 9,800 riders from Dallas before and after each match. Preliminary cost estimates for moving riders throughout the region is $18.2 million, DART said Tuesday.

Those costs include $8.5 million for TRE service, equipment and upgrades in preparation for the World Cup, with another $2.5 million for light rail service and support.

The Trinity Railway Express can move around 5,800 riders before and after matches with peak 30-minute service frequency. Passengers will have last-mile connection to AT&T Stadium via private shuttle paid for by the North Central Texas Council of Governments. Room will be reserved for about 200 regular commuters.

The remaining attendees expected to use transit — about 4,000 people before or after each match — will be transported via about 50 DART buses from Victory Station to Lot H of AT&T Stadium.

Attendees of Fan Fest events at Fair Park and those visiting the International Broadcast Center at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center will be served by existing DART light rail and bus.

The Green Line will run three-car trains and add additional midday service to increase frequencies to 10 minutes between Victory Station and Lawnview Station for Fan Fest. 

The Red and Blue Lines will run two-car trains to the convention center, though access to rail and bus during the convention center renovation project is still under discussion.

...

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that.

They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat.

They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes.

In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer.

All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday.

“Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later.

“We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added.

In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. We have to want to be here 100%. We have to fight.”

But on Sunday, they floundered. For most of the first half, they didn't take the risks nor show the “aggression” they said they would. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own.

Soon thereafter, Diego Luna tried to inject life into the USMNT, and into another snoozefest. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers.

"The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want," Pochettino said postgame.

At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. He poked a clever square ball to Patrick Agyemang, who equalized with a firm finish.

The two Major League Soccer attackers, two of five changes to the U.S. starting lineup, seemed to lift a lagging team back into the game.

Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. The USMNT was once against stagnant. Why?

"I think we need to have every single person buy into exactly what we're doing and what we're trying to do," Adams said postgame. "It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us."

Not long after halftime, they receded again. They nearly conceded two penalties. (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) Then, in the 59th minute, they conceded again. Jonathan David put Canada up 2-1.

And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players.

It ended with Pochettino "disappointed," again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright.

"I want to send the message to the fans: Don't be pessimistic," Pochettino said.

But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: "In football, anything can happen."

And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt "shame" after the two losses, and promising, again, that "next time" would be different.

Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup.

"I'm never concerned, man. It's football," he said. "You gotta show up in big moments, when the moments matter. We didn't show up in this window here. We've showed up in the past, in moments when we needed to."

FIFA has sparked controversy with a major decision: the Club World Cup 2025 Play-In between Club América and LAFC will take place at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles, home of the MLS club. Scheduled for May 31 at 7:30 PM (local time), the announcement has already caused unrest in the América camp.


Home Advantage for LAFC in What Was Supposed to Be Neutral Ground



Initially expected to be held at a neutral venue, FIFA's move to hand home-field advantage to LAFC has raised serious concerns. Club América will now have to fight for a Club World Cup spot as visitors, something they feel compromises the fairness of this pivotal playoff match.

Within América's inner circle, there's growing frustration over what's being viewed as an imbalance in a match that determines the final slot for the most prestigious club competition on the planet.


Why Is There a Play-In?



This unique situation arose after Club León was excluded from the tournament due to FIFA's multi-ownership rule. Since both León and Pachuca are owned by the same group—and Pachuca had already qualified—FIFA ruled León ineligible. As a result, a Play-In was organized between:



LAFC – 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup runners-up
Club América – highest-ranked team in the Concacaf regional rankings not yet qualified



The winner of this high-stakes encounter will enter Group D, which already features Chelsea, Flamengo, and Espérance de Tunis.







More Than Pride on the Line



Beyond prestige, qualification offers a massive financial opportunity. The champion of the Club World Cup 2025 could walk away with up to $97 million USD—making this Play-In far more than just a formality.

While LAFC continues its MLS campaign, América is fully focused on the Clausura 2025 Liguilla, juggling domestic ambitions with international pressure. And now, with the Play-In already tilted in LAFC's favor, the Eagles' uphill battle has officially begun.

After a lackluster season that ended without a major trophy, Real Madrid are looking to bolster their squad this summer ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup.

Majors changes are coming to the biggest club in the world. Not only is Xabi Alonso in line to replace Carlo Ancelotti, but Real Madrid are also preparing to sign and welcome several new players to the Spanish capital. While the reported moves of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen are stealing the headlines, the club has now set their sights on a midfield reinforcement. 

MARCA reported Real Madrid held a virtual meeting with 17-year-old Franco Mastantuono's agents. No offer was made for the Argentine, but he is reportedly on Los Blancos' radar after his stellar season for River Plate. If Real Madrid want to sign Mastantuono, though, they must pay his €45 million ($51.3 million) release clause. 

The Spanish giants are reportedly eyeing Bayer Leverkusen's Exequiel Palacios as well. The Argentine previously almost signed with Real Madrid back in 2019, but the deal fell through after he suffered an injury. Now, six years alter, Palacios could be on his way to Madrid along with Alonso. After all, he fits the desired profile of a "team player" that will not break the bank to sign.

Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller and AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders are also named in the report. Both midfielders got to experience what a European night is like at the Santiago Bernabéu this season; Real Madrid faced both Stuttgart and AC Milan in the Champions League league phase, and Reijnders even found the back of the net in the Rossoneri's 3–1 victory over Ancelotti's men. 

Any of the four players would give Real Madrid more depth at the position for this summer's FIFA Club World Cup. Eduardo Camavinga is set to miss the tournament after suffering a complete tear of the tendon in his left adductor muscle, and Jude Bellingham could also miss some time if he undergoes a procedure to fix a nagging shoulder injury. 

The first of two summer transfer windows opens on June 1. Real Madrid will have until it closes on June 10 to put pen to paper to sign new players before the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. The tournament boasts a record $1 billion prize pool and gives Los Blancos an opportunity to bring a much-needed trophy back to Madrid.

MIAMI — Los Angeles FC will host Mexico's América on May 31 in their Club World Cup qualification playoff, FIFA finalized on Friday.

The winner will get group-stage games against Chelsea in Atlanta on June 16, then Esperance from Tunisia in Nashville, and Flamengo of Brazil in Orlando.

The play-in game is needed to complete the 32-team lineup of the tournament that starts on June 14 because another Mexican club, León, was removed. León broke tournament integrity rules being in the same ownership group as another Club World Cup entry, Pachuca.

FIFA announced the date and venue 10 days after León's appeal against expulsion was lost at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.

LAFC's 22,000-seat home BMO Stadium — next to the LA Memorial Coliseum and shared with Angel City — will stage the game at 7:30 p.m. local time.

That is several hours after the Champions League final in Munich between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. Both have qualified for the Club World Cup.

The Club World Cup entry for LAFC or América is worth an initial $9.55 million payment from FIFA for a CONCACAF region team, plus a share of the $1 billion in total prize money based on results at the month-long tournament. It is being played in 11 U.S. cities.

 FIFA planned the LAFC-América game in March after first ruling to expel León, which qualified by winning the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League.

FIFA said LAFC would be in the playoff because it was the beaten finalist against León, while América was the next best ranked team in its Club World Cup confederation ranking.

It was unclear why América — one of Mexico's best-supported teams — is eligible when FIFA rules cap each country at two entries unless it has more than two winners of a continental championship in the four-year qualifying period through 2024. 

Mexico already has Pachuca and Monterrey in the tournament that has been heavily promoted by FIFA President Gianni Infantino with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Trump has said he will attend the July 13 final at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey to present the gold trophy. It has spent much of the past few weeks in the Oval Office at the White House.

LAFC will host LIGA MX powerhouse Club América on Saturday, May 31 at BMO Stadium for a spot in this summer's FIFA Club World Cup.

The winner of the single-game playoff will replace Club León – who were disqualified due to FIFA's multi-club ownership rules – in Group D alongside Chelsea (England), Flamengo (Brazil) and ES Tunis (Tunisia).

Should LAFC prevail, they'll join Seattle Sounders FC (2022 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) and Inter Miami CF (host nation spot) as Major League Soccer's three representatives at the expanded, 32-team tournament that runs from June 14 to July 13 across the United States.

Concacaf teams earn a guaranteed $9.55 million for participating in the Club World Cup and could win up to nearly $100 million as part of the unprecedented $1 billion prize pool.

How they got here: 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup runners-up

Arguably the most successful MLS side of the past half-decade, LAFC won the 2022 MLS Cup-Supporters' Shield double and clinched the 2024 US Open Cup title while reaching six finals under head coach Steve Cherundolo, who recently announced he will depart the club at season's end.

The Black & Gold are led by star forward Denis Bouanga, a two-time MLS Best XI selection (2023, '24) who scored 20 league goals in back-to-back years, winning the MLS Golden Boot presented by Audi and the CCC Golden Boot in 2023.

Additional stars include French national team legends Olivier Giroud and Hugo Lloris, as well as rising Venezuelan winger David Martínez, homegrown forward Nathan Ordaz, and center back Aaron Long.

How they got here: Top-ranked team in the FIFA Club World Cup rankings after the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup

The most decorated club in Mexican history, Las Águilas have won a record 16 league titles, a record six Copa México crowns and a joint-record seven Campeón de Campeones trophies. They are also the most successful team in Concacaf Champions Cup history, with seven titles.

Coached by André Jardine, América's star-studded roster features goalkeeper Luis Malagón, midfielder Álvaro Fidalgo, winger Alejandro Zendejas and forward Víctor Dávila. Zendejas is a former FC Dallas homegrown who represents the US men's national team.

The three-time defending LIGA MX champions, América are currently facing Cruz Azul in the Clausura semifinals as they chase a fourth straight league title.

The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) could be set for one of its most high-profile tests in recent memory: a potential friendly against World Cup champions Argentina, with the match tentatively scheduled for November 2025 in Qatar. The tantalizing prospect of Christian Pulisic squaring off against Lionel Messi, in what would be a symbolic showdown of sports eras and continents, is still unconfirmed—but it has already sent ripples through the American soccer community.

According to Argentine journalist Gaston Edul, “Argentina is planning international friendlies in October and November, and the United States is among the possible opponents for the Albiceleste.“ While US Soccer has not yet confirmed the fixture, the game would fit squarely into a strategic final run of high-intensity matchups in the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which the U.S. is set to co-host alongside Canada and Mexico.

Under Mauricio Pochettino, the USMNT has embarked on a rigorous calendar of friendlies to refine squad chemistry and test tactical flexibility. Having already secured qualification as co-host, the United States is leveraging every international window to prepare for what could be a transformative tournament on home soil.

In September, the Stars and Stripes will face two of Asia's top sides: South Korea on September 6 at Sports Illustrated Stadium in New Jersey, and Japan on September 9 at Lower.com Field in Columbus, Ohio.

“We want to play against the best,” a source close to the federation told ESPN, emphasizing the need for “meaningful challenges in high-pressure environments.“

Japan, ranked No. 14 in the FIFA World Rankings, is currently Asia's top team and has not lost in 12 matches. South Korea, ranked No. 23, is also on the verge of World Cup qualification. These matches offer the U.S. a crucial measuring stick before heading into a potentially historic matchup against Argentina.

The 2022 World Cup winner remains one of the game's most dominant forces under head coach Lionel Scaloni. Whether Messi—now playing in MLS with Inter Miami—would feature in the proposed friendly is unclear. But the symbolic weight of the match, especially being played in Qatar, the site of Argentina's most recent glory, adds gravitas to the potential clash.

The proposed match would fall within the final FIFA international window of the year, running from November 10 to 18. While the U.S. is considering hosting matches in October, they are also reportedly looking at an international tour in November—a detail that aligns with the Qatar fixture.

Friday's reports claim that Manchester City want to sign Netherlands international Tijjani Reijnders from Milan in time for the beginning of the FIFA Club World Cup, which kicks off in mid-June. 

Reports over the last few weeks indicate that a number of Europe's biggest clubs are interested in striking a deal for Reijnders during the summer transfer window. Manchester City and Real Madrid specifically have been linked with a move for the Dutchman over the last few days. 

Now, according to reports from Calciomercato.com, City are keen on wrapping up a deal with Milan by the beginning of June so that Reijnders is available in Guardiola's squad in time for the Club World Cup in the United States. 

A price tag in the region of €70m has been quoted by various outlets, while Calciomercato.com claims that City are prepared to offer €70m, while Milan will seek a total package in the region of €75m-€80m including bonuses. 

Reijnders recently signed a new and improved contract extension with the Rossoneri in March, which runs until the summer of 2030. He had been earning around €1.7m per season in wages on his first Milan contract, which has reportedly risen to somewhere in the region of €3.5m plus bonuses. 



70m would be the deal of the century for Milan.

Serie A

“We didn't find the right solutions,” said Christian Pulisic, ashen-faced and frustrated as he addressed the media to a backdrop of opposition euphoria in Rome.

At Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday night, the United States men's national team star tried to drag his team back into a Coppa Italia final they had trailed to Bologna since Dan Ndoye's 53rd-minute strike.

Advertisement

Pulisic scored and assisted in a vital Serie A win against the same opponents five days earlier, but couldn't find the net when tasked with turning in Luka Jovic's saved shot in the first half.

Later, with the clock ticking, he tried to go it alone, beating three defenders and zipping into the area but Bologna goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski foiled him before he could shoot.

Fourteen minutes later, his race was run, and head coach Sergio Conceicao replaced the American, perhaps with an eye on another key game back at the Olimpico against Roma on Sunday. At full time, the Bologna players, staff and supporters celebrated wildly.

So, no solutions for Milan on the night but a result that could leave one of their best players pondering other ways to solve an issue.

If Milan cannot beat Roma in two days, their chances of salvaging Champions League qualification will be over. Even victories in their final two games would leave Milan needing a staggering concoction of other results to go their way.

Even aside from the Champions League, Milan could miss out on European football altogether, with the Coppa Italia's backdoor to reach the Europa League having closed and a current league position of eighth leaving even the Conference League a long shot.

Should they fail, Pulisic and those around him may ask the question: does he need to be playing at the highest level of club competition going into the World Cup year?

The Champions League is the place all top players want to be. Often, they move teams to get there and speak of those big nights competing against the elite of Europe as the peak of their careers.

Pulisic is no stranger to the biggest stage of all. He played the last 24 minutes of the 2021 final, helping Chelsea to beat Manchester City 1-0. That victory was the highlight of his nine separate seasons in the competition. The last two of those have been with Milan, and this year he scored four goals as his team exited in the revamped league phase.

But if Milan fail to qualify for the 2025-26 edition, he will not be honing his tools alongside the best of Europe. Will that affect his levels going into the World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico?

He will still likely remain a pivotal man for Milan, playing in one of Europe's top leagues (the re-energized Italian top flight is arguably stronger than it has been in a long time, with Milan's rivals Inter reaching the Champions League final and with two games to go are in a thrilling race with Napoli for the scudetto).

Sure, his morale may initially be dented by having to sit on the outside and potentially watch as compatriots Weston McKennie and Tim Weah play Champions League with Juventus (although even that is not certain). But Pulisic is professional and focused enough not to let that limit his motivation in a key year.

There is an argument that the 26-year-old might benefit from fewer minutes heading into 2026, something Mauricio Pochettino may ponder as he decides how much to call upon Pulisic this summer across friendly games and the Concacaf Gold Cup.

All this is assuming Pulisic remains a Milan player. There have been constant rumors the attacker has been close to signing a new contract at San Siro, but a deal has not yet been agreed and there may well be Champions League clubs interested in him this summer after his fine personal form during the team's otherwise tumultuous campaign.

Bids may give him pause for thought, but there could be something to be said for staying put. Top players may want to be in the top competitions, but international managers prioritize consistent minutes for their stars.

Often, the USMNT debate while Pulisic was in and out of the Chelsea team centered on whether he needed to be playing every week, and in a side where he had a responsibility that mirrored his pivotal role with the national team.

He has that at Milan, unchanged across three different managers since he arrived, where he is consistently counted on to deliver. It may not have worked against silverware-starved Bologna on Wednesday, but often he is Milan's game-changer, charged with leading the side as he does his country.

Would he be better moving for the sake of the Champions League, to a club where he might have to start afresh in proving he can be a regular, or risk being considered a squad player? Unlikely.

Pulisic would likely back himself, and his talent, to avoid that fate again but even if the San Siro is not the perfect example of stability, it has represented that to the player who burst onto the scene with Borussia Dortmund before feeling he was underused for some of his time at Stamford Bridge.

Whatever happens over the next two fixtures, and Milan are that unpredictable you could not quite fully rule out a dramatic late surge into fourth, Pulisic will have choices to make going into the summer.

Does he suck it up and hope Milan show the type of ambition in the transfer market that proves they will challenge for the Serie A title, or at least top four, next season?

Or does the lure of Champions League football, going into the biggest year of his professional life, mean he may need to search for pastures new?

Settling on the right solution will be essential for the contentment of the USMNT's best player before 2026.

Serie A

“We didn't find the right solutions,” said Christian Pulisic, ashen-faced and frustrated as he addressed the media to a backdrop of opposition euphoria in Rome.

At Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday night, the United States men's national team star tried to drag his team back into a Coppa Italia final they had trailed to Bologna since Dan Ndoye's 53rd-minute strike.

Pulisic scored and assisted in a vital Serie A win against the same opponents five days earlier, but couldn't find the net when tasked with turning in Luka Jovic's saved shot in the first half.

Later, with the clock ticking, he tried to go it alone, beating three defenders and zipping into the area but Bologna goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski foiled him before he could shoot.

Fourteen minutes later, his race was run, and head coach Sergio Conceicao replaced the American, perhaps with an eye on another key game back at the Olimpico against Roma on Sunday. At full time, the Bologna players, staff and supporters celebrated wildly.

So, no solutions for Milan on the night but a result that could leave one of their best players pondering other ways to solve an issue.

If Milan cannot beat Roma in two days, their chances of salvaging Champions League qualification will be over. Even victories in their final two games would leave Milan needing a staggering concoction of other results to go their way.

Even aside from the Champions League, Milan could miss out on European football altogether, with the Coppa Italia's backdoor to reach the Europa League having closed and a current league position of eighth leaving even the Conference League a long shot.

Should they fail, Pulisic and those around him may ask the question: does he need to be playing at the highest level of club competition going into the World Cup year?

The Champions League is the place all top players want to be. Often, they move teams to get there and speak of those big nights competing against the elite of Europe as the peak of their careers.

Pulisic is no stranger to the biggest stage of all. He played the last 24 minutes of the 2021 final, helping Chelsea to beat Manchester City 1-0. That victory was the highlight of his nine separate seasons in the competition. The last two of those have been with Milan, and this year he scored four goals as his team exited in the revamped league phase.

But if Milan fail to qualify for the 2025-26 edition, he will not be honing his tools alongside the best of Europe. Will that affect his levels going into the World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico?

He will still likely remain a pivotal man for Milan, playing in one of Europe's top leagues (the re-energized Italian top flight is arguably stronger than it has been in a long time, with Milan's rivals Inter reaching the Champions League final and with two games to go are in a thrilling race with Napoli for the scudetto).

Sure, his morale may initially be dented by having to sit on the outside and potentially watch as compatriots Weston McKennie and Tim Weah play Champions League with Juventus (although even that is not certain). But Pulisic is professional and focused enough not to let that limit his motivation in a key year.

There is an argument that the 26-year-old might benefit from fewer minutes heading into 2026, something Mauricio Pochettino may ponder as he decides how much to call upon Pulisic this summer across friendly games and the Concacaf Gold Cup.

All this is assuming Pulisic remains a Milan player. There have been constant rumors the attacker has been close to signing a new contract at San Siro, but a deal has not yet been agreed and there may well be Champions League clubs interested in him this summer after his fine personal form during the team's otherwise tumultuous campaign.

Bids may give him pause for thought, but there could be something to be said for staying put. Top players may want to be in the top competitions, but international managers prioritize consistent minutes for their stars.

Often, the USMNT debate while Pulisic was in and out of the Chelsea team centered on whether he needed to be playing every week, and in a side where he had a responsibility that mirrored his pivotal role with the national team.

He has that at Milan, unchanged across three different managers since he arrived, where he is consistently counted on to deliver. It may not have worked against silverware-starved Bologna on Wednesday, but often he is Milan's game-changer, charged with leading the side as he does his country.

Would he be better moving for the sake of the Champions League, to a club where he might have to start afresh in proving he can be a regular, or risk being considered a squad player? Unlikely.

Pulisic would likely back himself, and his talent, to avoid that fate again but even if the San Siro is not the perfect example of stability, it has represented that to the player who burst onto the scene with Borussia Dortmund before feeling he was underused for some of his time at Stamford Bridge.

Whatever happens over the next two fixtures, and Milan are that unpredictable you could not quite fully rule out a dramatic late surge into fourth, Pulisic will have choices to make going into the summer.

Does he suck it up and hope Milan show the type of ambition in the transfer market that proves they will challenge for the Serie A title, or at least top four, next season?

Or does the lure of Champions League football, going into the biggest year of his professional life, mean he may need to search for pastures new?

Settling on the right solution will be essential for the contentment of the USMNT's best player before 2026.

LFC VS. PALACE 25.05.2025

CHAMPIONS SOUVENIR PROGRAMME

Liverpool are awaiting an opportunity to sign Florian Wirtz after talks with the Bayer Leverkusen attacking midfielder, and a decision could accelerate rapidly.

Wirtz and his parents flew into the UK earlier this week to meet with the Liverpool officials and discuss a potential move to Anfield.

It comes with the Reds among the clubs hoping to sign Leverkusen's No. 10 this summer, with reports in both England and Germany confirming their intentions.

The Times‘ Paul Joyce has explained that Liverpool will “make a strong pitch” to Wirtz should he “show an inclination to move to the Premier League.”

Liverpool's belief is that the 22-year-old would prefer a switch to Bayern Munich, but Bild‘s Christian Falk claims they are at least ahead of Man City in the running.

Progress could be made in talks over a deal for Wirtz upon the conclusion of the Bundesliga campaign on Saturday, when Leverkusen visit Mainz knowing they are already guaranteed to finish second.

And new comments from Bayern sporting director Max Eberl suggest that they could look to bring the playmaker in before the Club World Cup next month.



“There's a lot of speculation in Munich, and everyone has their own opinion. Of course, that doesn't make things easy,” he told reporters on Friday, as reported by the Liverpool Echo.

“With the Club World Cup, this summer is obviously special. I try to ignore it as much as possible.”

Bayern will face Auckland City, Boca Juniors and Benfica in Group C of the Club World Cup and, as with Real Madrid and Trent Alexander-Arnold, would be eager to involve Wirtz if possible.

That comes with up to £97 million in prize money available for each club competing.

While no guarantee that they will therefore sign the player, the opportunity to do so in a pre-tournament transfer window running from June 1 to 10 could force a decision over his future – be it Bayern, Liverpool or elsewhere.



Speaking to SPORT1, Eberl directly responded to Wirtz's trip to the UK, saying: “What can I say? Florian Wirtz is free to visit Liverpool, Manchester, Madrid, or whatever with his family and friends.”

“For now, he's under contract with Bayer Leverkusen,” he continued.

“We can't let all the speculation – ‘agreement reached', ‘contract signed' – get to us. We're doing our job and perhaps know the facts better than all the speculation going on around us.”

Leverkusen are reported to value Wirtz at €150 million (£126.4m), though interested parties would almost certainly look to negotiate that down.

Enrique Sanz

Real Madrid approaches the final stretch of the current league campaign with nothing to decide. FC Barcelona's victory against Espanyol, at the RCDE Stadium, leaves Hansi Flick's pupils as mathematical champions of the tournament. In that sense, the white club is already looking at the next competition they must play: the Club World Cup.

The tournament organized by FIFA this summer will start on June 18 for the white squad. That date appears as a very clear deadline in the Valdebebas offices according to the information handled by Melchor Ruiz. The COPE journalist has revealed the roadmap that the leaders led by Florentino Pérez would have for the next three weeks.

The first name on the agenda, the veteran journalist points out, "would be Carlo Ancelotti, that farewell and tribute" at Santiago Bernabéu. "Let's see if on Saturday the 24th or Sunday the 25th and then already in the auditorium of the Sports City as they bid farewell to all the legends". Real Madrid would be preparing a "private event" as on repeated occasions, but "from there the order would start with the announcements and presentations of the signings" achieved in the summer.

"Initially the idea is to announce first Xabi Alonso, then Alexander-Arnold, third Huijsen", Melchor Ruiz points out on COPE. Additionally, the journalist recalls that the operation "is not completely closed, but it will be carried out" in the coming days or weeks because "those details remain" typical of this transfer.

Melchor Ruiz warns that Real Madrid has set in motion another signing: "it would also be attempted, in those first ten days" before the Club World Cup, "the left-back". The number one candidate right now on the white team's list of prospects for that position is none other than Álvaro Carreras. The Benfica defender "is very much liked," although "Grimaldo also" seems like an option to expand the assets in that area of the field.

"But just last night, almost at dawn today, they told me 'these two names are important, we are on it but there are also others'" candidates. Melchor Ruiz points out that those three signings thought of in the Valdebebas offices, in addition to Xabi Alonso himself, are "brought forward to be at the Club World Cup".

Melchor Ruiz points out that "there are several names also on the table" to add assets to the midfield. But that incorporation "would be dealt with later" without considering the clearly established deadline by the Club World Cup. "Right now, the ones that sound the most are the German Stiller from Stuttgart, Reijnders the Dutchman from Milan, and Exequiel Palacios from Leverkusen who knows Xabi Alonso perfectly", Melchor Ruiz concludes.

Thus, Real Madrid will experience two really hectic weeks given the multiple changes that must be made to the first team before the Club World Cup. The last pending signing in the Valdebebas offices, however, would be postponed until the end of that competition organized by FIFA... because no one in the club would consider the arrival of a midfielder to Santiago Bernabéu locker room so urgent, at least compared to the defense.

Carlo Ancelotti can strengthen his claim to be the greatest manager in football history by leading Brazil to World Cup glory next summer.

The Italian coach has practically completed the club game, having won a record five Champions League titles with Real Madrid and AC Milan. He's also the only manager in history to have won titles in each of Europe's five major leagues – the Premier League, Serie A, Ligue 1, Bundesliga and La Liga.

Next up, Ancelotti will attempt to reach the zenith of the international game and end Brazil's 24-year wait to get their hands on the most prestigious trophy in football.

Here are the only two managers who have won both the Champions League (or old European Cup) and the World Cup.

In 1996, Lippi watched on from the Stadio Olimpico touchline as his Juventus side beat Louis van Gaal's Ajax in a penalty shootout.

All four of his players converted their spot-kicks, the Old Lady showing their mettle to make it over the line and get it won – something they've failed to do in five successive final appearances since then.

Ten years later he did the same as the Azzurri took on Les Bleus on the biggest stage of all at Berlin's Olympiastadion. Another 1-1 draw after 120 absorbing minutes and another occasion in which his lieutenants successfully tucked away their pens.

“There's no right or wrong way to start out as a coach, but it is important to have the ability to work with players,” wrote Claudio Ranieri of his old pal Lippi in The Observer ahead of the 2006 World Cup final.

“You need to manage them, in all senses of the word, and to motivate them. But above all you need to know your football, how to read the game and change things during a match.

“Lippi does all this. As well as being superb at communicating with his players, he is a great motivator. He knows he can't be a friend to them, can't be too close, but also that he must not be too distant. He needs to give the right sort of understanding and feeling to his team.”

Remind you of anyone else? Ranieri could just as easily be talking about another of his compatriots, Ancelotti.

Being a brilliant man-manager as well as an adept in-game tactician is a perfect recipe for tournament football.

A defensive midfielder in his playing days, Del Bosque won five league titles and four Copa del Rey with Real Madrid in the 1970s and early 1980s.

He later served as a youth coach, interim and caretaker before finally landing the big gig on a permanent basis in 1999.

The year before, Jupp Heynckes had led the club to their sixth European Cup – and first in 32 years – but left only a few days later after domestic underperformance and a spectacular falling out with the board.

Inheriting a squad of winners, the mild-mannered Del Bosque kept that spirit going by delivering the Champions League trophy in 2000 and 2002, making it three in five years for Los Blancos around the turn of the century.

That pedigree made him the perfect candidate to take on Spain's Euro 2008 champions following the departure of Luis Aragones.

Sure enough, just as he'd done at the highest level of the club game, Del Bosque guided La Roja to World Cup glory in South Africa.

“I told them that this was the game of our lives,” Del Bosque reminisced in an interview with FourFourTwo.

“We were football romantics, and I knew we were going to have the opportunity to experience a beautiful night, unique for many people. I told them that it was not a war, but a sport, and that we could win or lose.”

Inter Milan will add a total of four or five players to their squad ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup this summer.

This according to today's print edition of Rome-based newspaper Corriere dello Sport, via FCInterNews. They anticipate two or three signings plus a couple of youngsters returning.

Inter Milan play in the Club World Cup this summer.

The Nerazzurri are one of two Serie A clubs along with Juventus in the expanded version of the competition.

And Inter will have the chance to bolster their squad with signings during a special transfer window between the first and tenth of next month.

Inter Milan have already completed one deal ahead of the Club World Cup.

Midfielder Petar Sucic signed his deal in February. He will join the Nerazzurri from Dinamo Zagreb at the start of June, and will therefore be available for the Club World Cup.

Meanwhile, the Corriere report, Inter are also pushing to sign Luis Henrique from Marseille before the Club World Cup kicks off.

Furthermore, the newspaper anticipate, Inter will also sign a defender ahead of the competition.

The top target at the back now looks to be Genoa's Edgar De Winter. However, Bologna duo Sam Beukema and Jhon Lucumi are also on Inter's shortlist.

Apart from signings, though, the Corriere also anticipate a couple players returning to Inter's squad.

Attacking midfielder Valentin Carboni should finally be back after suffering a horror knee injury in the autumn while out on loan with Marseille.

Meanwhile, striker Francesco Pio Esposito will be back from loan with Spezia.

Pio Esposito will be participating in the Under-21 Euros with Italy. However, he could return to the Inter squad during the Club World Cup after the end of the international tournament.

The talent acquisition strategies of big and small nations alike has changed markedly in a chaotically deglobalizing world

Consider a World Cup qualifier that took place in late March in Sydney. An Australian team coached by the son of Croatian immigrants, with an attack led by a Scottish-born naturalized Australian and a second generation Sri Lankan Tamil-Australian, faced an Indonesian team in which all but one of the starting XI were born and raised in the Netherlands. Nurtured by the Dutch academy system and performing, in many cases, at a high level in club football throughout Europe and the US, these players qualified for Tim Garuda thanks to ancestral links to Indonesia, a former Dutch colony.

Indonesian footballing authorities have, for the past year or so, pursued an aggressive naturalization policy in a bid to qualify for the 2026 World Cup – a curious reversal of the extraction that the Dutch inflicted on Indonesia, a major source of agricultural and mineral wealth, through the 19th and 20th centuries. This policy of strength through Dutchification wasn't much help on that night against Australia: Indonesia eventually lost 5-1. But the heavy defeat did nothing to dim the spirits of a boisterous majority-Indonesian crowd.

The real fascination of the contest, arguably, was in its contrast of talent acquisition strategies – Australia's driven by immigration and multiculturalism, Indonesia's following the boomerang of colonization. Football's rush into a more globalized future – right when the international direction of geo-economic travel is in the other direction – is creating both opportunities and incongruities. In a chaotically deglobalizing world, soccer might now be globalization's most persuasive argument.

International football has always involved a war for talent at some level; from Giuseppe Rossi to Declan Rice, the agonies of dual nationals choosing one path over another have stirred debate for decades. The old colonial connection works to the advantage of both colonizers and colonized. Portugal, for example, has for many years benefited from its domestic league's status as a draw for Brazilians to naturalize players like Deco and Pepe, while African countries such as Algeria, Morocco, and Senegal have long drawn on the strength of French football, with its significant African diaspora, to make their national teams more competitive. (If the suburbs of Paris competed as a single nation, they'd comfortably be among the best teams in the world.) This two-way traffic extends to the exploitation of multiculturalism as a recruitment lever, in which receiving countries become senders and sending countries re-receive: the Turkish community in Germany delivered Turkey its current national team captain, Hakan Çalhanoğlu, but it's also the cradle from which Die Mannschaft's most enigmatic player this century, Mesut Özil, emerged.

The share of foreign-born players at the World Cup, to take the most obvious index of globalization, has consistently grown over the past three decades. In 1990, just 6.2% of the players at the World Cup were born in a country other than the one they represented, according to an analysis by Vox; by 2022, that share had risen to 16.5%.

Rule changes, perhaps unsurprisingly, have also helped the foreign-born national team player emerge as a central character in world football. After introducing a “clear connection” requirement in 2004 after Qatar tried to fill its national team with uncapped mercenaries who had no connection to the Gulf state, Fifa adjusted the scheme in 2021 so that players with three or fewer caps for a national team before the age of 21 can switch allegiances. This has boosted the mobility of players across borders who might otherwise be “cap-tied” by their appearance in only one or two representative matches while still developing as a player and person.

Though buying a national team outright is still (quite rightly) prohibited, countries are growing more skilled at discovering seams of eligible talent. Agents, whose own financial interests are naturally geared towards giving their clients as much exposure as possible, are becoming more aggressive in their “advertisement” of players to the federations for which they qualify.

The Indonesian strategy is perhaps the most extreme example of what's possible under the current rules. No doubt, there's a real advantage to be gained (in the short-term at least) from being a country in the footballing periphery with a viable connection to a place with a deep pool of talent. Still, the move to go all-in on naturalization has provoked predictable debate in Indonesia and among regional rivals about fairness, the dilution of national identity, and a potential weakening of the domestic league.

For Indonesia, there are at least precedents to guide this great experiment in mass naturalization. Building on the historic migratory links between the two countries, Japan had a measure of success with naturalizing Brazilians like Marcus Tulio Tanaka and Alessandro “Alex” Santos in the 1990s and 2000s, before the J-League and domestic player development became strong enough to reduce the dependence on naturalizations to make the national team competitive. Interestingly, “haafu” or half-Japanese players like Zion Suzuki are now an increasingly important part of the national setup, which perhaps demonstrates the different stages the quest for talent can cycle through.

At the other end of the spectrum is China, which attempted to follow the Japanese model by naturalizing foreign-born players like Elkeson, Fernando, and Nico Yennaris in a failed quest to qualify for the 2022 World Cup; the policy has now largely been abandoned, with China reverting to domestic development. The key to Japan's successful transition from a naturalization-focused national team to one anchored in more “conventional”, homegrown playing strength – a corollary to its emergence into a genuine global power on the field – has been the popularity and growth of the J-League. How far China can progress with a domestic league that has had its ambition and financial power clipped in recent years remains to be seen. The promise of naturalization is just as often false as it is firm.

Being a country that people want to visit can also offer advantages, even if their distribution is unpredictable: US star Yunus Musah, for instance, was brought up and nurtured as a soccer talent largely in the UK but qualifies for the US thanks to him being born in New York while his mother was on vacation. Having all of these advantages at once, of course, gives a country unique recruiting strength, and owing to the growing heft of MLS this is the category to which the US, along with the UK, France, Spain and Portugal, now unequivocally belongs.

Canny exploitation of the eligibility rules might help smaller footballing nations be competitive but in the long run it's the richest and most powerful countries that will probably reap the biggest rewards. The current USMNT is unmistakably a team born of this moment's global tussle for talent: Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun, Cameron Carter-Vickers, and Sergiño Dest are all foreign-born and -raised, while other regular fixtures in the team like Gio Reyna, Tim Weah, and Ricardo Pepi have experienced, to differing degrees, the difficulties involved in choosing a single sporting nationality as a player eligible for multiple teams.

Reyna is, of course, the son of US legend Claudio Reyna, and despite being born in England and nurtured by the German academy structure, the way he tells it there was never any doubt that he would play for the USMNT.

Debates over naturalization and the pitch to dual nationals have waxed and waned over the years, but in the US they were perhaps never stronger than during the reign of Jürgen Klinsmann, a staunch Europeanist famous for his disrespect of MLS. Klinsmann's selections were notable for drawing extensively on the dividend of America's projection of military power – and people – across the globe. US military bases became an unlikely recruiting ground for the US: Jermaine Jones, John Brooks, and Timothy Chandler were all born to US service personnel stationed in Germany and rose through domestic German football but each went on to represent, to varying degrees of distinction, Klinsmann's USMNT.

Though “military brats” have featured less frequently under Gregg Berhalter and Mauricio Pochettino, the unmatched global projection of US military power – especially in Europe – does offer an additional potential selection advantage that no other national team can boast. Birthright citizenship, the constitutional guarantee that gave Musah a US passport, needs no justification, but improved national team depth is perhaps the only good argument for militarism, in any context.

How much longer some of these advantages will exist for is another question. With Donald Trump threatening to pull back the US security umbrella over Europe, his administration actively pursuing an end to birthright citizenship, and federal immigration authorities viciously targeting the Latino community, a traditional source of playing strength for American soccer, the USMNT is facing a future in which the next generation's Musahs and Joneses – and perhaps even Reynas and Pepis and Weahs – simply won't exist. Meanwhile all three branches of the federal government have united in an effort to make this country as xenophobic and inhospitable to foreigners as possible in the runup to next year's World Cup.

A nation that's been a great beneficiary of football's booming cosmopolitanism is now doing its best to strip itself of its own unique advantages, withdrawing into a form of sporting autarky. The US, given all its natural strengths and the sheer variety of unusual recruitment options available to it, should be at the head of the global scramble for soccer talent in the years ahead. Under the country's current misdirection, that seems less and less likely.

Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz overcame Musetti and windy conditions in just over two hours to reach his fourth final of the season ahead of the French Open, which gets underway later this month.

Alcaraz now awaits the result of Sinner's last-four clash with Tommy Paul later on Friday to see if he will get the showdown that tennis fans around the world want to see.

World number one Sinner is the red-hot favourite to beat American Paul after dumping out Madrid Open champion Casper Ruud on Thursday with an astonishing display of tennis.

"Both players are playing great. Everybody saw the game against Casper," said Alcaraz, who might again have to face down a partisan centre court crowd on Sunday.

"Let's see. If I'm going to play against Tommy Paul, I have to be ready for that. If I play against Jannik, I have to be ready for that battle, and obviously deal with the crowd."

Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display.

The 23-year-old gave up three breaks of serve and made 29 unforced errors in the first set, and he was warned by umpire Renaud Lichtenstein after slamming his racket into the clay as he gave up his serve to go a set behind.

Alcaraz gave Musetti an opening when he fired long at break point in the first game of the second set, before the Italian then did the exact same thing in the next game to level it up.

But Musetti fought back with another break of Alcaraz's serve and then held his with more disciplined tennis to go to 4-3 in the set, even drawing applause from Alcaraz for one spectacular backhand volley he plucked out of the sky.

But Alcaraz broke back in game eight to level the set, sparking a furious reaction from Musetti, who was punished with a point for the following game for smashing the ball into the stands.

Alcaraz served that game to love as Musetti continued to fume, and he ended the crowd's hopes of an all-Italian final by coming through the decisive tie-break

It all added up for Tommy Paul earlier this year when he cracked the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time. Will he next achieve one of his biggest goals: claiming ATP Masters 1000 glory?

The American is trying to do just that this week at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, where he is into the semi-finals with a run that has included a victory against longtime foe Alex de Minaur, who had led their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 5-0.

ATPTour.com caught up with Paul at Indian Wells to discuss why playing De Minaur is difficult, his greatest success, why he doesn't feel he has dealt with too many difficulties and plenty more.



What is your favourite tennis rivalry?
Rafa and Roger, it's my favourite rivalry in tennis.

Who is your greatest rival?
I don't know if it's a rivalry, because he's got me so many times, but me and Demon [Alex de Minaur] have had some serious wars, and he's got me in some big matches, so I'm out for revenge on Demon.

What makes him so tough to play?
Consistency. Doesn't miss a ball. He's a dog on court.

What has been your greatest success?
I would say my greatest success so far is last year in Queen's [Club], winning the 500 title. That was a special thing at a special place. 

What's the greatest difficulty you've had to overcome?
I don't like to feel like I've had too many huge difficulties in my life. I play tennis for my job and for a living, and I think life's been pretty good.

What's been the most unique moment in your career?
Transitioning from juniors to pros is unique. I think for a lot of people it's easier than others and for me it was a difficult time, but definitely a big change in lifestyle.

What is the biggest number or the biggest accomplishment that you're chasing?
I guess the biggest thing that I'm chasing is a tournament, a Masters 1000 title or Top 5 in the world.

How long have you been pursuing that?

I guess my whole life. I feel like every time I go to a tournament, the goal is to win the tournament. And I played quite a few of these, and I've wanted to win every single one that I've played.

What's your favourite tournament to play?
My favourite tournament to play in is either Indian Wells, Wimbledon, or the US Open. US Open because it's the home slam for us. Wimbledon, it's the mecca. And Indian Wells, because [it is] tennis paradise.

 

What's been the coolest off-court experience you've been able to enjoy being a professional tennis player?
I've gone to a lot of really cool sporting events, whether it's on the Tour or at home. I guess earlier this year, the Eagles won the Super Bowl, and I went to the NFC Championship game. That was a pretty awesome event to go to.

Has being a professional tennis player given you some better fishing opportunities?
Before the [US] Open, a couple years ago, we went fishing in the Hamptons, and that was quite an experience.

Every major sportswear brand brings its best apparel and footwear to the Grand Slams. Clay court season is in full swing, and the tennis world is preparing to descend upon Paris for Roland Garros later this month.

Parisian culture dictates a high quality of fashion, and no company wants an unforced error on the clay courts of Philippe Chatrier. Over the past month, various brands have already begun rolling out their on-court kits for the French Open. 

Earlier today, fans got their first look at On's "Summer" and "Mid-Summer" court collections designed for Roland Garros and the start of grass court season.

It looks like On is sticking with its gradient designs for Grand Slams, this time using a rainbow mix of green, yellow, blue, and purple. The collections do not appear on the On website (yet); instead, they leaked early at TennisWarehouse.com.

The On Men's Summer Court collection includes just three pieces available for purchase at this time: the Court Sleeveless Top ($70), Court Top ($80), and Court Short ($80).

Tennis fans can expect to see Ben Shelton and Joao Fonseca debut the rainbow-inspired kits on court in Paris later this month.

Meanwhile, the On Women's Summer and Mid-Summer Court collection has more to offer at this time. It sticks with the rainbow gradient for Summer while using a familiar black and purple color scheme for Mid-Summer.

The Summer and Mid-Summer Court collections include the Courtside Pleat Skirt ($100), Court Skirt ($100), Court Crop Top ($80), Court Top ($80), and Court Tank ($70). Fans can expect to see Iga Swiatek wear pieces from the collection as she defends her French Open title.

Some tennis fans on social media have expressed a desire to see On move away from the gradient patterns, but the Swiss brand always stands out on the court compared to rival companies that try to blend in with neutral designs.

Ben Shelton has had an up-and-down season on the ATP Tour, as the American continues his pursuit of a third career title. 

The American has struggled to find consistency this year, with several early-round exits, despite making it to the final of the Munich Open recently, where Shelton lost to Zverev.

Shelton made the semi-final of the Australian Open, marking a strong start to the season, but since then hasn't been able to get it going, with a record of ten wins and nine losses since the first major of 2025.

The 22-year-old still has his entire career ahead of him, and former world number one Andre Agassi recently discussed how he can best utilise those future years. 

Speaking on the Tennis Channel Live Podcast, Agassi said: “I love Ben. I have known his Dad for many years and had the chance to meet his Mom, such a wonderful lady, they have done such a wonderful job with him.”

“I love his spirit, I love his athleticism. The guy is a force to be reckoned with. He has one of the liveliest arms you have ever seen.”

“There are a number of ways he can be better, I do believe. He is still really raw. So powerful, he can take the racket out of a lot of people's hands, nobody wants to see him next to their name in the draw.”

“I think he can make life even a little easier for himself, but he is one of those guys who for two weeks can go to heaven and make some great stuff happen in the biggest moments in tennis, I really believe that.”

“I have never seen him in a situation where he feels outmatched. Every time he is out there in the biggest of moments, he looks like he wants that ball on his racket, and that is a great sign too, especially at such a young age.”

Following his Australian Open final-four appearance, Shelton went out in the Round of 16 at both the Dallas Open and the Mexican Open. 

He showed promising signs in the first half of the ‘sunshine double', overcoming Mariano Navone, Karen Khachanov, and Brandon Nakashima to reach the quarter-finals in Indian Wells, but ultimately fell to eventual champion Jack Draper. 

Shelton then lost in the opening round of the Miami Open, as well as the Monte-Carlo Masters before enjoying his best run of the season in Munich.

The last two tournaments of the clay swing haven't gone to plan for the world number 13, having crashed out of the Madrid Open and the Italian Open in the third and second round, respectively. 

Shelton's last title came in April 2024, when he emerged victorious at an ATP 250 event in Houston.

Often characterised by unpredictable bounces and quick kicks, grass tennis courts have long been considered one of the sport's most challenging surfaces to master.

They're a key reason Wimbledon is widely seen as the most iconic tournament in tennis.

Known for rewarding aggressive styles of play, the surface was once dominated by serve-and-volley specialists like Boris Becker and Pete Sampras.

When discussing changing tactics in grass court tennis, Jeff Sackmann, founder of statistical website Tennis Abstract, said: “It's been a huge move towards baseline play, definitely. 

“If you go back to the 90s, you have Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker, Greg Rusedski and Tim Henman who would serve and volley.

“Now, it's basically gone.”

One factor which may have contributed to this shift is the fact that tour-level grass tennis courts have now become more durable – a precedent thought to be set by Wimbledon's change to using 100% ryegrass courts in 2001.

Previously, the All England Club used only 70% ryegrass. 

Speaking on the famous switch, Co-Head Coach of Wigmore Lawn Tennis Club in London, Scott Davies, said: “Although before this change, the grass courts were faster, their durability was worse.

“So they'd start off really fast, and then they'd wear down and become way more unpredictable. They'd have slow patches and fast patches, bad bounces.”

The modern grass tennis court, thanks to ryegrass and improved maintenance, plays flatter and more reliably, somewhat resembling hard courts in pace and bounce.

This has caused some players and fans to believe that grass courts have slowed down in recent years, according to Tennis View Magazine.

Therefore, the assumption that grass courts are the fastest on tour may have become somewhat outdated. 

But how could these speed changes be measured?

When discussing strong indicators of surface speed, statistician Sackmann said: “Aces are great and basically, it just tells you how well the returner is able to respond. And that's going to be something influenced by the surface speed.”

While rally length is also considered to be a valuable tool for measuring surface speed, Sackmann believes both produce similar results.

Tennis Abstract's surface-speed metric uses ace rates to compare court speeds across ATP events, not just the Slams, indirectly factoring in external elements, such as temperature, humidity, wind, the balls used, and of course the physical surface.

A score of 1.25, for example, indicates players would hit 25% more aces on a certain tournament's surface than the tour average for that year, therefore suggesting a significantly faster court.

According to this measure, the gap between court speeds has narrowed since 1991, compared to 2023, particularly between grass and hard courts – perhaps a result of the use of ryegrass. 

However, clay courts, with their naturally higher friction, remain the slowest by a wide margin.

Still, recent statistics from Grand Slam tournaments show that grass courts continue to offer an advantage to powerful servers.

In 2024, Wimbledon, which is currently the only major to be played on grass, produced the highest number of combined aces across both the men's and women's draws.

Their ace leaders, Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard (115) and Elena Rybakina (39), accumulated 154 aces between them, a fraction of the 6455 struck across the tournament.

By contrast, at the 2024 US Open, which boasted the second-highest tally for male and female ace leaders at the last four slams, only 3139 aces were tallied – less than half of Wimbledon's count.

While Perricard, standing at 6ft 8in with a huge serve, could be considered something of an outlier, his run to the fourth round at Wimbledon, which was his best Slam showing to date, illustrates how players with a similar toolset can excel on grass. 

These numbers challenge the growing belief that grass courts have slowed in recent years.

In fact, ace rates on grass, as well as across all surfaces, have significantly increased since 1991.

Data collected from the ATP Tour's top 40 serve leaders shows the average number of aces per match on grass has risen by approximately 76%, from 7.6 to 13.4, between 1991 and 2024 (when the last grass court ATP-level tournaments were held).

While these numbers demonstrate a potential rise in grass surface speed, further blunting arguments that the courts are in fact slowing, these numbers may reflect broader developments in the sport.

Factors such as improved equipment and more intense training regimes have enabled players' to improve their athleticism  – possibly resulting in increased ace numbers.

Discussing advancements in the game, tennis coach, Davies, said: “Players have sports scientists, sport nutritionists controlling pretty much every aspect of their lives.”

Stats connoisseur Sackmann also acknowledged the growing role of fitness in the modern game.

He said: “Now, if you're if you're playing almost anybody on tour, even somebody who's not a great returner, they're going to make you fight for it.”

Overall, while grass courts can still be regarded as the fastest on tour, the perception that the three main tennis surfaces have become homogenised in recent years could be explained by improvements in player conditioning and court quality – causing tennis to enter an era dominated by baseline play.

Only one Italian Open match remains and it could have a big impact on defending champion Iga Swiatek's seeding at the French Open.

Four-time Roland Garros winner Swiatek has already had a setback in her seeding as she is guaranteed to slip from No 2 to No 4 in the WTA Rankings after the WTA 1000 event in Rome.

But she could drop to fifth in the standings if Jasmine Paolini goes on to beat Coco Gauff and win the trophy at Foro Italico.

The seedings for the French Open are based on the WTA Rankings on May 19, 2025, and Aryna Sabalenka is assured of being the top seed with Gauff second and Jessica Pegula third, but the fourth and fifth positions will only be decided after the Italian Open final.

Despite her quarter-final exit in Rome, Sabalenka sits comfortably at the top on 10,683 points in the Live Rankings and she is followed by Gauff (6,863/7,213) and Pegula (6,308).

It is the second major in a row where Sabalenka is the top seed as she was also at No 1 at the Australian Open after Swiatek dominated the top spot the previous few years.

Swiatek is currently in fourth place after she failed to defend her WTA 1000 trophy and she has 5,838 points while Paolini is fifth on 5,515, but the Italian will move to 5,865 points if she wins the final.

The other players who will be seeded in the top eight are Mirra Andreeva, Madison Keys and Zheng Qinwen with Emma Navarro and Paula Badosa completing the top 10.

1. Aryna Sabalenka
2. Coco Gauff
3. Jessica Pegula
4. Iga Swiatek
5. Jasmine Paolini
6. Mirra Andreeva
7. Madison Keys
8. Zheng Qinwen
9. Emma Navarro
10. Paula Badosa
11. Diana Shnaider
12. Elena Rybakina
13. Karolina Muchova
14. Elina Svitolina
15. Barbora Krejcikova
16. Amanda Anisimova
17. Daria Kasatkina
18. Donna Vekic
19. Ludmilla Samsonova
20. Jelena Ostapenko
21. Clara Tauson
22. Ekaterina Alexandrova
23. Beatriz Haddad Maia
24. Elise Mertens
25. Magdalena Frech
26. Marta Kostyuk
27. Peyton Stearns
28. Leylah Fernandez
29. Linda Noskova
30. Anna Kalinskaya
31. Sofia Kenin
32. Yulia Putintseva

The top eight players can't face each other before the quarter-finals as they will each be placed in their own section of the main draw for the clay-court major while Sabalenka will headline the top half of the draw and Gauff will go into the bottom half.

The next two (Pegula and one of Swiatek and Paolini) will also be split.

If Swiatek ends up as the fifth seed, she could face one of the top two as early as the last eight.

Fourth or fifth will be the five-time Grand Slam winner's lowest seeding at Roland Garros since 2021 when she was seeded eighth as she has been the top seed the past three editions.

Unlike at WTA 1000 events, the seeded players do not enjoy byes in the Grand Slams and they all have to win seven matches to secure the title.

Reigning Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova is set to be seeded 15th, but there are doubts over whether or not she will play as she has not featured so far this year. The Czech is set to play in Strasbourg next week, but it remains to be seen if she will be fit enough.

Just outside the cut

Should any of the players in the top 32 withdraw from the French Open, then the following players are next in line to be seeded:
33. Magda Linette
34. Olga Danilović
35. Ons Jabeur

Meanwhile, Krejcikova is one of eight Grand Slam winners who are set to be seeded with the others being Sabalenka, Gauff, Swiatek, Keys, Rybakina, Ostapenko and Kenin.

Carlos Alcaraz and Lorenzo Musetti were handed boosts in the ATP Rankings thanks to their performances at the Italian Open while Alexander Zverev's failure to defend his title will have a big impact on his French Open hopes.

Alcaraz's run to the semi-final in Rome helped him to nail down second place in the rankings behind Jannik Sinner and with it he also secured the No 2 seeding for Roland Garros.

The four-time Grand Slam winner will battle Musetti for a place in the final at Foro Italico and a title run could see him close the points deficit to Sinner to just over 1,000 points after it was more than 4,000 at one stage.

But Sinner – playing in his first tournament since his serving his three-month doping ban – could also extend the lead as he will face Tommy Paul in the semi-final.

1. Jannik Sinner – 9,730 points
2. Alexander Zverev – 8,085
3. Carlos Alcaraz – 7,850
4. Taylor Fritz – 4,815
5. Jack Draper – 4,440
6. Novak Djokovic – 4,130
7. Casper Ruud – 3,715
8. Alex de Minaur – 3,635
9. Lorenzo Musetti – 3,550
10. Holger Rune – 3,440

Sinner has once again broken through the 10,000-point barrier in the rankings after demolishing Casper Ruud 6-1, 6-0 in the quarter-final.

With Alcaraz secured of the No 2 seeding for his Roland Garros title defence, it means Zverev will be seeded third and he will meet either Sinner or Zverev in the semi-final in Paris should they all get that far.

Jack Draper had a chance to move to a career-high No 4, but his defeat to Alcaraz in the quarter-final put paid to that quest as he remains at No 5 with Novak Djokovic at No 6 and Casper Ruud at No 7.

Musetti's excellent clay-court season continues with his run to the semi-final of his home event and he is up to No 8 while he could move as high as sixth if he wins the title.

Impressive, considering the Italian started the clay-court season at No 16 in the rankings.

1. Jannik Sinner – 10,130/10,380/10,730
2. Carlos Alcaraz – 8,240/8,500/8,850
3. Alexander Zverev – 7,285
4. Taylor Fritz – 4,625
5. Jack Draper – 4,610
6. Novak Djokovic – 4,080
7. Casper Ruud – 3,905
8. Lorenzo Musetti – 3,860/4,110/4,460
9. Alex de Minaur – 3,635
10. Holger Rune – 3,440

There will be a newcomer to the top 20 when the rankings are updated on Monday as Jakub Mensik will climb two places to a new career-high of No 19. The Czech teenager reached the fourth round in Italy, but his rise was set up by his Miami Open title run.

It does mean Stefanos Tsitsipas is down to No 20 – his lowest position since 2018.

There were no +20 surges in the top 100, but Camilo Ugo Carabelli is up eight spots to a new career-high of No 52 and one spot behind him is Jacob Fearnley after the Brit climbed four spots.

Jaume Munar enjoyed a fine run in Rome as he reached the last 16 as his reward is a 10-place jump to No 56.

Zhizhen Zhang reached the quarter-final of the 2024 Italian Open, but didn't compete this year and he will be hit with a 25-place drop to No 30.

But that is not as bad as Nicolas Jarry as the Chilean finished runner-up to Zverev last year, but lost in the second round this time around. The former world No 16 is projected to fall 96 places to No 149.


                Carlos Alcaraz continues to set new records and he created a few more as he beat Lorenzo Musetti in Rome.

                Will Carlos Alcaraz finish his career with more Grand Slam titles than Jannik Sinner? Andre Agassi gives his verdict.

Aymeric Labaste, Director of International Development at Roland-Garros, speaks to PocketGamer.biz about the evolution and impact of the Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault.

In this exclusive interview. The conversation delves into the strategic motivations behind the event, its partnership with Tennis Clash, and the future plans for the eTennis competition. Labaste shares insights on reaching new audiences, measuring success, and the growing intersection of physical and digital sports for Roland-Garros - and tennis in general.

PocketGamer.biz: How does the eSeries fit into the overall strategy of Roland-Garros to expand its global brand and reach new audiences?

Aymeric Labaste: As one of the four tennis Grand Slam tournaments, Roland-Garros enjoys strong visibility among traditional tennis fans thanks to its nearly 100-year legacy. 

With Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault, our ambition has been to inject innovation into our brand's DNA and to expand its reach on a global scale, especially among digital-native audiences. This year, over 515 thousand participants joined our three Open Qualifiers, playing more than 9.5 million matches on the virtual Central Court. For the first time, we also integrated official Roland-Garros music and French voice-over for the umpire, small details that add up to a truly immersive experience. 

Since the first edition in 2018, we've positioned Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault as the world's biggest eTennis event. In 2022, we moved our competition onto the mobile game Tennis Clash, which is the perfect vehicle to connect with a broader audience through its arcade-style gameplay. As 50 percent of Tennis Clash users don't play tennis in real life, it's crucial for us that every player can experience the spirit of Roland-Garros from their smartphone/tablet in a fun & accessible way!

“As 50 percent of Tennis Clash users don't play tennis in real life, it's crucial for us that every player can experience the spirit of Roland-Garros from their smartphone/tablet in a fun & accessible way!”Aymeric Labaste

What were the key motivations behind partnering with Tennis Clash for the eSeries, and how does this collaboration align with the traditional values of Roland-Garros?

When we began our collaboration with Tennis Clash in 2022, we were already convinced that mobile was both the present and future of esports, with over 2.8 billion mobile gamers worldwide. Major publishers like Riot Games, Epic Games and PUBG had already launched mobile versions of their games to align with evolving consumer habits, a clear signal of the platform's growing dominance.

Asia, in particular, has been leading the way, with mobile gaming deeply embedded in its gaming & esports culture. Tennis Clash, as the tennis video game with the largest community (i.e. over 170 million downloads), turned out to be the ideal partner to make our Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault truly accessible and inclusive on a global scale. In 2025, we had over 515 thousand participants from 221 different territories, proof of its worldwide appeal. Lastly, knowing that 52 percent of mobile gamers are women, it has also allowed us to connect with a more gender-balanced audience. The partnership with Tennis Clash reflects our ambition to stay true to Roland-Garros' core values - international, accessibility, inclusivity and excellence - while embracing new formats that bring the spirit of our tournament to life for a new generation of tennis fans.

Can you describe the evolution of the Roland-Garros eSeries since its inception? What have been some of the biggest successes and challenges?

When we launched the very first edition of Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault in 2018, one of our initial challenges was internal: convincing the top management of the French Tennis Federation that esports could be a powerful platform to promote the Roland-Garros brand globally.

Then, the biggest turning point came in 2022, when we partnered with Tennis Clash. Finding the right publisher sharing our ambitious vision to build a true eTennis ecosystem was essential, and that move proved to be a game changer for our tournament's popularity (238 thousans participants in 2022). From there, bringing the right sponsors on board was essential to elevate the project and establish a strong marketing platform. Renault has supported the tournament since 2022, and Mastercard joined us in 2024. Their commitment has played a key role in helping us grow the competition into what it is today. 

Among our proudest achievements: surpassing half a million participants since 2024 and opening the Final Stage's livestream to the public at Roland-Garros for the first time last year, creating an exciting new way for fans to engage with the event.

“Another major milestone in 2025 is the participation of former tennis champions Gilles Simon & Marion Bartoli as ambassadors, a perfect symbol of how the worlds of tennis and eTennis can come together.”Aymeric Labaste

Another major milestone in 2025 is the participation of former tennis champions Gilles Simon & Marion Bartoli as ambassadors, a perfect symbol of how the worlds of tennis and eTennis can come together. This year, Gilles & Marion will each lead their own teams, as we introduce a team format for the first time. It's great for the show, but also enriches the players' experience, giving all finalists the chance to play as a team before the competition becomes individual again in the playoffs. 

What specific initiatives or features within the eSeries have been most effective in engaging new demographics, particularly younger or disengaged audiences in different regions/territories?

One of the most effective ways we've engaged new demographics, especially younger or previously disengaged audiences, has been through mobile-first accessibility. By partnering with Tennis Clash, we eliminated many traditional barriers to entry: no expensive hardware, no steep learning curve, just instant access from a smartphone or tablet. The format itself also helps: arcade-style gameplay, short matches, fast progression and an open & global qualifying system. In addition, livestreaming the Final Stage at Roland-Garros, on platforms consumed by Gen Z like Twitch or YouTube, was another key decision. The climax of our competition requires having the right lineup to deliver the best content to both core & casual tennis fans. For 2025, we're going even further by broadcasting the event on the Roland-Garros YouTube channel for the first time. This allows us to reach a truly global audience, beyond the community of a single host streamer. It's about making the competition accessible wherever fans are as well as delivering premium and immersive content, bridging the worlds of sport and esports.

“It's also interesting to observe that many of the best Tennis Clash players are actually real-life tennis players, which gives them an edge since they already understand tennis strategies.”Aymeric Labaste

How do you measure the success of the eSeries, and what metrics are most important to Roland-Garros in evaluating its impact?

We measure the success of Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault through a combination of participation, reach and media value. On the participation side, we track the number of players, matches played, and the diversity of territories represented. These metrics give us a strong sense of global engagement & accessibility. The livestream viewership of the Final Stage at Roland-Garros, both on Twitch & YouTube, is critical in evaluating how the competition resonates with fans, especially younger, digitally-native audiences. From a partner perspective, we closely monitor their visibility on Tennis Clash and across social media, as these platforms drive visibility and brand exposure for our sponsors like Renault and Mastercard. Ultimately, the media value generated for them is a crucial indicator of success. All together, these metrics help us assess how Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault is growing not only as a competition, but as a powerful storytelling and brand engagement platform for Roland-Garros.

How do you see the relationship between the physical and digital aspects of Roland-Garros evolving in the future?

Our competition is a powerful platform to promote our brand in a way that stands apart from traditional media. By immersing new audiences in the Roland-Garros universe through esports & live streaming, we're not only growing brand affinity but we're also inspiring more people to follow Roland-Garros and even give tennis a try. 

Both physical and digital aspects are essential to making Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault a true success. The Qualifying stage, with over half a million participants, builds momentum, but it's the climax at Roland-Garros that gives the competition its prestige and emotional payoff. Our 8 finalists are invited to Paris for a full three-day experience, we feel proud to be the only eTennis competition offering such an immersive on-site experience. It starts with an exclusive esports training at GameWard, a professional French esports club, to ensure they're all gaining skills and feeling like professional players for the Final Stage. Especially because it takes place in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers worldwide and a live audience at Roland-Garros.

All this adds pressure and excitement for these amateur players, more used to playing on their phones at home than under the spotlight. To round out the experience, the 8 finalists also receive tickets to the real Roland-Garros tournament on Central court, making their Parisian visit truly memorable. It's also interesting to observe that many of the best Tennis Clash players are actually real-life tennis players, which gives them an edge since they already understand tennis strategies. While that knowledge certainly offers an advantage, it's their ability to manage the nerves and leverage their mental game that often separates the winner from the rest!

What are your future plans for the eSeries, and how do you envision it growing and adapting in the coming years?

Our main objective is to maintain our leadership in the eTennis space while establishing ourselves as a true reference for esports within the global sports industry. To achieve this, we're focused on reinforcing the Roland-Garros experience within the competition itself, while also creating a truly immersive journey for all stakeholders - participants, fans, streamers and ambassadors. Today, Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault stands as the world's largest eTennis event, offering exclusive opportunities that set us apart. We provide the best Tennis Clash players with a unique 3-day, all-expenses-paid experience at Roland-Garros, along with prize money (€5,000 prize pool). These features not only elevate the prestige of the competition but also make it a truly compelling moment in the esports calendar. The event continues to grow, and we're proud to see it becoming a must-attend for fans eager to experience the excitement of the Final Stage live at Roland-Garros. As the livestreaming world never stops evolving, we're pushed to be even more creative in delivering, with our streamers, top-tier content and making sure our audience stays engaged. Looking ahead, I'm expecting to see even stronger connections between the worlds of tennis and eTennis. Many active and former professional tennis players already play video games while travelling on the Tour, and I'm convinced we'll see more of them participating in esports competitions like ours - either as players or team captains - just like former top 10 stars Gilles Simon and Marion Bartoli this year. 

Could you share some insights into the global reach and participation in the eSeries, and how it compares to traditional tennis viewership or participation?

The logics of engagement behind eTennis and traditional tennis are fundamentally different, making direct comparisons somewhat irrelevant. Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault serves primarily as a marketing platform designed to promote the Roland-Garros brand in the months leading up to the real tournament in Paris. The Final Stage of our competition takes place the day before the Roland-Garros main draw begins, helping to build momentum and excitement around Roland-Garros. Our eTennis event is also enhancing the brand equity of Roland-Garros in terms of awareness and perception across different targeted markets. This is why we kick off the competition in early March, with 3 open qualifiers in March & April that engage participants long before Roland-Garros in Paris. By doing so, we create meaningful connections with our brand early on. Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault also allows us to reach a broader and more diverse audience, including those who may not traditionally be tennis fans but are drawn into the Roland-Garros universe through gaming. A key indicator of the global success of Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault is the number of matches played on our virtual Central Court within Tennis Clash: from 1.6 million in 2022 to 9.5 million in 2025, across 221 territories. It's a strong signal of the rising popularity of our competition on a worldwide scale.

Top-seeded Sinner needed just 65 minutes to completely dismantle the two-time Roland Garros finalist on Campo Centrale. In a display that Agassi likened to “a runaway train”, Sinner didn't face a break point on his way to a 6-0, 6-1 victory—his first time bageling a Top 10 opponent.Read More: Jannik Sinner joins Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray on legendary list with 25th win in a row“There was not much Ruud could have hoped for out there.

Sinner tested positive twice in 2024 for the banned substance clostebol, but was later determined to bear “no fault or negligence” for the contamination.

While sidelined, Sinner was not allowed to train with ranked players or enter a professional sports facility, and he was barred from any “official training activities” until April 13.Read More: Jannik Sinner's doping case: A complete timeline from start to settlementAccording to Agassi, that long period of inactivity makes Sinner's performance on Thursday even more impressive.“The thing that surprises me the most about three months away was always the movement stuff. For me, it was always the return, it was always the reaction to the ball,” he reflected.“But, when you can move as well as he does? It looked like he spent a few matches not really stressing, not pressing, watching the ball, tracking it and using his legs. Then, once he got comfortable that he could take some big blows, he started letting his game fly.“And yeah, there's no looking back for him. He's where he's at because he belongs there.”

Sinner has looked right at home at the Foro Italico, and he hasn't missed a beat—or dropped a set—since returning to action. The top seed eased past Mariano Navone and Jesper de Jong in the early rounds, and overcame his biggest challenge of the fortnight against No. 17 seed Francisco Cerundolo 7-6 (2), 6-3 to reach the quarterfinals.The world No. 1, who lifted his second Australian Open trophy in January and hasn't lost a match all year, will face Tommy Paul next for a place in the final.

Jamaica's Alyssa James, 17, the number one ranked junior player in the Caribbean and Central America, is showcasing her talent on the European circuit after being awarded a spot in the International Tennis Federation Grand Slam Player Development Team. She will now face some of the world's best in Europe at the French Open.

Ranked 112 in the world, she has already registered wins this month at tournaments in Italy and just missed out on a quarter-final spot in Santa Croce where she lost a three set thriller to world number 61 Nauhany Vitoria Leme Da Silva 3-6, 6-3, 6-7.

However, her journey will continue as she moves on to Milan next week before competing in Belgium on May 26 and Roland Garros in France on June 1, which she says is a dream come true.

“It's a huge honour as only a handful of junior players from around the world are chosen. To be one of them is truly humbling and satisfying as it shows that my hard work is paying off,” she told the Jamaica Observer.

“Roland Garros is a dream — just setting foot on those courts will be unforgettable and I want to compete, challenge the best, and prove I belong on that stage.”

Clay courts are regarded by many to be the most difficult playing surface in tennis but James says she's well prepared to take on the challenge.

“(It) presents a unique challenge as the court is slower and rallies and matches are longer,” she said. “The clay courts also require a different type of movement when compared to hard courts as you have to slide into many shots. It also requires strategic shot selection as points are won primarily by forcing errors by keeping your opponent off balance.

“My preparation has been intense, and I spent a lot of time playing on the Hartru clay courts in Florida and working on my leg strength and endurance during my fitness sessions.”

James has also invested in mental preparation, which she says is necessary to be successful.

“You can be in top shape, but without mental clarity, it's tough to perform — especially on clay, where matches can last over two or three hours,” she said. “You're constantly analysing your opponent, adjusting your strategy, and staying composed even when things aren't going your way. It's like a mental chess match. I rely on visualisation, breathing exercises, and mental routines to stay focused and grounded. Blocking out distractions and staying present is essential, especially in high-pressure environments.”

Jamaica's number one-ranked James, who moved to an academy based in Florida after attending Hillel Preparatory School, has proven to be one of the brighter prospects in the sport, winning several local and regional titles with her most recent coming in the Dominican Republic last May.

Since then, she's made a number of deep tournament runs including quarter-final appearances at Indian Wells and in Brazil as well as a semi-final loss in Zapopan, Mexico.

With three tournaments to come in Europe to come, James is hoping to make a breakthrough into two of the world's biggest grand slams.

“I'm focused on growth, testing myself against the best junior players in the world, and breaking new ground to improve my level of play,” James said. “I also want to absorb and enjoy the experience. My goal is to break into the top 50 as this will put me in a good position to gain entry into Wimbledon and the US Open. It's an ambitious goal but I believe that it's within reach.”

As she waves the Jamaican flag high all over the world, James says she hopes to inspire other young players from the island.

“Representing Jamaica has always given me great joy and is one of the greatest honours of my life,” she said. “Every time I step on a court and see the Jamaican flag next to my name or flying high in the stadium, it fills me with pride. It's a reminder that I'm playing for something bigger than myself.

“Jamaica is known internationally for our music and track and field. I would like to put Jamaica on the map for tennis. I'm excited about the chance to represent Jamaica at the Billie Jean King and Fed Cup tournaments later this year. I hope my journey inspires young athletes back home — to believe that with hard work and commitment, anything is possible.”

Tommy Paul has faced some off-court distractions during his Italian Open campaign. (Getty Images: Ion Alcoba Beitia, File)

Tommy Paul has reached the Italian Open semifinals after defeating Hubert Hurkacz.

He revealed his truck was repossessed at his home in the US after he missed "a couple of payments".

Paul will play world number one Jannik Sinner in the Italian Open semifinals.

Tommy Paul has been forced to put off-court distractions in his rear-view mirror at the Italian Open this week after the American's beloved truck was repossessed at his home in Florida.

Paul beat Hubert Hurkacz 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to set up a semifinal against world number one Jannik Sinner in Rome.

But it was clear the fate of his Ford F-150 was a worry for world number 12 Paul, who has made more than $US10 million ($15.5 million) in career prize money.

"It's been a great week on court so far. I feel like I've been getting a little bit better with every match. Off court, a little bit of a stressful week," Paul said.

Jannik Sinner admits he thought about walking away from tennis prior to accepting a three-month doping ban earlier this year.

"I got my truck repossessed. I missed a couple payments and they took my truck from my house this week.

"I've been grinding to get my truck back. If you know me, that's my baby."

Paul added his truck was on the way back home after he paid a $US1,000 fine to the authorities.

"I'm excited to get it back. I had to win a couple matches so I could pay that off," said Paul after pocketing $US325,964 for reaching the semifinals in Rome.

Paul is the first American man to reach consecutive Italian Open semifinals since Pete Sampras in 1993-94 and he could return to the top 10 with a win over Sinner.

He is also seeking his first title of the season after capturing three tournament victories in 2024.

Sinner is playing his first tournament since serving a three-month doping suspension.

She's the first American to reach the Internazionali BNL d'Italia final since Serena Williams and Madison Keys in 2016.ByBaseline StaffPublished May 16, 2025 copy_link

Published May 16, 2025

After a grueling three hours and 33 minutes on Thursday evening, Coco Gauff finally let out a roar of celebration and then pointed toward her head. The 21-year-old just took down Zheng Qinwen in three tightly contested sets, 7-6 (3), 4-6, 7-6 (4) to move into the final at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia for the first time.Going into their third career meeting, No. 4 seed Gauff said she expected a “physical match” from the Olympic champion. But it turned out to be just as much of a mental test as well, in what ended up being the longest match of the 2025 WTA season—and the longest of Gauff's career, too.Read More: Outfit of the Day: Coco Gauff brings Italian high fashion to the Foro Italico“I was just trying to go for every point.

In that championship match, Zheng led by a break twice in the decisive set before the American dug deep and came all the way back for a 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2) victory.

In Rome, the pair went the distance once again. They traded breaks of serve three times in the third set before Gauff pulled away in the tiebreak, and improved to 3-0 in their head-to-head.“Overall I'm just happy,” Gauff continued. “It wasn't my best level at all, to be honest. Just happy to get through it and through to another final.”With the victory, Gauff added her name to an elite shortlist as she became the first American since Serena Williams and Madison Keys to reach the final in Rome. That year, the former world No. 1 edged past Keys to claim her fourth and final title in the Eternal City.To secure her first, Gauff will face a dual challenge against home favorite Jasmine Paolini in the final. The sixth seeded Italian is aiming to become the first home grown champion to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985—and she's set to have a vocal majority of fans at Foro Italico willing her on.

For Gauff, victory would also taste like revenge: Though she leads their head-to-head 2-1, Paolini won their most recent meeting—and the only on clay courts—last month in Stuttgart, 6-4, 6-3.“She's a tough opponent. I think especially here with the home crowd behind her, she's going to be playing some great tennis. I have to expect that,” Gauff said of Paolini. “Hopefully I can bring a better level and hopefully win the title.“If not, I'm proud just really of this match, too."

No. 4 seed Coco Gauff will face No. 6 Jasmine Paolini for the WTA 1000 Internazionali BNL d'Italia title on Saturday at 5 p.m. local (11 a.m. ET). Here's everything you need to know.

It will be a buona festa on Saturday at the Foro Italico, as two Top 10 players square off in the women's singles final at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome.

The sixth WTA 1000 title of the season -- and the second on clay -- will be decided in Rome on May 17. For just the third time in the Open Era, an Italian woman will play for the trophy.

Rome: Draws | Scores | Order of play

No. 6 seed Jasmine Paolini will be the crowd favorite, as she has become the first home finalist on the women's side in more than a decade. Paolini will be going for her third WTA title, her second at WTA 1000 level and her first on clay.

To capture the title and thrill the home crowd, Paolini will have to get past No. 4 seed Coco Gauff of the United States. Gauff battled into her second straight WTA 1000 final of this year's clay-court swing, and she is seeking her 10th WTA title.

Here's what you need to know about Saturday's showdown on Campo Centrale:

The Internazionali BNL d'Italia women's singles final will be played on Saturday, May 17 at 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET).

The doubles final will take place the following day, Sunday, May 18 at 12 p.m. local time (6 a.m. ET).

By making the Rome final, both Paolini and Gauff have assured themselves 650 PIF WTA ranking points and €456,735 in prize money.

The singles champion will increase those numbers. Whoever wins the final will pocket 1,000 ranking points and take home €877,390.

By reaching the final, Paolini has already guaranteed she will maintain her spot in the Top 5. A runner-up showing will keep her at No. 5, but if she wins the title, she will return to her career-high ranking of No. 4.

As for Gauff, she will return to her career-high of No. 2 in Monday's rankings, win or lose. 

Gauff's season picked up a head of steam once she got onto the European clay. After a quarterfinal finish in Stuttgart, Gauff has now reached back-to-back WTA 1000 finals at Madrid and Rome. She is 11-2 on clay so far this year.

Her path to the Rome final, though, had a couple of bumps along the way. Gauff dropped her first set of the tournament to teenage qualifier Victoria Mboko. Then in the semifinals, she needed to grind through the longest main-draw match of the year -- a 3-hour and 32-minute late-night thriller over Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen.

Gauff's run to the final:1R: bye2R: d. [Q] Victoria Mboko (#156) 3-6, 6-2, 6-13R: d. [32] Magda Linette (#32) 7-5, 6-34R: d. Emma Raducanu (#49) 6-1, 6-2QF: d. [7] Mirra Andreeva (#7) 6-4, 7-6(5)SF: d. [8] Zheng Qinwen (#8) 7-6(3), 4-6, 7-6(4)

Meanwhile, Paolini thrilled her partisan crowds all fortnight, dropping only one set in the process (to Diana Shnaider in the quarterfinals).

Coming into Rome, Paolini had not reached a final all season, but she was rejuvenated on her home soil. Paolini defeated three seeded players en route to the semifinals before ending the run of Peyton Stearns, who became the first player in the Open Era to win three consecutive third-set tiebreaks this fortnight.

Paolini's run to the final:1R: bye2R: d. Lulu Sun (#46) 6-4, 6-33R: d. [27] Ons Jabeur (#36) 6-4, 6-34R: d. [17] Jelena Ostapenko (#18) 7-5, 6-2QF: d. [13] Diana Shnaider (#11) 6-7(1), 6-4, 6-2SF: d. Peyton Stearns (#42), 7-5, 6-1

Gauff leads their head-to-head 2–1, but that edge comes with an asterisk: Paolini won their only meeting on clay -- and it wasn't long ago.

Gauff took their first two encounters, both on hard courts, at Adelaide in 2021 and Cincinnati in 2023, where she went on to win her first WTA 1000 title.

But just last month in Stuttgart, Paolini earned her first win over Gauff with a 6–4, 6–3 victory on indoor clay at the WTA 500 event.

This is a huge moment for Italy at their biggest tournament. Paolini is the first Italian women's singles finalist at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia since her doubles partner Sara Errani in 2014 (who finished runner-up to Serena Williams).

One more win would make Paolini the first Italian women's singles champion at this event since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, 40 years ago. Paolini, Errani and Reggi are the only Italian women to make this final in the Open Era.

Meanwhile, Gauff is the first American woman in nine years to reach the Rome final, and she is trying to claim the title for the United States once again. In 2016, Serena Williams defeated Madison Keys in an all-American Rome final.

And despite her clay-court proficiency (including a Roland Garros final in 2022), a victory on Saturday would be Gauff's first title on this surface since she won WTA 250 Parma in 2021.

The 29-year-old Paolini became the third oldest woman to reach her first Rome final, younger only than Helga Masthoff (1971) and Li Na (2012).

And Paolini is the first Italian to reach multiple WTA 1000 finals since this tournament tier was introduced in 2009. Paolini was the champion at WTA 1000 Dubai last year.

Paolini now holds the best winning percentage of any Italian at WTA 1000 events (56.9%, 41-31), surpassing former US Open champion Flavia Pennetta.

As for 21-year-old Gauff, she has now become the youngest player to reach the singles finals at both Rome and Madrid in the same season.

A Rome semifinalist in 2021 and 2024, Gauff has won 17 matches at the tournament. In the Open Era, only Gabriela Sabatini won more main-draw matches at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia before turning 22 (Sabatini won 27 matches).

For the first time in her career, Gauff has registered four Top 10 wins on clay in a single season. She beat Mirra Andreeva and Iga Swiatek at Madrid, then added wins over Andreeva and Zheng Qinwen this fortnight in Rome.

Gauff and Paolini both spoke after their semifinal wins:

Gauff: "[The Stuttgart quarterfinal vs. Paolini] was a tough match. She played well. She's a tough opponent. I think especially here with the home crowd behind her, she's going to be playing some great tennis. I have to expect that.

"Hopefully I can bring a better level and hopefully win the title. If not, I'm proud just really of this [semifinal] match, too."

Paolini: "I think [2014 finalist Errani is] part of my team. She watched many, many matches. Last match she was a key part because she helped me a lot. ... It's amazing to be in the final as she did.

"[The 2024 season] gave me a lot of confidence that I have to remember, a lot of experience that I have under my belt. At the same time this year is another year. It's different, completely different story. ... [I'm] trying to repeat [to] myself, 'Look, remember that last year, we did an amazing year.'"

No. 4 seed Coco Gauff will face No. 6 Jasmine Paolini for the WTA 1000 Internazionali BNL d'Italia title on Saturday at 5 p.m. local (11 a.m. ET). Here's everything you need to know.

Paul even took to social media after the match to post a video of the moment his "baby" was taken away. Set to the tune of Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On", the Instagram Story showed a tow truck pulling up to the vehicle in his driveway, securing it in record time and then hauling off.Thankfully for Paul, everything has been sorted out after a couple of rounds at the Foro Italico.The 27-year-old, who has won over $10 million in career prize money, has already added a cool €291,040 (USD $325,200) to his bank account by reaching the semifinals—and he confirmed that one of his trainers was already on the way to retrieve the truck.Paul, the No. 11 seed, will take on top-ranked Jannik Sinner next in the semifinals. With €523,870 (USD $585,300) on offer should he advance, that should be plenty to put on autopay and keep any other tow trucks away.

Another day, another comeback to delight her home fans. No. 6 seed Jasmine Paolini became the third Italian woman in the Open Era to reach the Internazionali BNL d'Italia final after coming from 4-1 down in the first set, saving two set points, to defeat Peyton Stearns 7-5, 6-1 in 1 hour and 39 minutes.

Rome: Draws | Scores | Order of play

Paolini advances to her eighth career final, and fourth at WTA 1000 level or above following Dubai, Roland Garros and Wimbledon last year. She is the first Italian woman to reach the final in Rome since doubles partner Sara Errani in 2014, and will bid to become the first home champion since 1985, when Raffaella Reggi defeated Vicki Nelson-Dunbar for the trophy.

The 29-year-old will seek her third career Hologic WTA Tour title when she faces No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in Saturday's final. Gauff needed 3 hours and 32 minutes to battle past No. 8 seed Zheng Qinwen in Thursday's late-night semifinal thriller.

Gauff leads Paolini 2-1 in their head-to-head -- but Paolini won their only clay-court meeting last month in Stuttgart.

First-set turnaround: Paolini's comeback wasn't as spectacular as in the quarterfinals, where she trailed Diana Shnaider by a set and 4-0 -- and then 2-0 in the decider -- before turning the match around. But she still required all her grit to slowly reel Stearns in.

The American leapt out to a 3-0 lead, and held two points for a 4-0 double break. A remarkable stretch volley from Paolini paved the way for the Italian to get on the board, and she took the next three games to get back on serve.

But the Stearns forehand kept finding its mark as she broke again for 5-3. But a bold drop shot from Paolini saved the first set point, and an even bolder return winner -- struck from out wide, having run around her forehand -- enabled Paolini to break back. Stearns netted a forehand on her second set point in the next game, and a blazing forehand winner from Paolini on the next point signalled that the crowd favorite was ready to seize control of the match.

Stearns, who had become the first woman in the Open Era to win three consecutive matches in third-set tiebreaks this week, began to leak errors towards the end of the first set, and they kept coming in the second as Paolini motored to the finishing line. From 5-3 down, Paolini won 10 of the last 11 games of the match.

Backing up 2024 breakthrough: Despite the big-stage consistency of Paolini's breakthrough 2024, reaching the second week of every major, she came into this season underestimated once again in terms of her ability to sustain her form.

But she now owns a 21-8 record this year, including semifinal finishes in Miami and Stuttgart. After Rome, she is guaranteed to move into the Top 10 of the PIF Race to the WTA Finals Leaderboard, and she will stay in the Top 5 of the PIF WTA Rankings -- moving back to her career high of No. 4 with the title.

Paolini herself has put 2024 into sensible perspective.

"I'm trying to be in the mindset that last year was a great year, but it give me a lot of confidence," she said. "I have to remember that, a lot of experience that I have in my belt, under my belt. At the same time, this year is another year. It's different, completely different story."

Rafael Camara continued his phenomenal start to the 2025 Formula 3 season, achieving a third consecutive pole position of the year in a dramatic Qualifying session in Imola.

The TRIDENT driver left it until his final lap of the day to complete a 1:32.206, which was good enough to beat Van Amersfoort Racing's Santiago Ramos to the Aramco Pole Position award by 0.236s.

Camara's team mate Noah Stromsted continued his solid start to the season, as the Mercedes Junior Team Programme member finished third.

Tuukka Taponen also put in a stellar final effort to qualify fourth for ART Grand Prix. The Scuderia Ferrari Academy driver wound up just ahead of the Rodin Motorsport pairing of Louis Sharp and Roman Bilinski.

Another team mate duo followed as Ugo Ugochukwu and Noel Leon qualified in seventh and eighth respectively for PREMA Racing.

Right behind them were the Campos Racing pair of Nikola Tsolov and Mari Boya in P9 and P10, while Tim Tramnitz and Bruno del Pino ended up 11th and 12th, respectively, for MP Motorsport.

This means Del Pino will start from reverse grid pole on an all-MP front row in the Imola Sprint Race which is set to start 1005 local time on Saturday.

WATCH: Hadjar triggers red flag during FP2 at Imola after spinning into the barriers

Oscar Piastri finished fastest from McLaren team mate Lando Norris once again in the second free practice session ahead of the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, as the session was disrupted by a late red flag after Isack Hadjar span off.

In dry and sunny conditions at 1700 local time, all drivers took to the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit in the opening minutes during a one-hour session which offered the best representation of conditions ahead of Qualifying on Saturday.

FP1: Piastri sets the pace from Norris and Sainz during first practice in Imola

Norris moved to the top of the times on the medium tyre after the first set of runs, his 1m 16.074s already nearly half a second faster than team mate Piastri's best from the opening session on the soft compound.

Traffic proved to be a tricky affair for teams and drivers to manage around the narrow circuit from the outset, Fernando Alonso claiming "I nearly crashed" after slamming on the brakes into the opening turn as Franco Colapinto's Alpine emerged from the pits.

Practice 2 results

Carlos Sainz became the first driver to dip below the 1m 16s barrier after 10 minutes, which moved him just ahead of Williams team mate Alex Albon, before both drivers were shuffled back a spot by Norris, who lowered the benchmark to a 1m 15.952s.

George Russell became the first driver to bolt on a set of soft tyres, the C6 rubber the softest in Pirelli's range and making its debut this weekend for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, with the Mercedes driver launching to the top of the times on a 1m 15.693s approaching the 20-minute mark.

HIGHLIGHTS: Catch the action from FP1 for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix as Piastri sets the pace

The majority of the field soon followed his lead and bolted on the red-walled tyre, Max Verstappen falling short of the Briton's best by just 0.042s and complaining of "bottoming quite hard through Turns 11 and 12", as the second Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda slotted into third briefly.

It was short-lived as Norris asserted himself back at the top of the times with a 1m 15.318s before Piastri lowered the benchmark to a 1m 15.293s inside the first half an hour. A second attempt for Norris to usurp his team mate was thwarted as he suffered a snap of oversteer at the final corner having set a personal best in sector one and session best in sector two.

Thereafter, the second half of the session consisted of race runs using the medium tyre before a red flag was deployed with six minutes remaining. Hadjar found the gravel on the exit of the Tamburello Chicane and, despite hitting the barrier, moved his Racing Bulls machine back to the edge of the circuit before becoming beached.

The session resumed with less than two minutes remaining, leaving Piastri to head Norris as McLaren completed a perfect Friday of running.

Pierre Gasly's Alpine impressed again by finishing third from Russell, Verstappen and Charles Leclerc, the Ferrari driver complaining of braking problems with his SF-25 along with team mate Lewis Hamilton throughout the session.

The Briton, who eventually finished 11th, struggled to tame his Ferrari which included a huge oversteer moment at the first chicane on his opening flying lap, while the seven-time World Champion also found traffic numerous times.

His replacement at Mercedes, Kimi Antonelli, also had a close call with Tsunoda on the run down the hill to Rivazza 1, claiming over the radio "that was super dangerous from the Red Bull".

The young Italian was left in 18th, as Hadjar finished the session as top rookie in seventh despite his off ahead of Tsunoda as Albon and Sainz completed the top 10.

Ollie Bearman's Haas finished 12th from the returning Colapinto, who also went wheel-to-wheel with Verstappen during the session on the exit of Tosa.

Alonso was the leading Aston Martin in 14th from Liam Lawson and Gabriel Bortoleto, the Kick Sauber driver having brought out the red flag in FP1, with Lance Stroll 17th. Nico Hulkenberg finished ahead of Esteban Ocon, with the Haas driver last and 1.127s off Piastri's session best.

Teams will regroup overnight ahead of the third and final practice session on Saturday, which takes place from 1230 local time before Qualifying later in the day.

Franco Colapinto is back in a Formula 1 race seat at this weekend's Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, having been called up by Alpine to replace Jack Doohan after the first five rounds of the season.

In an exclusive interview with F1 TV's Lawrence Barretto, the Argentinian racer opens up about the emotions around his return, when and where he found out, and what his expectations are alongside experienced team mate Pierre Gasly.

With the red flag deployed, the rookie driver reported "I'm okay" over the radio, before adding that "I think it was just the front wing [that was damaged]".

Bortoleto was classified ninth in the one-hour session, which did not resume following the red flag, as Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri topped the times from McLaren team mate Lando Norris.

Oscar Piastri has topped the timesheets during the first practice hour ahead of the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, the championship leader setting the pace ahead of McLaren team mate Lando Norris and the Williams of Carlos Sainz.

Several cars started to peel out onto the track as the session got underway in dry and sunny conditions at 1330 local time, with a returning name amongst these as Franco Colapinto headed out in the Alpine, the Argentinian having been brought in to replace Jack Doohan for the next five races.

While Colapinto had bolted on the medium C5 tyres for his initial runs, the majority of the field opted for the softs on a weekend that marks the debut appearance in 2025 of the C6 compound. Amongst those running the soft rubber was Charles Leclerc, the Monegasque back in action after missing Thursday's media activities due to feeling unwell.

There was an early incident for Leclerc when the Ferrari driver found himself in the way of Fernando Alonso, leading to the Aston Martin man – who took victory at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari 20 years ago – reporting that he “nearly crashed” with the SF-25.

Practice 1 results

The drama wasn't over there for Leclerc, who soon found himself dipping a wheel in the gravel at Turn 15 after a bit of a moment through Turn 14. Norris, meanwhile, had set the early pace during the first quarter of the session, the McLaren man leading the way on a 1m 17.125s.

As the track continued to evolve and the times quickly tumbled, George Russell had gone quickest by the halfway point with his effort of 1m 16.599s, the Mercedes driver heading the timesheets from Sainz and home favourite Kimi Antonelli.

Meanwhile there was an unusual problem for Leclerc, who stated that “helmet lift is horrible” as he struggled with his lid, while team mate Lewis Hamilton looked to be fighting with the Ferrari, the Briton reporting that the car did not want to slow down.

With most of the field completing soft-shod runs as the session progressed, the McLaren pair of Piastri and Norris had moved themselves to the top of the order in a 1-2 formation ahead of Russell on an increasingly busy track.

Many looked to be pushing hard in the closing stages, with Alex Albon having some dramatic moments as his Williams bounced over the kerbs and took a brief trip through the gravel on a weekend where the squad will be hoping to continue their recent good run of form. There was also a slide for Max Verstappen, the Dutchman appearing frustrated at the wheel of the Red Bull.

More drama was to come in the dying minutes of FP1 as Gabriel Bortoleto crashed out of the session, the Kick Sauber driver running over the kerbs before hitting the barriers at Turn 18 to bring out the red flags.

The incident brought an early finish to everybody's running, with Piastri remaining on top thanks to his effort of 1m 16.545s to go just 0.032s clear of Norris in second. Sainz and Russell were close behind in third and fourth respectively, the top four separated by less than six-hundredths of a second.

Hamilton took fifth after a seemingly tricky session for Ferrari, while Alpine's Pierre Gasly, Verstappen, Albon, Bortoleto and the other Kick Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg rounded out the top 10.

Lance Stroll claimed P11 for Aston Martin, ahead of Leclerc, Antonelli, Alonso and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson. Tsunoda, meanwhile, slotted into P16, with Colapinto in P17 while the Haas pair of Ollie Bearman and Esteban Ocon were 18th and 20th respectively, the duo separated by Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar.

The drivers and teams will now regroup in the paddock to examine their data and prepare for Friday's second Free Practice session, which is due to get underway at 1700 local time.

Max Verstappen has described his first time driving on the Nurburgring Nordschleife as "fantastic", with the four-time Formula 1 World Champion confirming rumours that he broke the GT3 lap record during sessions last week.

Verstappen competed in an official Nurburgring Endurance Series test at the wheel of Emil Frey Racing's Ferrari 296 GT3 machine while using the pseudonym of 'Franz Hermann' in order to go under the radar.

The Dutchman was there in support of his protégé, 22-year-old racer Thierry Vermeulen, as reports circulated that Verstappen had broken the circuit's 7m 49.578s GT3 lap record, set by Norwegian Christian Krognes.

Verstappen told the press of his Nordschleife outing during media day at Imola

"It was, yeah," confirmed Verstappen, when asked whether his lap was faster than that record ahead of the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix this weekend. "But for me I'm not there to show that I can break a lap record or whatever record, I was just having fun and learning the track."

The Nordschleife, also known as the 'Green Hell', hosted Formula 1 events throughout the 1950s and 1960s, with the last edition taking place in 1976 following Niki Lauda's fiery crash, which nearly claimed the three-time World Champion's life, before a shorter layout was constructed and used for the first time in 1984.

While Verstappen, who sits third in this year's F1 Drivers' standings after six races, had never driven around the notorious 14-mile circuit, he was no stranger to the venue, having sampled it numerous times courtesy of his sim racing hobby.

"I've never driven there in real life, not even with a road car," he said. "Of course, I did spend a lot of time on the simulator doing thousands of laps, so that helped.

"When I got out there a few barriers were different, maybe a few kerbs were a little bit different, but I know the track layout well. It's just getting used to the grip level of the car, the conditions, the new tarmac in places.

"At the same time I was there with my sim driver that now turned into a real driver. Even for him also to get up to speed there, because eventually we all want to do that race as a team. It was a very good day, we got lucky with the weather as well – it was nice and sunny. It was fantastic!"

PADDOCK INSIDER: Colapinto's back in F1 action with Alpine – and the Argentinian racer means business

While falling short of committing to racing at the track in the future, Verstappen would in any case need to secure a DMSB (Deutscher Motor Sport Bund) Permit, which either requires him to compete in several categories to reach the GT3 level or be given special dispensation.

There's one particular journey the makers of “Arco,” a soulful animated movie premiering in the Special Screenings section of Cannes 2025, are hoping to follow, whether they say it or not. The journey of “Flow.”

That animated triumph premiered to raves at Cannes in 2024 and slowly built momentum until finally winning the Best Animated Feature Oscar earlier this year. For all Cannes represents to global cinema, it had never been a particularly fecund environment for animation: The festival used to play host to splashy premieres for blockbuster hits such as “Shrek 2” and “Bee Movie,” not eventual Academy Award winners. “Flow” changed all that. What would Cannes do for animation next?

This writer is no Oscar prognosticator, but it seems “Arco” is unlikely to repeat that triumph. Not that it isn't a worthy film — though not as worthy as the wordlessly universal “Flow,” which, at times, truly feels like a movie that's never been made before — but the path that movie took feels almost unreplicatable.




			Popular on IndieWire		






For one, “Arco,” with its copious French dialogue and unmistakably Gallic sensibility (even if dubs into other languages do eventually happen) simply doesn't have the borderless resonance. For another, it simply wears its influences on its cinematic sleeve a little too readily: A little bit of “Peter Pan,” “E.T.,” Studio Ghibli, even “Star Trek” — with director Ugo Bienvenu‘s stated aim of presenting a positive, hopeful vision of the future in “Arco,” and the colorful palette with which he's realized it, Roddenberry Entertainment should seriously consider coming onboard as producing partners for the U.S. release. It's that level of optimistic.

As Bienvenu's first feature, “Arco” is undoubtedly a promising start for a budding auteur who's been toiling away at short films, music videos, graphic novels, and short animations for Hermès. One of his illustrations for the French luxury house became a popular scarf called “Wow!” which gave a comic book sensibility to the equestrian images associated with the brand. He has an eye for detail that calls to mind Ghibli, as well as the great French artist Jean Giraud, known to the world as Mœbius. But Bienvenu embraces an explosion of color that's all his own.

“Arco” introduces us to a young boy of 10 or 11 living in a far future where humanity now resides among the clouds on “Jetsons”-like platforms on stilts. At a certain point, the population of Earth realized that a “Great Fallow” needed to happen, that the surface of the planet needed to rest. We meet Arco himself giving feed to chickens and pouring food in a trough for pigs. This may be an extremely advanced civilization he's part of, but it's also back to basics. And soon, we discover that people, once they turn the age of 12, don a rainbow cloak with a special light-refracting diamond, and use the colorful garment to fly through the air — and go back in time. 

 










Arco isn't old enough yet to fly, but that isn't going to stop him. He steals his sister's cloak while the rest of the family is sleeping and jumps off the edge of the platform.

After that, we're introduced to a raven-haired girl of about the same age named Iris. She's living on the ground in a suburban community where her primary caregiver is a robot named Mikki, and bubble-like shields pop up over everyone's homes when the climate-change-fueled thunderstorms wreak havoc or devastating wildfires break out. Her parents, consumed with work, are never even home and communicate with Iris merely by “Star Wars”-style blue-grain holograms. Iris has a caring companion in Mikki — she asks him to play cowboy and Captain Hook, and he obliges — but she still dreams of something more fulfilling. And into her life drops Arco.

Yes, Iris is living in Arco's past even if it's our future. The year for her is 2075, and the environmentally ravaged earth she inhabits is definitely a place that needs a “Great Fallow.” The story from there becomes a tad predictable: Arco is a fish out of water, Iris quickly becomes his devoted friend, a misunderstanding causes them to go on the run. And some choices don't quite work, like the monochromatically-attired, turtleneck-wearing identical triplets who are tracking Arco — having before seen visitors from the future like him, who fly in the sky and leave rainbow trails behind them, the brothers are determined to prove their existence — and are in the story as just a particularly French kind of comic relief. 

 










As in any story like this, Iris is both trying to help Arco get home, and also doesn't really want him to leave. But Bienvenu comes up with a stirring ending, one so emotional it almost paves over the bumps in the narrative road that got us there. But it's undoubtedly a bit of connecting the dots to get to that ending, something genuinely soulful that's a bit reduced because of a plot that just went from Point A to Point B.

Still, much of the film is absolute retina candy. Like “Flow” director Gints Zilbalodis, Bienvenu built his studio around recent graduates of top animation schools, and there is a youthful energy pointing to new possibilities for the medium. He also has a unique idea animating his entire vision: Why do visions of the future have to be uniformly grim? Can't they be full of wonder also? That said, it's important to stay a bit clear-eyed about the way things are, too. Like Gene Roddenberry, Bienvenu is imagining a hopeful far-future, and a pretty miserable near-future that's a continuation of our miserable present (oh yeah, the “Star Trek” creator foretold that the 21st century would be rough). 

The path ahead may be full of peril, but hope might still wait on the other side of that rainbow. And Bienvenu certainly gives us hope that animation can continue to be a vessel for epic visions and intimate musings, and can be one of the most deeply personal forms of cinematic expression there is. The artistic intentions couldn't be better. Maybe with the next film, the ability to better realize them will follow.

 










“Arco” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


	How do you make a satirical movie about modern America when the news that comes out of there every day is quite literally beyond a joke? Ari Aster is one of the rare directors willing to go there, and his new film Eddington is extraordinary not only for that but for depicting a slice of history that we have yet to see properly shown on film, even though it happened only five years ago. Dressed up as a neo-noir Western, this pandemic saga drips with the kind of biting, dark political humor hardly seen much since the heyday of screenwriter and novelist Terry Southern, author of Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove.

	











	The setting — late May 2020 — is crucial: Covid-19 has just become a thing, and the residents of Eddington in Sevilla County are getting used to life with masks and social distancing. Most comply, but others are skeptical, including Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix), who, in the film's opening scenes, is pulled up by cops from the neighboring district of Santa Lupe Pueblo. Cross is a maverick cop, but one with a good heart; instead of enforcing the law, he subverts it, letting the locals get away with minor infractions, on the grounds that the town is tiny and the virus won't be getting there anytime soon.


	His views collide with those of the town's mayor, Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal), a local bar owner who briefly dated Joe's wife Louise, now recovering from a nervous breakdown. Her rehabilitation is going slowly, not helped by the fact that her mother, Dawn (Deidre O'Connell), is staying with them and shows no signs of leaving. Dawn is a conspiracy nut and, as such, has been “doing her own research” into the genesis of the pandemic. This, though, is just the thin end of the wedge; Dawn spreads all kinds of misinformation in the town, from the speculation that the wrong boat sank instead of the Titanic to the fact that Hillary Clinton has been arrested and is already languishing in Gitmo.




			Watch on Deadline		







RELATED: Everything We Know About Ari Aster's ‘Eddington' So Far


	In this respect, the subtext of Eddington is that the devil will find work for idle hands to do. In ordinary times, the likes of Dawn would be dismissed as crackpots, but in pandemic limbo, with everyone bored and at a loose end, her weird suppositions start to get traction, sending everyone down internet rabbit holes. She even gets to Joe — who took over the role of sheriff after Louise's father died seven years before — when Dawn taunts the pair of them over the breakfast table. “Where's your anger, Lou?” she says. “Where's your anger, Joe?”

	











	Joe's anger isn't immediately apparent, but it does prompt him to stand for mayor against Garcia, a move he announces over social media. This piques Garcia's concern, and the pair meet for a High Noon-style showdown scored with a suitably Western sting courtesy of composer Daniel Pemberton. Affronted by what he sees as Garcia's condescension, Joe doubles down on his bid for mayor and turns his squad car into a campaign vehicle, complete with anti-lockdown signs with slogans that say, for one example, “Your (sic) being manipulated.”


	The outside world, meanwhile, is about to boil over with its myriad lockdown frustrations, and, in a very bold gambit, Aster uses the real-life killing of George Floyd as the catalyst that brings bitter chaos to the middle of nowhere. The local college kids form their own branch of Black Lives Matter and stage a protest, which Joe does his best to tamp down in his so-far perfectly serviceable way (he is, after all the kind of man who says “super-duper, thank you very much”). But the rebellion is real, and it starts to dawn on Joe that the regular tools of small-town politicking are woefully inadequate in this strange new world, where news spreads more like a malignant virus than wildfire.

	Although less confrontational than Aster's last film Beau Is Afraid, Eddington is certainly going to divide audiences with its ambitious mix of genres — without spoiling the first of several shocking twists, he pivots midway from gentle Western pastiche to bloody neo-noir, with a middle section that resembles the stylish early '90s westerns of American director John Dahl. But more explosive is its approach to American politics; from Bitcoin to Pizzagate, TikTok to vaccine denial, Eddington takes aim at all the quirks and absurdities of President Trump's administration and how its compliant MAGA zealots have radicalized whole generations of a country once known for its compassion.


	At the film's first screening in Cannes, the largely international audience seemed nonplussed with its blending of fiction and reality, not quite grasping the significance of the references that pepper the screen, from Dr. Fauci to George Soros, Tucker Carlson, Kyle Rittenhouse and, God save us all, even Marjorie Taylor Greene. But though all its parts don't quite knit together, Eddington is what you might call a big swing, a film that's more serious than it first seems, seeing Covid as the Big Bang that landed us right where we are now. It's about the elephant in the room: the emergent likes of QAnon, 4Chan and the Proud Boys, things that did more damage than Covid ever did, leaving a raw, still-festering wound. Without ceremony or mercy, Eddington rips the Band-Aid off, and not everyone is going to want to look at, or think about, what's there underneath it.

Senior Film Reporter


	After landing his third Oscar nomination for Conclave, Ralph Fiennes has come aboard for the role of the villainous President Snow, ruthless dictator of Panem, in Lionsgate‘s The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, based on the bestselling novel by Suzanne Collins.


	Fiennes inherits the role from Donald Sutherland, who passed away in June 2024, aged 88.


	“We wanted to honor Donald Sutherland by having one of this generation's greatest actors play President Snow 24 years before Katniss Everdeen entered the arena,” said producer Nina Jacobson of Color Force. “Working with Ralph has been on my bucket list since he traumatized me for life in Schindler's List. It's genuinely a thrill to welcome him to the Hunger Games.”

	











	Published March 18, the latest installment in Collins' dystopian YA book series revisits the world of Panem 24 years before the events of The Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the 50th Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell. The story centers on 16-year-old Haymitch (Joseph Zada), a clever and resourceful boy from District 12, who's unexpectedly chosen for this edition of the games, which will feature a deadly twist: twice the number of tributes, with 48 children sent into the arena to battle for their lives.

	Others in the cast include Whitney Peak as Lenore Dove Baird, Mckenna Grace as Maysilee Donner, Jesse Plemons as Plutarch Heavensbee, Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Beetee, Maya Hawke as Wiress, Lili Taylor as Mags, and Ben Wang as Wyatt Callow.


	Franchise vet Francis Lawrence is directing from a script by Billy Ray. Color Force's Jacobson and Brad Simpson are producing, with Cameron MacConomy exec producing. Meredith Wieck and Scott O'Brien are overseeing the project for the studio and Robert Melnik negotiated deals for Lionsgate. Slated for release on November 20, 2026, the new film comes on the heels of five installments that have grossed more than $3.3 billion worldwide.


	Upcoming, Fiennes will be seen in Danny Boyle's highly anticipated zombie flick 28 Years Later and Nicholas Hytner's film The Choral. He is repped by CAA and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern in the U.S. and 42MP in the UK.

Alexander Skarsgård — the six-foot-four Swedish actor you may know from playing one of two Northmen — is a giant, beautiful weirdo. Those less familiar with his work as a bloodthirsty creature of the night (or his character in “True Blood”) may only see a classic Hollywood hunk — the kind of guy who could conceivably marry Nicole Kidman and Kirsten Dunst; who looks like he was built by Hasbro to sell Tarzan action figures but can still slap on a tuxedo and win the red carpet; who can convincingly step onscreen as a soldier or a doctor or an international man of mystery.

 










The Alexander Stangårds out there know better. They know the star's mysterious allure sparks from within. They know his characters range from terrifying monsters to hilarious parodies of those monsters to something indefinable in between. They know even when he plays himself, he'll somehow end up jerking off to his own erotic humiliation and eating a gourmet dinner made from human hands. (Y'all should've finished “Atlanta” — things got wild.) They know that in real life, the heads turning to see him in a tuxedo are also wondering why he's not wearing any pants. They know he's this man, and this man, and this man.

No matter your previous impression of Skarsgård, an oddball so wonderfully at ease with his place in the world he's allowed everyone to mispronounce his name for years, you'll be delighted to see how he boots up Murderbot. As the titular cyborg in Apple's adaptation of Martha Wells' award-winning science-fiction books, “The Murderbot Diaries,” Skarsgård's supermodel packaging and eccentric inner life enrich a violent security robot's Pinocchio-like journey from a wooden, regimented machine to a thinking, feeling, real boy. The first season is largely fun and silly — a buoyant black comedy with all but one episode clocking in under 30 minutes — but among all the weirdness, co-showrunners Chris and Paul Weitz (“About a Boy,” “Mozart in the Jungle”) also sneak in a savvy story about how community brings out the best in mankind.

As far as synopses go, “Murderbot's” is relatively straightforward. Set sometime in the distant future, near some place called “the Corporation Rim,” the series picks up as hundreds of drunk, debaucherous humans celebrate the successful completion of another resource expedition. Standing stoically amid the screaming, spitting, scrapping miners is a security robot. Most people don't notice it. They treat the white-and-black armored cyborg like any other machine they're not currently using. It's there to protect them, they're not there to worry about it.

 










But we can hear its thoughts. Skarsgård's omnipresent narration may be an early red flag for anyone unfamiliar with Wells' novels, but Murderbot's ongoing inner monologue is baked into the show just as it's baked into the books — how he sees the world and its inhabitants becomes a source of humor, suspense, and empathy, not to mention a speedy way to mow through exposition. It's how we come to learn the pessimism Murderbot has for most of humanity (he calls most of the miners “assholes,” even when they're not torturing him for shits and gigles), and it's how we discover what makes this corporation-owned security unit unique: He's free.

Most robots like Murderbot are kept in check by the “governor module,” a handy piece of code that makes sure the machine obeys every human command. But Murderbot got so bored during his latest assignment that he started hacking his own code, and just now, as he endures random abuse from the hard-partying dudes all around him, Murderbot is finally able to disable his governor module.

Shackled no more, Murderbot — a name he gives himself because his first thought for what to do with his newfound freedom is to “kill all these idiots and take a starship to a distant galaxy” — instead decides to lay low. If people notice he's not listening to them anymore, he'll be sent back for repairs or destruction. So he signs up for his next mission and flies off with a new crew to protect, hoping a safe path to his own personal paradise soon emerges.

 










Then an odd thing happens. Murderbot's “clients” aren't like the usual “greedy psychopaths” he safeguards. They're… “weird.” Mensah (Noma Dumezweni) leads a team of scientists who set up camp on a new planet to conduct research. They want to use what they learn to better their community back home (or sell the information to corporations for necessary funds). Unlike the rest of the galaxy, they're strictly non-violent, they're socially open-minded, and they always put the needs of others ahead of their own wants.

In other words, they're hippies. Arada (Tattiawna Jones), Pin-Lee (Sabrina Wu), and Ratthi (Akshay Khanna) are in a throuple. Bharadwaj (Tamara Podemski) is vegan. They all make their own clothes, snap in approval, and dance to “truly upsetting music.” Gurathin (David Dastmalchian) doesn't quite fit in with the rest of them, but his black fingernails and handmade accessories show he's trying to blend in with his adopted family, even if he's skeptical about their decor and can't quite dance to their beat — although the lack of rhythm may be because he's an “augmented human,” meaning he's got similar cybernetics to Murderbot, just not as powerful. 

The recurring clashes between Murderbot's militaristic approach to safety and the crew's “peace and love” lifestyle are good for plenty of laughs, as the newly freed thinker slowly acquiesces to the charms of a caring community. Meanwhile, to keep up the action, the team encounters local aliens (which look like the worms from “Tremors,” crossed with a two-headed centipede) and scraps with neighboring humans. Every so often, Murderbot has to bust out his arm-guns (actual arms in his guns, not Skarsgård's oft-showcased biceps), and the results evoke conflicting feelings within the team members. “This bot is crazy violent… but it also saved my life?” “It's just a machine… but it acts like a man?” “It's kinda hot… but he doesn't have a penis?”

 










Debating what makes us human is well-trodden territory in science-fiction stories (and a topic co-creator Chris Weitz has recently tackled in scripts for “The Creator,” Robert Zemeckis' “Pinocchio” remake, and even, one could argue, “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story”). But the potent combination of playfulness and earnestness the Weitz brothers bring to “Murderbot” helps keep us invested in the cyborg's personal evolution.

Even better is how the series utilizes a meta parallel straight from the books: Murderbot loves television. As soon as he's freed from his oppressive corporate job, Murderbot downloads thousands of hours of “premium entertainment” to keep himself from getting bored. His favorite show is a “Star Trek” parody titled “The Rise & Fall of Sanctuary Moon,” which he obsessively watches (when he should be watching over the crew) and vigorously defends. (The way Murderbot snaps at anyone who dares to mock his favorite show is very funny.)

Murderbot fawning over a science-fiction TV show within “Murderbot,” a science-fiction TV show, allows for plenty of self-referential jokes and gags (a personal favorite: when Murderbot delivers his version of director's commentary). But the Weitzes also use television to draw parallels between Murderbot and the audience, forging an empathetic connection to the character by emphasizing the empathy TV can create in its viewers. 

 










Sometimes, Murderbot will take what he learns from “Sanctuary Moon” to connect with the humans he struggles to understand. Other times, the mere mention of the popular program creates necessary conversation where there was none. Still more often, Murderbot's binge-a-thons interfere with important duties — rather than offer relief from the daily grind, they become a distraction from what really matters. TV becomes both a bridge to his human crew and a wall to hide from them. 

“I don't watch serials to remind me of the way things actually are,” Murderbot says to himself. “I watch them to distract me when things in the real world are stressful as shit.” That “Murderbot” is able to do both — crafting a heartfelt plea for building communities while still serving as a giddy break from life's hardships — makes the show that much more enjoyable. Add such sneaky-smart attributes to Skarsgård's shrewdly measured yet snappily spirited performance, and “Murderbot” lives up nicely to its title's intrinsic promise: It's goofy, sure, but it's also kinda great.

“Murderbot” premieres Friday, May 16 on Apple TV+ with two episodes. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale on July 11.

EXCLUSIVE: Netflix's A Different World spinoff pilot has cast 8 in leading roles. They are Chibuikem Uche as Kojo, Maleah Joi Moon as Deborah, Cornell Young as Shaquille, Jordan Aaron Hall as Amir, Alijah Kai as Rashida, and Kennedi McClure as Hazel, Deadline has learned.


	Netflix declined to comment.


As Deadline reported previously, the streamer will shoot a pilot for A Different World, a sequel to the 1987 sitcom, which will chronicle Dwayne and Whitley's daughter's time at an HBCU. The project had been in development at the streamer since last year, and the commissioning of the pilot is part of that process.

	The pilot is a one-off and not part of a strategy shift, sources said. The pilot model in general is more often employed in comedy as a proof of concept for tone, chemistry among the ensemble cast, comedic timing and other key ingredients of a successful series.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The Different World sequel comes from writer/executive producer Felicia Pride and executive producers Debbie Allen, Mandy Summers, Tom Werner, Gina Prince-Bythewood and Reggie Bythewood. Allen, Werner, Prince-Bythewood and Bythewood all worked on the original multi-camera series, a spinoff of The Cosby Show, which ran on NBC for six seasons with Carsey-Werner producing.


	As Deadline reported, the sequel was originally envisioned as single-camera. It is unclear whether that has changed. Allen, who is slated to direct the pilot from a script by Pride, is well versed in both formats. The pilot is eying a June shoot in Atlanta, sources said.


A Different World followed Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet) and her new classmates at Hillman College, a fictional historically Black college. Though Bonet exited after one season, the show continued with the leading cast of Jasmine Guy, Kadeem Hardison, Dawnn Lewis, Darryl M. Bell, Sinbad, Charnele Brown, Cree Summer and Glynn Turman.


	The retooled second season continued to follow the students' lives, with the love story between Guy's Whitley Gilbert and Hardison's Dwayne Wayne at the center. The sequel will center on the couple's youngest daughter, Deborah Wayne, who is now also attending an HBCU (It is unclear whether it will be Hillman, which was the initial idea).

The tight end flew solo at Patrick Mahomes' charity gala in Las Vegas.

	Hannah Dailey



Travis Kelce flew solo at Patrick Mahomes' charity auction Thursday night (May 15), but Taylor Swift‘s presence was still felt — especially during one hilarious moment when the Kansas City Chiefs tight end withdrew his bid on a guitar signed by his superstar girlfriend.


In a clip filmed by one attendee of the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation's Golf Classic gala in Las Vegas, Kelce stands near his table with his bidding paddle in hand as an auctioneer fields offers on an acoustic guitar autographed by Swift. As the asking bid rises, the New Heights podcaster changes his mind and withdraws from pursuing the item, quipping, “I just realized I have that already.”

	











	As Kelce sits back down with a cheeky grin, Mahomes — who stands nearby — bursts out laughing with the rest of the event's attendees. The quarterback's wife, Kansas City Current co-owner Brittany Mahomes, also sits at their table, covering her face as she chuckles.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Founded by Patrick Mahomes in 2019, 15 and The Mahomies is “dedicated to improving the lives of children” and supporting initiatives that “focus on health, wellness, communities in need of resources and other charitable causes,” according to the charity's website. In 2024, Kelce attended the same gala with the “Fortnight” singer on his arm, at one point auctioning off four tickets to Swift's Eras Tour for $80,000.


	The event comes just a few days after the Grotesquerie star and Swift stepped out together in Philadelphia for a Mother's Day gathering at a restaurant, marking one of the first times the couple has been seen out in public in the past few months. Since concluding her Eras trek in December, the 14-time Grammy winner has largely been staying out of the spotlight (although fans do suspect she's gearing up to announce something at the 2025 American Music Awards on May 26). 


	During her time off, Swift has seemingly been prioritizing family time. Travis' older brother, retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, recently revealed that the singer-songwriter had made time to meet his and Kylie Kelce's new daughter, Finnley, whom they welcomed in April.


	“We were fortunate to have them all in,” Jason told Entertainment Tonight on Monday (May 12). “It doesn't happen often — everyone's busy — but it was really special.”

The first truly modern American Western, or at least the first one that has the nowness required to mention Pop Crave by name, Ari Aster's “Eddington” is also the first major Hollywood movie that's been willing to see the COVID pandemic for the hellacious paradigm shift that it was — as the moment when years of technologically engineered polarization tore a forever hole in the social fabric of a country that was already coming apart at the seams. 

Few other filmmakers would have the chutzpah required to make a “No Country for Old Men” riff that hinges on mask mandates and the murder of George Floyd, and we should probably all be grateful that none of them have tried. But Aster, who's exclusively interested in making the kind of films that should be reviewed straight onto a prescription pad, is too beholden to his neuroses for his latest movie to play like a cheap provocation. This time, however, there's a good chance those are your neuroses, too.

Stemming from a collective sickness to the same degree that “Beau Is Afraid” was born from some very personal trauma, “Eddington” — the tagline for which reads: “Hindsight is 2020” — only wields its what's the opposite of nostalgia? specificity as a means to an end. It might set the scene with a little “remember how it felt to wait in line outside the pharmacy?” fun, but Aster's bleakly funny and brilliantly plotted assessment of how fucked we've become since then soon leverages those fun memories into a far more probing story about the difficulties of sharing a town between people who live in separate realities. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






If “Eddington” is still a discourse generation machine powerful enough to make “Civil War” seem like a wind-up toy by comparison, that isn't because it picks sides — or risks the navel-gazing tedium of Alex Garland's epic by explicitly refusing to. Virtually everyone in Aster's COVID Western is a victim to one extent or another, even if some of them have a lot more blood on their hands by the end of it than others; there's no need for false equivalencies in a film whose characters are all powerless to disentangle the internet from the fabric of their personal lives.

That includes Sheriff Joe Cross (a sublimely pathetic Joaquin Phoenix), who only goes online under extreme duress, and always seems to unholster his phone as if he's begging someone not to make him use it. The impotent face of law enforcement in a small New Mexico town that's home to about 5,000 people, Joe is a “common sense” conservative who just wants to make babies and mess around with his government-appropriated AR-15. 

 










He's trying to make peace with the fact that his QAnon-susceptible wife Louise (Emma Stone) would rather watch numerology videos on YouTube than acknowledge her husband's existence, but Eddington's mask-happy mayor Ted — a handsome tech entrepreneur (Pedro Pascal) who secretly intends to host a massive artificial intelligence datacenter on the outskirts of Eddington after he wins re-election — is in thrall to the state's liberal governor, and his political career hinges on enforcing their various COVID mandates. 

That doesn't sit well with the asthmatic Joe, who doesn't consider the coronavirus to be a “here” problem, in much the same way as he later tries to wave off the idea that Eddington is a microcosm of the structural racism and class inequalities that people begin to protest on Main St. after police execute a man in St. Louis. Everyone in his jurisdiction is getting their news from a different source, and tensions are spilling into the supermarket aisles as people struggle to find a common harmony amid the noise of their competing echo chambers. 

Hell, even the people in Joe's house are getting their news from different sources, especially since his live-in mother-in-law (Deirdre O'Connell as Dawn) has started force-feeding Louise videos by a far, far right-wing YouTuber who tells his subscribers that “your pain isn't a coincidence.” He's played by a smooth and shaggy Austin Butler, and you'd probably want to believe him too. 

 










What's a sheriff to do? In Joe's case, he decides to run against Ted for mayor, and that decision will ultimately have a massive ripple effect on everyone in town, from the deputies he enlists to run his harebrained campaign (Luke Grimes and Michael Tooley, whose competing ambitions assume a racial dynamic in the wake of Black Lives Matter), to a horny white teenager who transforms himself into the wokest kid alive to impress his politically active crush. Alas, Googling Angela Davis may not be enough to seal the deal in a society where the internet — that great connector — has made it impossible for people to communicate with each other, and the reality of that situation only grows increasingly unmanageable as national headaches begin to impose themselves on a town where everyone sees their neighbors as a problem to be solved. 

Aster has described “Eddington” as a Western with cell phones instead of guns, but the guns do eventually come out; no one familiar with the director's previous work will be shocked to learn that this movie doesn't end with a raucous but rousing civil assembly. The more that Aster's latest freakout begins to resemble an apocalyptic kumbaya about the need for non-partisan communication, the more gleefully he obliterates any hope of restoring a shared reality between his characters (case in point: The story's first act of profound violence immediately follows a showdown that's soundtracked by Katy Perry's “Firework”). 

 










The stakes escalate with a mordant velocity reminiscent of Park Chan-wook's revenge sagas, a point of reference that continues through the darkly funny — and patently absurd — coda that Aster tacks on to the end of his film's pulse-pounding final shootout. Like so many aspects of “Eddington,” the way that shootout resolves might easily be mistaken for cynicism if not for the script's increasingly fever-brained insistence that its characters are at the mercy of a power beyond their control (not to double back to “Civil War,” but I hope everyone's ready for another take on “The Antifa Massacre”). 

Technology isn't always at the forefront of this story, but Aster is unsparing about the ambient role it continues to play in our lives, and the further that our dear Sheriff Joe falls off the rails, the more that “Eddington” revels in the constructed nature of his reality (an opportunity that Daniel Pemberton's Tōru Takemitsu-like score takes full advantage of). For a movie so giddy about grabbing hold of the third rail, Aster's fourth feature is less effective as a shock to the system than it is for how vividly — and how uncomfortably — it captures the day-to-day extent to which our digital future has stripped people of their ability to self-identify their own truths. 

 










John Ford's “Young Mr. Lincoln” makes a cameo appearance towards the end, but “Eddington,” for all the inspiration it takes from the masters of its genre, feels equally indebted to the likes of Miranda July's “Me and You and Everyone We Know” in how it takes stock of our divided online world, and pleads with everyone to “free each other's hearts.” That film ended by reforging the human connection between people. This one ends with target practice. 

“Eddington” premiered in Competition at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. A24 will release it in theaters on Friday, July 18.

There's “How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb,” and then there's “How to Sufficiently Interview Someone Whose Work You've Spent Countless Meaningful Hours with While Over Zoom to Promote a Film About Themselves, All Inside of Eight Minutes.” Who knows what number among the hundreds of thousands (millions?) that have attended U2 concerts in the last 45 years would sell an arm and leg for limited time of any kind with Bono, whose odd mixture of talent, sincerity, and absurdity have left an imprint on fans that goes well past the standard rockstar glitz and glamour.

 










My own opportunity arose via “Bono: Stories of Surrender,” Andrew Dominik's cinematic rendition of a one-man stage show that itself condensed Bono's compelling, self-effacing memoir “Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story.” Those who read that book will recognize many stories captured herein, though they've been jumbled around, reanimated by Bono's buoyant presence, and punctuated with stripped-down renditions of classic U2 tracks.

For whatever that could suggest of an ego trip, it's a proper experience: Shot in black-and-white by David Fincher's regular DP Erik Messerschmidt, “Stories of Surrender” looked and sounded nice at home — and could really be something on an Apple Vision Pro, where it begins streaming in 180-degree “Apple Immersive Video” on May 30 — though those at Cannes will have the rare opportunity to see and hear it on a grander scale. While I can't wager what “Stories of Surrender” might mean to a U2 agnostic, this acolyte found it effortless (but not-insubstantial) viewing.

Zooming from New York into Cannes, I found the legendary musician — sunglasses obviously on — offering a straight-out-the-gate greeting.

The following interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.

Bono: [Points at camera] Chin, chin, motherfucker.

IndieWire: Hi, Mr. Bono. How are you?

Mr. Bono to you. [Laughs]

We could go with Paul.

No, I like that. I really like Mr. Bono. Herr Bono.

Monsieur Bono. We could just do this for eight minutes — we could just riff.

Would love to.

That's the dilemma of super-fast encounters with people you admire.

Speed-dating, Nick.

These are the challenges that we face, but it's a good challenge.
 










It's an artform, I'm told, to a person who doesn't do full stops or commas or even paragraphs [Laughs] that well. This might be tricky for you, and I apologize upfront; it's certainly going to be tricky for me. But I have a number of friends who are great journalists, and the art of compression is one I'm in awe of.

I come to you as something of a co-star, because I was in the crowd for the filming of this movie.

Oh, wow.

I spent hours watching you do different takes, waiting between set-ups, singing along when the time came. It was also interesting watching it as a complete, edited piece — it's seamless. I can't remember what was cut out, except when you broke into an Elvis impersonation and did “Heartbreak Hotel.” Do you remember that?

I don't, but I remember there was some tequila involved — oh, no, it was whiskey. I remember doing a Ramones thing. Yeah, no: It's all a bit of a blur because it might have been the same day that I say goodbye to my father five times. [Laughs] Derangement of the senses, as it were.

It felt deranged being in there. I wonder what it was like being a performer with an audience that's, let's say, “in on the joke” — being directed to react on the third take of a song or fourth take of a joke as if it were all fresh. Does it affect you much as a singer or actor?
 










It's tricky to undo surprise. For someone like me, it's more than tricky — it's unsettling. But once the interweb — or whatever they're calling it these days — happened, suddenly, to surprise your audience became almost impossible. So artists started to become human jukeboxes and just change their sets every night to create that sense of surprise. But I learned through this process the power of a script, and that actually the exact same words, the exact same tempo — actually the exact same key — can mean something completely different from one night to another. I had this confirmed before I went into “Stories of Surrender” with two copies I have of Frank Sinatra singing “My Way” — one from his late 50s and one from his late 70s. Same arrangement, same key, same text, and one is an apology and one is a boast. It left me in awe of interpretive singing.

I guess Frank knew what every great actor knows: that you can, somehow, suffuse the same line but with where you are at and where your emotion is at. The hardest bits for me were actually when there was no audience at all and I was just left on my own; Andrew wanted it that way. So I don't know how many days we did just on our own, and he was reminding me: “You think the audience are close in this theater, but they'll never be as close as this lens. And that lens will know if you're not telling the truth more than any of these people who are either a) fans of yours; b) curious; c) just tourists coming to see the sight.” That was interesting. So I had to get closer to the text. Yeah.

 










There's a really rich history of U2's music in cinema — my own favorites are the Passengers songs in “Beyond the Clouds.” Are there any that make you especially proud when you see them?

Probably my favorite U2 song is from Wim Wenders' film, called “Faraway So Close” — a song called “Stay.” And on the Passengers album there's “Miss Sarajevo,” which features in “Stories of Surrender,” but “Your Blue Room” is… yeah. It's very special. We just revisited that album in conversation with Brian Eno, who was our guide on those. We went in and spent some time in the studio over a period, and we're straight back there.

U2 is this odd combination of… it's this dialectical thing between experimentation, innovation, trying to get to feelings — more than stances, feelings — that haven't been felt, and sort of connecting. It's this almost contradictory impulse. David Bowie had it, too. It's like: He wanted to be Picasso [Laughs] and he wanted to be Elizabeth Taylor. And when he was completely, equally driven, you got all this incredible music. That's my drug of choice, really: music. I always want artists to be somewhere at the center of that contradiction. The Beatles' best work is: They're still trying to communicate with the best people, but they're also trying to push the artform to its elastic limit.

 










For me, “Stories of Surrender,” the elastic limit might just be to make people laugh, and to be able to take off my armor — this sort of machismo that Irish people go around with — and just talk about my life as a little opera. And that felt somewhat daring and somewhat, actually, experimental. Sometimes we can hide in the experimental. This was more exposure for its mundanity, actually: The kitchen table, the four chairs — Edge, Adam, Larry, Ali — the operating theater, the hospital bed where I say goodbye to my father, “Krapp's Last Tape,” black-and-white. I managed to be both really pretentious in the first five minutes, which I'm really proud of, then pantomime. Stuff from avant-garde to fucking panto.

I think Apple is going to set off a device in my Mac that kills me if I don't end this conversation right now, but —

Publicist: Thank you, Nick.

No, no — hold on a second.

Well, I just want to say thanks. Having spent so much of my life listening to your music, these minutes were valued.

I feel a little more useful now. Thanks, Nick.

Whatever I can do to improve Bono's day.

Thanks, Nick. You're a beautiful man.

EXCLUSIVE: The movie business is on a much needed hot streak. How the momentum impacts two plum packages remains to be seen.


	One of them, the feature adaptation of the video game adaptation Split Fiction, has Wicked helmer Jon M. Chu attached to direct what will be another two-hander with female leads. Sydney Sweeney is one of them, and Paul Wernick & Rhett Reese are the writers. They are the scribes behind Deadpool & Wolverine, the Deadpool and Zombieland films. Not surprisingly after the smash results of the screen adaptation of the Minecraft video game, bids are high and a deal is getting close. I've heard bid numbers in the multiple millions from Sony and Amazon MGM Studios, with the latter in strong position to take it off the table, and it will likely be settled by early next week.

	











	More intriguing is Deeper. I've heard that Ana de Armas is poised to join Tom Cruise in this undersea supernatural film that Doug Liman will direct. De Armas is the new wrinkle here; they've been photographed together recently, and I'm told they are doing the diving training required for the project.  




			Watch on Deadline		







Deeper follows an astronaut who encounters a terrifying force while on a deep dive into a never-before-explored trench. Pic has been in development for almost a decade, originally set at MGM in April 2016, which bought a Max Landis spec. I've heard Christopher McQuarrie is involved with the script now. Originally, Bradley Cooper was to star, with Kornél Mundruczó directing; Idris Elba and filmmaker Baltasar Kormákur teamed on a later iteration that likewise failed to move forward.


	This one is expensive, in the $200 million range most likely, and it proved too rich for Warner Bros' blood. But Cruise crushed the Croisette this week with the final installment of Mission: Impossible The Final Reckoning, a film expected to do $70 million or more on its five-day opening weekend, hopefully on a blockbuster path. De Armas also has momentum, as her John Wick spinoff Ballerina is tracking at $40 million-plus.


	While he, Liman and McQuarrie have plans to shoot a narrative film in space with cooperation from NASA and SpaceX, I'm told Cruise would like to make Deeper next and it's not a question of if, but where he decides to make it. No comment from his camp.

The politician also wrote that The Boss is "not a talented guy" as well as a "pushy, obnoxious JERK."

Donald Trump is not too happy with Bruce Springsteen, whom the president called “highly overrated” and “dumb as a rock” in a heated post on Truth Social after the musician slammed his administration during a concert in Manchester, England.


	On Friday morning (May 16) — two days after Springsteen voiced his disdain for the United States government's “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous” leadership at the kickoff show of his 2025 European tour —  Trump began by writing, “I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States.” 

	











	“Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country,” Trump continued. “Sleepy Joe didn't have a clue as to what he was doing, but Springsteen is ‘dumb as a rock,' and couldn't see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!)?”


	“This dried out ‘prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just ‘standard fare,'” Trump added. “Then we'll all see how it goes for him!”


Billboard has reached out to Springsteen's reps for comment.


	The twice-impeached president's comments come after The Boss greeted his Manchester crowd Wednesday (May 14) by saying, “The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock and roll, in dangerous times.”


	“In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, and has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration,” he continued before launching into 2001's “Land of Hopes and Dreams.” “Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against the authoritarianism, and let freedom ring.”


	Springsteen — who also posted the speech on his Instagram — has long been open about his stance on American politics, endorsing Trump's opponent Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. Four years prior, he called the POTUS — who in May 2024 was convicted of all 34 felony counts in his hush money trial — a “threat to our democracy” in an interview with The Atlantic.

	











	The “Born in the U.S.A.” singer is just one of many major music stars who has made their stance against Trump clear — and Springsteen also isn't the only one of them whom the former reality star has put on blast recently. Also on Friday, Trump insulted Taylor Swift, writing that the 14-time Grammy winner is “no longer ‘HOT?'”

After weeks of reports that Kelly Clarkson wants to leave her daily talk show in the dust, NBC has announced the Grammy winner and former coach on “The Voice” will host a new primetime series, due to premiere in August 2025. 

On May 14, Variety reported that NBC greenlit the new show starring Clarkson, which will turn a popular feature on her talk show called “Songs & Stories” into a limited series. In each of the four episodes, Clarkson will interview different music superstars: Teddy Swims, Lizzo, the Jonas Brothers, and Gloria Estefan. 

Clarkson will not only host but executive produce her “Songs & Stories” show, according to Variety. The weekly episodes will air on August 19, August 26, September 2, and September 9 at 10 p.m. Eastern time. 

When Clarkson has hosted “Songs & Stories” themed episodes of “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” which airs on over 200 stations across the U.S., she's had in-depth discussions about music with R&B singer Babyface, country stars Miranda Lambert and Garth Brooks, 90s icon Alanis Morisssette, and pop superstar Pink. Clarkson also performed duets with some of them. 

The “Breakaway” singer's primetime show will follow a similar format, according to Variety. The outlet reported that NBC's logline for the “Songs & Stories” series says each episode is “a front-row pass for Kelly Clarkson to engage with some of her favorite celebrities and examine both their music and personal lives. The specials are a forum where iconic voices meet heartfelt storytelling through unfiltered conversation and sung in an intimate, unplugged setting.”

It's not clear if NBC and Clarkson hope to continue “Songs & Stories” after its initial four-episode run. 

Clarkson's limited primetime series is an interesting development amid questions about her future on  “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” 

In early April, Page Six reported that Clarkson wanted to leave the NBC show, which moved from Los Angeles to New York in 2023. The singer was eager for a fresh start for herself and her kids — daughter River and son Remy — following her drawn-out divorce from their dad, Brandon Blackstock, per People. 

But after multiple unexplained absences from her daily talk show in March, with a rotation of celebrities filling in, an insider told Page Six that the single mom was finding her work schedule “grueling” and keeping her away from quality time with her kids. 

On May 9, while performing in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Clarkson lamented to the audience that her concerts were few and far between because of her taping schedule, the outlet reported. 

“We haven't done a show in a while, y'all, 'cause I have a talk show. It's like a whole other job,” she told the crowd. 

In December, Deadline reported that “The Kelly Clarkson Show” had been renewed for a seventh season, “to take her up to the end of 2026.” 

Meanwhile, Clarkson will return to her old stomping grounds at “The Voice” for the May 20 season finale, to perform her new single, “Where Have U Been?” She was a coach on the show from seasons 14 through 21, and returned for season 23.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Oscar winner and Captain Marvel actress Brie Larson (Room) is set to star in creature horror film Fail-Safe, with J.J. Abrams producing and FilmNation, WME and CAA launching the hot project at the Cannes market.


	JT Mollner (Strange Darling) is set to direct the movie, which is described as “a modern take on the creature horror film told from the perspective of a young boy who slowly begins to discover that his beloved parents are hiding a disturbing secret about his mother's true nature.”


	Brian Duffield (No One Will Save You), who is currently directing Whalefall for 20th Century and Imagine, wrote the screenplay based on a short story by Philip Fracassi.

Lost creator and Star Wars and Star Trek director Abrams said: “With Fail-Safe, Brian Duffield has written an absolute powerhouse of a script. It's a horror film that is as sweet and moving as it is terrifying. To have JT Mollner in the director's chair — his Strange Darling blew me away — is a dream come true. Finally, having the limitlessly talented Brie Larson as our star sets up Fail-Safe to be that rare horror film that makes you laugh, feel, and care, before taking you on an absolutely wild ride.”

	The movie heralds from FilmNation Entertainment's production label Infrared, J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions, and Assemble Media. Drew Simon, J.J. Abrams and Jon Cohen, and Jack Heller are producers. Assemble's Caitlin de Lisser-Ellen and Brian Duffield are executive-producing, as is Larson.


	Infrared is financing. Arrival, Conclave and Anora outfit FilmNation is handling international sales and will co-rep domestic rights with CAA Media Finance and WME Independent.


	“I'm beyond excited to see Brie take on this role – it's frightening, emotionally charged, and so different from anything she's done before,” said producer Drew Simon, Infrared President of Production. 


	“The depth and intensity this character demands is immense, and I know Brie's going to bring something unforgettable to the screen.” 


	Larson won the Oscar for 2016 movie Room.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


(UPDATED with more details) On Cassie Ventura‘s likely last day as a witness in Sean “Diddy” Combs' sex-trafficking trial, the very pregnant singer was in a credibility vs. coercion standoff Friday with her ex-boyfriend's defense lawyers.


	“You always want to show me that you have the power and you knock me around”, the jury this morning heard Ventura read aloud a 2016 text she sent then boyfriend Combs after the Bad Boy Records founder brutally attacked her in an L.A. hotel hallway as the singer tried to escape one of the couple's now infamous drug-fueled “freak-offs.” The message continued: “I'm not a ragdoll I'm someone's child.”

	











	Captured in March 2016 on the InterContinental's security cameras and investigated by one of the hotel's guards at the time, the beating of Ventura by the half-naked Diddy has been widely seen in and out of court since it was obtained and broadcast by CNN last spring. Sitting with his defense team in Judge Arun Subramanian's lower Manhattan courtroom, a steely-eyed and fidgeting Combs Friday morning listened as the ‘Me & U' singer resumed her testimony under questioning from attorney Anna Estevao.


	On the stand answering questions about her own 2023 time at a rehab and trauma program in Arizona and receiving PTSD treatment, Ventura was also asked today by Estevao if she knew Diddy entered a rehab facility soon after the L.A. hotel incident nine years ago. The witness admitted she had a hard time recalling that step by Combs in any detail.


	The defense lawyer also wanted to know, as Ventura had said previously, she believed her now-ex had “blacked out” from substance abuse at the time of the hotel melee. “I believe he was intoxicated,” Ventura replied. She added “everybody's definition of blackout is different.”


	What was not different in anyone's definition was Ventura's declaration that Combs took or promised to take her passport, other ID and phone(s) when he was angry with her or thought she was cheating on him. To that, the court heard Combs reacted harshly when he suspected something was going on between Ventura and singer (and no stranger to controversary himself) Chris Brown and an unnamed NFL player.

	In the undeniably complicated and unorthodox relationship Ventura and Combs had from 2007-2018, such actions could prove a significant factor in proving the charges against the defendant and the lack of agency Ventura a.k.a. Victim-1 actually had.


	Emphasizing their client's drug abuse (which was spotlighted by revelations of a 2012 OD on Thursday) and Combs' short temper when under the influence, the defense team have tried to paint the couple's years together as two broken people out of control and feeding into each other's worst, most raw and most depraved wants. It is a portrait that the defense concedes is sad and perhaps pathetic but not a crime under the charges Combs in facing.


	However, a crying Ventura's vivid recollection in testimony on May 14 of being raped in 2018 by Diddy in her L.A. apartment after they broke up could prove a hard blow to the defense's narrative. Today,  Estevao probed Ventura for missteps and conflicting statements in her retelling of the alleged rape both in court and to law enforcement. 


	While that effort didn't really go much of anywhere, the defense lawyer herself introduced a new element when Estevao brought up Combs having bi-polar disorder. Seemingly never mentioned before, information was raised in the context of Combs acting “strangely” at the “closure” dinner he and Ventura were having in Malibu on the day the producer is said to have raped his then ex-girlfriend seven years ago.


Arrested on September 16 at an upscale NYC hotel lobby, the 55-year-old Combs is charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. The allegations in the initial and since amended indictment could see the Grammy-winning performer in prison for the rest of his life if he's found guilty. Up against dozens of civil suits claiming assault and abuse as well, Combs has denied all accusations, entered not guilty pleas, and exclaimed he is being persecuted for his unconventional but fully consensual sexual obsessions by a prudish government and gold diggers.


	With statements like the 2009 text “I'm always ready to freak-off,” from Ventura to Combs that was read out yesterday, the prosecution knows that on re-direct Friday it will have to make sure the Step-Up 2 actress puts the most glaring of the litany of correspondence in some context. Under a discussion with the judge before the jury was brought in, the prosecution pledged to have a speedy re-direct and conclude Ventura's testimony if the defense can get its cross-examination done by 4:30 p.m. ET at the latest.


	Irritated Friday by the defense's sometimes almost dithering approach to pulling up texts and other evidence, Judge Subramanian has made it crystal clear that he sees it as essential the about-to-give-birth-any-day Ventura is out of the witness box ASAP. The original desire was to have her testimony wrapped up before the 12:30 p.m. ET lunch break, but that plan has evidently been revised. The change of plan is in part due to protests by the defense. The lawyers say they have a lot to ask the star witness before they lose her permanently once she goes into the hospital for the birth of her and husband Alex Fine's third child.


	To punctuate how serious that timetable is, earlier today the feds sent a letter to the judge floating that Combs and his defense actually wanted Ventura to go into labor on the stand so they could use the flurry as pretext for a new mistrial motion. “The inefficiency of cross-examination yesterday raises the inference that the defendant hopes to accomplish precisely that outcome,” the document starkly declared. (Read the letter here).

	











	The importance of Ventura to the government's case cannot be overstated, which is one reason the jurors have been shown explicit and shocking otherwise sealed photographs of the baby oil and drug-drenched “freak-offs.”


	One can, as the Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey-led prosecution certainly does, draw a straight line between the currently incarcerated Combs in court now and the abuse and assault suit Ventura filed against him in November 2023. Still, while sticking to his line that he did nothing wrong, Combs did settle with Ventura within 24 hours of the filing of her suit. Sources told Deadline at the time that Combs paid Ventura “around $30 million,” but on May 14 the singer revealed officially for the first time it was actually $20 million.


	On May 15, Ventura was asked by defense lawyer Estevao if she recognized that Combs' “career was ruined at that point,” after her short-lived and much-covered suit was filed. Without much of a pause, Ventura answered: “I could understand that, yeah.”


	As the suits piled up and the status conscious Combs became a pariah in the music industry and almost everywhere else, the innocence proclaiming mini-mogul did apologize for the severity of his abuse in his relationship with Ventura after the security camera footage emerged in May of him hitting and kicking her in 2016. At the time, as it also was revealed that Combs bought the footage for $50,000 the day after the incident, Ventura's lawyers slammed his apology as “disingenuous.”


	Whether or not that is true, it is a fact that the apology has since been deleted form Combs' social feeds. Now, after dispute the accuracy of the video for several months, the defense concedes that the footage is disturbing as an example of domestic violence. Centering the incident as a fight over a phone, as attorney Teny Geragos did in the defense's opening statement, Combs' team asserted what everybody can see doesn't rise to the charges the feds have hit the “All About the Benjamins” performer with.  


	After the U.S. Attorney's office intent earlier this week to strongly show that self-admitted domestic violence predator Combs was guilty of the charges in his constant coercive efforts to force a fundamentally unwilling Ventura into filmed sex with male escorts and more with threats of battering, career disaster and public humiliation, the defense sought to flip the script Thursday. To that, with gentle nudging and a distinct reading of evidence like the text message, Estevao tried Thursday and today to reiterate the defense's opening statement of May 12 that while Combs can be a violent drug-using ass, Ventura was an active and consenting agent in everything the couple did – not matter how sordid.


	Correspondingly, on the stand for nearly 15 hours so far this week, a sometimes tearful, triggered and voice-cracking Ventura has more than held her own against defense lawyer Estevao since yesterday. In fact, as most of the day was spent examining the copious texts and emails Combs and Ventura sent each other over their 11-year on-and-off “toxic relationship,” elements of the defense's tactics seemed to almost be doing the job of the prosecution. An agitated Combs could be seen repeatedly passing notes to lawyers and speaking directly to Estevao at one point during a break.


	Today Diddy seemed more composed, though how long that will last is TBD. During a short break Friday, Combs was alone at the defense table as his lawyers left the room to prepare for the rest of the morning session. Looking bored, the now white haired and once entourage leading defendant had a staffer help him with the position of the  monitor in front of him.

	











	With the schedule in flux, it is unknown right now when the prosecution's next witness, Dawn Richard, will begin her testimony. Once one of the singers from the Combs'-fronted MTV series Making the Band and other Diddy projects, Richard in September last year sued her past producer for rape and more. Filed right around the time Combs was arrested in this criminal case, that civil case is ongoing.


	This criminal case is expected to last eight to 10 weeks. Judge Subramanian told the jury when they were seated on May 12, promising to free them up by the July 4th holiday. At the stop and start pace the proceedings are currently going, that deadline could prove elusive.

Jason Kelce welcomed his fourth daughter, Finnley Anne, with his wife Kylie in March. The couple, who wed in 2018, already had Wyatt, 5, Elliotte, 4, and Bennett, 2. The arrival of the new baby has been a special event in the Kelce family, which includes Jason's brother, Travis, and his girlfriend, Taylor Swift.

Jason and Travis both recently appeared at the Amazon Upfront 2025 presentation, since their “New Heights” podcast is attached to the tech giant. While speaking with Entertainment Tonight, Jason shared some details about family life in the newborn bubble since Finnley's birth.

“Finnley's doing great. She is six weeks old, so she is a baby. We are not sleeping much, but it's been good,” the former Philadelphia Eagle shared.

A post shared by Kylie (McDevitt) Kelce (@kykelce)

Of course, the next question was whether his brother's girlfriend had met his new baby. Jason confirmed that Swift has met baby Finn, and then he shared a bit more information about the family dynamic in recent weeks. 

“She has, yep, she's met her. We were fortunate to have them all in … it doesn't happen often,” Jason Kelce explained. “Everybody is busy, but it was really special. Thankfully we have a tight-knit family that makes time for each other, and it's been awesome.”

Jason retired from the NFL in 2024 as one of the most-decorated offensive lineman in league history. In addition to being the mom of four, Kylie Kelce has also been keeping busy with her own podcast, “Not Gonna Lie.”

In early 2025, Swift wrapped up her Eras Tour and Travis Kelce finished out the season with the Kansas City Chiefs at Super Bowl LIX. 

A post shared by 𝒮𝓊𝓈𝒶𝓃𝓃𝒶𝒽⸆⸉ (@tayvis.socials)

Both Swift and Travis Kelce have stayed out of the public eye since the Chiefs' loss in February and the end of her tour. But, they were recently spotted in Philadelphia spending Mother's Day with the Kelce clan.

The couple joined Jason, Kylie, and mom Donna for a meal at Talula's Garden. Swift wore a black Christy Dawn dress with a daisy print. Some fans saw the outfit as a nod to lyrics from a song on her 2017 album “Reputation.” 

In “Don't Blame Me,” Swift sang “I once was poison ivy but now I'm your daisy.”

The dress sells for $298 on the Christy Dawn website, but is currently sold out. The Grammy winner accessorized with a $6,000 Chanel purse. Travis Kelce kept things casual for the outing, wearing a short-sleeved button up shirt.

A former contestant from “The Bachelor” and “Bachelor in Paradise” is reaching out for support from fans as her family navigates difficult news. Serene Russell took to her Instagram Stories to share her heartbreak with fans and provide ways they can help.

On May 15, Russell shared the news via an Instagram Story. She wrote, “On Sunday, Mother's Day, I saw my mom and immediately became concerned with her condition during brunch.” 

Russell noted she took her mom to the emergency room, but “everything came back clear.” They returned home, but Russell's mom continued to feel unwell. 

After her mom went to get checked out again, while Russell was at work, “she was diagnosed with a golf ball sized brain tumor.” 

Upon finding the tumor, Russell explained, her mom was “diagnosed with stage 3-4 brain cancer.” 

“I am still in shock, as this has all happened in 3 days and she had been hiding her pain/has been experiencing disorientation.” Russell noted that her mom's symptoms only began a week ago. 

A post shared by serene russell (@serenebrookrussell)

The “Bachelor in Paradise” alum asked for prayers to be sent her mom's way. She also shared a link to a GoFundMe created to raise funds for her mother's medical costs. 

She noted her mom would be getting surgery in a few days, but wrote, “her insurance does not cover it.” 

Russell wrote, “We are facing many obstacles but this is my mom and I know she is strong enough to beat it.”

In addition, Russell shared, “My little brother and sister are 15 and still depend on her. We all do.” A second Instagram Story included the GoFundMe link a second time, as well as a photo of Russell with her mom, younger brother, and younger sister. 

On the GoFundMe page, Russell's mom is described as “a very strong, independent woman” who is “not one to ask for handouts.” 

“Sherri is the mother to 5 wonderful children and she has been recently diagnosed with brain cancer. This is very unexpected to her, her children, and other family members,” the page for the fundraiser noted. 

After her upcoming surgery, the medical team will determine the next steps, likely chemotherapy or radiation, the update added. The GoFundMe organizer explained that the surgeon does not take the insurance that Russell's mother has, thus the family's decision to try to crowdfund the costs. 

Fans took to “The Bachelor” subreddit to share their sadness and post supportive messages about Russell's news. 

“Some of Serene's siblings are still in their teens… it's really just an awful situation all around. It comes out of nowhere and is just such a shock and absolutely devastating,” one person wrote. 

“That's so awful… I didn't know she had younger siblings. Poor things,” another fan wrote.

A post shared by serene russell (@serenebrookrussell)

As Us Weekly noted, Russell first appeared on Clayton Echard's season of “The Bachelor.” She went to “Bachelor in Paradise” the following summer and immediately clicked with “The Bachelorette” alum Brandon Jones.

Jones and Russell got engaged during the “Bachelor in Paradise” finale, and talked about setting a 2024 wedding date. In May 2023, however, the pair split.

Russell recently went public with her new romance. She is now dating Brendan Morais, who did season 7 of “Bachelor in Paradise.” 

Morais left paradise with Pieper James, and the two quietly split after two years together.

	For 30 years, it seems that there has never been a pitch too wild for Snoop Dogg. He's done a reggae album, a funk album, two gospel albums and even released an album on the blockchain. The Zelig of popular music, no collaborator is off limits: Willie Nelson, Stevie Wonder, Katy Perry, Quincy Jones, Daddy Yankee, the Bee Gees, Limp Bizkit, BTS, Patti LaBelle, Prince Royce, Banda MS, Tiësto, Popcaan, Jelly Roll, Charlie Sheen. He's sold his own app, his own breakfast cereal and recently opened a weed store in L.A., the city where he will likely serve as NBC's ambassador to the 2028 Summer Olympic Games.


	If any of this ever seemed incongruous with being gangsta rap royalty, it has never once affected the Teflon Dogg, America's lovable uncle. He gives a truckloads of money to charity, is generally regarded as one of the nicest people in the business and has been consistently releasing solid if underheralded solo albums since the Clinton administration. Who's going to care if the guy sells an NFT or two?

	











	That all changed in January when Snoop did a short DJ set at David Sacks' Crypto Ball, a Washington D.C. schmoozefest held to celebrate Donald Trump's re-inauguration. Fans on social media rebelled, calling him a sellout, but Snoop stood his ground, telling The Breakfast Club, “I'm not a politician. I don't represent the Republican Party. I don't represent the Democratic Party. I represent the motherfucking Gangsta Party, period point blank.” Snoop promised that his 21st solo album, Iz It a Crime, would break his radio silence, fighting back against haters and doubters and reaffirming his legacy. Luckily, a defensive Snoop is still classically and effortlessly cool: “Me and Dre at the So-Fi the only way I sell out,” he raps on “Unsung Heroes”

	“Unsung Heroes” is also the album highlight with its droning organ that sounds like it's stripped from an Ethiopian jazz record providing a hot slab of asphalt for Snoop to spit venomous invective. Tracks like “Iz It a Crime?” with its breathy Sade sample and the breezy “Sophisticated Crippin'” are less antagonistic as middle fingers go, listing his achievements and brushing off crumbs. The only other song that really seems to be the State of the Snoop address is “ShutYoBitchAssUp,” which most assume is aimed at former Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight, who has been disputing Snoop's ownership of the label: “I can see why you mad/I bought everything you own/Now you in PC snitching on the phone.”

	However, beyond those tracks, Iz It a Crime? isn't really the pugalistic battle record it's being made out to be. Instead it's another dependable Rhythm & Gangsta offering in a career full of them. There's his cadre of producers he's been using for the last 20-30 years (Battlecat, Soopafly, Denaun, Nottz, Rick Rock); there's the always liquid flow (“I'm talking lolos, a couple of cholos, la vida loco/Facts in a chokehold/Hey Siri, we need some more hoes”); and there's the occasional misstep (in this case, the narcotic would-be-club-banger “Spot”). The duet with still-rising raunch-rapper Sexxy Redd (“Me and OG Snoop”) is naturally electric and Wiz Khalifa shows up like an old friend to get a little wistful (“Just the Way It Iz”). It really is just Snoop being the ever-reliable Snoop — and only a true keyboard warrior could be mad at that.

Justin Bieber denied online rumors that he was abused by Sean Combs in his first public statement since Combs was arrested for sex-trafficking and racketeering.


	With Combs' trial underway this week in New York, Bieber's rep released a statement Friday in part due to the many rumors that have propagated since Combs' arrest that alluded to Bieber being an abuse victim of Combs.


	“Although Justin is not among Sean Combs' victims, there are individuals who were genuinely harmed by him,” the rep said in a statement to People. “Shifting focus away from this reality detracts from the justice these victims rightfully deserve.”


	In the aftermath of Combs' arrest, the internet was awash with resurfaced videos where the Bad Boy exec and the then-teenaged singer talked about hanging out together, a conversation that — in light of the accusations — is unsettling. “Where we hanging out and what we're doing we can't really disclose. But it's definitely a 15-year-old's dream,” Combs said in one clip. “For the next 48 hours, he's with me. And we're gonna go full. Buck full crazy.” 

	











	The resurfaced clips — coupled with Bieber's worrying public activity, rumors of drug use, and emotional social media posts — led some to assume that he was abused by Combs or participated in the alleged “Freak-Offs,” but the singer's rep denied those claims Friday. Bieber himself has not yet directly commented on the Combs situation.

	On Friday, the Combs trial resumed with Cassie on the stand in what is expected to be the final day of her grueling, explicit four-day testimony; the singer is eight-and-a-half months pregnant, which pushed the prosecution to introduce her testimony early in the trial.


	This week has been the first time the former celebrity couple of Combs and Cassie had seen each other in years. Combs is on trial for the sex-trafficking of two women between 2009 and 2024, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted.

The president has been mocking the superstar since she started sharing her political views in 2018.


													By
												

	Anna Chan



	Bad blood is still brewing. Donald Trump made yet another jab at superstar Taylor Swift in a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday (May 16).


	Eight months after he shared on the same social media platform that he hates the 14-time Grammy winner, the twice-impeached president posted, “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,' she's no longer ‘HOT?'”


Billboard has reached out to Swift's rep for comment.


	The insult seemingly came out of thin air, as Swift has not spoken about Trump since endorsing Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for president in September. Her support of President Joe Biden's vice president came after the business mogul shared an AI image of the “Anti-Hero” singer falsely endorsing him for a second term in office.


	“It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth,” the star wrote of the fake image at the time. “I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.” 

	











	Swift concluded that message — which was accompanied by a photo of her with her beloved cat Benjamin Button — by signing off as “Childless Cat Lady,” a dig at Vice President JD Vance's comments about Democrats who don't have kids.


	Five days after the superstar backed his opponent, Trump posted on Truth Social in all caps, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!”


	While they never had mad love for each other, Trump — who in May 2024 was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money case — did previously appreciate the singer-songwriter. In August 2012, he wrote on X (then Twitter) to thank the star for a photo, closing his message with “you are fantastic!” Months later in October, he congratulated her on landing the co-hosting gig announcing the Grammy nominations special, ending his tweet with “Taylor is terrific!”


	But once Swift began sharing her political leanings in 2018, when she urged the voters of Tennessee to vote against Republican Marsha Blackburn in the midterms, Trump's opinion of the star shifted. “Let's just say I like Taylor's music about 25% less now, OK?” he told reporters at the White House.

After reuniting with his K-pop boy band GOT7 earlier this year, the LA singer-songwriter-model returns to his solo music career with the Far East Movement–founded company.

With a new single already announced for the end of the month, Mark Tuan embarks on a fresh chapter by signing a new management deal ahead of a new, “raw and intimate” era.


Billboard can exclusively reveal that the Los Angeles singer-songwriter-model is teaming up with with Transparent Arts for his music career and other projects. Mark will release his new single “High as You” on May 30, to start the joint venture with the Asian American entertainment powerhouse. According to a press release, the new, alt-rock track “captures the essence of an unforgettable love — the only high he ever knew. With seductive melodies and striking choreography, Mark is ready to showcase a raw and intimate side of himself like never before.”

	After reuniting with his K-pop boy band GOT7 for a new EP earlier this year, “High as You” is Tuan's first solo release of 2025 and previews more music on the way.

	“I'm thrilled to partner with Transparent Arts and to step into a new phase of my journey as an artist,” Mark says in a statement. “‘High As You' is just the beginning, and I'm looking forward to sharing more of this side of me with my fans.”


James Roh, COO of Transparent Arts, adds, “We're thrilled to welcome Mark to our roster. As a fellow LA native, we felt an instant connection with him. He brings a rare blend of professionalism, talent, and authentic kindness. Working with Mark has been creatively fulfilling, and we can't wait for the world to hear what we've been working on.”


	After GOT7 opted not to renew its contract with JYP Entertainment in 2021, Tuan returned to LA to launch his solo career via the independent label Dreamers N Achievers (DNA), which he acts as CEO. The 31-year-old has balanced his indie projects like 2022 full-length, The Other Side, and his Fallin' EP, from 2023, with GOT7 activities and fashion collaborations including an ambassadorship with Saint Laurent and partnership with Calvin Klein.


	Founded by Billboard Hot 100 chart-toppers Far East Movement, Transparent Arts is a 360-degree entertainment company dedicated to amplifying Asian culture and talent worldwide through management, production, branding, and live events. Tuan joins a roster that currently includes Korean indie breakthrough band The Rose, Filipino superstar singer-actor James Reid, LA-based DJ and producer Yultron and more. Through over 15 years in the business, TA collaborators include artists like Bruno Mars, Marshmello, and Awkwafina, with Universal Music, YouTube, McDonald's, and SM Entertainment listed as brand partners.


	Earlier this year, Mark teamed up with his GOT7 band mates to drop its first project in nearly three years, Winter Heptagon, through a new partnership with Kakao Entertainment. The EP peaked at No. 16 on Billboard's World Albums chart, becoming the group's 20th entry. Meanwhile, lead single “Python” climbed to No. 4 on the World Digital Song Sales chart — GOT7's strongest showing since 2021. The group celebrated with concerts in Seoul's SK Olympic Handball Gymnasium arena and Bangkok's Rajamangala Stadium, reportedly selling out the 85,000 seats for the latter within a day.

	Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service after posting a picture of seashells spelling out “8647” on Instagram — which conservatives claim is a secret call for President Donald Trump's assassination. 


	On Thursday, Comey posted an image to his social media of a “cool shell formation” he found during a walk on the beach. The first half of the shell formation spelled out “86,” ostensibly a reference to common hospitality slang. The second half, “47,” was seemingly a reference to Trump, the 47th president. 


	To “86” something is an extremely common parlance in the restaurant and bar industry. When the manager asks security to “86” the man yelling at the bartender, they don't mean that they should take him out back and kill him, only that the person should be ejected from the bar. Similarly, if a chef tells a server to “86 the special” they mean that the server should let other staff know that the dish is no longer on offer. 

	











	Trump, top officials in his administration, Republican lawmakers, and MAGA commentators on social media took the post as a cold call to murder the president. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In a clip released by Fox News on Friday, Trump told host Bret Baier that Comey knew “exactly what that meant” and that “a child knows what that meant […] that meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear.” 


	“Our country has become respected again and all this, and he's calling for the assassination of the president,” Trump continued, adding that “if he had a clean history, I could, I could understand if there was a leniency,” but in his view Comey was a “dirty cop.”


	Trump's allies quickly seized on Comey's post on Thursday, with Donald Trump Jr. writing that Comey was “casually calling for my dad to be murdered.” 


	“Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of @POTUS Trump,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X.  “DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.”

	Current FBI director Kash Patel wrote that the bureau was “aware of the recent social media post by former FBI Director James Comey, directed at President Trump.” He added: “We are in communication with the Secret Service and Director Curran. Primary jurisdiction is with SS on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.”

	











	Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's Director of National Intelligence, even told Fox News that Comey should be in jail. “James Comey in my view should be held accountable and put behind bars for this,” she said. 


	House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) wrote: “President Trump has already survived TWO assassination attempts. Now, former disgraced FBI director James Comey is either threatening to kill Donald Trump or suggesting someone should. This is as outrageous as it is dangerous.” 


	Comey responded to the backlash by deleting the post, which he said he assumed were a “political message.”


	“I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence,” he continued. “It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.”


	It wasn't enough for his critics. It's also not the first time Trump's allies have claimed the term “86” was a call for his murder. In 2020, prominent lawmakers and influencers accused Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer of calling for the president's murder after she displayed an “8645” pin during a televised interview.

	Several prominent Republican influencers and even former lawmakers have some posts they would theoretically need to explain to law enforcement themselves. Last year, former Rep. Matt Gaetz wrote on X that he and MAGA Republicans had successfully “86'd” Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Former Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, and Former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell from the GOP.”


	Last we checked all three of those individuals were very much alive and un-murdered.

	In a 2020 post, Pizzagate influencer Jack Posobiec wrote “8647” — a reference to President Joe Biden — on social media. In response to Comey's post on Thursday, Posobiec wrote: “The fmr director of the FBI is calling for left-wing assassins to target our president and kill him. Have no idea why he hasn't been arrested yet.” 


	If that's how he really feels, Posobiec is welcome to print out his tweets about Biden and self-surrender at the nearest convenient FBI office.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: As Bono premieres his Andrew Dominik-directed Apple docu Bono: Stories of Surrender on Friday, Deadline can reveal he's not the only rock icon making noise at the Cannes Film Festival. Also present on the Croisette in an underground capacity is the Red Hot Chili Peppers. A documentary on the band's formative years is being quietly shopped, with secret screenings by Submarine Entertainment.


	The fact that the surviving members of the band participated on camera in this documentary is surprising, since they've turned down many offers in the past. That might be because of the shrapnel and deaths from drug use. That dark side of the music business is part of their overall tapestry to go along with 120 million albums sold and membership in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

	More refreshing is the moment they transformed from L.A. misfits to genre defying music pioneers, first under the name Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. They had only one song they played at their very first show that they had written that same day called “Out in LA.” The crowd went crazy and the club promoter ran over afterwards and asked if they could come back the next week with two songs. They did just that and the band was officially launched. They demolished in their first appearances and quickly signed a seven-album deal.  




			Watch on Deadline		







	There are two invite-only rough-cut screenings for buyers and festival organizers, and the first was Wednesday. The second one is Sunday at 4:15 local time at the Olympia.


	The film centers on the deep childhood bond between Anthony Kiedis, Flea and original guitarist Hillel Slovak — charting their early experimentation, the band's unruly formation, and the sonic chaos that defined their first three albums. The film features exclusive new interviews with Kiedis, Flea, John Frusciante, Jack Irons and George Clinton, and others. It was that approach by director Ben Feldman that provoked the band to lean into this. The comp is Becoming Led Zeppelin.


	Submarine is screening the cut for select buyers in both New York and Los Angeles following the secret Cannes screenings. A festival premiere for the film will be planned for either fall 2025 or early 2026. Visions of the band in that outdoor street venue at Toronto makes one possible landing place for the pic.

	











	Submarine has scored deals in the past with Cannes sneaks of the docus Todd Miller's Apollo 11 and Todd Haynes' Velvet Underground. Pic is produced by Marc D'Agostino and Asta Entertainment in association with Polygram Entertainment. James Slovak is co-producer and Polygram's David Blackman is an executive producer along with Dan Braun and Josh Braun of Submarine, and the latter are representing world sales.

Donald Trump, who had “Born in the U.S.A.” on his 2016 campaign rally soundtrack, insisted he's “never liked” Bruce Springsteen or his music after the musician called the president “incompetent and treasonous” at his 2025 European tour kick-off.


	Such biting words from such a famous and revered rockstar unsurprisingly got under the skin of the president, even as he's in the middle of a trip through the Middle East and planning to accept $400 million luxury jets from Qatar. He fired off a Truth Social post Friday morning calling Springsteen “Highly Overrated” and “not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK.”


	Trump proceeded to lash out at Springsteen for his support of former president Joe Biden, calling the musician “dumb as a rock,” and a “dried out ‘prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!).” The president also seemed particularly fixated on the fact that Springsteen made his comments abroad, and closed his message with the simultaneously outlandish, but also disconcertingly ominous (in light of well, everything) claim that Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just ‘standard fare.' Then we'll all see how it goes for him!”

	Springsteen has, of course, criticized Trump plenty of times on American soil. In a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, Springsteen called Trump a “moron,” and at a 2024 campaign rally for Kamala Harris, he called Trump an “American tyrant.” At his recent tour opener in England, Springsteen said the U.S. was “in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration.”


	Later in the show, before playing “My City of Ruins,” Springsteen added, “A majority of our elected representatives have failed to protect the American people from the abuses of an unfit president and a rogue government. They have no concern or idea of what it means to be deeply American. The America l've sung to you about for 50 years is real, and, regardless of its faults, is a great country with a great people. So we'll survive this moment. Now, I have hope, because I believe in the truth of what the great American writer James Baldwin said, he said, ‘In this world there isn't as much humanity as one would like, but there's enough.'”

	When Bono hits the road for a tour, he usually brings along about 200 trucks, a stage that weighs roughly 170 tons, hundreds of employees, and three high-school buddies named Adam, Larry, and Edge. But when he went out in early 2023 to promote his memoir, Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story, he brought little else besides a table and chairs, a fake beer, and a keyboardist, cellist, and harp player.


	The shows were a unique hybrid of rock concert and one-man Broadway-style production in which Bono paid loving tribute to his wife, Ali Hewson, his three bandmates, and his late father, Paul Hewson, pausing often to perform U2 classics like “Where the Streets Have No Name,” “With or Without You” and “I Will Follow” in radically stripped-down fashion.


	The tour only hit a handful of markets around the world, and never played to anything larger than a theater, so the vast majority of U2 fans had no ability to experience it. That's finally changing on May 30 when the film Bono: Stories of Surrender lands on Apple TV+. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival earlier in the month.

	











	In the middle of a very busy press day at Cannes, we had 18 minutes with Bono to chat about putting together his first solo show, the new documentary, the status of U2's long-awaited new album, and the health of drummer Larry Mullen Jr., who missed out on the band's recent Sphere residency to recover from an injury.

Most book tours, even for really high-profile ones, are just a series of public interviews and readings. What made you want to do something so radically different?You've put your finger on it. The stage play came out of a desire to not be on a promotional book tour, and to keep my own interest in it. I didn't know I could do it. And to become other people was a bit of a holiday for myself, number one. But then to play my father with the turn of my neck, turn of my head…to play Luciano Pavarotti was quite the challenge. And then I turned our rock & roll band into three chairs and a table.

You're accustomed to a pretty big stage, a pretty big production budget, and all sorts of props. This time around, you had very little. It must have forced you to get creative considering those limitations.That's right. There's maximalism of the U2 show in every which way to this table and chairs. If I wasn't Irish, it would be pretentious to talk about Krapp's Last Tape and Samuel Beckett. But there's a simplicity that I enjoyed learning, or relearning, you might say, because in our early days, the sort of fireworks were just the mood you were in. The pyro was jumping into a crowd, and all that excitement that that would cause. I started to get into gestures and understanding how powerful a simple gesture could be. A movement of the hand. A turn of the head. Staring at a single person in the crowd.

	











Going back to your teenage years, you've never really done a full concert without the other guys in U2. Did you have any trepidation about going onstage on your own?I was terrified. But I seem to enjoy that. My drug of choice is putting myself in a place where I'm not comfortable because I feel I learn the more when I'm there. And I also am a student of performers who wish to break the fourth wall. Iggy Pop, for me, was just a master. He's a master of unpredictability. Spontaneity. A master of stepping inside a song, and becoming the song.


	But then there were actors like Mark Rylance. I went to see Mark Rylance in [the play] Jerusalem. I couldn't believe it. And I felt this confrontational performer.


	Patti Smith. You see it in her. She isn't comfortable on an elevated stage. One show I saw Patti Smith Group, and she entered from behind, fought her way, elbowed her way, through the crowd. And got up on stage. What an entrance.

	I tried it in reverse in my twenties. But I like those performers that you feel could break through the fourth wall, could sit on your lap, could bite you, could rob you, could mug you, could make love with you, could chase you down the street, could break your heart. I wanted to see if I could be that kind of a performer.


Did you see Bruce on Broadway or any other recent one-man shows to get some inspiration for how to do this?I saw Bruce on Broadway. I mean, every time I see Bruce, it changes my life in some way. The opera, for instance. He's Irish-Italian. He gives you the permission to go to the opera. “Jungleland.” That's an opera right there. I saw him twice on Broadway, and I knew I'd better come up with something different because I couldn't touch that. I just tried to create these different characters and play them.


You're backed by keyboardist Jacknife Lee, cellist Kate Ellis, and harp player Gemma Doherty during the show. How did they help you reshape the songs and approach your music in a different way?Jackknife is a bit of a genius. Edge is in awe of his arrangements. Only Edge, by the way, wouldn't be thinking, “Where's the guitar in this?” Edge just doesn't think like that. He's just like, “Wow. That's another feeling that the song now has.”


	I got the privilege to sing “Sunday Bloody Sunday” to [Doherty] from Derry who was a child of the peace process. She's from that town. She's playing the harp, and she's an innovator. She's got a bit of a punk spirit, too. And so she's adding distortion to the harp, and she's a great singer.

	











	That version of “Sunday Bloody Sunday”…I'm scared I'll never reach it again because it just took me somewhere else. I felt like Nina Simone walked through the room, and I was like, “Wow.” Kate Ellis, I think it's Philip Glass who said this is one of the most astonishing cellists he'd ever worked with. I was surrounded by greatness.


	But I still have this random thing before I go onstage. I can be really easy and walk onstage and feel confident about the night and look forward to it, or I want to throw up in the bathroom. I don't seem to be on top of that, even in my sixties. And when I get a break, which is coming up apparently in the next few months, I might need to go and see a shrink. I might need to lay down on that couch. But I suppose the audience is the shrink here. I mean, if I think about it, that's what I do.


The show is a tribute to your father in a lot of ways. Did you do that to pay him back for everything he did for you?Certainly. I think I wanted to get closer to him, and I ended up doing just that. Well, he ended up the star of the show. He had the better lines. It made me laugh. And playing him night after night…and then just those put-downs. And I'm saying, “You know Pavarotti rang the house, and he's looking for a song?” “Did he ring the wrong number?” He was funny. I understand him better.


	Your old editor, Jann Wenner, sent me on this road. He was the one 20 years ago, after one of those Herculean interviews you do with Rolling Stone where you guys put us through our paces, and it was days that felt like weeks and weeks that felt like days. And eventually he said, “I think you owe your father an apology.” And I was like, “What? I've just been telling you how difficult he was.” He said, “No, no, you've just been telling me how difficult you were.” When I apologized to my father, it changed a lot for me. Unfortunately, he wasn't around.


You literally speak in his voice, sit in his chair, become him onstage. That's a pretty powerful thing. I'm sure it was cathartic.I don't know enough about the theater to know if this has been done before, but maybe I should put a health warning on it. I'm not sure we're covered. But you know what? There was a part of me that was just more concerned that people just laugh at my jokes.


	Do we trust people who aren't funny anymore? I'm not sure. And people don't come to U2 shows for belly laughs. But I've never been in a great conversation that hasn't had one.


Andrew Dominik is the director of the movie. What approach did you want him to take in capturing this show?He made a movie called Chopper, and it's one of my favorite films. And it starred Eric Bana when Eric Bana was a comedian. Not the Eric Bana that we know now. Clearly, he was great at working with non-actors. He worked with Nick Cave, so I knew he understood music.

	











	I'd met him and liked him. We shared social circles. He makes my wife laugh out loud quite a lot. He has actual deafness and some convenient deafness. When we'd be discussing a scene or whatever, if he didn't like what I was saying, he'd be like, “I can't hear you, mate.” But I'm grateful to him. I'm so grateful to him because he got those performances out of me. I don't know how he did that. And his lighting. And with Erik Messerschmidt as his DP and a whole host of other brilliant people around us, we got this thing.


	It doesn't look like we just came to record that show. He said, “Look, it's another art form, Bono. And you'll have to let me take it into a different place.” I said, “Well, I just want the stage show.” “You have to let me take it into another place.” And I don't know if it ever got to the place he wanted me to go, but I'm very proud of the work we did together.


The last album of new U2 songs was eight years ago. It's the longest gap ever between albums. The fans are getting restless. What can you tell them to keep their spirits up?Well, they're right. And nostalgia is not to be tolerated for too long, but sometimes you've got to deal with the past in order to get to the future and to the present. To get back to now is our desire. Get back to this moment we're in. We've been recording. And it sounds like future to me. We had to go through some stuff, and we're at the other end of it.


How is Larry doing? Is he playing with you guys in the studio?We've been playing in the room together, the four of us. And I can tell you he is completely through whatever storm of injury he's been through. His playing is at its most innovative. He's just all about the band. He doesn't want to talk about anything else, which is kind of amazing. 


	By the way, being a band in a room where each individual musician has a role that's singular and collective is so rare because music is assembled these days. And even some of our music we have assembled, and we'll do that again, but to try and capture a moment of a rock & roll band in full flight is at the heart of this record that we're making that we've recorded, but we are not finished.

I'm getting the hook here, so I'll end with a question about Pop. The 30 year anniversary is coming up. Will we get a Pop 30 box set?Well, I never thought about that. Actually, I'm sure somebody clever has thought of that. But if they have, I'm not aware of it. And the film of the PopMart tour in Mexico is one of the most extraordinary U2 shows ever. I love the imagery around that album. And the only thing that album wasn't was pop.

A bet-the-company lawsuit filed by Village Roadshow against the studio ultimately helped bankrupt the financier, which was found to have breached a series of deals over 'The Matrix' films. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	When it filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, Village Roadshow pointed to the souring of its longtime partnership with Warner Bros. for its financial woes. At the heart of the falling out that was years in the making: A legal battle over the studio's decision to release Matrix Resurrections simultaneously on HBO Max and in theaters, eating away at box office returns.


	That lawsuit went dark shortly after it was filed, with a judge moving it to arbitration.




	A year later, an arbitrator found in favor of WBD and awarded the studio roughly $125 million, The Hollywood Reporter has learned of the previously unreported figure. It was found in 2023 that Village Roadshow breached a series of deals involving the Matrix films by failing to pay its $107 million share of the cofinancing arrangement, according to a person familiar with the situation who was granted anonymity because the matter is confidential. The debt remains unpaid.

	In March, Village Roadshow filed for bankruptcy protection. The move from the company — once one of the most prolific behind-the-scenes financiers in Hollywood that backed The Matrix and Ocean's franchises — came after a costly endeavor aimed at creating content in-house and the 2022 lawsuit, which “irreparably decimated the working relationship” with WBD, wrote Village Roadshow chief restructuring officer Keith Maib in a court document. Matrix Resurrections wasn't the only film at issue in that legal battle. Village Roadshow alleged that it was shut out of cofinancing sequels and remakes to key franchises based on movies it shares the rights to with WBD, including Wonka, Joker and I Am Legend.


	One example that predated the Matrix feud: Village Roadshow wanted in on a TV series that was being developing based on Edge of Tomorrow but was told the project wouldn't move forward if it didn't relinquish its rights, according to court filings. WBD ended up abandoning the show.


	Responding to claims over The Matrix Resurrections, WBD maintained in public statements and court filings that it offered Village Roadshow the opportunity to cofinance the film, which was accepted. The financier later refused to pay its share on the movie, which cost roughly $200 million to make and $100 million to market, according to a court document. WBD prevailed on claims Village Roadshow advanced for unfair competition, breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which covers bad faith dealings, said the person familiar with the arbitration.

	











	An arbitrator sided with WBD that Village Roadshow breached the co-ownership and distribution agreements, added the person, who confirmed that the studio was awarded over $107 million in damages plus $17 million in interest.


	That ruling has been confirmed on appeal, though damages will be recalculated to account for a would-be day-and-date license for the movie and other distribution revenues that WBD had already received and would've had to pay, according to a court document. The studio remains confident that the award will stand, a source says. Interest on the outstanding co-financing obligation has ballooned to nearly $32 million.


	Village Roadshow incurred over $18 million in legal fees over the course of the litigation, while WBD spent roughly $8 million across arbitrations related to the Matrix sequel and Wonka, which involve allegations that the studio refused to recognize the financier's rights to partner on the movie by claiming that it's not a prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory — a film co-owned by the two sides, per the court document. 


	The studio is looking to collect on the debt as Village Roadshow looks to sell most of its assets. Last month, the court approved a $417.5 million offer from Blade Runner 2049 producer Alcon Media Group for Village Roadshow's film library, including stakes in The Matrix and Ocean's franchises. The stalking horse bid, which sets a price floor for the assets, will be tested at auction. Rival offers, including from Warner Bros. Discovery and investment firm Content Partners, may still surface ahead of the deadline May 16.

	











	Also up for sale: the derivative rights to proven tentpoles, among other movies, and Village Roadshow's studio business. Since 2018, the company has had 99 feature films and 233 television series in development, though only six movies and seven television shows went into production at a price tag of $47.5 million. None of them were able to turn a profit indicating sustainability of the endeavor aimed at creating content in-house.


	WBD and Village Roadshow declined to comment for this story.

Filmmaker Oliver Laxe brings a kind of humbling brilliance to “Sirât,” his inaugural Cannes competition entry, after catching attention in sidebars for his previous films. It's the kind of film that Cannes attendees from far and wide come to the festival for: sui generis and evading any classification, emanating from a wholly personal vision of cinema while not resisting galvanizing, and sometimes crowd-pleasing, pleasures.

Born in France to Galician parents, and shooting the majority of his work to date in Morocco, Laxe's work operates in the interstices of borders and cultures, but wholly bypasses appropriation. It's always visually transportive and grimly sublime, focusing on simple plots and conflicts that provide ample space for philosophical and existential contemplation. And “Sirât” is undoubtedly his most fully realized work in his regard, notable too for folding in the visceral pleasures of contemporary genre and even blockbuster cinema.

The world Laxe creates is finely rendered in both the fore- and background, revealing much greater scope than its initial set-up lets on. Luis (Sergi López, in another powerful performance) is another variety of a recurrent character in cinema and television now: the stricken father, forced to bring his emotions further to the surface than he's typically comfortable with, and responding in disbelief to his offspring's opposing values. 

His teenage daughter Mar left five months ago for the Moroccan Sahara's illegal rave parties — and never returned. With no online communication, and little sense of her ultimate whereabouts or intentions, Luis and his young son Esteban (Brúno Nuñez) travel there themselves. Laxe soon gets in his first of many effective, incongruous fissures, as these remnants of a domestic family amble around a score of pilled and tatted-up partiers, the sub-bass and steady 4/4 house music kick pushing tension into the red.

Pragmatically enough, after showing photos of Mar to a raver couple called Jade and Bigui (Jade Oukid and Richard Bellamy, playing version of themselves, like the majority of the cast beyond López), they mention she could be at a future party located south of where they are. They decide to join forces and navigate there together, and we allow Laxe another common modern auteur strategy: finally dropping the  title card once the first act is well underway.

 










But what quashes that opening rave introduces one of the film's most fascinating elements. A large convoy of military vehicles drive into the vicinity, and while there's little threat of violence or confrontation between the two parties, something catches our attention when a soldier wants to take the “EU citizens” present into custody. As the drive begins, the radio mentions civilians massed at national borders, and statements from the NATO Secretary General. 

It's an alternate present or near-future, and the world is collapsing; suddenly, we understand the rationale of why Mar, and later her family, can disperse from where they permanently lived. Morocco emerges as an “interzone,” like William S. Burroughs famously characterized it in “Naked Lunch,” where European, African, Middle Eastern nationalities, as well as Islamic (the film's title derives from the religion's name for the bridge between hell and paradise), Christian and New Age (to cite the ravers) customs can commingle. 

Upon his film's very tactile and material basis, we can project any intelligent guess for backstory, yet it's one of the best examples of the “anti-psychological” approach that experimental filmmakers such as Laxe (alongside Albert Serra and Yuri Ancarani) have been chasing over the past decade, with reference to their portrayal of bodies and landscapes.

 










With another band of travelers — Stef, Josh and Tonin, the latter of whom has lost part of his right arm — in tow, the screenplay by Laxe and Santiago Fillol seems to lay out a plausible Point B to its a Point A: the potential reuniting of the family at the final rave in a sentimental, but satisfying catharsis. The ensuing first hour almost seems like a problem-solving “adventure” film, with petrol to be bartered for and solutions found to traversing unsteady rocks and bodies of water. 

Laxe, I'm sure, would be flattered by comparisons to “The Searchers” and the Mad Max series. Yet a shattering tragedy at around the film's mid-point upsets that trajectory entirely, as their convoy of cars become stationary, and confrontations with mortality must be sought.

To expand on the very “material” nature of this film, it never concedes to any scenes of now-routine psychedelic disorientation; Laxe and his ace cinematographer Mauro Herce are confident their mere photography of the space will burrow us into the characters' emotions and appreciation for the area's splendor, and also promise transcendence. 

Even if it shows civilization as we once knew it to be now perishing, the film pays tribute to contemporary leftist currents in imagining what a utopia after capitalism might look like. Collectivity could be our ultimate destiny: the community ritual of bodies attached to sublime music (and electronic dance music is more beautiful than many skeptics realize), the dispensability of the nuclear family in a world of greater co-operative labor and nurturing. Such hopes can seem strident or naive in the world where the majority of us live, but Laxe's true achievement in this film is magicking a scenario where their realization isn't just possible, but necessary.

 










“Sirât” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou solidified A24's signature horror reign with 2022's twisted and evil-spirits-summoning “Talk to Me,” about a party game gone horrifyingly awry for a group of teen friends. They've upped the stakes with a more gruesomely disturbing but seriously, conceptually half-baked new thriller, “Bring Her Back,” in which Sally Hawkins is psychotically good and in an unhinged, manically grieving form we've never seen her in.

The British “Happy-Go-Lucky” and “Shape of Water” actress ever brings a touch of whimsy or furtive sadness to her roles, often as a woman with a secret. In “Bring Her Back,” her secrets are overwhelming every cell in her being as a foster mom, Laura, who is seriously unwell and taking desperate measures to resurrect the spirit of her own biological dead daughter — and in the flesh of one of the two foster children she's inherited. Despite Hawkins' commitment to the bit, however, Laura is a cartoonish villain that makes identifying with or even understanding her grievous plight — there is no word in the English language for a person who's lost a child, after all — a steep challenge.

In that sense, call A24's latest scary offering another entry in the genre of grief-house horror, movies that use genre tropes into a quote-unquote deeper exploration of trauma and pain. But that in itself is becoming a tired trope, one that the Philippou brothers, despite considerable skill behind the camera and especially in directing young children, mined already with “Talk to Me.”

Piper (Sora Wong) and Andy (Billy Barratt) are a codependent sister and brother — she's also blind and mocked for her amblyopia by classmates, and in need of his constant physical and emotional support. They've just lost their father, who drops dead in the shower for reasons that may or may not eventually have to do with both the kids' no-longer-with-us mother and the burdens that come with raising them. “Bring Her Back,” with some memorably harrowing images courtesy of cinematographer Aaron McLisky, reminds a shadow or so of another A24 horror movie, Ari Aster's “Midsommar,” in its chilling sequences of familial bodily maiming that become a motif that terrorizes the protagonists in the present.

 










They're shoved into the foster care system, and into the woods-ensconced home of care worker Laura, who already lives with a seriously disturbed child in the form of Oliver (Jonah Wren Phillips), a mute with the vacant cough-drop-eye stare of someone who's seen something very awful but has been deprived of the words or ability to speak of it.

Things get seriously creepy when Laura is dressed, uh, very casually (and honestly rather chicly in oversized sunglasses) at Piper and Andy's father's funeral and she forces Andy to kiss the corpse. “It's a tradition,” but it's also obviously the start of a witchy spell that is also somehow related to the snuff movies lying around Laura's house on VHS in which an obese or pregnant naked man is seen encircling a naked young woman who is terrified out of her mind. As if the taxidermized pet dog weren't weird enough, or the fact that Laura gets absolutely shitfaced with the kids to pry more secrets out of them to harness her power, or something.

The mythology of “Bring Her Back” is dizzyingly unclear and patched-together from what feel like studio notes commissioning both over-explication and also less of it, as if ambiguity alone can pass for scares. But the emotions and the performances in the present day are there, especially from Barratt, who thinks he's experiencing his own sort of post-grief psychosis when he wakes up in bed every morning covered in his own piss.

 










What starts to come into view is that Laura had a daughter who looks suspiciously like Piper, and that perhaps Laura has tried this trick before on Oliver, who can't leave the premises without having a grand mal seizure. It has something to do with the chalk outline surrounding the house, the familiar iconography of the occult even though the movie begins literally with the words “this is not a cult.”

Eventually, Billy tries to warn the foster care headquarters, managed by a kindly woman named Wendy (Sally-Anne Upton), that Laura is trying to sabotage Billy. There's a grimly hilarious moment when Wendy shows up for a wellness check and Laura claims that Piper didn't want to change a thing about her dead daughter's original bedroom decorations. 

“You're lucky the child is blind,” Wendy says, which in a sense also applies to the filmmakers, who've contrived Piper's blindness merely as a device to advance certain set pieces at the film's end. That's no knock against the turn from Wong, who eventually gets the best audience-cheer-eliciting moment in a film that otherwise induces eyerolls with regards to how Laura keeps getting away with her cartoon-villain behavior.

You want to throttle this woman, which is the point, but it makes “Bring Her Back” into a taxing experience. Except not taxing emotionally, where it should count, as despite the Philippous' flair for craft, they here don't quite connect the dots from horror movie that features grief to a horror movie that's truly about grief. And grief is becoming as shopworn an old horror yarn as trauma once was; I think we finally put that one to rest.

 










“Bring Her Back” opens in theaters from A24 on Friday, May 30.

Tilda Swinton is set to lead another literary adaptation: Ottessa Moshfegh‘s psychological thriller “Death in Her Hands,” with auteur David Lowery directing. Swinton, who most recently led Pedro Almodóvar's English feature debut “The Room Next Door,” will star as widow Vesta Gul, who may or may not have stumbled upon a crime scene. The character finds a handwritten note while walking in the woods, with the letter reading, “Her name was Magda. Nobody will ever know who killed her. It wasn't me. Here is her dead body.” Yet without a corpse in sight, recluse Vesta becomes obsessed with solving the would-be murder. 

 










The book's official synopsis reads, “As her inner world begins to eclipse reality, the mystery of Magda threatens Vesta's grip on her own life — until, in a spellbinding operatic climax, we realize that Magda's death may finally allow Vesta to live.” The novel was published in 2000.

Lowery will adapt the novel for the screen, with See-Saw Films producing. Iain Canning, Emile Sherman, and Jeanie Igoe are producing, with the executive producers including Simon Gillis and Ann Phillips. See-Saw's sales division Cross City Films and WME Independent are set to secure financing for the feature at Cannes.

“I am a devoted fan of Ottessa Moshfegh, and the opportunity to translate ‘Death in Her Hands' to the big screen has been, in some ways, a subterfuge for getting to spend a great deal of time obsessing over her prose. But now the ruse is up!,” Lowery said in a press statement. “The script begot by the novel will soon become a film, and I am suddenly aware more than ever that adapting this particular work represents a devious challenge (anyone who's read the novel will understand why)! But I'm ready for it, and am emboldened to have such wonderful collaborators at my side: the whole team at See-Saw, Jeanie, and of course, the incredible Tilda Swinton, who I know will illuminate Ottessa's story in ways I could only dream of.”

Producers Canning and Sherman added, “David Lowery is a master of crafting striking, atmospheric stories, and there's no one better to bring Ottessa Moshfegh's haunting and brilliant novel to the screen. We can't wait for audiences to step into the world he creates and be swept away by Vesta's story, played by the incomparable, magnetic, and endlessly compelling Tilda Swinton.”

 










Lowery next has “Mother Mary” in the works starring Anne Hathaway, which is currently in post-production. “Death in Her Hands” isn't the only Moshfegh adaptation in the works: Author Moshfegh, who also collaborated with Hathaway for her adaptation of “Eileen,” told IndieWire that she hand-selects who will adapt her work for the screen.

“I wouldn't just sign the rights over to a novel to anyone,” she said. “There are people who have some doings around other IPs. I trust them, but that isn't to say I'm not good at detachment. I don't actually want to control other people's work. An adaptation is just an adaptation. It's not supposed to be a carbon copy. That's impossible. It's a reinterpretation, it's a translation, and it's a really creative process.”

Moshfegh added at the time that the adaptation of “My Year of Rest and Relaxation,” to which LuckyChap optioned the rights to in 2018 and Yorgos Lanthimos was rumored to be attached to direct, is still  “underway.” No director has been announced yet. “I have no idea about the timeline on that, but hopefully sometime,” “Causeway” screenwriter Moshfegh said in 2023.

Charlie Polinger's directorial debut, also featuring Everett Blunck and newcomer Kayo Martin, observes a young boy trying to fit in at a summer water polo camp. 


							By 

	Lovia Gyarkye


Arts & Culture Critic


Charlie Polinger opens his thrilling and uneasy directorial debut feature The Plague with an arresting sequence that quickly establishes the haunting undertones of this adolescent psychological thriller. The ambient, muffled sound of sloshing water is set against a shot of the bottom of a pool. One by one, swimmers drop into the massive indoor basin. Their spindly legs move awkwardly as they try to get in sync. It's 2003, and these are the middle-school-aged attendees of the Tom Lerner Water Polo camp. From this angle, Polinger and his cinematographer Steven Breckon make these kids look like phantasmic figures.

	An eerie sense of unreality runs through The Plague, which premiered at Cannes in the Un Certain Regard sidebar. Working from a screenplay he also wrote, Polinger uses horror conventions to tease out the psychic terror and intimidation of pre-teen social codes. In the age of renewed questions about and considerations of the manosphere, The Plague is a prescient title. Polinger's film is not as dark as Netflix's popular miniseries Adolescence, but it does circle similarly unsettling themes — like the way the terms and tenets of masculinity are dictated by arbitrary rules, or the cost of nonconformity among young men.

The Bottom Line

	
	A haunting story of boyhood as nightmare.
	



Venue: Cannes Film Festival (Un Certain Regard)Cast: Joel Edgerton, Everett Blunck, Kayo Martin, Kenny RasmussenDirector-screenwriter: Charlie Polinger

								1 hour 38 minutes			






	Key performances carry The Plague and alleviate the occasional strain of overwrought direction. Relative newcomers Everett Blunck (stellar in Griffin in the Summer) and Kayo Martin portray opposite ends of youthful angst with an engaging sincerity and terrifying accuracy. Martin, with the subtlety of his judging expressions, seems especially made for his role as Jake, the resident cool kid who weaponizes his sharp attention to detail. The actor plays well against Blunck, who portrays Ben, a new camper trying to figure out where he fits among the various cliques. An anxiety-inducing sound design (by Damian Volpe) and score (by Johan Lenox), coupled with an appropriately icy visual palette built on grays and blue, help tell Polinger's nail-biting story. 


	When Ben (Blunck) arrives at the water polo camp, he quickly notices the hold that Jake (Martin) has on the other boys. The teen with the mess of blonde hair functions as a ring leader and, with his approval, Ben becomes part of the crew. The other boys call Ben, who just moved from Boston, “Soppy” on account of the fact that he garbles the “t” in the word “stop.” One thing Polinger makes clear early on is how closely Jake scrutinizes the other boys — noticing minor characteristics that differentiate them from one another — and uses those observations to mock them. This skill keeps Jake in power, making him an intimidating person to everyone, including the boys' coach Daddy Wags (Joel Edgerton, in a brief but effective turn).

	











	Ben watches the others too, and he quickly picks up that no one hangs out with Eli (Kenny Rasmussen, also excellent). The quiet child keeps mostly to himself, eating lunch in the locker room and occasionally sleeping there too. According to the other kids, Eli has the plague, a vague disease that allegedly begins with a rash and renders the infected unable to socially function. Jake warns Ben to stay away from Eli and to wash his body should he accidentally get too close. In a clever move, Polinger never establishes if the plague is real because even if it isn't, the fear it sows is. 


	The remainder of The Plague follows Ben as he tries to reconcile social acceptance with his own moral code. He understands that people shouldn't be exiled for their differences and yet the idea of losing his place within the hierarchy keeps him up at night. Blunck deftly portrays Ben's inner turmoil and the anxiety his journey produces. 


	Polinger deploys jump scares, intimate close-ups (especially of Jake and Ben staring at one another) and elements of body horror to recast these coming-of-age dilemmas as high-stakes, nightmarish challenges. When the director widens his scope, to survey the broader social behaviors on display, The Plague adopts a primal urgency and the film possesses the feverish energy of William Golding's Lord of the Flies or Claire Denis' Beau Travail. In one of those scenes Polinger observes the boys during lunch, excitedly speaking over each other and laughing. The camera ominously cuts (editing is by Henry Hayes) between views of the group and the faces of individual campers. For the most part, they are children having a good time, but if you look closely you can see a flash of panic beneath the cheerful visages.

And his character is kind of a big deal.

[This story contains spoilers for the season four finale of Power Book III: Raising Kanan.]


Power Book III: Raising Kanan season four just came to a close, but the previously announced season five is around the corner. To that end, we've got some good news and some bad news.




	The good: Shameik Moore has been cast as Branford “Breeze” Frady. The fans have been waiting on that one. 


	The bad: Power Book III: Raising Kanan season five will be its last.

	OK maybe it's not so bad; showrunner Sascha Penn says this was “always” his “intention.”

	











	“It was always my intention that Raising Kanan would run for five seasons, and thanks to my friends and partners at Starz and Lionsgate, as well as the incredible cast, crew and writing staff, I've been able to tell the entirety of the story I set out to tell way back in 2019,” Penn said. “Having said that, with the table we've set in this season finale and the inevitable introduction of Breeze, there is still an exceptionally intense and action-packed season left for the viewers to experience, and I assure you that the stakes for Kanan and the entire Thomas family have never been higher.”


	“I'm very proud of this series,” he continued, “and grateful that we've been able to see it through to what is an incredibly explosive and satisfying conclusion for the unbelievably loyal fans of the Power Universe.”


	Moore is pretty excited for it too.


	“The Power Universe fans have been patiently anticipating this moment and I'm honored to step into the iconic role of Breeze,” he said in a statement. “I jumped into a story that is already alive with such strong characters, but it was a fun challenge to find Breeze's unique identity, and I can't wait for fans to see how Breeze will shift dynamics in the story. It's gonna be a wild ride.”


	The name of Moore's character, a drug kingpin from Jamaica, Queens, has been out there in said Power universe since the very first season of the OG Power back in 2014. We learned back then that a young Kanan Stark worked for the mysterious Breeze, as did James “Ghost” St. Patrick (Omari Hardwick) and Tommy Egan (Joseph Sikora). Well, in the season four finale of prequel series Raising Kanan, our young Kanan (MeKai Curtis) finally meets Breeze through street legends (and Kanan's aunt and uncle) Snaps (Wendell Pierce) and Pop (Erika Woods).

	











	Season four of Raising Kanan found Kanan reluctantly entering into a truce with his mother, drug queenpin Raquel “Raq” Thomas (Patina Miller). (Miller and Penn spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the shocking season four ending and what it means for season five.)


	“With Unique (Joey Bada$$) back from the dead and pulling strings from the shadows, the hesitant trust between mother and son didn't last long, and their volatile relationship was tested once again, leading to another dramatic showdown in the season finale,” in Starz's words.


	In addition to Miller, Curtis, Bada$$, Pierce and Woods, Power Book III: Raising Kanan stars London Brown, Malcolm Mays, Hailey Kilgore and Tony Danza. 


Power Book III: Raising Kanan is the second Power spinoff, behind only Power Book II: Ghost. Courtney A. Kemp created the original Power with Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson and Mark Canton. Along with those three, Chris Selak and Kevin Fox also serve as executive producers on the franchise. Lionsgate Television produces Power Book III: Raising Kanan for Starz.

The Weeknd says Tom Cruise did him a solid with the actor's lip-sync performance of “Can't Feel My Face,” the singer says during his first-ever interview on The Tonight Show Thursday (May 15) in an exclusive Billboard preview clip.


	Host Jimmy Fallon told The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye) one of the first times his late-night talk show used one of his songs was in 2015 during a Lip Sync Battle segment featuring Cruise, who praised the singer as being “enormously talented” before launching into his performance of “Can't Feel My Face.” 

	











	“I definitely saw that. It actually helped the song,” said The Weeknd. “It helped it peak to the record-breaking top, thanks to him obviously.” “Can't Feel My Face,” the third single from his sophomore album Beauty Behind the Madness, became his first No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 a decade ago.

	The Weeknd's full Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon interview — his first sit-down late-night interview — airs in full tonight at 11:35 p.m. ET on NBC, and streaming on Peacock. The Weeknd is promoting his upcoming feature film Hurry Up Tomorrow, based on his album of the same name, out in theaters on Friday.

Following months of speculation, Deadline has confirmed that Academy Award-nominee Ana de Armas (Ballerina; No Time to Die; Knives Out) has indeed signed on to star opposite Tom Cruise (Mission: Impossible; Top Gun: Maverick; Edge of Tomorrow) in his upcoming undersea supernatural thriller Deeper. 

Plot details are buried deep, but the promising feature follows an astronaut who encounters a terrifying force while on a deep dive into a never-before-explored trench. 

The film, which has been in the works for nearly a decade, will be helmed by Doug Liman, who previously worked with Cruise on Edge of Tomorrow and American Made, both of which were critical and commercial successes. 

Cruise and de Armas have been photographed together at multiple events this past year, which has sparked dating rumors, but DHD claims the pair are currently undergoing the extensive diving training required for the project. 

Deeper is based off a Max Landis spec that was sold to MGM in 2016, but Cruise's most trusted collaborator Christopher McQuarrie is now handling scripting duties, so it's likely the screenplay has undergone some drastic changes. 

At the moment, it's unclear which studio will ultimately pick up the film, as Cruise is currently shopping it around after Warner Bros. determined that its estimated $200 million production budget was too high for them.

However, things seem to be trending in the right direction, especially now that both Cruise and de Armas are expected to be major winners at the summer box office. Cruise's Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is tracking for a five-day launch north of $70 million domestically over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, while Ana de Armas' Ballerina is projected for a $40 million opening two weekends later. 

Cruise and McQuarrie are also still developing their space film, working alongside NASA and SpaceX to make it happen, but it's believed Cruise is keen on making Deeper first before rocketing off into the final frontier. 

With The Final Reckoning due out next week, Cruise's next project will be an untitled film with 4x Academy Award-winner Alejandro G. Iñárritu, which wrapped filming on May 3 after a six-month shoot. He'll co-star with Sandra Hüller, John Goodman, Michael Stuhlbarg, Jesse Plemons, Sophie Wilde, Riz Ahmed, Emma D'Arcy, Pip Torrens, Corey Johnson, Danny Kirrane, and Joe Hurst. 

The highly anticipated Cruise/Iñárritu film is slated to hit theaters October 2, 2026 - having taken over the slot previously held by The Batman Part II, which moved to 2027.

More than 60 years ago, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) officially began with Project Ozma at the Greenbank Observatory in West Bank, Virginia. Led by famed astronomer Frank Drake (who coined the Drake Equation), this survey used the observatory's 25-meter (82-foot) dish to monitor Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti—two nearby sun-like stars—between April and July of 1960. Since then, multiple surveys have been conducted at different wavelengths to search for indications of technological activity (aka "technosignatures") around other stars.

While no conclusive evidence has been found that indicates the presence of an advanced civilization, there have been many cases where scientists could not rule out the possibility. In a recent paper, veteran NASA scientist Richard H. Stanton describes the results of his multi-year survey of more than 1,300 sun-like stars for optical SETI signals. As he indicates, this survey revealed two fast identical pulses from a sun-like star about 100 light-years from Earth that match similar pulses from a different star observed four years ago.

Dr. Stanton is a veteran of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), whose work includes participating in the Voyager missions and serving as the Engineering Manager of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. Since retiring, he has dedicated himself to the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) using the 76.2-cm (30-inch) telescope at the Shay Meadow Observatory in Big Bear, California, and a multi-channel photometer he designed. The paper describing his survey's findings is published in the journal Acta Astronautica.

For years, Stanton has used these instruments to observe more than 1,300 sun-like stars for optical SETI signals. Unlike traditional SETI surveys that have used radio antennas to search for evidence of potential extraterrestrial transmissions, optical SETI looks for pulses of light that could result from laser communications or directed-energy arrays. This latter example has been considered in recent years thanks to Project Starshot, NASA's Directed Energy Propulsion for Interstellar Exploration (DEEP-IN) concept, and similar interstellar mission concepts.

As Stanton indicated, the field of optical SETI traces its roots to a 1961 study by Schwartz and Townes. They reasoned that the best way an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) could send an optical signal that outshone their star would be with intense nanosecond laser pulses. Other optical SETI searches look for signals in infrared wavelengths, high-resolution spectra, or visible light. As Stanton related to Universe Today via email, his SETI search differs from conventional optical surveys:

"My approach is to stare at a single star for roughly 1 hour using photon counting to sample the star's light at what is considered a very high time-resolution for astronomy (100 microsecond samples). The resulting time series are then searched for pulses and optical tones. The instrument uses readily available off-the-shelf components that can be assembled into a PC-based system. I'm not sure if anyone else is doing this with a significant time commitment. I am not aware of any discovery of similar pulses."

After years of searching, Stanton noted an unexpected "signal" on May 14th, 2023, while observing HD 89389, an F-type star slightly brighter and more massive than our sun, located in the constellation Ursa Major. According to Stanton's paper, this signal consisted of two fast, identical pulses 4.4 seconds apart that were not revealed in previous searches. He then ran comparisons against signals produced by airplanes, satellites, meteors, lightning, atmospheric scintillation, system noise, etc.

As he explained, several things about the pulses detected around HD 89389 made them unique from anything seen previously:

"A. The star gets brighter-fainter-brighter and then returns to its ambient level, all in about 0.2s. This variation is much too strong to be caused by random noise or atmospheric turbulence. How do you make a star, over a million kilometers across, partially disappear in a tenth of a second? The source of this variation can't be as far away as the star itself.

"B. In all three events, two essentially identical pulses are seen, separated by between 1.2 and 4.4 seconds (the third event, found in an observation on January 18th of this year, was not included in the paper). In over 1500 hours of searching, no single pulse resembling these has ever been detected.

"C. The fine structure in the star's light between the peaks of the first pulse repeats almost exactly in the second pulse 4.4s later. No one knows how to explain this behavior.

"D. Nothing was detected moving near the star in simultaneous photography or in the background sensor that easily detects distant satellites moving close to a target star. Common signals from airplanes, satellites, meteors, birds, etc., are completely different from these pulses."

A re-examination of historical data for similar signals revealed another pair of pulses detected around HD 217014 (51 Pegasi) on September 30th, 2019. This main-sequence G-type star is located about 50.6 light-years from Earth and is similar in size, mass, and age to our sun. In 1995, astronomers at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence detected an exoplanet orbiting this star, a hot gas giant that has since been named Dimidium. This was one of the first exoplanets ever detected, and the first time an exoplanet was discovered around a main-sequence star.

At the time, said Stanton, the signal was dismissed as a false positive caused by birds. However, a detailed analysis ruled out this possibility for all the pulses observed. Other possibilities that Stanton explores include refraction caused by Earth's atmosphere, possibly due to a shock wave. However, this is unlikely since shockwaves would have had to occur with perfect timing to coincide with all three optical pulses. Other possibilities include starlight diffraction by a distant body in the solar system, partial eclipses caused by Earth satellites or distant asteroids, and "edge diffraction" by a straight edge (as described by the Sommerfeld Effect).

There's also the possibility that a gravity wave could have generated these pulses, which requires additional consideration. Another interesting possibility is that it could be the result of ETI. As Stanton indicated, whatever modulated these stars' light must be relatively close to Earth, implying that any ETI activity must be within our solar system. Moreover, similar pulses have since been observed from another sun-like star located 81 light-years from Earth (HD 12051, on January 18th, 2025). To explain all three occurrences (and subsequent discoveries), Stanton stresses that more data is needed.

"None of these explanations are really satisfying at this point," he said. "We don't know what kind of object could produce these pulses or how far away it is. We don't know if the two-pulse signal is produced by something passing between us and the star or if it is generated by something that modulates the star's light without moving across the field. Until we learn more, we can't even say whether or not extraterrestrials are involved!"

There are several examples of Optical SETI (OSETI) or LaserSETI, including the collaborative effort launched by Breakthrough Listen and the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) Collaboration. However, Stanton's method presents many opportunities for future SETI surveys, which could search for similar examples of optical pulses. To that end, he suggests two approaches that could reveal more about this phenomenon and help astronomers place tighter constraints on their possible causes:

"Look for events using arrays of synchronized optical telescopes. If the object is moving between the star and us, this approach should tell us how fast it is moving normal to the line of sight, and potentially its size and distance. [Also,] it would be very interesting if the star's light is modulated without an object moving across the field.

"Observing events with telescopes separated by a few hundred kilometers might show that any separation in the time each pulse arrives is due only to differences in the light time from the star to each telescope. Then, unless the variation could somehow be attributed to the star itself, we would have even more to explain!"

TORONTO — People travel for all different reasons, from romance, relaxation and adventure to the downright weird and wacky (did you know bat tourism is a real thing?). But one particular niche is rising in the ranks among travellers in search of unique travel experiences, and that's UFO tourism.

With reports of UFO (Unidentified Flying Objects) and UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) sightings increasing in mainstream media, so too is interest among travellers in the pursuit of all things extraterrestrial. Popular UFO festivals like the one in Roswell, New Mexico (the largest in the U.S.) and McMinnville, Oregon (the second largest) attract oddity-seekers from around the world, while a growing number of UFO-inspired hotels (you gotta check out Treehotel's treehouse in Sweden) is also fanning the flames of E.T. fever.

But with Canada having a moment in domestic travel right now, UFO chasers are being called to experience other-worldly adventures here in their own backyard. Sightings of unexplainable objects in the sky are regularly reported in major cities across the country (over 1,000 each year!), giving travellers a new reason to visit some of Canada's top destinations.

So where in Canada gives you the best chance at spotting a UFO? According to a new study by Casino Days, Toronto tops the list with 283 UFO sightings to date and an average duration of 9.84 minutes per visit. Calgary trails behind with 161 sightings and an average duration of 13.86 minutes, followed by Vancouver (158 sightings, 12.78 minutes) and Ottawa (139 sightings, 9.90 minutes) rounding out the top five.

Also making it to the list are Montreal in the #6 spot (119 sightings, 15.35 minutes), Winnipeg in seventh (118 sightings, 14.27 minutes), Victoria in eighth (106 sightings, 9.11 minutes), London in ninth (79 sightings, 7.03 minutes) and, finally, Saskatoon coming in at #10 with 74 sightings to date and the longest average duration of per visit at 20.32 minutes!

But that's not all – Casino Days also ranked the Canadian provinces most likely to survive an alien invasion. Without Will Smith or Tom Cruise to save the day, these cities must rely on their military strength, food supply, freshwater access and population density to withstand a War-of-the-Worlds-esque attack. So, if/when the day comes that extraterrestrials scour the earth, Casino Days suggests running for the hills to Quebec, which boasts a survivability score of 7.96 out of 10. Ontario comes in a close second with a sore of 7.51, followed by Manitoba (7.44), Alberta (7.08) and Newfoundland and Labrador (7.06).

This may sound a bit kooky but for many travellers (and potential clients), it's all weirdly wonderful. So, next time a client requests an out-of-this-world vacation, tell them Canada will be hard to beat.

A Haitian woman who had lost family members to a violent criminal gang took her revenge by poisoning 40 gang members with tainted empanadas.

Haiti has long been at the mercy of violent street gangs, and many families have suffered tragedies at the hands of these ruthless criminals, but few ever dared fight back out of fear for their loved ones' safety. But vigilantes do exist! One woman in the Kenscoff district of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital city, made international news headlines after carrying out a massacre in the ranks of a local gang that had reportedly been responsible for the deaths of several of her family members. A respected street vendor specializing in pâtés, a Haitian version of empanadas, the woman recently offered dozens of gang members free pâtés as thanks for “protecting her neighborhood”. In reality, she was carrying out revenge against the people who had terrorized and killed several of her family members.

The woman, whose name has not been revealed for protection, had long sold pâtés in Kenscoff, so the gang members had no reason to suspect anything, but on this particular occasion, the Haitian empanadas were laced with a powerful industrial insecticide. Minutes after feasting on the treats, the criminals started experiencing severe stomach aches and vomiting. They all died before they could even receive medical assistance.

Local media reported the deaths of 40 members of ‘Viv Ansanm', a Port-au-Prince gang allegedly affiliated with former policeman turned crime boss Jimmy Cherizier, also known as ‘Barbecue'. Fearing reprisals, the woman left her home in Kenscoff, which turned out to be a good idea, as her home was burned down shortly after the poisoning incidents.

The unnamed vigilante reportedly turned herself in to Haitian police and confessed to carrying out the poisoning of the 40 gangmen as revenge for the deaths of her family members. She claims to have acted alone in devising and carrying out the plan. There is no information on whether she faces any charges for killing the 40 known criminals.

Annabelle doll`s paranormal tour goes viral on TikTok, reigniting fear and fascination.

The Annabelle doll, long considered one of the most terrifying haunted artefacts in existence, is once again causing panic online—this time on TikTok. With viral videos capturing its appearance during a paranormal tour across the United States, the sinister doll has reignited public fascination and left a new generation questioning the boundaries between fiction and the supernatural.

Chilling return on paranormal tour

In May 2025, Annabelle hit the road as part of the “Devils on the Run Tour,” a travelling showcase featuring cursed relics from the Warrens' Occult Museum. Among the most high-profile stops was the now-defunct Moundsville State Penitentiary in West Virginia—widely regarded as one of the most haunted sites in the U.S.

The event, titled “W.V.P. Lockdown with Annabelle,” was held from 8 to 11 May and drew paranormal enthusiasts from across the country. But it wasn't until Ryan Daniel Buell, known for hosting A&E's Paranormal State, shared his TikTok documentation of the doll's arrival that things took a viral turn.

9.8 million views and counting

One particularly eerie video showing Annabelle being moved into the penitentiary, accompanied by ominous lighting and suspenseful music, has amassed over 9.8 million views and 430,000 likes as of 13 May. The footage has stirred widespread unease among TikTok users, especially those in cities like New Orleans and Connecticut.

While some viewers see the posts as entertainment, others are left genuinely disturbed, citing the doll's dark reputation and the Warrens' longstanding warnings. The viral moment has also reignited debates on whether haunted artefacts should be taken lightly in the era of viral content.

Upcoming appearances in haunted hotspots

Following her West Virginia visit, Annabelle is scheduled to appear in New Orleans, San Antonio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky. These locations, many steeped in their own ghostly legends, have only intensified the doll's mystique. However, Connecticut—Annabelle's original home—is not yet confirmed as a stop, disappointing fans in the state where the legend began.

The Seekers of the Supernatural Paracon, typically hosted at Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, has not yet released its 2025 dates. The annual event, which often features items from the Warrens' collection, remains one of the most anticipated gatherings for paranormal investigators and enthusiasts alike.

The sinister origins

Annabelle's terrifying history dates back to 1970, when a nurse in Hartford, Connecticut, received what seemed to be an innocent Raggedy Ann doll as a gift. According to the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), the doll soon began exhibiting disturbing behaviour—moving on its own, shifting positions, and leaving notes that read “Help us” on parchment paper the owners said they never had.

One of the most alarming incidents reportedly involved the fiancé of one of the roommates, who claimed he woke up one night with the doll crawling on top of him in an attempt to strangle him.

When called to investigate, renowned demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren concluded that the doll was not possessed by a child's spirit, as initially suspected, but rather manipulated by a demonic entity seeking a human host.

Behind glass, but never forgotten

After conducting an exorcism, the Warrens took Annabelle into their care, sealing it in a glass case at their Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut. A warning label on the case reads: “Positively do not open.” Though the museum is no longer open to the public, Annabelle's reputation has grown—thanks in part to Hollywood.

The 2014 film Annabelle, along with its sequels, spun the story into the wider Conjuring cinematic universe, raking in over $800 million globally. This on-screen depiction solidified the doll's status as a modern horror icon.

Whether one believes in paranormal forces or not, the cultural impact of Annabelle is undeniable. While skeptics may argue it's all superstition, the doll's devoted believers would disagree. For them, Annabelle is no mere toy, but a vessel of dark energy—one that should remain locked away at all costs.

The Detroit Lions' defensive coaches spoke to the media on Thursday, including new defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard.

Sheppard gave the media some insight into the reintegration of superstar defensive end Aidan Hutchinson into the mix. Hutchinson broke his tibia and fibula while on track for a career year early last season.

"There's not a more resilient, mentally tough guy that that type of injury during that type of season that he was on course of having could have happened to," Sheppard said.

"He's the most energetic guy on the field."

Hutchinson, the No. 2 overall pick in 2022, had just been named the NFC Defensive Player of the Month for September before his injury in Week 6 against the Dallas Cowboys. He's already racked up 7.5 sacks on the year and was an early favorite for Defensive Player of the Year.

Sheppard said he checked in with Hutchinson during drills on Thursday after seeing how well he looked.

"I said, 'Hutch, you know how I know you back?' He's like, 'How?'" Sheppard said.

"'Because you're touching that ground when you run that hoop.' That's that little thing he does like he's some supernatural cat, which he is."

Sheppard is entering his first season as Lions defensive coordinator after Aaron Glenn's departure to take over as New York Jets head coach.

The WB is getting some major throwback love, with fans and stars alike celebrating the unforgettable shows that shaped a generation. Beloved series like Gilmore Girls, Supernatural, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek are back in the spotlight as viewers reminisce about the classic story lines, iconic casts and era-defining onscreen drama.

Stars from hit shows are catching up with fans — whether it's the Gilmore gals sharing their latest projects, former teen heartthrobs revealing what they've been up to, or the Supernatural family reflecting on their long-running monster-hunting adventures and looking ahead to new chapters. Famous faces like Lauren Graham, Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles and plenty more are dishing on life after The WB, giving Us plenty of updates, reunions and even a few new babies along the way. Whether it's nostalgia or catching up on your faves, these classic WB stories and stars are keeping viewers hooked decades later.

On January 11, 1995, a network launched that would become a destination for younger viewers — one that would have them saying “Oh what a night!” five times a week. 

The WB was a teenager's dream network before it became The CW in 2006, giving fans a ton of eye candy to look at on all of its hit series. 

More than 20 years after Gilmore Girls debuted on October 5, 2000 — and was rebooted in 2016 for a four-part update — viewers are still yearning for more from Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. 

Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles not only formed a close bond with each other while playing brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, respectively, on Supernatural, but they also forged an unbreakable connection offscreen.

"Strict Scrutiny" co-host Leah Litman has the profile of a person who, in previous eras, would seem like a defender of the Supreme Court. She's a law professor at the University of Michigan and once worked as a law clerk for former Justice Anthony Kennedy. In recent years, she's become one of the most outspoken critics of how the current iteration of the nation's highest court has abandoned good faith readings of the law, basic legal reasoning, and even facts in pursuit of a far-right agenda. In her new book, "Lawless: How the Supreme Court Runs on Conservative Grievance, Fringe Theories, and Bad Vibes," Litman chronicles the decline of this once-venerated institution. She spoke with Salon about her book and how recent cases suggest the court is getting even more unhinged in this second Donald Trump administration. 

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

I listened to oral arguments for Mahmoud v. Taylor, and I was struck by how victimized Sam Alito acted during the entire thing. He felt he was being oppressed by this children's book called "Uncle Bobby's Wedding." It perfectly illustrated the thesis of your book, which is about how much the jurisprudence of the current Supreme Court is all vibes and grievance. What were you thinking when you listened to those arguments?

I don't know whether to laugh or to cry. The justices keep providing me with so much content and so much material after I finished the manuscript. It perfectly reflects this notion of conservative grievance: the idea that social conservatives, religious conservatives, all the core parts of the Republican constituency, are the real victims. And there's no discrimination except against white evangelical Christians. That worldview was on display.

"The uncomfortable reality is that a conspiracy theory-laden universe is in full swing at the Supreme Court."

This is a children's book about a young girl being concerned that when her favorite uncle got married, he'd have less time for her. Justice Alito read it as a personal attack and rank discrimination against religious conservatives like him because her favorite uncle happened to be getting married to a man. Apparently, acknowledging that some men marry men whom they love is discrimination against Sam Alito and people who believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. It was stunning in its clarity.

I don't know what's going on in his head, but it's hard to use any word but "lying" to describe his claims during arguments. He said that the little girl in the book objected to the marriage cause she was homophobic, when she loved her gay uncle, and just didn't want him to have less time for her.

The projection is very telling. Justice Alito read this book, where Chloe is concerned about her uncle's upcoming wedding, and Justice Alito seemed to read into Chloe his own views. He imagined Chloe saying something like, "Mommy, I have a sincere religious objection to Uncle Bobby's marriage to a man." And then he interpreted her mother as saying something like, "No, Chloe, that's bad. You can't think that. Men get to marry men because that's the future liberals want." 

Of course, Chloe and her mother said no such thing. He read the mere acknowledgement that a man would marry a man as an expression of hostility to his worldview, which is that same-sex marriages shouldn't exist at all. Acknowledging their existence, acknowledging the existence of LGBT people, he perceives as an attack on him, because the jurisprudence he is fashioning is all about bringing about a world where gays, lesbians, and bisexuals are not allowed to have civil rights and are not allowed to live openly.

There's been this myth for a long time that there might be liberal judges and conservative judges, but they all adhere to the same belief that they should follow the facts and they should follow the law. Brett Kavanaugh talked about it as "calling balls and strikes." To reject the obvious reading of a children's picture book suggests that's not the case. How far have they drifted from those basic principles?

Oh, I would say quite far. It wasn't just Sam Alito, although he is the best example and encapsulation of this conservative grievance, bad vibes, fringe theory direction that the Supreme Court is headed in. During the same oral argument, you had Neil Gorsuch insisting that the book "Pride Puppy" involved a sex worker who was into bondage. If you read the book, there is a woman wearing a leather jacket, and she's at a Pride parade. Neil Gorsuch took from that and insisted, no, the book actually involves bondage and sex workers.

"The Republican justices are where the Republican Party is."

Examples are myriad. In the 303 Creative case, which also concerned LGBTQ equality, you have the court insisting the case involved a wedding website designer with sincere religious objections, who was going to be forced to make a wedding website for a same-sex wedding. The person did not specialize in wedding website design. She did not sell her business as a designer of websites from a religious perspective. And the one alleged request she received for a same-sex wedding was submitted by someone who claimed they never submitted such a request, who was a website designer themselves, and was a man married to a woman.

The Supreme Court has been running on these fast and loose characterizations of the facts for a while. We all can have a good laugh at the idea that "Uncle Bobby's Wedding" is a personal attack on people who don't believe in marriage equality. But the uncomfortable reality is that a conspiracy theory-laden universe is in full swing at the Supreme Court. It's a court captured by far-right conspiracy theories. That worldview interferes with their assessment of the law, their assessment of the facts, and their ability to engage with reality.

Sam Alito and, to a large extent, Clarence Thomas get the most attention for having their brains poisoned by this stuff. But a lot of people think Chief Justice John Roberts isn't so bad.

Look, there are differences between the Republican appointees, but the reality is, on the big picture level, they are in lockstep in important ways. Chief Justice Roberts, this purported moderate institutionalist, struck down the key provision of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County versus Holder by inserting a misleading ellipsis into a quotation he drew from one of his previous opinions. He inserted this ellipsis, so the sentence meant the literal opposite of what it had actually said.

This is the same Chief Justice who wrote the sweeping immunity ruling that effectively placed the president above the law. And people ask why Donald Trump thinks he's above the law. Some of the president's more expansive, outlandish assertions of executive power draw from this idea of the unitary executive theory, which is the idea that the Constitution gives the president and the president alone all of the executive power. It's that idea that the president relied on to fire inspectors general, to fire the heads of commissions like the National Labor Relations Board or the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission. Guess who wrote that the Constitution puts all of the executive power in the president: John Roberts. He was writing the same for the Reagan administration back when he was a lawyer in the Reagan administration.

People mistake the forest for the trees. It's more interesting to focus on the differences between the Republican appointees. It is closer to reality to acknowledge that on these super high-profile, ideologically salient cases, the Republican justices are where the Republican Party is. 

There's a recent case where reporting suggests that Samuel Alito was trying to slow walk a lawsuit regarding a bus full of Venezuelan immigrants that they were trying to send to that El Salvador in prison. The rest of the court stepped in and stopped Alito from doing that and rushed out a decision that ended up probably saving those men's lives. What is your read on that particular situation?

Some lower courts had blocked the government from relying on the Alien Enemies Act to summarily expel people to this foreign megaprison in El Salvador. The case went up to the United States Supreme Court on a request for emergency relief, blocking the government from carrying out these renditions. The Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration and released its order blocking the deportation before Alito finished his dissent. In doing so, they likely saved these men from being sent to El Salvador because they got the order out before the men could be transported.

What to read from that? It's a little hard to know. I'd imagine that the Supreme Court is responding in part to the administration's blatant disregard, if not outright defiance of their previous order in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, which told the administration to facilitate Mr. Abrego Garcia's return. The administration's response has basically been, "make me." Then Stephen Miller characterized the decision in Abrego Garcia as a unanimous win for the administration. That's definitely not true. As to whether they thought they can't wait on Justice Alito, because he is trying to buy the Trump administration time to deport these men, I'm not sure.

Trump got this immunity decision, and he seems to recognize that, as you argue in this book, these six Republican judges are going to bend over backwards to misinterpret the law to help him out. There is another case that just got going, where 12 Democratic attorneys general are suing, claiming Trump's tariffs are illegal. Which seems right to me, though I'm not a lawyer. It will be another interesting test of whether or not the Supreme Court has a limit. What are your thoughts on that case? Because it is a situation where Trump's agenda is so different than the standard Republican agenda.

If you look back at the first Trump administration, there was this case challenging the entire Affordable Care Act. The state of Texas sued on this cockamamie theory that the entire Affordable Care Act had become unconstitutional when Congress reduced the penalty for not having health insurance to $0. And the Trump administration joined Texas's lawsuit, to ask the court to strike down the entirety of the Affordable Care Act. That was a Trump thing. It was not the consensus position of the Republican caucus, which had voted down efforts to repeal the entirety of the Affordable Care Act.

In that case, the Supreme Court rejects the Trump administration's request. That's another example where the zeitgeist of the Republican Party is not exactly tracking what Donald Trump is asking for. And in those instances, you have a Republican court majority that is probably closer to the median Republican in Congress or than they are to Donald Trump. Now, that means, of course, they are enabling Trump, left and right and all over the place, you know, and are on board with a lot of his agenda. But it does mean there are some differences.

It seems to me that the Supreme Court often oversteps with regard to this Christian nationalist agenda. Or is it larger than that?

I think it is larger than that. I agree that one of the ideas they are most committed to is that conservative Christians are the victims of a society that doesn't share their views. But they are also very committed to the idea that white conservatives accused of racial discrimination are very put upon. That idea has inflected a lot of their jurisprudence on voting rights. This term, they are hearing another Voting Rights Act case that asks them to say it's actually unconstitutional racial discrimination for states to try to ensure that black voters are represented in districting. It's super transparent in the cases of religion, but it's definitely present in other areas of law as well.

When I'm chatting with people on social media, I find the Supreme Court situation is the source of almost nihilistic pessimism. There are six Republican-appointed justices. As you said, they are in lockstep with this increasingly ridiculous, paranoid agenda. There is no sense that will change any time soon. They sometimes seem to have king-like powers. Should people feel this hopeless? Are there reasons to feel that this can get better?

I understand the feeling of hopelessness. I definitely feel depressed sometimes. But, just like we tell people not to obey in advance for the Trump administration, don't obey in advance for the Supreme Court, either. If you have a great law or policy that you think will meaningfully improve people's lives, and you think it's constitutional, do it. Make them strike it down. Make them pay the price for taking away people's healthcare, voting rights, and whatnot.

Second, if you are that convinced that the Supreme Court is such a destructive force on society, you should try to convince other people of that as well. If we do that, we might be in a situation where the next time progressives, the Democratic Party, the left have political power, they could exercise that political power in ways that reduce the destructive potential and powers of this Supreme Court.

The other thing that gives me hope is the polling on the Trump administration on immigration and other matters, and especially the polling on the Supreme Court. A majority of the country is not on board with their wild grievance-laden, retributive agenda. And so that gives me hope. Just because these weirdos on the Supreme Court are doing this doesn't mean the rest of the country is OK with it.

How much of this is Mitch McConnell's fault?

Mitch McConnell is a key figure in my book for a reason. Even when Republicans aren't on board with what Trump is doing, the Republican Party and people like Mitch McConnell own absolutely everything he is doing. They have enabled him and they continue to do so. It doesn't really matter if Mitch McConnell is occasionally voting against the nominee, voting against tariffs, or whatnot. He held open a Supreme Court seat to give Donald Trump a better chance of being elected president. He refused to impeach Donald Trump when Donald Trump attacked our democracy. He has held open seats to make room for radical extremists on the lower courts who have done absolutely wild things, like order nationwide bans on medication abortion. He owns a lot of this, and he should be remembered as such.

Being abducted by little green men might seem like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. But specialists have said people with one little-discussed issue may experience something strikingly close to this scenario.

In a social media post, sleep scientist Dr Matt Walker, from the University of California, Berkeley, delved into the terrifying phenomenon of sleep paralysis, which affects only a small number of people. "Experiencing paralysis upon waking is known as REM sleep paralysis," he explained.

"Normally, during REM sleep, the brain induces muscle atonia (temporary paralysis) to prevent dream enactment. Occasionally, consciousness can return slightly before muscle control, affecting roughly 25 per cent of people.

"Fascinatingly, REM sleep paralysis experiences often parallel narratives of alleged alien abductions. Dr Eti Simon theorises that muscle atonia's primary evolutionary function might be restorative, with dreaming subsequently co-opting this physiologic state."

Sleep paralysis is characterized by the terrifying inability to move or speak during the process of waking up or falling asleep. This bewildering condition typically occurs during deep REM sleep, which is commonly associated with dreaming phases.

People who have encountered sleep paralysis often report feeling a force pressing down on them or even sensing the presence of someone - or something - in the room with them. This puzzling phenomenon is not only tied to explanations for supposed alien abductions, but could also be a plausible explanation for ghost encounters and other supernatural experiences.

Psychologist Dr Louise Goddard-Crawley previously told MailOnline: "From a scientific perspective, these hallucinations in sleep paralysis are manifestations of our internal mental processes rather than meaningful messages from an external source. Some people may perceive threatening figures or monsters, while others may experience more neutral or even positive hallucinations. The specific form that these hallucinations take can be influenced by cultural depictions, personal beliefs, and individual psychological factors."

Although it's unclear how sleep paralysis happens, the UK's NHS states that it may be linked to conditions like insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalised anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. It tends to occur more frequently in people with a family history of the condition.

Fortunately, you can do a few things to minimise its effects. One of the most effective is to make sure you go to bed at roughly the same time each day, and regularly get seven to nine hours of sleep.

On the flipside, patients are also encouraged to avoid smoking, eating a big meal, or drinking alcohol or caffeine shortly before bed. Sleeping on your back is discouraged, too.

It's essential to seek medical advice if you feel scared to go to sleep or feel continually exhausted due to sleep paralysis.

Steven Spielberg has been filming a movie this year in New Jersey and New York, but photos on social media suggest that the movie could be a close encounter for Kansas City.

Is the movie set in KC?

Last week a software engineer on X tweeted a photo from the set in New Jersey.

“Steven Spielberg just casually transforming my campus into Kansas City,” he wrote.

He included a photo of a building dressed like a TV station with fake call letters, KCXE, on the front. Another picture showed satellite dishes locked behind a fence with this sign, “KCXE 4 Broadcast Operations.”

In reality, that building is on the campus of the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark.

A photo posted on Reddit showed the same building with the words “Kansas City News” emblazoned on the side in tall red letters.

Details about the film, set for a 2026 release, are sparse, though it is described as a UFO movie, familiar territory for the legendary Oscar-winner who directed “E.T.” and “Close Encounters of the Third Kind.”

Some entertainment outlets have tapped this new film as one of the most anticipated sci-fi movies coming down the road.

In late February, photos published by a local New York newspaper provided the strongest evidence that at least some of the action involves Kansas City.

The Journal News, which covers New York's Lower Hudson Valley, published a series of photos of the filmmaking underway in White Plains, New York.

They showed Spielberg and actress Emily Blunt (“Oppenheimer,” “The Devil Wears Prada”) on the set.

A Kansas City Police Department car was on set, too. Spielberg was seen crouching next to one as he worked.

Another photo showed a Kansas City Royals street signed posted high on a lamppost. It was Royals blue, bore the team's crown-shaped icon, its web address and read: “You're in Royals country. Get your season tickets now.”

“We can see Steven Spielberg there standing next to a cop car. It says Kansas City on that by the way. So clearly parts of it are going to take place in Kansas City,” UFO sleuth Patrick Scott Armstrong said on his podcast, “Vetted,” while discussing the film.

“Even though they're filming in Jersey, they make it seem like Kansas City.”

In March, as Spielberg filmed in Westchester County, New York, a Reddit user reported seeing the local library “dolled up” as the “Jackson County Hospital,” noting that Kansas City is in Jackson County, Missouri.

“I saw the ambulances on set all said Jackson County this morning,” another Reddit user responded.

The Star asked the KC Film Office if it knew anything about the movie and whether, indeed, it takes place in a fake KC.

Spielberg has filmed other projects in the Northeast and is so familiar with the area he reportedly told one mayor to never change his town.

With last year's popular Hallmark Christmas movie about the Chiefs and several reality TV shows filmed here in recent months, the KC film industry is in the midst of “an exciting time,” film office director Rachel Kephart told The Star recently.

“We have world-class crews, diverse locations, geographic accessibility and competitive film incentives that make filming in KC a good business decision,” she said.

Asked about the Spielberg film, the office said in a statement that it did “not have any further details to share regarding this project.”

The film is said to be based on an original story by Spielberg with a screenplay by longtime collaborator David Koepp, who worked with him on the first “Jurassic Park” film and two “Indiana Jones” movies.

The title hasn't been revealed, though it appears to be shooting under the name, “Non-View.”

“Disclosure” and “The Dish” have been bandied about, too.

Blunt stars alongside Wyatt Russell, Colin Firth, Colman Domingo, Josh O'Connor and Eve Hewson.

The film is slated for a June 12, 2026, premiere which sets it up to be Spielberg's return to big summer blockbusters like “Jaws” and “Jurassic Park.”

As for that KCPD car Spielberg huddled against, that vehicle could use a little more Hollywood magic.

“This car does not resemble any Kansas City Missouri Police cars,” KCPD spokesman Jacob Becchina told the Star.

Being abducted by aliens may sound like something pulled straight out of a science-fiction movie. Yet, experts say people who suffer one little-known issue may 'experience' an eerily similar ordeal.

Dr Matt Walker, Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, has spent years studying the science of sleep. In a new Instagram post, he shed light on the frightening phenomenon of sleep paralysis, experienced by just a small fraction of people.

"Experiencing paralysis upon waking is known as REM sleep paralysis," he explained. "Normally, during REM sleep, the brain induces muscle atonia (temporary paralysis) to prevent dream enactment. Occasionally, consciousness can return slightly before muscle control, affecting roughly 25 per cent of people.

"Fascinatingly, REM sleep paralysis experiences often parallel narratives of alleged alien abductions. Dr Eti Simon theorises that muscle atonia's primary evolutionary function might be restorative, with dreaming subsequently co-opting this physiologic state."

As Dr Walker suggests, sleep paralysis describes a state in which a person cannot move or speak while waking up or falling asleep. Although it's unclear how this occurs, it is generally believed to happen when someone reaches deep REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which is usually when we dream. 

People who experience this phenomenon often describe the sensation of something pushing them down, or even feel like there is someone else in the room. Some say this could explain supposed alien abductions, as well as alleged ghost sightings and other forms of paranormal activity. 

Psychologist Dr Louise Goddard-Crawley previously told MailOnline: "From a scientific perspective, these hallucinations in sleep paralysis are manifestations of our internal mental processes rather than meaningful messages from an external source. Some people may perceive threatening figures or monsters, while others may experience more neutral or even positive hallucinations. The specific form that these hallucinations take can be influenced by cultural depictions, personal beliefs, and individual psychological factors."

While it's unclear how sleep paralysis happens, the NHS states that it may be linked to conditions like insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalised anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. It's also more common among people with a family history of the issue.

Thankfully, you can do a few things to alleviate its effects. It is especially recommended that you go to bed at roughly the same time each day and regularly get seven to nine hours of sleep. 

Meanwhile, patients are also advised to avoid smoking, and shouldn't eat a big meal or drink alcohol or caffeine shortly before bed. Sleeping on your back is discouraged, too. 

It's crucial to seek GP advice if you feel terrified to go to sleep or feel constantly tired due to sleep paralysis. NHS guidance adds: "A GP may be able to treat an underlying condition that could be triggering sleep paralysis such as insomnia or post-traumatic stress disorder. If this does not help they might refer you to a doctor who specialises in sleep conditions."

Japan's Defense Ministry was urged to set up an office tasked with tackling UFOs at a meeting with a cross-party group of lawmakers on Friday.

The group, chaired by former Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, handed a proposal to the current defense chief, describing such sightings -- formally referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP -- as realistic and serious national security concerns.

"Our country has fallen behind in responding to UAP, while securing safety in territorial airspace and waters is an urgent matter," the group said, calling for the establishment of a Japanese version of the U.S. All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.

The Pentagon office was founded in 2022 to lead U.S. efforts to address UAP through a rigorous scientific framework and a data-driven approach.

The lawmakers also proposed that a new office regularly report the progress of UAP investigations to parliament and disclose information to the public, in addition to conducting scientific analysis of collected data and identifying potential threats.

Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said, "We will make efforts to meet the expectations" of the group, which was formed last year.

Researchers have discovered an ancient moth-like sea predator in a treasure trove of museum fossils in Canada. The half-a-billion-year-old creature, Mosura fentoni, reveals that Cambrian arthropods were more diverse than previously thought.

Half a billion years ago, a feisty predator flapped around the primordial seas, hooking prey into its mouth while breathing through long gills on its butt.

Researchers recently discovered this 506 million-year-old creature, called Mosura fentoni, in a cache of museum fossils in Canada. The fossils suggest that these early arthropods were more diverse than previously thought. The team thinks the now-extinct arthropod would have looked a bit like a moth — a distant living cousin — so they named it after Mothra, the fictional giant moth from Japanese cinema.

Whereas Mothra is large enough to battle Godzilla on the silver screen, the real-life M. fentoni was only about the size of a human finger. Despite its small size, this tiny creature represents a huge and rare find for scientists.

The M. fentoni fossils, plucked mostly from the Burgess Shale rock formation in the Canadian Rockies, are so well preserved that they include intricate details of the species' biology, including the creature's nervous system, circulatory system and digestive tract. This is extremely rare for fossils, which scarcely preserve soft tissues, and helps shed light on the evolution of ancient arthropods.

"Very few fossil sites in the world offer this level of insight into soft internal anatomy," study co-author Jean-Bernard Caron, the Richard M. Ivey curator of invertebrate paleontology at the Royal Ontario Museum, said in a statement. "We can see traces representing bundles of nerves in the eyes that would have been involved in image processing, just like in living arthropods. The details are astounding."

The researchers published their findings Wednesday (May 14) in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

Arthropods are a large group of invertebrates with hard exoskeletons, segmented bodies and jointed legs. Today, they make up around three-quarters of all living animals, including insects, arachnids and crustaceans. One of the reasons for their evolutionary success is their specialized body segments. These variable segments have helped arthropods diversify within their groups and ultimately become everything from horseshoe crabs to moths.

M. fentoni belonged to a group of ancestral arthropods called radiodonts, identifiable by shared features like side flaps and head appendages. These invertebrates thrived during the Cambrian period (541 million to 485 million years ago), but their fossils have shown relatively uniform body segments with little variety, until now.

Researchers collected 60 fossils of the newly described species between 1990 and 2022, primarily from the Raymond Quarry, part of Yoho National Park in British Columbia. Many of these specimens had been sitting in the Royal Ontario Museum for years until the authors of the new study took a closer look at them. The team also identified one other specimen in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., according to the study.

"Museum collections, old and new, are a bottomless treasure trove of information about the past," study lead author Joe Moysiuk, curator of paleontology and geology at the Manitoba Museum, said in the statement. "If you think you've seen it all before, you just need to open up a museum drawer."

The researchers photographed and scanned the fossils to build a picture of this ancient creature's biology. They found that, unlike other radiodonts, M. fentoni had lots of body segments on its rear, which were lined with gills. The species also had the longest gills relative to body length of all known radiodonts, despite being among the smallest, according to the study.

The team concluded that the back-end gills were most likely a specialized system for respiration; horseshoe crabs, wood lice and some other living arthropods have subsequently evolved a similar system. Researchers aren't certain why M. fentoni needed the long butt gills, but they speculated it was an adaptation to low-oxygen environments or an active lifestyle — possibly a very active reproductive lifestyle — that required greater oxygen consumption. Either way, the discovery highlights that radiodonts were more diverse than previously thought.

"Radiodonts were the first group of arthropods to branch out in the evolutionary tree, so they provide key insight into ancestral traits for the entire group," Caron said. "The new species emphasizes that these early arthropods were already surprisingly diverse and were adapting in a comparable way to their distant modern relatives."
