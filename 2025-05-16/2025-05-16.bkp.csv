            The United States is examining development of a twin-engined warplane to be known as the F-55, as well as an upgrade to its Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor called the F-22 Super, US President Donald Trump said on Thursday.
    


            Trump was speaking at a meeting of business leaders including the heads of Boeing and GE Aerospace in Doha, a day after announcing a string of business deals including an order from Qatar for 160 Boeing commercial jets.
    


            Trump referred to the F-55 both as an upgrade to the Lockheed F-35 and a new development in comments that appeared to echo talk by the US arms giant of a “best value” alternative, after losing out to Boeing to replace the F-22 superfighter.

            He also highlighted the role of the new air dominance platform called the F-47, recently awarded to Boeing, opens new tab, and said the United States was simultaneously looking at upgrading the stealth fighter that it is designed to replace, the F-22.
    


            “We're going to do an F-55 and – I think, if we get the right price, we have to get the right price – that'll be two engines and a super upgrade on the F-35, and then we're going to do the F-22,” Trump said.
    


            “I think the most beautiful fighter jet in the world is the F-22, but we're going to do an F-22 Super, and it'll be a very modern version of the F-22 fighter jet,” he said.
    


            “We're going to be going with it pretty quickly,” he added.
    


            Trump last month awarded Boeing the contract for the F-47 – a replacement for the Lockheed F-22 stealth fighter featuring a crewed aircraft flanked by a cohort of drones and seen as America's most advanced or sixth-generation fighter.
    


            Lockheed Martin, which lost out to Boeing in that Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) competition and was dropped from a separate contest for a new US Navy stealth jet, has said it is now looking at plans for a “fifth-generation-plus” fighter.
    


            CEO James Taiclet told analysts last month that Lockheed was looking at ways of applying technology developed for its losing bid for the F-47 contract to the F-35, delivering 80% of the capability for half the cost.
    


            “We're basically going to take the chassis and turn it into a Ferrari,” he told analysts.
    


            A Lockheed spokeswoman said “We thank President Trump for his support of the F-35 and F-22 and will continue to work closely with the Administration to realize its vision for air dominance.”
    


            Lockheed is separately in the midst of a delayed technology and software upgrade for the existing generation of F-35 strike fighter to boost cockpit displays and processing power.
    


            Analysts said it was not immediately clear how Trump's list of potential developments fitted into known programs and spending plans, or the timing of existing programs.
    


            Agency Partners aerospace analyst Nick Cunningham said the F-55 may alternatively refer to the F/A-XX program, intended to replace the US Navy's aging Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet fleet with the service's own sixth-generation stealth fighter.

Converting luxury jet gifted to Trump into Air Force One could cost hundreds of millions



            The Navy and Congress are battling with the administration to keep the plans moving forward, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Announcement of a winning bidder had been expected as early as March.
    


            Funding of the radar-evading F-22, which is designed to combat other fighters, has been fiercely debated for years as Congress blocked plans by the Air Force to speed up retirements to focus on the next generation blueprint that became the F-47.
    


            Any significant upgrade to the out-of-production F-22 would be costly, while Trump's reference to two engines implies the F-55 would not be a straightforward derivative of the single-engined F-35 but imply an ambitious new platform, analysts said.
    


            “Adding an engine to the F-35 makes it a new aircraft,” UK-based defense analyst Francis Tusa said.

Live Updates


• Trump ends trip: President Donald Trump is heading back to Washington, DC, after finishing a trip to the Middle East with stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates that saw him reimagine alliances on the world stage. In the UAE earlier Friday, he hinted at new global tariff terms and appeared to confirm Iran has received a nuclear deal proposal.
    


• String of deals inked: Trump's trip has yielded a list of deals, including a partnership with the UAE to build a massive AI data complex in Abu Dhabi, a commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest $600 billion in the US, and Qatar's agreement to buy US-made Boeing planes.
    


• Trump's legislative agenda: Meanwhile, back in the US, a group of House conservatives blocked the sweeping bill in a key committee vote, dealing a major embarrassment to House Republican leaders and Trump himself.
    


• Ukraine war talks: Trump said he plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as soon as he can, as trilateral talks with representatives from Ukraine, Russia and Turkey happened in Istanbul on Friday.
    


            President Donald Trump's agenda has been thrown into chaos after a group of GOP hardliners blocked the bill in a key committee vote on Friday – dealing a major embarrassment to House Republican leaders and Trump himself.
    


            The outcome of the vote does not spell the end for the bill, but it marks a major setback for GOP leaders, who will now have to determine if they can find a way forward to win over holdouts.
    


            A core of right-wing Republicans had warned House Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team, both privately and publicly, that they planned to oppose the vote in the House budget panel meeting on Friday. But GOP leaders took the gamble, and proceeded with the vote anyway.
    


            Five Republicans opposed the bill: Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Chip Roy of Texas, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania.
    


            The next steps for the House budget panel are unclear, though the group must decide to advance Trump's bill at some point before it can come to the floor.
    


            The move came after a bloc of House conservatives took the rare step Friday of publicly vowing to derail Trump's legislative agenda without major changes, casting doubt on Johnson's ability to pass a sweeping tax and spending cuts bill next week.

            GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas formally declared he is opposed to the House version of President Donald Trump's agenda bill without “serious reforms” – signaling a major problem for House GOP leadership as they try to pass the bill next week.
    


            Roy, a well-respected conservative in the House, trashed the bill during a critical House GOP budget committee meeting on Friday. He said the bill “falls profoundly short” of addressing the nation's massive deficit problem.
    


            GOP Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, too, said he is opposed to the current version — but signaled he could potentially get to yes with key changes to further tighten eligibility for Medicaid, squeezing more money from the federal health program.
    


                    “Sadly, I'm a hard-no until we get this ironed out. I think we can. We've made progress, it just takes time,” Norman said.
                





Meetings with holdouts: Those conservatives' comments came after a nearly-hour long conversation with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Scalise said they're all in agreement about the changes they want to make but said they're working through timing implementation. Some of the panel's members aren't on board with the bill as they want deeper spending cuts, IRA subsidies repealed, Medicaid work requirements implemented sooner, among other issues.
    


            Scalise said Trump, who is returning from an overseas trip, has been keeping track of the bill's progress. Norman, however, said he has not heard from the president directly.
    


            If Trump's bill does not advance in the committee on Friday, it may not be able to make it to the floor next week. The House Budget Committee can only lose one GOP vote on Friday and at least four members, including Roy, told reporters on Thursday they had issues with the bill.
    


Helping Speaker Johnson's vote math: GOP Rep. Brandon Gill – whose wife had their second child just days earlier – made a surprise return to Washington, DC, on Friday to help advance the vote. Gill, a member of the House Budget Committee, told CNN that he will be voting to advance the bill because he needs to support the president's agenda.
    


This post has been updated with additional comments from the representatives. 



            New FEMA acting Administrator David Richardson told his staff in an agency-wide call Thursday that the organization is “not necessarily” unprepared for hurricane season, adding that FEMA will likely face more reforms and steep staffing cuts in the months ahead, according to a recording of the call reviewed by CNN.
    


            To ensure his agency is ready for potentially catastrophic disasters in hurricane season, which begins June 1, Richardson is leading what he calls a “complex problem-solving session,” which he expects his team to nearly finish next week.
    


            “We are, to some degree, to a great degree, ready for disaster season '25,” Richardson said, referring to the early results of his initiative.
    


CNN obtained an internal assessment from the agency's review process, which lays out a long list of ongoing problems at FEMA, including uncertainty around its mission, lack of coordination with states and other federal agencies, low morale, and new red tape that will likely slow responses.
    


            Richardson – who refers to their operation as “FEMA 2” – reiterated that the administration plans to dramatically reform and shrink FEMA in the months ahead, which could mean personnel cuts.
    


                    “We do need many, many of us. I'm not going to say all. I'm not going to say the majority,” he told staff, calling this year a transition period. “We'll take some risk, but I don't want to take too much risk, because remember, the president's will and the American people's interests, I believe, are the same.”
                





            He stressed that President Donald Trump's goal is to shift more responsibility for disaster preparedness, response and recovery onto the states. He plans to travel across the country to encourage state leaders to bolster their emergency management budgets and infrastructure.
    


            Richardson has previously stated that his sole objective is to implement President Trump's agenda.
    


            The US has not yet tabled a follow up proposal outlining the details of a potential Iran nuclear deal — despite some expectations that one would come this week, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            On Friday, President Donald Trump appeared to confirm Iran had been given a formal proposal, telling reporters aboard Air Force One, “They have a proposal, but more importantly, they know that they have to move quickly or something bad – something bad's gonna happen.”
    


            Following the fourth round of nuclear talks that took place in Oman last weekend there was an expectation that a detailed proposal would be shared with Iran this week, but that has not happened, the source said.
    


            During last week's talks, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi both brought proposals to the table, the source said. Those proposals led to hours of negotiations but since then the US has not shared a revised proposal with Iran, the source said.
    


            The Trump administration is expecting an Iranian response to what was discussed last weekend possibly in the next round of talks, said a separate source familiar with the matter. A date for those talks has not been set yet, though it is being discussed, both sources said.
    


            CNN has asked the White House for comment.
    


            Earlier in the week, Trump also indicted that a deal could be within reach.
    


            “Iran has sort of agreed to the terms,” he said, according to a White House pool report. “We're getting close to maybe doing a deal.”
    


            President Donald Trump signaled on Friday that he wants the US to help take care of the situation in Gaza after a further wave of intense Israeli airstrikes overnight, saying “a lot of people are starving” and that he expected “a lot of good things” in the next month.
    


                    “I think a lot of good things are going to happen over the next month, and we're going to see, we have to help also out the Palestinians,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday as he returned to the United States after his Middle East trip.
                





            When asked by a reporter whether he supported Israeli plans to expand the war in Gaza, the president responded: “You know, a lot of people are starving on Gaza, so we have to look at both sides.”
    


            “But we'll, we're going to do a good job,” he added.
    


                    Earlier Friday, speaking in the United Arab Emirates on the last leg of his visit to three Gulf nations, Trump said: “We're looking at Gaza, and we got to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving. A lot of people. There's a lot of bad things going on.”
                





More on the situation in Gaza: The Israeli military intensified operations across Gaza Thursday, killing more than 100 people and pledging to continue bombings as Trump suggested establishing a “freedom zone” in the enclave. Many of the casualties were in Jabalya in northern Gaza and in Khan Younis in the south, according to Gaza Civil Defense.
    


            On Thursday, the president reiterated his desire to take over the Gaza Strip, telling a business roundtable in Qatar that the United States would “make it a freedom zone.”



            The Department of Homeland Security has requested 20,000 National Guard members to help arrest and deport undocumented immigrants, a spokesperson has confirmed.
    


            “DHS requested 20,000 National Guard members to help carry out the President's mandate from the American people to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
    


                    “The Department of Homeland Security will use every tool and resource available to get criminal illegal aliens including gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and other violent criminals out of our country. The safety of American citizens comes first.”
                





            CNN reported earlier this week that the Trump administration was planning to deploy hundreds more federal personnel to ramp up arrests of undocumented immigrants as soon as this week, citing two sources familiar with the planning.
    


            US President Donald Trump just finished a lavish tour of Gulf Arab states, where every one of the three energy-rich nations he visited had a long wish list from the American leader.
    


            While those nations reaped some big rewards from the trip, they fell short of others. Here's what we know about what the Gulf states got, and didn't get, out of Trump's visit.
    


A ‘real' American commitment to Riyadh: Saudi Arabia wanted a formalized security deal with the US. While it didn't get that, experts say it came significantly closer to one.
    


                    “Saudi may not have gotten their formalized security agreement, but there was a lot of talk around it… So this may have been, rather than the culmination of the process, the continuation of the conversation,” said Dina Esfandiary, Middle East lead for Bloomberg Economics, adding that Washington may not be as enthusiastic about the arrangement as Riyadh has been.
                





First American state visit to Qatar: Qatar this week received its first-ever official state visit by a US president. The last time a sitting US leader visited the nation was in 2003, when former President George W. Bush paid a visit to Central Command headquarters, where he addressed US military personnel.
    


An AI megacomplex in the UAE: The UAE's main target from Trump's trip was deeper investments on AI and technology, and while it achieved victories in that regard, the visit fell short of what Abu Dhabi really wanted: unrestricted access to advanced American microchips.
    


            During Trump's visit to the UAE, the two countries announced a partnership to build a massive data center complex in Abu Dhabi to advance AI capabilities with 5-gigawatts of capacity — enough to power a major city.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk held a phone call with US President Donald Trump on Friday, according to the Ukrainian presidency.
    


            The Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul were the main topic of conversation, a spokesperson for Zelensky told CNN.
    


            Zelensky said he spoke with Trump following his country's talks with Russia, reiterating that “pressure on Russia must be maintained.”
    


                    “Ukraine is ready to take the fastest possible steps to bring real peace, and it is important that the world holds a strong stance,” Zelensky wrote on social media after the call.
                





This post has been updated with Zelensky's reaction to the call. 



            President Donald Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of insinuating a threat against him through a cryptic social media post, calling it a clear suggestion of assassination.
    


                    “He knew exactly what that meant. A child knows what that meant. If you're the FBI director and you don't know what that meant? That meant assassination. And it says it loud and clear,” Trump said in a clip of an interview with Fox News released on Friday.
                





            Comey had posted an image on Instagram of a shell formation on a beach showing the numbers “8647.” The post was quickly deleted but not before it triggered outrage among Trump's allies and drew federal scrutiny.
    


                    “Now, he wasn't very competent, but he was competent enough to know what that meant. And he did it for a reason, and he was hit so hard, because people like me, they like what's happening with our country,” Trump told Fox News host Bret Baier.
                





            When reached for comment, Comey directed CNN to his Instagram post explaining the earlier picture's removal.
    


            In explaining why he removed the post, Comey wrote on Instagram that he had “posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message.”
    


            “I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down,” he continued.
    


            While departing the United Arab Emirates earlier, President Donald Trump defended his administration's decision to offer refugee status to White South Africans who arrived in the United States this week, claiming that the US must protect people facing persecution, regardless of race or background.
    


            “I think if I see people in distress, I don't care what color, what they look like, what anything their size, their height, their eyes. I don't care,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday. “But I think that from all evidence, the farmers in South Africa are being treated brutally.”
    


            When pressed by a reporter on whether prioritizing White South African landowners while restricting refugees from other global regions was fair, Trump insisted the move was driven by humanitarian concerns.
    


For context: In January, South Africa enacted the Expropriation Act, seeking to undo the legacy of apartheid, during which non-White South Africans were forcibly dispossessed from their lands for the benefit of Whites. The law empowers South Africa's government to take land and redistribute it — with no obligation to pay compensation, in some instances — if the seizure is found to be “just and equitable and in the public interest.”
    


            A flight carrying a group of 59 White South Africans granted refugee status by the Trump administration landed in Washington, DC, on Monday, as reported by CNN. They're the first group to be accepted under this designation by the administration, with more Afrikaner arrivals expected.
    


            Meanwhile, the US has placed a broad suspension on most other refugee resettlement programs, including those for individuals escaping war and famine.
    


            The decision to allow only White South Africans an exemption from the indefinite pause has sparked criticism from refugee advocates and the South African government alike.
    


            President Donald Trump appeared to confirm reports that special envoy Steve Witkoff offered Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal.
    


            Asked if the US has given Iran a formal proposal, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One:
    


                    “They have a proposal, but more importantly, they know that they have to move quickly, or something bad, something bad's gonna happen.”
                





            On Thursday, the president indicated negotiators are “very close” to a deal and that Iran has “sort of agreed” to terms, suggesting Iran agreed not to make what he described as “nuclear dust.”
    


            Iranian officials haven't publicly commented on Trump's remarks, though the comments were reported by the country's semi-official ISNA news agency. CNN has requested a comment from Iran's mission to the United Nations.
    


            Trump repeatedly said during his trip to the Middle East this week that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and warned of violent consequences if it does so. But those comments were met with the ire of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Wednesday, who called Trump “naive for thinking that he can come to our region, threaten us, and hope that we back down against his demands.”
    


            Witkoff, meanwhile, held a fourth round of talks with Iranian officials moderated by Oman last weekend with plans to continue discussions. Timing for the next round of talks is unclear.
    


            President Donald Trump said Friday that he “may” call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to Russia's war in Ukraine.
    


            He told reporters aboard Air Force One while departing Abu Dhabi, “We have to meet. He and I will meet.”
    


                    Trump continued: “I think we'll solve it, or maybe not, but at least we'll know. And if we don't solve it, it will be very interesting.”
                





            Trump said earlier on Friday that he plans to meet Putin “as soon as we can set it up,” as trilateral talks with representatives from Ukraine, Russia and Turkey begin this afternoon in Istanbul.
    


In Istanbul: The US and Russia held brief working-level talks ahead of the direct talks between Russia and Ukraine. State Department Director for Policy Planning Michael Anton met with Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky for just 15 minutes, according to the press traveling with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
    


CNN's Kylie Atwood and Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting. 



            President Donald Trump has departed Abu Dhabi, concluding a trip to the Middle East that included stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.
    


            Trump walked out onto the tarmac in Abu Dhabi with United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
    


            The leaders walked in conversation onto a light blue carpet, until arriving close to the steps of Air Force One. The plane was wheels up at 6:26 a.m. ET (2:26 p.m. local time) on Friday.
    


            Trump went up the steps to board and gave his signature fist pump before entering the plane.
    


            President Donald Trump toured the Abrahamic Family House on Friday before departing for Washington. The complex houses a mosque, a synagogue and a church.
    


            Trump visited the mosque, synagogue and church, and signed a guest book, marveling at the site.
    


                    Asked his message to the people of the United Arab Emirates, he said, “Great unity, great faith, incredible people with a tremendous leader who's a friend of mine.”
                





Correction: An earlier of this version of this post cited a pool report that misstated the origin for the Abrahamic Family House. That reference has been removed.



            President Donald Trump made light of a gift from the United Arab Emirates on Friday, when he was gifted a box from UAE officials containing a single drop of oil.
    


            “This is the highest quality oil there is on the planet. But they only gave me a drop,” he said, laughing.
    


            But that one drop may have a much bigger meaning.
    


            One of the world's biggest oil exporters, the UAE has said it will celebrate the last barrel of oil it produces as it embarks on a massive drive to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbons.
    


                    “In 50 years' time, we will celebrate the last barrel of oil,” UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan said in 2015. “Oil was an exhaustible resource, and therefore we should lay down our future development plans based on this premise.”
                





            Oil accounts for about 60% of government revenues and less than 30% of its GDP, much lower than neighboring oil-rich Gulf countries.
    


            President Donald Trump suggested Friday that his top trade negotiators plan to contact about 150 countries with information on new tariff rates because there is not enough time to negotiate bespoke deals before a self-imposed July deadline.
    


            Trump said during a business roundtable in Abu Dhabi that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick “will be sending letters out” within two to three weeks.
    


                    “We have, at the same time, 150 countries that want to make a deal, but you're not able to see that many countries. So at a certain point, over the next two to three weeks, I think Scott and Howard will be sending letters out, essentially telling people – we'll be very fair – but we'll be telling people what they'll be paying to do business in the United States,” Trump said.
                





            He continued, “I guess you could say they could appeal it, but for the most part, I think we're going to be very fair, but it's not, it's not possible to meet the number of people that want to see us.”
    


Some context: Trump rocked markets and injected massive uncertainty into the global economy as he imposed tariffs across the globe in April. Since then, he has announced an agreement in principle with the United Kingdom, as well as a deal with Beijing to remove a staggering 145% tariff rate imposed on Chinese goods. His economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said recently that there were about 24 trade deals in the works with other countries.
    


            President Donald Trump complained about the aging Air Force One plane shortly before making his way back to Washington from the Middle East, after he confirmed he is expected to be gifted a luxury Boeing plane by Qatar.
    


                    “I leave now and get into a 42-year-old Boeing. The new ones are coming. New ones are coming,” Trump told reporters in Abu Dhabi.
                





            A top Qatari official told CNN on Wednesday that the plane was a “government-to-government transaction” and not a personal gift to Trump amid ethical and security concerns in the US from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle — and even some of the president's most ardent allies.
    


            “This is a very simple government-to-government dealing,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani told CNN's Becky Anderson, adding that the matter was “still under legal review.”
    


            President Donald Trump on Friday lamented the idea that his successors could receive credit for investment and projects that his administration laid the groundwork for in his trip to the Middle East.
    


            “You know the sad part, whoever's next president, let's just say whoever — he's the next president. ‘What a great job they did.' Look—- I built all these plants. I built all these factories,” Trump told business leaders during a US-UAE business exposition in Abu Dhabi.
    


                    He continued, “Can you imagine – I'll be sitting at home, who the hell knows where I'll be, and I'll say, ‘I did that,' and everyone will say, but somebody's gonna be cutting a ribbon, as well… Somebody's going to be taking the credit for this. You remember, press: This guy did it.”
                





            Trump has repeatedly inflated the size of Middle East investment in the US, claiming plans for up to $1 trillion at his first stop but “maybe $13 trillion” days later as he prepared to return to Washington.
    


            President Donald Trump has arrived at Qasr Al Watan, the presidential palace in Abu Dhabi, where he's set to attend a breakfast roundtable with US and United Arab Emirates business leaders alongside UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
    


            Friday is the president's fourth and final day on a jam-packed, three-stop Middle East tour that has seen him reimagine alliances on the world stage and shed his MAGA isolationism.
    


            Later today, he will tour the Abrahamic Family House — an interfaith complex that houses a mosque, synagogue and church — before making his way back to Washington on Air Force One.
    


            Qasr Al Watan is closed Friday, but is normally open daily to the public for tours, shopping and dining.

            Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that now is a critical time for the US to reach a nuclear deal with Iran given the country's uranium enrichment levels.
    


                    “This is a critical moment,” Rubio told Fox News. “The president has made it a priority and now people understand the urgency here because they are fairly close, too close for comfort, to a nuclear weapon.”
                





            “We have to roll that back one way or another and we hope it's peacefully and through the process of negotiation,” Rubio added.
    


            During his Gulf tour, President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned that Iran must never obtain a nuclear weapon, threatening to strike the country if it fails to reach a nuclear deal. But he has not explicitly ruled out Iran enriching uranium on its own soil. While uranium can be weaponized if enriched to high levels, it can also be used as a nuclear fuel.
    


            Trump said earlier Thursday that the US is “very close” to reaching a deal with Iran after Tehran “sort of” agreed to its terms. Iranian officials haven't publicly commented on Trump's remarks, though the comments were reported by the country's semi-official ISNA news agency. CNN has requested a comment from Iran's mission to the United Nations.
    


CNN's Betsy Klein and Nadeen Ebrahim contributed to this report.



            President Donald Trump is in the United Arab Emirates, the third and final stop of his Middle East trip after he visited Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
    


Here's a recap of the trip:



Agreements with Riyadh: The US has several new agreements with Saudi Arabia, focusing on cooperation in areas like military, customs authorities and medical research. Meanwhile, Trump secured a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US, the White House said.
    


Deal with Qatar: Trump on Monday defended the plan to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family, saying the US can't turn down a free jet. CNN reported that the Boeing 747-8 jet would be retrofitted to be used as Air Force One. The plan raised substantial ethical and legal questions about foreign influence over the US government because of the plane's massive value. It also raises significant security concerns. Separately, on Wednesday, Qatar signed an agreement to purchase jets from US manufacturer Boeing for Qatar Airways.
    


Deal with United Arab Emirates: The US announced a new weapons sale of over $1.4 billion to the UAE, just days before Trump was scheduled to visit. The US and UAE also announced a partnership to build a massive data center complex in Abu Dhabi to advance artificial intelligence capabilities with 5-gigawatts of capacity — enough to power a major city.
    


Plans for Syria: Trump announced Tuesday that he plans to lift sanctions on Syria. On Wednesday, he met with interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia. Trump said the US is “exploring normalizing relations” with Syria.
    


Trump family business grows: The Trump family's business ties have more than tripled since the president's first term in office, a CNN tally of the deals has found, including new projects announced since he reclaimed the White House.
    


            The United States and United Arab Emirates will partner to build a massive data center complex in Abu Dhabi to advance artificial intelligence capabilities with 5-gigawatts of capacity — enough to power a major city.
    


            The agreement, announced Thursday during US President Donald Trump's visit to the UAE, will mark the largest data center deployment outside of the United States, according to the Commerce Department. It will begin with a 1-gigawatt AI data center, but will eventually span 10 square miles.
    


            The project is also expected to expand the footprint of American AI and cloud companies in the Middle East, allowing them to better serve the global south. No companies were named in the Commerce Department's announcement, although Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was spotted at one of Trump's UAE meetings. Nvidia declined to comment.
    


            Trump has been working to push AI investment, as the success of US tech companies are seen as key to retaining the US's position as a global superpower.
    


            The UAE has also said it wants to become a global leader in artificial intelligence by 2031. Ahead of Trump's visit, UAE Minister of Education Sarah Al Amiri said the country is looking to diversify its economy, especially in the areas of AI and technology. Investments in AI infrastructure are seen as crucial to securing the region's post-oil future.
    


            The White House also announced on Thursday an agreement under which the UAE has committed to build or finance data centers in the United States that are “at least as large and as powerful” as those in the UAE.

European NATO members would face a $1 trillion bill over 25 years to replace US military contributions if Washington exited the bloc, according to a study published on Thursday by a British think tank. The EU is planning a militarization drive, which it claims is necessitated by an alleged Russian threat.

Western European leaders have said member states must reduce their dependence on US weapons while implementing a massive increase in military spending. The proposed hike comes amid claims that Russia could attack a NATO member in the coming years. Moscow has denied the allegations and has accused the West of “irresponsibly stoking fears” of a fabricated threat.

The report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) outlines the challenges nations would encounter in the event the US withdraws from NATO to focus on confronting China.

According to the IISS, European nations – including the UK – would need to replace some 128,000 American troops, along with a wide array of weapon systems and command infrastructure currently provided by the Pentagon, particularly for air and naval forces.

”European states would need to invest significant resources on top of already existing plans to boost military capacity,” the report stated. The estimated price tag for replacing American weaponry alone ranges from $226 billion to $344 billion.

Domestic arms manufacturers would face difficulties securing contracts, financing, and skilled labor, while also grappling with regulatory and supply chain hurdles, the report warned. In certain sectors – such as stealth aircraft and rocket artillery – European NATO members currently lack viable alternatives, prompting the IISS to suggest outsourcing production to countries outside the bloc.

Beyond hardware, the study highlighted intangible but critical costs associated with command-and-control functions, space intelligence, and filling high-level leadership roles traditionally held by US officers.

The think tank questioned whether European governments possess the political will to ensure the vast spending required. The administration of US President Donald Trump has accused European NATO nations of taking advantage of American military protection without contributing enough in return.

On Thursday, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul stirred controversy by vowing to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, well above Germany's existing level of 2.1%. The statement, made following a NATO meeting, drew backlash, including from members of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius later stated that the exact percentage was “not so important” and that Berlin considered 3% to be a more realistic level.

Ukraine's European backers are considering imposing “punitive tariffs” on Russian exports as part of potential new sanctions set for discussion at the European Political Community summit in Albania on Friday, Politico has reported, citing EU officials.

Western countries have imposed widespread sanctions against Russia since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022 in a bid to isolate the country, but have held back from a total trade embargo. The restrictions include a ban on Russia's seaborne oil shipments, cutting the country off from the Western financial system, and freezing around $300 billion in foreign reserves.

The leaders of the UK, France, Germany, and Türkiye are meeting in the Albanian capital for an informal gathering on Friday, which is also being attended by Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky.

The talks in Tirana will focus on “dramatically” tightening sanctions against Moscow and include potential “punitive tariffs” on Russian imports, two EU officials told Politico.

EU ambassadors on Wednesday approved a 17th package of sanctions against Russia, which targets nearly 200 oil tankers that the West claims are part of a Russian “shadow fleet,” older vessels operating outside Western insurance systems.

The push for new sanctions has been inspired by US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has proposed “bone-crushing” measures, including imposing 500% tariffs on Russian exports if Moscow resists peace talks. The senator insisted that the goal was “to help the president [Donald Trump]” gain leverage on Russia.

“We would take inspiration from the magnitude” of his proposal, one official told Politico.

Earlier this week, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Western Europe and the US must “go further” and “prepare to brandish devastating sanctions” to “suffocate” the Russian economy “once and for all,” in order to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the Ukraine conflict.

“Russia has found ways around the blockade imposed by Europe and the United States. Turning off the tap in this way is a way of grabbing Russia by the throat,” he told French broadcaster BFMTV on Wednesday.  

Russia remains committed to seeking a long-term solution to the Ukraine conflict but will not tolerate being addressed in the “language of ultimatums,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week. He earlier noted that Russia is used to Western pressure and is not concerned about new sanctions.

In March, Putin said that a total of 28,595 sanctions had been imposed on Russian companies and individuals in recent years – more than the total number on all other countries combined. According to the president, the West sought to eliminate Russia as a competitor but its economy has only grown more resilient under pressure.

The BRICS group has become a leading platform for aligning the interests of the global majority, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday in a video message to participants of the 2nd BRICS Women's Entrepreneurship Forum.

With its current membership, Lavrov said, the organization now accounts for close to half of the planet's population and around 40% of global GDP in terms of purchasing power parity – surpassing the combined economic weight of the G7.

Given these figures, Lavrov argued, it is natural that BRICS continues to attract countries from the Global South and East, as many “seek equal and mutually beneficial partnerships for the sake of joint development.” 

“We view BRICS as a focal point for coordinating the interests of the World Majority's leading countries, a key pillar of a multipolar world, and an important mechanism for advancing genuinely multilateral cooperation,” Lavrov said.

He also emphasized that BRICS places particular focus on innovation and economic modernization, “sustainable finance, digitalization, and transport connectivity.”  Within that context, Lavrov highlighted women's entrepreneurship as a critical force for progress, not only within BRICS countries but globally.

“Women's entrepreneurship is one of the key drivers of progress in these and other areas,” the Russian foreign minister said.

According to Lavrov, the creativity, determination, and leadership qualities demonstrated by female entrepreneurs continues to unlock opportunities. Their work, he said, opens up “new horizons for the development of our countries' economies and social spheres.”

Lavrov also emphasized that the initiatives put forward at the forum will certainly be considered in the run-up to the BRICS summit scheduled for July 6–7 in Rio de Janeiro, and will “contribute to the collective efforts.” 

BRICS was established in 2009 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa joining in 2011. In 2024, the bloc extended its full membership to Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates. Nigeria and Uganda became partner states of BRICS in January 2025.

WASHINGTON, May 16. /TASS/. The US administration expects a meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to take place very soon, said Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the US president and senior director for counter terrorism.

""Deals are all about timing. When the time is right, that's when the president is in the room with Putin, but my expectation is imminently,"" he told an international security conference organized by the Politico newspaper.

When asked what he meant by ‘imminently,' Gorka lashed at the newspaper: ""That's all you're getting. I detest the Politico. <…> You are not going to get anything more from me than imminently.""

Commenting on whether Trump planned to attend the Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul, the White House official replied: ""No, because we need to have all the parties decide. One of the parties is missing, right? There is no point [in Trump's presence].""

""We need to make sure that there's no intransigence from all sides involved. But you can rest assured that when the final ink is put on that piece of paper [with agreements on Ukraine], President Trump will be the person, the man behind the art of the deal, who seals that deal,"" Gorka said.

Speaking about potential discussions on international recognition of Russia's sovereignty over Crimea and other territories, he said: ""I will not comment. <…> I'm the Senior Director for counterterrorism.""

""We're kind of exhausted that topic at this point. But I'll tell you this: we live in the real world. The Trump administration lives in the real world,"" the White House official continued. ""We recognize the reality on the ground, and we have one priority <…>, whether it's the Middle East or whether it's Ukraine, it's to stop the bloodshed. Everything else comes after the bloodshed has been halted.""

Order follows Pentagon's announcement of plan to remove 1,000 military members who openly identify as trans

US military commanders will be told to identify troops in their units who are transgender or have gender dysphoria, then send them to get medical checks in order to force them out of the service.

A senior defense official on Thursday laid out what could be a complicated and lengthy new process aimed at fulfilling Donald Trump's directive to remove transgender service members from the US military despite years of service alongside all the other 2 million US troops.

Earlier this month, the Pentagon announced plans to remove in short order the 1,000 members of the military who openly identify as trans, and giving those who have yet to so identify openly 30 days to remove themselves.

That memo was fueled by a supreme court decision allowing the Trump administration to enforce a ban on trans military members. The defense department has said it will follow up by going through medical records to identify others who have not come forward.

The latest order to commanders relies on routine annual health checks that service members are required to undergo. Another defense official said the Pentagon had scrapped – for now – plans to go through troops' health records to identify those with gender dysphoria.

Instead, transgender troops who do not voluntarily come forward could be outed by commanders or others aware of their medical status. Gender dysphoria occurs when a person's biological sex does not match their gender identity.

The defense officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details of the new policy. The process raises comparisons to the earlier “don't ask, don't tell” policy, which at times had commanders or other troops outing gay members of the military who at the time were not allowed to serve openly.

Active-duty troops will have until 6 June to voluntarily identify themselves to the defense department, and troops in the national guard and reserve have until 7 July.

The department is offering a financial incentive to those who volunteer to leave, although some who have put their hand up point out that it is far from genuinely voluntary. They will receive roughly double the amount of separation pay of those who do not come forward.


 A new question about gender dysphoria is being added to service members' annual health assessment. Active-duty troops who do not voluntarily come forward would have to acknowledge their gender dysphoria during that medical check, which could be scheduled months from now.

A unit commander could expedite the health assessment. Under the new policy, “commanders who are aware of service members in their units with gender dysphoria, a history of gender dysphoria, or symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria will direct individualized medical record reviews of such service members to confirm compliance with medical standards”.
 The defense official said it was the duty of the service member and the commander to comply with the new process.

Officials have said that as of 9 December 2024, there were 4,240 active-duty troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria national guard and reserve. But they acknowledge the actual number may be higher.

Trump tried to ban transgender troops during his first term, while allowing those currently serving to stay on. Joe Biden overturned the ban after he became president.

The new policy does not grandfather in those currently serving and only allows for limited waivers or exceptions.

Trump and his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, claim that transgender troops do not meet “military standards” with Hegseth stating baldly on social media: “No More Trans @ DoD” and denigrating transgender people during recent public comments.

Photo from Vietnam war is now at centre of controversy after documentary claimed it was taken by someone else

The World Press Photo group has suspended the attribution of authorship for one on the most famous press photographs ever taken, after a new documentary challenged 50 years of accepted journalism history.

The photo, officially titled The Terror of War but colloquially known as Napalm Girl, remains one of the most indelible images of the US war in Vietnam. Since its publication in June 1972, it has been officially attributed to Nick Ut, a Vietnamese photographer working with the Associated Press in Saigon.

The AP and Ut have long maintained that Ut, then 21 years old, took the photo, which went on to win the World Press Photo of the Year award in 1973 and established Ut as a venerable photojournalist.

But a recent documentary challenged that history, instead proposing that the photo, which depicts a naked nine-year-old girl named Phan Thi Kim Phuc as she flees a napalm attack in the South Vietnamese village of Trảng Bàng, was taken by a man named Nguyen Thành Nghe. The Stringer, which premiered at the Sundance film festival in January, claimed that Nghe, a stringer for NBC who was driving that day and who often sold photos to the AP on a freelance basis, was denied credit in favor of Ut because he was not AP staff.

The film prompted “deep reflection” at World Press Photo, which conducted its own investigation, the results of which were made public on Friday 16 May. The in-house analysis, conducted between January and May 2025, concluded “based on analysis of location, distance, and the camera used on that day” that “photographers Nguyễn Thành Nghệ or Huỳnh Công Phúc may have been better positioned to take the photograph than Nick Út.”

The suspension only applies to the photo's authorship, and does not rescind the 1973 Photo of the Year award. “The photograph itself remains undisputed,” the group said, “and the World Press Photo award for this significant photo of a major moment in 20th century history remains a fact.”

“Based on these findings and according to our values of accuracy, trustworthiness and diversity, we draw conclusions with regards to attribution,” Joumana El Zein Khoury, the group's executive director, said in a press release. “It is important to state that the picture itself is undisputed and it is without question that this photograph represents a real moment in history that continues to reverberate in Vietnam, the United States, and globally.”

Earlier this month, the Associated Press announced that it found “no definitive evidence” to warrant changing the photo's authorship, and released a 96-page report on the matter – its second in four months – based on its own internal investigation. The AP concluded that it was “possible” Ut took the photo, and found no evidence that Nguyen took it instead. The matter was unable to be proven conclusively, it added, due to the passage of time, the absence of key evidence, the limitations of technology and the deaths of several key people involved.

“We left nothing uncovered that we're aware of and we've done it with a great deal of respect to everybody involved,” said Derl McCrudden, an AP vice-president of global news production, in a statement. “It makes no difference to us if we changed the credit, but it has to be based on facts and evidence. And there is no definitive evidence proving that Nick Ut did not take this picture.”

The Stringer, directed by Bao Nguyen, enlisted several witnesses to argue that Nghe sold the photo to the Saigon bureau photo chief, Horst Faas, for $20 and a print, including Nghe's brother, who claims he brought the film to the AP; Nghe's daughter Jannie; Carl Robinson, a longtime AP photo editor in Saigon who first contacted the film-makers; and several of Robinson's former photojournalist colleagues. The investigators also consulted forensic experts with the French NGO Index, who found it “highly unlikely” that Ut took the photo based on the other images AP credited to him that day.

The AP conducted its own forensic investigation involving further interviews, the examination of cameras and surviving negatives from that day, and a 3D model of the scene. The resulting report revealed “inconsistencies on both sides” but concluded that buying Nghe's story would “require several leaps of faith”, such as believing that the only time he sold photos to a western news agency, it turned out to be one of the most famous images of the 20th century.

Nghe, who made a surprise appearance at the Stringer's Sundance premiere, confirms his account in the film. Ut, meanwhile, continues to maintain his authorship, and told the AP that the dispute “has been very difficult for me and has caused great pain”.

But for World Press Photo, the official author is now: unknown. “This remains contested history, and it is possible that the author of the photograph will never be fully confirmed,” the group said. “The suspension of the authorship attribution stands unless it is proved otherwise.”

 This article was amended on 16 May 2025. An earlier version described Nguyen Thành Nghe in 1972 as a “driver for NBC”; he was a stringer for NBC and a freelance photographer who was driving Nick Ut on the day the photo of Phan Thi Kim Phuc was taken.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ex-FBI director deletes Instagram post of shells in ‘8647' formation that Republicans claim is code for assassination

A now-deleted photo of seashells posted on Instagram by the former FBI director James Comey is being investigated by the US Secret Service, after the US homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said it constituted a “threat” against Donald Trump, and set off warnings from other administration officials.

On Thursday, Comey posted a photo of seashells forming the message “8647”, with a caption that read: “Cool shell formation on my beach walk.”

Trump's supporters have interpreted the message as an endorsement of violence against Trump, the 47th president, who survived an attempt on his life at a campaign event in Pennsylvania last year.

But the term 86 is a slang term far more often frequently used to mean getting rid of or throwing something out. It is thought to have its roots in the restaurant industry and is used to mean scrapping old equipment or not serving particular customers, as well as in a military context for stopping a mission or plan, often as a synonym for “nix”. Merriam-Webster notes that 86 has very occasionally been used to mean “to kill” but said it did not endorse that meaning “due to its relative recency and sparseness of use”.

A spokesperson for the Secret Service confirmed the agency was “aware of the incident” and said it would “vigorously investigate” any potential threat, but did not offer further details.

Comey later took down his post, saying in a statement that he was unaware of the seashells' potential meaning and saying that he does not condone violence of any kind.

“I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message,” Comey said in a statement. “I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me, but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.”

But the post ignited a firestorm on the right, with Trump loyalists accusing the former FBI director of calling for the president's assassination, with differing political interpretations of the message.

“Disgraced former FBI director James Comey just called for the assassination of POTUS Trump,” Noem wrote on X. “DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.”

The director of the FBI, Kash Patel, said his agency would “provide all necessary support” as part of an investigation headed by the Secret Service.

Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the presidential security agency, said on social media that the agency investigates anything that could be taken as a threat. “We are aware of the social media posts by the former FBI Director & we take rhetoric like this very seriously,” he added.

Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, said she didn't buy Comey's explanation that the message carried no greater meaning. Gabbard said Comey had “just issued a call to action to murder the president of the United States.”

As a former FBI director and someone who spent most of his career prosecuting mobsters and gangsters, he knew exactly what he was doing and must be held accountable under the full force of the law,” Gabbard posted on X.

Gabbard later told Fox News that Comey was “issuing a hit” on the president and that “the dangerousness of this cannot be underestimated.”

Comey's cryptic post comes as the former FBI director is about to publish FDR Drive, the third installment of a crime series about a fictional New York lawyer, Nora Carleton. Publisher's Weekly outlined the plot as centering on a US attorney who tries to bring to justice “a far-right media personality with a popular podcast vilifying those he thinks are destroying America: intellectuals, immigrants, and people of color”.

Comey and Trump have a deeply antagonistic relationship that stretches back to the early days of the first Trump administration, when, according to Comey, Trump sought to secure a pledge of loyalty from the then FBI director, who refused.

In a move that shocked Washington, Trump dismissed Comey, who was leading the criminal investigation into Russian meddling in the US election. Comey later wrote a memoir that recounted the episode, prompting Trump to declare him an “untruthful slime ball”.

Comey has remained a Maga world bete noire, drawing rightwing ire whenever he steps into the political fray.

Taylor Budowich, the White House deputy chief of staff, also responded by calling the photo “deeply concerning” and accused Comey of putting out “what can clearly be interpreted as ‘a hit' on the sitting President of the United States”.

The Tennessee congressman Tim Burchett, a staunch Trump supporter, called for Comey to be jailed. “Arrest Comey,” he wrote on X.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taiwan should be allowed to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an irreplaceable contributor to global health and disease prevention efforts, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) said yesterday.

He made the comment at a news conference in Taipei, hours before a Taiwanese delegation was to depart for Geneva, Switzerland, seeking to meet with foreign representatives for a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the WHA, the WHO's annual decisionmaking meeting, which would be held from Monday next week to May 27.

As of yesterday, Taiwan had yet to receive an invitation.

Taiwan has much to offer to the international community's efforts to protect the world's collective health, and its exclusion from the WHA has been a loss to all nations, Lin said.

The nation's healthcare system covers 99 percent of the population and has a proven record in providing for disadvantaged people and ethnic minorities, he said, adding that it could benefit the WHA's Global Plan of Action for Health of Indigenous Peoples.

China has for years distorted UN Resolution 2758 to pressure the WHA into excluding Taiwan from its proceedings, but Taiwan's democratically elected government should be the sole representative of its people, Lin said.

The resolution applies only to the representation of China in the UN, not Taiwan's, and many have challenged the falsehoods perpetuated by Beijing's legal and cognitive warfare, he said.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus should heed the call of professionalism and political neutrality, and reject Beijing's meddling, Lin said, adding the global common good should take precedence over other concerns.

Taiwan's key role in global chip supply chains makes it a crucial partner in any worldwide public health initiative, he said, citing the nation's participation in the Global Cooperation and Training Framework alongside Japan, Australia, Canada and other countries.

Minister of Health and Welfare Chiu Tai-yuan (邱泰源) said that Taiwan's exclusion from the WHA is an injustice to the nation and robs the world of the benefits it could have obtained from one of the foremost practitioners of disease prevention and public health.

The government will not give up the fight for the Taiwanese whose universal right to health must not be denied, he said.

Asked about Washington's pullout from the WHO, Lin said that the US' support for Taiwan remains unchanged, as its membership in the organization is valid until the end of the year.

In February, the US envoy to the WHO again expressed Washington's support for Taipei's participation in the organization and criticized Beijing's mischaracterization of the UN resolution, he said.

The US remains capable of wielding influence outside the WHO and Taiwan would be the first to join any alternative global health framework Washington creates, Lin said.

Taiwan can share information about health matters and be involved in deliberations on global health policy without being part of the WHO, he added.

Health is a human right and the government will not give that up with or without being invited to attend the assembly, Lin said.

Chiu said Taiwan's delegation would host a forum on the nation's experience in universal health coverage and in applying artificial intelligence to healthcare, adding that Japan, Thailand, the US, the UK, Germany and Switzerland would attend the event.

Ranked 19th in the world, the Taiwanese duo defeated Kang Min-hyuk and Ki Dong-ju of South Korea 21-18, 21-15 in a pulsating 43-minute final to clinch their first doubles title after teaming up last year.
Wang, the men's doubles gold medalist at the 2020 and 2024 Olympics, partnered with Chiu in August last year after the retirement of his teammate Lee Yang                                    


FALSE DOCUMENTS?

The New Taipei City District Prosecutors' Office in January launched an investigation into a group that was allegedly helping men dodge compulsory military service using falsified medical documents.
Actor Darren Wang (王大陸) has been accused of being one of the group's clients.
As the investigation expanded, investigators at New Taipei City's Yonghe Precinct said that other entertainers commissioned the group to obtain false documents.

The number of newborns totaled 8,684, which is 704 births fewer than in March and the lowest monthly figure on record, the ministry said.
That is equivalent to roughly one baby born every five minutes and an annual crude birthrate of 4.52 per 1,000 people, the ministry added.

Iran was yesterday set to hold talks with the UK, France and Germany in Turkey, after US President Donald Trump said a nuclear deal with Tehran was “getting close.”

The Istanbul meeting follows Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi's warning of “irreversible” consequences if the European powers move to reimpose UN sanctions on Iran that were lifted under a 2015 deal. 

However, Trump torpedoed the deal during his first term in 2018 by unilaterally abandoning it and reimposing sanctions on Iran's banking sector and oil exports.

A year later, Iran responded by rolling back its own commitments under the deal, which provided relief from sanctions in return for UN-monitored restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities.

The three European powers have been weighing whether to trigger the 2015 deal's “snapback” mechanism, which would reinstate UN sanctions in response to Iranian non-compliance — an option that expires in October.

Such a stance “risks provoking a global nuclear proliferation crisis that would primarily affect Europeans themselves,” Araghchi warned. 

However, writing in the French weekly news magazine Le Point, he also said that Tehran was “ready to turn the page” in its relations with Europe.

Yesterday's meeting with the European powers comes less than a week after a fourth round of Iran-US nuclear talks which Tehran called “difficult but useful,” and after which a US official said Washington was “encouraged.” 

Araghchi said yesterday's talks would be at deputy foreign ministers level.

Speaking on a visit to Qatar on Thursday, Trump said the US was “getting close” to a deal with Iran that would avert military action.

“We're not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran,” he said.

The Oman-mediated Iran-US talks were the highest-level contact between the two sides since Washington abandoned the nuclear accord in 2018.

Since returning to office, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” policy on Tehran, backing nuclear diplomacy, but warning of military action if it fails.

On Thursday, US news Web site Axios reported that the Trump administration had given Iran a “written proposal” for a deal during the fourth round of talks.

Araghchi denied the report, saying “we have not been given anything.” 

However, he added that “we are ready to build trust and transparency about our nuclear programme in response to the lifting of sanctions.”

Trump has said he presented Iran's leadership with an “olive branch,” adding that it was an offer that would not last forever. He further threatened to impose “massive maximum pressure,” including driving Iranian oil exports to zero if talks failed. 

Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 percent, far above the 3.67 percent limit set in the 2015 deal, but below the 90 percent needed for a nuclear warhead.

Tehran insists its right to continue enriching uranium for peaceful purposes is “non-negotiable,” but says it would be open to temporary restrictions on how much uranium it enriches and to what level. 

On Wednesday, Iranian atomic energy agency chief Mohammad Eslami reiterated that Tehran “does not seek nuclear militarization,” adding that enrichment was under the supervision of the UN nuclear watchdog. 

“The dismantling of enrichment is not accepted by Iran,” he said.


EUROPEAN FUTURE?

The artist-turned-politician has been pitching Albania as a trendy coastal destination, which has helped to drive up tourism arrivals to a record 11 million last year.

The Socialist Party won 52.1 percent of the vote on Sunday compared with 34.2 percent for an alliance of opposition parties led by his main rival Sali Berisha, according to results released by the Albanian Central Election Commission.
Diaspora votes have yet to be counted, but according to initial results, Rama was also leading there.
According to projections, the Socialist Party could have more lawmakers than in 2021 elections. At the time, it won 74 seats in the

Most of the public have a favorable view of President William Lai (賴清德), with satisfaction rates particularly high for his handling of national defense, safeguarding of Taiwan's sovereignty, and dealing with foreign affairs, including his China policies, a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) poll showed yesterday ahead of the one-year anniversary of his inauguration.

Lai's approval rating was 57.3 percent, up from 46.7 percent last month, despite global economic turmoil over US tariff policies, with the approval ratings for all of his major policies garnering more than 50 percent, DPP spokeswoman Han Ying (韓瑩) said.

His disapproval rating was 40.2 percent, Han said, citing data from the poll.

Lai's administration has led Taiwan forward over the past year, despite ever-changing global issues, Chinese intimidation and opposition parties holding a majority in the legislature, Han added.

Lai received particularly high ratings for his policies to bolster national defense, with 64.5 percent approving against 31.1 percent disapproving; 63.9 percent approval for safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty versus 32.6 percent disapproving; and 58.4 percent approving of the establishment of the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee and 31.3 percent disapproving, she said.

Endorsement of Lai's policies was especially high among young people, with 74.4 percent and 73.9 percent of the 20-to-29 age group backing the national defense and civilian defense committee policies respectively, Han said.

His approval was 60.6 percent for foreign affairs initiatives, while 34.2 percent disapproved.

On cross-strait policies, his approval rating was 56.3 percent versus 37.7 percent disapproving, she said.

Female respondents on average backed Lai's policies by 5 to 10 percentage points more than their male counterparts for his policies on national defense, sovereignty, foreign affairs and cross-strait dealings, she said.

The survey was conducted on Monday and Tuesday, garnering 1,055 valid responses from people aged 20 or older nationwide.

Interviews were conducted via landline or mobile phone. The poll had a 3 percent margin of error and a confidence level of 95 percent.

Separately, the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) told a news conference in Taipei that a rally would be held on Monday to urge Lai to step down.

A motorcade destined for DPP headquarters would depart from KMT headquarters in the afternoon, it said, calling on drivers joining the rally to honk twice at 5:20pm to express their anger toward the Lai government.

KMT Secretary-General Justin Huang (黃健庭) said the past year has been the darkest time in Taiwan's history and the nation's democracy has been severely compromised.

The Lai government has focused on power struggles, ignoring the economy and people's livelihoods, while creating social confrontations by abusing the judiciary and promoting a mass recall campaign, Huang said.

The government “knelt down” before any negotiations began when the US announced its tariffs, allowing US President Donald Trump to take as much as he liked, he said.

“You can never wake someone who is pretending to be asleep,” KMT spokeswoman Yang Chih-yu said, explaining the decision to call for people to sound their horns in protest.

The government would provide full scholarships for international students to further their studies for two years in Taiwan, so those who want to pursue a master's degree can consider applying for the program, he said.
The fields included are science, technology, engineering, mathematics, semiconductors and finance, Yeh added.
The program, called “Intense 2+2,” would also assist international students who completed the two years of further studies in

Tsai arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport on Friday night, but did not speak to reporters before departing.
Tsai wrote on social media later that the purpose of the trip was to reaffirm the commitment of Taiwanese to working with democratic allies to promote regional security and stability, upholding freedom and democracy, and defending their homeland.
She also expressed hope that through joint efforts, Taiwan and Europe would continue to be partners building up economic resilience on the global stage.

Ukrainian and Russian delegations concluded their talks in Istanbul on May 16 after speaking for less than two hours, with no agreement reached on a full, 30-day ceasefire, and Moscow demanding Kyiv withdraw completely from Ukraine's four oblasts that President Vladimir Putin claims to have annexed.

A source in the Ukrainian President's Office briefed on the talks confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Moscow's delegation insisted that Ukraine retreat from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, despite Russia not controlling any of them in their entirety.

The Kremlin illegally declared the annexation of the four oblasts  following sham referenda in late 2022, incorporating them into Russia's constitution — a move that holds no weight internationally.

Despite the demands, the source said the Ukrainian delegation's ""impression was that (the Russian) delegation simply didn't have any real authority.""

""They now need to return to Moscow, just to figure out what they can even say in response to what they heard here,"" they added.

According to the source, during the talks, Ukraine offered an immediate ceasefire, an all-for-all prisoner exchange and to hold a face-to-face meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin.

In one positive development, Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement for the exchange of prisoners of war (POWs) on a 1,000-for-1,000 basis, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, who was leading Ukraine's delegation, told reporters after the talks on May 16.

""We know the date, but we're not going to say it yet,"" he said.

Soon after, Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Russian delegation, confirmed the agreed exchange in comments to Russian state media.

After the talks ended, Zelensky and several top European leaders held a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, the Ukrainian leader announced on Telegram.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk joined Zelensky during the call.

""Ukraine is ready to take the fastest possible steps for real peace, and it is important that the world holds strong positions,"" Zelensky wrote.

""If the Russians refuse a complete and unconditional stop to the fire and killings, there must be strong sanctions. Pressure on Russia must be maintained until Russia is ready to end the war.""

Soon after Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk echoed the condemnation of Russia's unwillingness to stop the fighting.

""The Russians in Istanbul have de facto broken off negotiations and refused to cease fire,"" Tusk wrote on X. ""Time to increase the pressure.""

No further details were provided about the content or duration of the call.

""Trump still hopes something can be done,"" the source in the President's Office said.

According to the source, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Keith Kellogg see the situation as it is. The same source said that Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is, in turn, ""overpromising.""

After Moscow proposed to hold peace talks in Turkey this week, Zelensky agreed and invited Putin for a face-to-face meeting. The Russian leader declined to attend and appointed his aide, Medinsky, to lead the talks.

The Russian delegation included deputy ministers and lower-level aides and excluded top officials like Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Zelensky commented that Moscow has dispatched a ""sham delegation,"" while Western officials presented the move as an indication that Putin is not serious about peace efforts.

Though Zelensky has since then left for Albania, a Ukrainian delegation, including Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, and Umerov, has arrived in Istanbul to meet the Russian delegates.

The Ukrainian delegation also held meetings with U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier in the day.

Kyiv and its allies have urged Moscow to adopt an unconditional ceasefire starting May 12 as the first step toward peace talks — a proposal Russia has ignored.

While Ukrainian officials said they hope to discuss a possible truce in Istanbul, Russia presented the meeting as the continuation of the 2022 talks and stressed the need to address what it sees as the ""root causes"" of the war.

The Kremlin unveiled its delegation for Ukraine-Russia peace talks in a decree signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 14.

Russia has not shared who it would send to negotiations in Turkey up until now. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 14 that Kyiv will determine its next steps in Ukraine-Russia peace talks when Moscow unveils its delegation.

Putin was not on the list of delegates, nor were any other top-ranking Russian officials. 

Moscow announced that their delegation would be headed by presidential advisor and propaganda architect, Vladimir Medinsky.

The Russian delegation will also consist of Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, Military Intelligence Director Igor Kostyukov, and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin.

The delegation is notably void of the Kremlin's top politicians, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, was also absent from the list.

Putin has refused calls for a ceasefire and instead insists peace negotiations begin before a ceasefire is implemented.

In response, Zelensky has said he will travel to Turkey for the peace talks, and has invited Putin to meet him there.

So far, Russia has given no signal that Putin will be present at the peace negotiations on May 15.

Russia has said the May 15 talks would be a resumption of 2022 peace negotiations held in Turkey at the onset of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine in February 2022.

According to the leaked 2022 peace draft proposal, both sides agreed to exclude Crimea from the treaty, leaving it under Russian occupation without Ukraine recognizing Russian sovereignty over it. 

The status of other Russian-occupied territories was to be decided in later talks between presidents Zelensky and Putin.

The treaty would reportedly see Ukraine abandon aspirations to join NATO or any other military alliance, but allow for EU entry.

Russia also demanded the lifting of all sanctions, repealing Kyiv's laws related to language and national identity, and limiting Ukraine's Armed Forces.

The negotiations were unsuccessful and did not lead to the signing of any agreements. After that, there were no direct talks between Ukraine and Russia.

The meeting between Zelensky and Putin, if it occurs, could signal a breakthrough in stalled diplomatic efforts to end Russia's full-scale invasion.

The last and only face-to-face meeting between Zelensky and Putin occurred in December 2019 in Paris under the Normandy Format. Since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, there have been no direct meetings between the two.

Russian authorities have listed maximalist demands in previous ceasefire negotiations brokered by the U.S.

Brazilian President Lula da Silva has said he will ask Putin to go to Turkey for peace talks with Zelensky.

The sixth meeting of the European Political Community will focus on Europe's security, including Russia's ongoing full-scale war against Ukraine, among other topics.

The summit comes as Ukrainian and Russian delegations are expected to hold talks in Istanbul for the first time since 2022. Turkish and U.S. officials will also reportedly join the series of discussions.

Zelensky's visit follows his trip to Turkey, where he met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Although a face-to-face meeting between Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin was anticipated in Istanbul, Putin instead sent a delegation led by his aide, Vladimir Medinsky.

Kyiv and its partners have urged Moscow to adopt an unconditional 30-day ceasefire as the first step toward a broader peace deal, a move that Russia continues to reject.

In South Africa, a pregnant woman arrives for an HIV test – and possible treatment, if needed – only to find the clinic shuttered. 

Further north in Sudan, where millions are suffering from starvation, 80 per cent of the country's community kitchens are closed weeks after funding cuts announced by the U.S. 

Half a world away in Vancouver, home ownership dreams have been dashed, with deposits being returned on presale condos. In Ottawa, a dad attending a hockey game with his young son must explain why fans are booing the other team's national anthem. A Canadian family's promised trip to Disneyland is cancelled. A duty-free shop at the Canada-U.S. border goes into receivership. 

In a Boston suburb, a Tufts University doctoral student from Turkey is snatched off the street by immigration agents.

Welcome to the past four months of life with Donald Trump in power. The collective shock of this rapid change has dulled in the U.S. President's lobster-pot world, which is heating up to the boiling point. Still, it is astounding that one man can cause so much disruption, so much upset, so much grief. He has made the world so much worse – and so quickly.

Anyone who has had the great misfortune of being raised by or married to an abusive person knows how the energy in a room can change with his every twitch (and yes, it's usually a man): how he might blow up at the slightest provocation, his volatile mood permeating the home or the event, cowing everyone as they walk on eggshells. This is what we are living through in the Donald Trump 2.0 era. Only it's not Christmas dinner he's ruining. The world is Mr. Trump's room now. 

A stock-market rollercoaster, lost jobs, a dismantled federal civil service and the possibility of a global recession have caused everything from fears of toy shortages at Christmas to a proliferation of yard sales in the Washington, D.C. region as laid off workers pack up and move away to less expensive regions – or, for reasons beyond the economy, Canada. 

One man, propped up by soulless sycophants, has managed to infect everything from the programming at the once-great Kennedy Center to attendance at the annual Blue Jays-Mariners showdown in Seattle to actual marriages that are struggling to survive suddenly unnavigable political rifts. 

“Make America great again?” More like “throw the Earth into chaos.”

In a matter of weeks, Mr. Trump has upended the world order. Under the leadership of one nasty, incoherent narcissist, the U.S. has gone from its decades-long role as a great (if flawed) democracy – one that was seen, generally, as trying to use its powers for good – to a nation to be feared, not respected. 

One can imagine that, rather than feel shame or guilt as lives are upended everywhere, Mr. Trump is the kind of person who would get a kick out of it. Look at how powerful I am!

History will study this time and wonder: How did people let that man get away with all of this? Didn't they see?

We see. And yet.

A composite image of five photographs show former members of Canada's 2018 World Juniors hockey team, left to right, Alex Formenton, Cal Foote, Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube and Carter Hart as they individually arrived to court in London, Ont., Wednesday, April 30, 2025.Nicole Osborne/The Canadian Press

Justice Maria Carroccia has dismissed a jury for the second time in the sexual assault trial of five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team.

The case will proceed by judge alone.

Justice Carroccia made the announcement on Friday morning.

The decision comes after a juror handed the judge a note on Thursday that accused two of the defence lawyers, Daniel Brown and Hilary Dudding, of inappropriate behaviour in the courtroom.

The note read: “Multiple jury members feel we are being judged and made fun of by lawyers Brown and Hilary Dudding. Every day when we enter the courtroom they observe us, whisper to each other and turn to each other and laugh as if they are discussing our appearance. This is unprofessional and unacceptable.”

During legal arguments on Thursday, both lawyers, who are representing Alex Formenton, categorically denied the accusation and Justice Carroccia said she has not witnessed any inappropriate conduct.

After Justice Carroccia made her ruling, Mr. Brown released a statement in which he called the allegations against him and Ms. Dudding an “unfortunate misinterpretation.”

Mr. Brown said that he and his co-counsel have “found ourselves involved in the unusual chain of events that led to this outcome. In short, a juror came to somehow believe that our courtroom demeanor was disrespectful of her.”

He added that “no defence counsel would risk alienating a juror, and nothing could be further from the truth in this instance. While it is true that co-counsel will speak with one another from time to time during a trial, this is commonplace. The very idea of counsel making light of a juror is illogical and runs directly counter to our purpose and function.”

The turn of events comes just days after the now 27-year-old complainant in the case, who is known publicly as E.M., finished nine days of testimony. Seven of those days were spent under what was often gruelling cross-examination by five defence lawyers.

It was the latest interruption in a case that was already upended when a mistrial was declared last month, just as the Crown called its first witness.

Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Mr. Formenton, Dillon Dubé and Cal Foote have each been charged with sexual assaulting E.M. in a downtown London hotel room after a Hockey Canada gala in June, 2018. Mr. McLeod faces a second charge of being a party to sexual assault.

The men have pleaded not guilty.

Throughout the trial, a standard publication ban has been in place that prevents the media from reporting on anything that occurs in court when the jury is not present. Now that the proceedings are going forward by judge-alone, that restriction is no longer in place and the details of what caused the first mistrial can be made public.

That incident also involved the defence counsel for Mr. Formenton.

On April 23, shortly after Crown attorney Heather Donkers finished making the prosecution's opening remarks, court was recessed for the noon break. When the judge returned, she was notified of an interaction between one of the jurors and Ms. Dudding at the Covent Garden Market, a popular lunchtime spot that is located a few blocks away from the courthouse. The pair had ended up in the same line at one of the vendors. What happened next is disputed.

The juror, who earlier in the day as part of the jury instructions from Justice Carroccia, had been warned not to speak to anyone from the court, including the lawyers, had made a complaint to the court sheriff about the interaction, which was relayed to the judge.

Justice Carroccia then brought the juror into court without the rest of the jurors to explain what happened. The juror told the judge that while at the market, a woman who was wearing court robes turned to her and said: “There was a lot of head shaking going on this morning.” (The sheriff said the juror told her: “A lady approached her” and said: “There was a lot of head nodding.”) The juror told the judge she understood she wasn't supposed to say anything so she closed her mouth and nodded.

This juror identified Ms. Dudding — who was sitting among the defence attorneys — in the courtroom as the individual she interacted with in line.

Ms. Dudding, who is an experienced trial litigator, emphatically denied this account. In Ms. Dudding's version of events, she was standing in line and realized a juror was standing closely behind her. In a reflexive reaction, she told the court she said something to the affect of “Oops, I'm sorry” and “It's awkward.”

In court, the juror told the judge that after the interaction, she took her lunch order and sat down at a nearby table in the market. She said a second juror joined her and she relayed what happened.

“I just said to her that she (Ms. Dudding) approached me and said that there was head shaking going on. And I just said, ‘as soon as she started talking to me, I didn't say anything back to her' is all I said,” the juror told the judge.

She said she remembered that the second juror replied: “It didn't seem right.”

The judge also called the second juror into court to describe the events. In her telling, the first juror told her: “A person said to her there's an awful lot of nodding going on.”

She said she believed the interaction seemed “inappropriate.”

Court then heard that, after lunch, all the jurors were together back at the court and began discussing what had transpired at the market.

Justice Carroccia adjourned court early, explaining that an issue had come up over the lunch hour that she needed time to consider and that she needed to discuss with the lawyers.

The judge and lawyers met for legal arguments in court the next day.

Crown lawyer Meaghan Cunningham asserted that a “corrective instruction” from the judge to the jury — in other words, telling jurors that they should put the incident out of their minds — would be sufficient to move forward with the trial.

In summarizing the Crown's position, the judge said: “The Crown submits that there is no basis to believe that either of the involved jurors or the other members of the jury hold any belief or are now biased against the defense.”

However, defence lawyer Megan Savard, who spoke for the lawyers representing the accused players, said there was no way that court could move forward. Ms. Savard stated that while she believed Ms. Dudding's version of events, it didn't matter because there was now a credibility contest between the juror and a defence lawyer.

Ms. Savard also argued that the juror's account — and apparent propensity to gossip — raised questions about their ability to hear and consider facts.

In reaching her decision, Justice Carroccia found that she had no choice but to declare a mistrial.

Simply removing one or both of the jurors involved in the market interaction would not have fixed the problem and a corrective instruction would have been insufficient, she said.

“My concern is that the circumstances of this case give rise to the possibility that one or more members of the jury may harbour negative feelings about defense counsel that could potentially impact on their ability to fairly decide the case,” she said. “Justice requires that I declare a mistrial in this case and begin the trial again. Accordingly, the motion for a mistrial is granted.”

A man living in a tent eats as his dog stands nearby, in Vancouver, on Feb. 14.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Shelley Wood is a writer and journalist whose most recent novel is The Leap Year Gene.

I'm a bleeding-heart liberal, voting green or orange, or strategically red. I'm also fortunate: I make a good living and am happy to be taxed to help improve the lives around me. Most of my family and friends share my sociopolitical views, which is comfortable and reaffirming.

Lately, however, I've sensed a subtle shifting of the plates in my social-justice core, relating to a specific quadrant of lefty groupthink: the dual crisis of addiction and homelessness.

To be clear, I accept, absolutely, that addiction is a disease, stigmatized too long while pharmaceutical companies and organized crime reap the profits. Compassionately and ethically addressing opioid addiction and the enmeshed problems of mental illness, domestic violence, intergenerational trauma, colonialism, poverty and more – compounded by a toxic drug supply – deserve the same resources, research and moon-shot ambitions of cancer or COVID-19. On top of that, the lack of affordable housing, emergency shelters and addiction treatment in Canada's cities is a shameful situation in need of lasting solutions at all levels of government.

What I've been wrestling with, privately, is whether I and my socially minded comrades are unintentionally part of the problem.

I trace the start of my quiet doubts to the days when people without housing began pitching their tents in municipal parks in cities across Canada. I and my friends expressed horror and outrage when bulldozers arrived to evict the tent cities. We all knew this was an assault on human dignity – these tents were the closest thing camp denizens had to homes and a community. How could they be destroyed by state powers when unhoused folks had nowhere else to go?

Yet a tiny voice in my head, one I wouldn't dare to speak aloud, asked: but parks? Surely we can do better: find better locations, better shelter? Still, I reasoned, when I have so much, maybe this was a small price for a temporary, urgent solution?

Then I started noticing changes in my husband. He used to keep old winter jackets in his car to offer to people sleeping rough. He'd buy two hot drinks at Starbucks, giving one to the guy panhandling out front. He convinced his family-run business to cover Kelowna's Gospel Mission's hot meals program. In recent years, however, he's spent most workday mornings cleaning excrement, trash, and drug paraphernalia from his shopfront before opening for business in downtown Kelowna. He's had thousands of dollars of product stolen. He's spent more repairing damaged property, much of it done by the same small group, their crimes deemed too small to warrant sentencing. His compassion has waned while his vitriol mounted.

I, too, am learning vitriol. Earlier this year, three men on bicycles with trailers (captured on neighbour's cameras) broke into our home while we were out of town. Over the course of 24 hours, the footage suggests, they ransacked, showered, ate from our pantry, used the beds, left feces in our toilets and soiled clothes on the floor. They stole computers, phones, stereos, jewellery, family heirlooms, and tellingly: almost all our warm winter jackets and boots. They emptied our freezer and liquor cabinet, then stole our cars to transport their haul.

To the homeless encampment. At least, that's where my work IT guy tracked my computer. Our cars, too, were found – by my brother-in-law, not the police – parked at the camp, as were the thieves' bikes and trailers, easily identifiable from security footage.

The RCMP officer assigned to our case called it the worst “home invasion” he'd ever seen, yet no one followed up with neighbours' videos and had to be cajoled into taking beer cans for fingerprinting. Ninety days after the break-in, he banged on our door at 9 p.m. to say he needed us to sign a paper to extend the request: Months had gone by yet the evidence hadn't even been analyzed. Another officer warned us not to expect a conviction, even if RCMP identified subjects and pressed charges. We've heard this before. One man caught stealing from my husband's downtown business had been charged with “petty” theft over 200 times.

Nor did the RCMP try to track down our stolen items in the encampment – to do so, they explained, would infringe on reasonable expectations of privacy in the camp. Indeed, many people I've told about our situation have stories of friends or family members who've gone to the encampment themselves to try to find and buy back their stolen goods. One officer told us the best chance of retrieving our stuff will be if one of the perpetrators dies of an overdose: A corpse would allow them to enter the tent to claim stolen items.

This is a profoundly broken situation. I am persuaded by the evidence in support of harm reduction that treats addiction as a medical problem, promoting human rights while seeking to curb the risks of infections, overdose, criminalization and stigma. For harm reduction to succeed, however, it needs buy-in not only from those with substance addiction, but also from community members paying taxes aimed at ameliorating the problem.

And we need to be open to reassessing what's working and what's not. One example making headlines is British Columbia's well-intentioned but poorly thought-through “safe supply” program. While safe supply has no doubt helped many people with drug addiction to obtain prescribed, non-toxic medications for personal use, it's had unintended consequences. According to a recent class action lawsuit and the RCMP, lethal doses of “safe” opiate prescriptions are making their way onto the streets with dire consequences for first-time users and vulnerable youth, increasing the risk of overdose and further taxing emergency services, social workers, and hospitals.

“That's what you get for legalizing drugs,” sniffed a manager at my bank when we went to check our account security after the break-in.

In fact, decriminalization has seen more success in places like Portugal, largely because it was accompanied by heavy investment in addiction treatment services and assertive measures to engage people living with addictions who are found to be contributing to social problems. Portuguese decriminalization was also commitment to public safety. Critically, Portugal decriminalized drug possession but considered all drug crime illegal and punishable, enacting “dissuasion commissions” to tailor rehabilitation needs, stipulate penalties, and minimize community impact. By contrast, British Columbia's incomplete approach – decriminalization and safe supply – hasn't done enough to protect high-risk youth, fund effective and accessible treatment interventions, or prioritize public safety.

I'm wrestling with all of this. I need people who know more about this than I do to do better, even if it means trying new approaches and abandoning the ones that haven't moved the needle.

But there's the catch. For Canada to invest in the full tool kit required to combat addiction, it needs the backing of citizens who care about a healthy, equitable society.

I fear that's what's slipping.

The public price has become too high; hearts like mine are at risk of bleeding dry.

As more people end up as collateral damage to B.C.'s floundering approach to this complex problem, support inevitably wanes. Worse, the best state efforts to support those dealing with unaffordable housing, addiction, or both, may have unwittingly created a situation where hardened criminals can operate with impunity within the very services and supports that tax dollars sustain. As crimes go unchecked and compassion erodes, criminality is conflated with homelessness, lawlessness with addiction, creating an infectious muck of distrust and anger that helps no one, least of all the very people at highest need.

My husband and I are still tabulating our losses, both the financial and intangible. I lost digital photos of loved ones. I lost keepsakes, mostly worthless, that held priceless memories. As a woman, I lost my sense of safety and security in my own home – the very thing that might, in other circumstances, cement my empathy for those trying to survive on Canada's streets. But the biggest loss? My compassion, now doing battle with a toxic blend of grief, disgust and rage.

This issue deserved to be an election issue last month, and it was, but the rhetoric – as always – was divisive. Neither of the prospective prime ministers offered creative, comprehensive, collaborative proposals that might risk rankling their base, any more than they could admit to decades of past missteps by successive governing parties. 

Because that's the kicker: Caring for people living without shelter, driven to desperate acts by their illness, is not the purview of left or right leaning people. Caring is bipartisan, or should be. But if people stop caring, particularly people putting their faith in strong social supports, donating to their local charities, and committed to a kind and compassionate Canada – then we are all the poorer for it.

Despite the efforts of its organizers, the Eurovision Song Contest in Switzerland's Basel has not been free of politics. Here's an overview of an unusual start, protests against Israel's artist and controversial songs.

The Eurovision Song Contest is heading into the home stretch. The second semifinal took place on May 15, with the final scheduled for Saturday. Out of a total 37 participating countries, 26 made it into the final.

As the biggest financial contributors to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which hosts the contest, Germany, Italy, the UK, France and Spain all received an automatic entry into the final, as did Switzerland as the previous year's winner.

The other participants are Norway, Luxembourg, Estonia, Israel, Lithuania, Ukraine, Austria, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Finland, Poland, Greece, Armenia, Malta, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Albania and San Marino.

A total of 160 million viewers from around the world are expected to tune into the broadcast from Basel at 9 p.m. local time and vote for their favorite act. 

Before the week of competition, the artists from the 37 participating countries all gathered at the official opening ceremony last Sunday on the stage of the St. Jakobshalle in Basel, Switzerland. The event was designed to reflect the festive and inclusive nature of the competition. But it did not remain unclouded.

For this year's edition, the organizers came up with something special. Instead of having the artists walk across a turquoise Eurovision carpet in the presence of accredited journalists and selected fans, they organized a parade through the city center.

The participants presented themselves on a turquoise catwalk in front of the town hall, then got into vintage cars and retro streetcars driving them along the almost 1.5-kilometer (around 1 mile) route over the Rhine bridge to the contest venue — accompanied by brass bands, traditional costume groups and carnival clubs — strolling past some 100,000 spectators.

Those spectators lining the streets were holding the usual flags of the participating nations, as well as LGBTQ+ pride flags. But there were also Palestinian flags and signs accusing Eurovision of complicity in genocide.

Such expressions of protest were sparked by Israel's participation in the song contest. Israeli artist Yuval Raphael was booed in front of Basel city hall, and there were threatening gestures and attempts to halt the streetcar she was on, but no serious incidents.

Only a few hundred protesters have taken to the streets, in contrast to last year's Eurovision in Malmo, Sweden where thousands marched through the city center for several days. Israel's representative at the time, Eden Golan, also felt the wrath of other Eurovision participants.

To prevent a repeat of similar incidents this year, Eurovision organizer, the EBU, required artists, members of official delegations and journalists to sign a code of conduct to ensure respectful interaction. One of the central points of this code is the prohibition of any political statements.

""The European Song Contest respects freedom of expression as a fundamental right. The participants retain their right to freedom of expression outside the competition,"" the document states.

Because of that stance by the EBU, the article on Raphael on the official Eurovision website avoids mention of a crucial experience in the 24-year-old's life: The singer survived the Hamas terrorist attack on the Supernova festival on October 7, 2023, as she lay underneath the bodies of murdered young people for several hours.

Israel's military operation of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks was what triggered protests at the 2024 Eurovision in Malmo. This year, Spanish broadcaster RTVE called for a debate for the first time on the participation of Israeli broadcaster KAN in the competition. According to official Eurovision Song Contest rules, individual broadcasters take part in the event, rather than the countries where they are located.

A few days before the start of this year's contest, more than 70 former participants, musicians and songwriters called for Israel to be excluded. They accused the EBU of double standards, given that Russia was banned from the competition after it launched its war on Ukraine in 2022.

The demand to exclude Israel was later joined by last year's Eurovision winner, Switzerland's Nemo.

In response, Eurovision director Martin Green reiterated his support for the Israeli broadcaster and emphasized that it was not the EBU's job to compare conflicts. The EBU had justified the exclusion of Russia's Channel One TV broadcaster and the Rossiya channel from the Eurovision Song Contest due to noncompliance with the principles of public broadcasters.

Compared with that debate, the indignation of Gian Marco Centinaio from Italy's right-wing populist League party over Estonian rapper Tommy Cash is no more than a storm in a teacup.

In his song ""Espresso Macchiato,"" Cash makes fun of common Italian cliches and Italians. ""I work around the clock, so I sweat like a mafioso"" was a line that particularly upset Centinaio, and he demanded that the Estonian be excluded from the competition. However, Estonia is unlikely to face sanctions.

Finnish trio KAJ, performing for Sweden, are also taking aim at a national idiosyncrasy: In the song ""Bara Bada Bastu,"" they poke fun at the Finns' love of saunas. So far, this folk-pop composition, leaning more towards the folk end of the spectrum, is the bookies' absolute favorite. It could just be Sweden's eighth win in this competition, which would be a record.

Erika Vikman, also from Finland, sings the bombastic ""Ich komme,"" German for ""I'm coming,"" which is an allusion to the sexual climax. According to reports, Eurovision organizers have asked her to make the staging, her costume and the choreography a little less sexually suggestive. Will she tone it down?

Twenty-four-year-old Miriana Conte from Malta, on the other hand, was forced to change the title of her R&B-style song. The original title, ""Kant,"" which means ""singing"" in Maltese, is a vulgar term for the female sexual organ in English — albeit spelled differently. The British broadcaster BBC complained that ""Serving Kant"" was in bad taste for a family show. And so the song is now only called ""Serving,"" with the word ""Kant"" no longer appearing.

The bookmakers' odds have Conte, Vikman and Cash maintaining their places among the top 10 favorites ahead of the Eurovision final. But they give the best chances of success to the ballads ""Maman"" by French singer Louane and ""New Day Will Rise"" by Israel's Raphael, as well as the pop aria ""Wasted Love,"" performed by the countertenor JJ, representing Austria.

Germany is hoping the electro-pop composition ""Baller"" by the duo Abor & Tynna, aka siblings Attila and Tünde Bornemisza from Vienna, will be a success.

Germany's transnational cooperation with Austrians reflects a broader Eurovision trend this year: Finns are competing for Sweden, a Norwegian for Ireland, a Slovak for the Czech Republic and an Italian for San Marino — with the title ""Tutta l'Italia"" (""All of Italy"").

Another special feature of this year's competition is the number of songs that are not or only partially performed in English: More than half of the 37 songs are in other languages.

The new German government has agreed to stop family members of refugees with subsidiary protection status from moving to Germany. The controversial move will particularly affect Syrian families. 

""Before I came to Germany, I didn't know it would be so difficult. I just didn't know. You know, we're men, and we men are not used to raising children,"" says Mohammed. He fled the civil war in Syria in 2014 with his wife, two daughters and two sons to Iraqi Kurdistan.  

Life was so difficult for the family there that his wife, two daughters and one son returned to Syria. Mohammed made the decision to make the dangerous journey to Germany through Libya and across the Mediterranean to Italy together with his son, who suffers from cerebral atrophy, in the hope of getting medical treatment and one day being reunited with the rest of the family in Germany.  

But two and a half years after arriving in the country, Mohammed still lives alone with his 9-year-old severely disabled son and has no idea when or if his wife and two daughters will be able to join him. His second son died after returning to Syria, a loss made all the more painful by the separation.  

Housed in shared accommodation at refugee centers, a friend eventually offered Mohammed a place to stay in what he describes as a broken-down house. He says they struggle to make ends meet on social welfare.

Mohammed was granted subsidiary protection status by the German authorities. It is granted to people who do not meet the specific criteria for refugee status under the Geneva Convention, but who face a risk of serious harm in their country of origin, including the death penalty, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, or indiscriminate violence in the context of an armed conflict. 

There are currently around 351,400 people with subsidiary protection status living in Germany, the majority from Syria. They receive a residence permit, typically for an initial one year, and have the right to live and work in Germany and access social benefits. But while asylum-seekers and recognized refugees have the right to reunification with spouses and children under the age of 18 under German and EU law, those with subsidiary protection status do not. 

Now the new coalition government of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) plan to suspend family reunification for those with subsidiary protection status for at least the next two years.

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) told the Bundestag on May 16 that citizens ""expected a change of policy"" on immigration and that included an end to family reunification in certain cases. ""The country's ability to integrate had simply reached a breaking point,"" Dobrindt said, adding that cities and municipalities across the country were at their limit. 

The issue of family reunification for people with subsidiary protection status has been a subject of much political debate in Germany. In 2015, the government led by former Chancellor Angela Merkel granted spouses, children or parents of beneficiaries of subsidiary protection the right to reunification. But this right was suspended in 2016 after just one year.  

Since 2018, the families of people granted subsidiary protection have been able to be reunited. However, the German government limits the number of visas it issues to a maximum of 1,000 per month. That causes a lot of uncertainty for people like Mohammed and his family in Syria, who must contend with long waiting lists, lengthy bureaucratic procedures and a limited number of visas. 

In 2024, Germany issued around 120,000 visas for the purpose of family reunification, according to Foreign Office figures requested by Mediendienst Integration, an information service run by the Council for Migration, a nationwide association of migration researchers. Around 10% (12,000) were issued to relatives of people with subsidiary protection in Germany. 

Critics, such as human rights NGO Pro Asyl, say that the separation from family can place a huge psychological strain on those affected, which can have consequences for integration and also irregular immigration. Without any legal route to reunite with children, parents or spouses, some take the risk of using irregular, often unsafe routes to reach their loved ones in Germany. 

Legal experts say that even if the EU Family Reunification Directive does not apply to people with subsidiary protection because it was adopted before the status of subsidiary protection was defined, legislators are still bound by Article Six of Germany's Basic Law and the right to family life enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights.  

However, one important restriction has been introduced by the Federal Constitutional Court in Germany and accepted by the European Court of Human Rights. ""If there is an alternative of family life in another country, especially in the country of origin, then there is no automatic right of family reunification in Germany,"" says Thomas Gross, an expert on German and EU law at the University of Osnabrück.

Germany's Constitutional Court will ultimately have to decide whether an end to family reunification for people with subsidiary protection is legally permissible, which will most likely take years, according to Gross. Meanwhile, families like Mohammed's remain separated indefinitely by slow-moving legal and bureaucratic processes.  

""It's not a question that you go to the embassy and the next day you get on a flight to Germany. It is a complicated and often lengthy procedure,"" Gross told DW.

A recent study found that it took anywhere from six months to more than two years before family members were issued visas by German embassies. ""It sometimes involves DNA tests, sometimes the embassy is far away in another country, which is practically impossible for many people,"" explains Gross. 

Mohammed says he has been unable to learn German or work because, without the support of his wife or other close relatives, he is effectively a full-time carer for his son, who requires regular hospital visits. His subsidiary protection visa is valid for one year and a renewal is far from certain after a federal state court ruled that a Syrian man did not qualify for subsidiary protection status because it deemed Syria a safe country.  

""There should be help from the state for my family to come here, this is an exceptional humanitarian situation,"" Mohammed says. ""I mean, how am I supposed to endure this any longer?""

The former director of the FBI has been accused of issuing a death threat against Donald Trump after taking a picture of seashells on a beach.

James Comey, who led the FBI from 2013-2017, shared a photo on Instagram of seashells lined up on the sand to depict the numbers “8647”.

He captioned the post: “Cool shell formation on my beach walk.”

However, the Secret Service is now investigating the matter after Trump allies interpreted the cryptic message as an incitement to violence against the president.

To “86” is a slang term used in the hospitality industry and the military, meaning to ban someone from an establishment or scrap a piece of equipment. However, it can also mean to kill someone.

Meanwhile, “47” is seen as a reference to Mr Trump, who is the 47th US president.

“While President Trump is currently on an international trip to the Middle East, the former FBI Director puts out what can clearly be interpreted as ‘a hit' on the sitting President of the United States — a message etched in the sand,” White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich wrote on X.

“This is deeply concerning to all of us and is being taken seriously.”

Mr Trump's eldest son Donald Trump Jr also posted: “Just James Comey casually calling for my dad to be murdered.

“This is who the Dem-Media worships. Demented!!!!”

Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said her department was investigating the post.

“Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of @POTUS,” she wrote on X.

“DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.”

Kash Patel, the FBI director, said that the bureau is “in communication with the Secret Service” over the matter and “will provide all necessary support”.

Other senior Republicans labelled the post “despicable” in the wake of previous attempts on Mr Trump's life and called on Mr Comey to explain his actions.

“This is a direct THREAT against President Trump, who has already survived two assassination attempts,” Alabama Senator Tommy Tubberville wrote on X.

“BEYOND despicable. James Comey MUST face consequences.”

Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn added: “James Comey is posting cryptic messages online alluding to getting rid of President Trump.

“Would he like to explain what he means by this given the assassination attempts on President Trump?”

Following the online backlash, Mr Comey removed the post from Instagram and released a statement saying it had “never occurred to me” that the message would be interpreted as a call for violence.

A post shared by James Comey (@comey)

Mr Trump, 78 was shot in the ear last July during a failed assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, that left one person dead and two others seriously injured.

Two months later, Secret Service agents foiled another would-be assassin who hid in the bushes with a rifle at the president's golf course in Palm Beach, Florida.

The president has a long-running feud with Mr Comey, whom he sacked as FBI director during his first term.

The former bureau chief, who now writes thrillers, was held responsible by many Democrats for helping Mr Trump win the 2016 election after he reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email affairs just 11 days before polling day.

The case involves judges' blocks of Trump's order to redefine the 14th Amendment's birthright citizenship clause.

The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Thursday in a case relating to President Donald Trump's executive order attempting to unilaterally redefine the meaning of the 14th Amendment's birthright citizenship clause.

At issue before the court, however, wasn't the order itself, but rather the topic of nationwide injunctions — sometimes referred to as “universal injunctions” — that several district court judges have used to halt the order's enforcement throughout the country.

The Trump administration argues that judges at that level of the federal court system should not be allowed to issue nationwide injunctions (even though Trump and his allies have celebrated such rulings when they have happened under Democratic administrations). 

During the Supreme Court hearing on Thursday, justices seemed to express little doubt that Trump's executive order was unconstitutional. However, on the question of nationwide injunctions, there appeared to be a split between the justices concerning how restrictions on them would work in a practical manner.

Justice Elena Kagan asked U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer, who was arguing in favor of the administration's position, how a blatantly unconstitutional law or order could be blocked in an expedient way, if an injunction can only affect a certain group of people or jurisdiction.

Theoretically, an injunction affecting only a small portion of the U.S. could be enforced while the unconstitutional action continues elsewhere in the country. If a presidential administration chooses not to appeal the injunction, the issue could potentially never reach the Supreme Court to be ruled on in a way that would affect the entirety of the U.S., leaving millions vulnerable to the unconstitutional action.

“There are all kinds of abuses of nationwide injunctions…[but] if one thinks that it's quite clear that the EO is illegal, how does one get to that result, in what time frame on your set of rules without the possibility of a nationwide injunction?” Kagan asked. 

Sauer's position was that a wider injunction affecting more parties could come through a class action lawsuit — a notion that Justice Sonia Sotomayor said “makes no sense whatsoever,” as those types of lawsuits take much longer time to organize and argue, and the end result still might not reach the Supreme Court.

Conservative justices who have expressed dismay with nationwide injunctions in the past also spoke up, sometimes by agreeing with misleading statements made by Sauer. Justice Clarence Thomas, for example, appeared sympathetic to Sauer's claims that nationwide blocks like these were a relatively new phenomenon.

“So we survived until the 1960s without universal injunction?” Thomas asked Sauer, who responded affirmatively. (In fact, the start of nationwide injunctions date back several decades before that time.)

Justice Samuel Alito also compared injunctions affecting the whole country to an illness in need of curing.

“Sometimes [judges are] wrong,” Alito said. “All Article III judges are vulnerable to an occupational disease, which is the disease of thinking that I am right and I can do whatever I want.”

Several legal experts, however, expressed grave concern over what could happen if the administration wins the argument over nationwide judicial holds — including for the case at hand.

“Although several justices are skeptical of nationwide injunctions, Sauer failed at offering up alternatives, a fact that was especially relevant in a case where many justices were questioning the underlying validity of Trump's EO to end birthright citizenship,” Law Dork's Chris Geidner said.

“The five male justices sound eager to rein in universal injunctions or abolish them … but also appear split on what could replace them, which is a really messy problem,” Slate senior writer Mark Joseph Stern wrote on Bluesky, noting in a previous post that he finds it “very, very difficult to anticipate where the Supreme Court will come down on the universal injunctions currently protecting birthright citizenship from Trump's assault.”

Civil rights lawyer Sherrilyn Ifill said it was disheartening that the case didn't focus on the issue of birthright citizenship more — and what would happen to many living in the U.S. if the injunction rule is changed.

“I have to be honest about what I didn't hear at oral argument at the SCOTUS today in President Trump's challenge to nationwide injunctions issued by district courts that have kept him from enforcing his anti-birthright citizenship EO: How delays & partial injunctions would hurt the true victims,” Ifill wrote.

She added:

If the President is arguing to strip federal judges of the power to stop him from flagrantly violating the 14th Amendment citizenship rights of Americans — literally rendering some children stateless persons — that context is germane to [the] argument about the legitimate use of the federal court's power.

This is how we grieve under occupation: digitally, remotely, alone. Our mourning, like our lives, is fragmented.

This is how we grieve under occupation: digitally, remotely, alone. Our mourning, like our lives, is fragmented.

My father, Najy Ajour, was supposed to leave Gaza for Egypt to reunite with my mother, two sisters and their children. I had convinced them to leave for their safety after our family home and second flat in Tal al-Hawa were destroyed. They had already endured a dehumanizing displacement journey that left trauma and deep scars. With the support of friends, I was able to arrange their departure through the Rafah crossing while it was briefly open.

The plan was to evacuate my father shortly after, along with another sister who remained in Gaza. But just days later, on May 7, 2024, the Rafah crossing closed, leaving him behind alone. What followed was the hardest year of his 74-year life. Still, he held on to hope, waiting for the border to open and the promise of reunion to be fulfilled.

Just hours before his death, he messaged my sister with a glimmer of optimism: There might be good news, he said. A ceasefire deal is being negotiated. He had already packed his bag, including three kilos of Arabic coffee for my mother and sisters. He had set aside a tracksuit for the journey and had sent most of his clothes ahead with my sisters to lighten his luggage.

My sisters still remember the way he cried when he took them to the Rafah crossing. His tears were deep and heavy. They thought he would follow shortly after. They didn't realize that goodbye would be final. That it was the last time they would see him.

In his final year, he lived in forced solitude, first displaced from the al-Mawasi area, then moving to my sister's partially damaged apartment in Khan Younis. Despite the trauma and devastation, he continued to dream. Just a day before he died, he told my sister he had dreamt his name was on the travel list — a list published on the Rafah border authority's page, naming those permitted to cross. But instead of traveling to Egypt, he travelled to God.

Two days before he passed, an airstrike hit the building next to my sister's home, killing several members of her husband's family. This affected my father deeply and his health declined rapidly. Without access to lifesaving medication or food, he died in hunger and despair, still holding on to hope that the crossing would open.

Before his displacement to the south, he used to visit his best friend, my aunt Nada, daily. But after the temporary ceasefire, he didn't go north to see her, his brothers or the rubble of our home. He wanted to stay near Rafah in case he could leave quickly. Tragically, his siblings only saw him again to say goodbye to his lifeless body.

My grief is shaped by siege and the cruelty of enforced separation. I was denied the chance to see my father in life and in death. The blockade kept us apart for decades. I left Gaza in 1993 for the West Bank, and though I visited occasionally when rare permits were granted by Israeli government, I had not seen him in person since 2014. That year, he came to Jerusalem for surgery. Since then, we stayed in touch through calls and video chats, always hoping for reunion. On his last birthday in November 2024, I sent him an old photo of us and wrote: “We'll take new ones soon.” He replied, “Inshallah. We will share the best moments together.” That day never came.

My father was a charismatic and beloved figure in Gaza, a legendary Palestinian footballer and national celebrity. He was admired not only for his talent on the field but for the warmth, joy and light he brought into people's lives. I was deeply moved by the number of articles and tributes written by friends and figures from the sports community all celebrating his remarkable life, captivating personality, smile and unparalleled talent. In Al-Quds newspaper the headlines included “The Miracle of Palestinian Football Has Passed Away” and “Funeral of the Superstar of the Golden Era, Najy Ajour.” A column article paid tribute with the title “The Legend, Najy Ajour, Has Passed Away.” In Al-Ayyam newspaper, one headline read “Sadness looms over the nation's athletes after the death of Najy Ajour, the legend of Palestinian football.” Another article in the same paper was titled “The Martyr of Displacement.” There was also a headline: “A commemorative football match held in honour of Najy Ajour's spirit.” In one survey, he was voted the best football player in Palestine over the past 50 years. He proudly shared every article written about him and often spoke to me about his achievements, inspiring me to pursue my own with the same passion.

He survived multiple bombings, the destruction of our home and repeated displacement. But it wasn't an airstrike that took him; it was the quiet violence of despair.

He was always proud of me just as I am proud of him. He expressed his love and pride by telling me, “I am the father of Dr. Ashjan Najy Ajour,” placing his name between my first and last name. It was his way of saying, “I love you and I'm proud of you.” Despite the distance, the borders and the blockade, our bond only deepened. We were more than father and daughter; we were close friends. My siblings often wondered how I could be so open with him, sharing things they wouldn't dare to. He even appreciated the way I challenged him, which shaped my strength. He always gave me courage. We often argued playfully. He used to joke, “You give me a headache,” and I'd reply, “I'll bring you Acamol!”

He was full of life, with a youthful spirit. He loved sports, dancing, vibrant colors, flowers and lights. Even in his final messages, he sent me photos of himself with red roses and a cup of coffee, captioned “Sabah Al Ward” (the morning of flowers). He reacted to my reply with a heart emoji. That was the last thing I received from him: his heart, the most beautiful one. I now realize I inherited his love for color, for flowers and for life itself. In my home, I've created a small corner in his honor, framing his photos and surrounding them with the flowers he adored. And every morning, I greet him with “Sabah Al Ward.”

A man who once celebrated life with such vitality was in his final years reduced to surviving on canned food, weakened by malnutrition and deprived of the medical care he desperately needed. He was displaced and the destruction of our family home broke his heart, becoming weaker each day. His heart began to fail but there was no doctor to see him, no hospital equipped to help him. No time. No space. No safety. The war didn't strike him directly. But it killed him.

My father didn't die a natural death. He wasn't killed by a missile, but he was killed nonetheless by despair, forced separation, the slow violence of siege, starvation and heartbreak. In Gaza, there is no peaceful death. When you live under constant airstrikes, famine and destruction, even dying becomes another form of violence. His body failed because the world failed him first.

What shattered me most was that I wasn't there when he died. I couldn't whisper goodbye. I grieved behind a screen separated by distance and blockade. None of his children were with him except one of my sisters who couldn't even attend his burial. His body had to be transported through dangerous roads from Khan Younis to the north. Even in death, he wasn't free. We feared his coffin might be bombed en route. In Gaza, funeral processions are targets, graves are desecrated and mourning is a luxury few can afford.

I watched videos of his coffin from afar, grieving in isolation. I couldn't see him — not in life, not in death. I saw images of his body arriving at the ruins of our home. My aunts and uncles gathered, crying out: “Habibi, we miss you!” A cousin whispered, “Ashjan sends her love.” I had asked them to kiss him for me, but the camera failed. I heard mourning but I couldn't see it. This is how we grieve under occupation: digitally, remotely, alone. Our mourning, like our lives, is fragmented.

Despite the danger, many gathered at the rubble of our old neighborhood to honor him. The Palestinian sports movement in Gaza paid tribute to the man who brought joy and pride to generations. In Egypt, where many of his friends had been evacuated, another funeral was held. I saw photos of my nephew Najy, who was named after my father, serving guests as prominent sports figures gathered to pay tribute and honor his memory. Watching those photos from a distance, I felt gratitude and heartbreak: Gratitude that he was honored.

Even amid genocide and trauma, I never let myself imagine his death. It felt sudden, but in truth, it was the slow culmination of prolonged suffering. He survived multiple bombings, the destruction of our home and repeated displacement. But it wasn't an airstrike that took him; it was the quiet violence of despair.

He died after watching the Royal Madrid football match, the one thing he loved most in life. For two days, he had been unwell and needed to see a heart doctor, but how could we find one amid the destruction of Gaza's health care system? How could his heart bear so much? After surviving so many attacks, so much fear, so much loss, how did it hold on? It wasn't just sickness that took him, it was despair. Despair is a quiet lethal form of violence. He died from kahar, a word in Arabic that means “dying from sorrow too great to bear.” It's a death born from loss, grief and a broken spirit. He died because our family was scattered across borders: his wife and two daughters in Egypt, me in the U.K., my brother in the West Bank and only one daughter still with him in Gaza. He hadn't seen some of us in years. I hadn't embraced him in over a decade. And yet, he held on to hope that one day, he would be reunited with us. That hope kept him alive. And when that hope disappeared, so did he.

My father's death was the result of intentional colonial cruelty and injustice. He was denied the right to live, to move freely and to access care. And now, I am denied the right to mourn him properly. His passing reflects not only a personal loss, but the collective Palestinian suffering shaped by siege, displacement and decades of colonial violence. He died alone waiting: to reunite with family, to escape Gaza's war brutality, to live in peace.

He had hoped to grow old surrounded by his wife, children and grandchildren. He told my sister he would rent a better flat in Egypt. He had dreams. He had plans. He held on to life and I held on to hope. But I now wonder: Why was I so hopeful? Was hope just a shield, a way to survive the unthinkable? Because of it, I delayed asking my father things I always meant to. I never recorded his memories.

I thought we had more time. I had hoped to gather all the articles and writings about him and create a special collection as a surprise for his birthday. I wanted to give him something that would preserve his legacy, especially since everything he had documented over the years had been destroyed when our home was bombed. They didn't just destroy the walls. We lost the memories, the archives, the pieces of history we wanted to hold onto. Another dream I held close was to sit down and interview him, to hear all his stories in his own voice, his achievements, his memories, his journey. I wanted to write about him in both Arabic and English, to honor him not only as a father but also as the legend he truly was. I wanted to make him proud, to celebrate his legacy while he was still with us.

This grief is not just mine — it's Palestinian grief: displacement, family fragmentation and disrupted mourning. Friends said, “At least his body wasn't torn apart.” I know they meant well, but it shows how dehumanized we've become, grateful just to bury our dead whole. The sorrow is not only in his absence, but in what he missed. He never met me again since 2014, never sat at my table, never hugged me. He was 74. I thought we had a decade more. Instead, he died waiting to see his children together.

Yet he lives on. In memory, in tribute, in newspaper headlines that called him “The Miracle and Legend of Palestinian Football” and “The Martyr of Displacement.”

My father's death was not only the end of a chapter, it was the theft of everything we had hoped would follow. And yet, I will remember. I will write. I will honor him not only through mourning, but through love and life, through the ongoing resistance and celebration of Palestinian existence. He was stolen from me, but his story and our memory will not be erased. I will be my father's daughter. I will carry the heart he gave me. I will carry his name. He is not absent, he is present in everything, in my heartbeat, in my spirit. He will live on through me and in my children. I will continue to love flowers, colors, the pursuit of dreams and life itself. Just as he scored goals on the football field, I will score in my field. I will always be Dr. Ashjan Najy Ajour, the daughter he was proud of.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","Former SSA Chief: “Elon Musk Is the Biggest Fraud, Not Social Security”","https://truthout.org/articles/former-ssa-chief-elon-musk-is-the-biggest-fraud-not-social-security/","Fri, 16 May 2025 14:25:00 GMT","

An internal document bolsters warnings that the hunt for fraud is a pretext for slashing Social Security benefits.

An internal Trump administration document reportedly shows that anti-fraud checks recently installed at the Social Security agency have found just two cases of potentially improper benefit claims out of more than 110,000 — a rate of 0.0018%.

The documents, first reported Thursday by Nextgov/FCW, further undercut President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's narrative that Social Security is brimming with fraud. Musk falsely claimed in March that “40% of the calls into Social Security were fraudulent.”

The anti-fraud checks for Social Security have been applied only to benefit claims made over the phone. According to the internal document, “No significant fraud has been detected from the flagged cases.” Earlier this year, amid widespread outrage, the Social Security Administration (SSA) walked back a proposal to scrap many of its phone-based benefit claim services.

Nextgov/FCW noted Thursday that the Trump administration's deployment of the anti-fraud tools beginning last month “did cause delays, as SSA changed its phone procedures to add the checks on the backend.”

“The lags stem from the three-day hold placed on telephone claims in order to run the anti-fraud [checks], a move that ‘delays payments and benefits to customers, despite an extremely low risk of fraud,'” Nextgov/FCW reported, citing the internal document.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a statement that “the Trump-Musk Social Security takeover has only meant more chaos and confusion for Americans.”

“Every one of DOGE's so-called ‘mistakes' is a backdoor cut to people's benefits,” said Warren. “There's nothing efficient about making it harder for people to access the checks they've earned and are owed.”

On social media, Warren called the revelations in the internal administration document “a HUGE scandal.”

This is a HUGE scandal.

Elon Musk, JD Vance, and Trump are lying about Social Security fraud.

Internal documents show DOGE found ""no significant fraud""—but did slow retirement claim processing by 25%.

It's long been clear that Social Security fraud is minuscule, with an inspector general report published last year estimating that just 0.84% of Social Security benefits paid out between 2015 and 2022 were dispensed improperly — and even those improper payments were not necessarily fraudulent.

The new reporting out Thursday bolstered warnings that the Trump administration's hunt for fraud is a mere pretext for slashing Social Security benefits and weakening the program.

“Turns out there ISN'T rampant Social Security fraud, but Elon's witch hunt, driven by his insane conspiracy theories, IS keeping seniors from getting their benefits as quickly as they should be,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) wrote on social media. “THIS is Republican governing: hunting for nonexistent fraud while breaking Social Security.”

Frank Bisignano, the newly confirmed SSA administrator, has close ties to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and has defended the president's false claim that tens of millions of “dead” people are receiving Social Security benefits.

CNN reported earlier this week that as SSA combs “through its databases to check whether beneficiaries are alive or dead” at Trump and Musk's behest, agency staffers are “seeing more people coming in to be resurrected” after being falsely deemed deceased.

“I've been saying it all along,” former SSA chief Martin O'Malley wrote Thursday. “Elon Musk is the biggest fraud, not Social Security.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

The disputes and chaos that followed the United States' sudden imposition of blanket tariffs in April have threatened to pick apart the tightly woven fabric of global production. Around 300 million companies worldwide connected by an estimated 13 billion supply links now face unprecedented uncertainty. But the current confusion is just the most recent example of the economic disruption that has marked the last half-decade. Since the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020, surprising bottlenecks in global supply chains have made scholars reassess how the economy works. Production slowdowns and shortages of goods as varied as hand sanitizer (which required speciality chemicals imported into the United States during the pandemic) and airplanes (Airbus faced delays in meeting demand because of shortages of important components in 2024) have exposed the vulnerabilities of a global economic system in which goods cross borders multiple times at successive stages of production and assembly. They have also challenged conventional understandings of how best to measure growth and productivity.

Trade and technology have rewired global production, but economic statistics measuring outcomes, such as GDP growth and productivity, are still collected on the basis of frameworks devised in the 1940s that focus primarily on the demand side of the economy and its current and past performance. They say little about the supply side, or an economy's ability to respond to pressure. As a result, around four-fifths of the output of advanced economies has been designated by economists as “hard to measure.” A disproportionate focus on easier-to-measure industries such as manufacturing to evaluate performance underestimates the importance of the industries actually powering the modern economy.

In an era of unprecedented interconnectedness—and upheaval—policymakers need new tools to track the condition of global production networks and capture forms of activity unimaginable at the birth of modern economic statistics. The overhaul will require more and better data gathering to fill gaps in knowledge, including indications of supply chain vulnerabilities, and innovative techniques for measuring how qualitative and intangible aspects of an economy contribute to growth and inflation. A new framework that wrestles with what standard statistics cannot is not just an academic matter; it is the only way leaders can make sound economic policy in uncertain times.

The current international framework for measuring economic growth and productivity is the System of National Accounts, a set of statistical standards agreed on every ten to 20 years by a United Nations–led committee of official statisticians. It includes GDP, long considered by economists and policymakers to be the single best measure of economic progress.

The System of National Accounts was established by American and British economists, including John Maynard Keynes, during World War II. As Allied countries dedicated resources and productive capacity to the war effort, they needed to strike a balance between consumption and war production and devised the SNA to measure, among other things, domestic demand. The system took hold in the years following the war and has been revised roughly every decade in response to structural changes in the economy, such as the rising influence of finance. The revision process is intentionally slow and incremental, requiring consensus among UN member countries before any changes are adopted.

Today's SNA is a sophisticated measure of the mid-twentieth-century economy, in which the manufacturing sector dominated, production took place within the borders of single countries, and broadband networks and data did not yet power economic growth. Recent updates to the SNA have made modest, modernizing changes. But no amount of tinkering around the edges will change the fundamental obsolescence of a system built around the drivers of growth and productivity from a bygone era. The SNA can perform the autopsy, but it cannot make a diagnosis or prescribe treatment.

The SNA has standardized the measurement of economic growth and enabled international comparisons for nearly a century. It has not, however, kept pace with changes in economic activity enabled by globalization and technological advances. Since the 1980s, manufacturing and service production, the networks of which were once national, have shifted to rely on global value chains. Whereas global trade once meant completed cars or refrigerators being shipped between countries, it now entails the transport of highly specialized components across borders at each stage of production and assembly.

New business models have flourished as the global economy has become more elaborate and entangled. Traditional integrated manufacturers that controlled the process from design to production and wholesaling have given way to “factory-less goods producers” that design, wholesale, and retail; contract companies that carry out the manufacturing; and downstream “servitized” manufacturers that focus on selling related services and maintenance. Contracted-out manufacturing accounts for some 15 to 20 percent of output in sectors such as electronics and pharmaceuticals in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the bundling of services with products (Rolls-Royce, for example, sells real-time monitoring services for its airplane engines) has become a popular practice among large companies.

These shifts have led to broad economic growth as specialization and the division of labor increase productivity in an ever-widening global market. But the trade-offs have become clear: goods have become cheaper, more accessible, and of higher quality, but companies have grown overly reliant on a few overseas suppliers for key components, making them more vulnerable to global economic shocks that are only becoming more common. Traditional economic statistics were not designed for this complex network of interdependence. The lack of reliable measurements on the supply side of the economy has made it difficult to capture the patterns and condition of global production chains even in calmer times.

So, too, has the inadaptability of these statistics in the face of sweeping technological advancement. Traditional stalwart measures such as GDP are not capable of accounting for the effects of cost-saving and productivity-increasing infrastructure such as cloud services on growth. They also underestimate, for example, the value of data to large companies, accounting only for the cost of building data centers and not the less tangible productivity enabled by data collection and use. What is more, statisticians cannot agree on how to record the value of widely used free digital services such as open-source software.

Central banks and researchers have begun to construct broad measures of supply chain pressures, such as the Federal Reserve's Global Supply Chain Pressure index, because of the central role that such stresses have played in driving the inflation that has racked the global economy since the pandemic. But statisticians—and therefore policymakers—still lack sufficient metrics for measuring the risks to supply chains for specific products, even high-profile ones such as the iPhone. Nor do they have the tools or expertise to understand how digitization and artificial intelligence are reshaping business models and trade. Put simply, they are attempting to craft policy without a useful statistical guide to current and future production in today's economy.

Developing statistics about global production networks is not impossible. Academic experts in this area, such as the University of Cambridge economist Vasco Carvalho, have explained how tax and payments data could be used to understand and track the flow of product components. But a truly effective update of economic statistics must go beyond mapping production networks and the new business models enabled by technology. It must also focus on capturing the economic resilience and future potential of an economy while better detailing its current patterns of production.

The economic concept known as comprehensive wealth is key to this reimagining. Comprehensive wealth broadly describes a country's balance sheet, including conventional productive capacity, such as the condition of the buildings and equipment owned by businesses, and its national infrastructure, from roads to ports. Crucially, it should also factor in communications networks and their potential chokepoints and vulnerabilities, along with other intangible infrastructure, including the data available to the government and private sectors, and “digital public infrastructure,” meaning hardware such as cloud servers and telecom networks; data and identity verification systems, which enable the digitization of public services and store all the economic and official statistics that businesses and governments need); and applications, including payment systems and government services. The digital stack is peppered with its own bottlenecks and vulnerabilities, and any government concerned with national security and resilience will need to be able to quantify these risks.

A national balance sheet needs a measure of human capital to quantify how the skills and health of the workforce contribute to productivity and earnings. It should also take into account a country's natural capital: although some of the natural resources that enable economic activity, such as the rare earths and other critical minerals needed in cutting-edge technology, are partially valued by current statistical frameworks, a fuller account must also consider undervalued resources, such as the national parks that provide leisure services and the soil quality and biodiversity that enable agricultural productivity.

Finally, a truly comprehensive statistical account should include what economists such as the Nobel Prize winners Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson have identified as the contribution that a country's legal and governmental institutions make to its prosperity through confidence in the rule of law, the security of contracts, and economic freedoms. Available metrics do not distinguish between productivity in countries with “extractive” institutions that concentrate wealth among elites at the expense of the broader population, discouraging private investment and individual skill acquisition, and countries in which institutions provide the stability that allows all people to thrive in their jobs or businesses.

Switching from traditional economic surveys of consumers and businesses to novel data sources will be a cultural revolution for traditionally cautious statisticians. Collecting the volume of data needed to build a more complete picture of a country's productivity and its economic vulnerabilities will take considerable planning by national statistical agencies, whose resources have been steadily reduced in most countries since the global financial crisis of 2008 tightened government budgets worldwide. It will also require an international effort to develop a consensus on definitions and data standards. But with response rates to official statistical surveys declining and businesses and individuals increasingly afflicted with “survey fatigue,” profound changes are both necessary and inevitable.

The very revolutions in data collection and technology that have necessitated a new statistical paradigm will be useful in creating it. Much of the underlying data already exists or could be collected, from the payment and tax numbers needed to track global production networks, to employers' payroll figures, information collected from store scanner systems, and the many new sources of sensor and satellite data. Pilot data initiatives such as the Anthropic Economic Index can help statisticians track the adoption and use of artificial intelligence across society, a defining technological shift that is currently invisible in economic statistics.

Global production networks are under immense strain. Policymakers rightly expect their statistical systems to deliver useful information on the state of their economies. Just as the imperatives of war led to the development of the SNA in the 1940s, the new exigencies of a world riven by trade wars, geopolitical instability, and supply shocks require a modern statistical framework. Without it, a true grasp of the nature of the global economy will remain elusive—and the world will remain in the dark.

Since he returned to office in January, U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive outreach to Russia has marked a stark shift in U.S. foreign policy. Ending years of isolation of the Kremlin, the Trump administration has offered numerous concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin, raising hopes among some Western observers that the United States might be able to bring about an end to the war in Ukraine after more than three years of fighting. So far, although Russia has shown an interest in engaging with Trump, there is little indication that it is prepared to wind down its military operations. But even if the administration's efforts succeed in bringing the Russian government to the negotiating table, there is a far larger obstacle to achieving peace: Russia's dramatic internal evolution since the war began.

The war in Ukraine is central to Putin's legitimacy, leaving him no rational incentive to end it voluntarily. At least since the end of 2022, the Kremlin has portrayed its war in Ukraine as a “war with NATO,” and confrontation with the West has become a key element of the regime's ideology. To truly end the conflict, therefore, will likely require little short of a change of regime in Moscow—and one driven by actors within Russia who neither benefit from the war nor align with Putin. The current U.S.-led effort to jump-start peace talks has largely set aside the more crucial question of a long-term strategy toward Russia, both under Putin and after Putin.

Already well before 2022, the character of the Putin regime had changed significantly, as Putin moved away from the West. For years, the Kremlin had been building an ultraconservative, revisionist ideology centered on antimodern values. After 2012, when Putin returned to the presidency, the Kremlin began tightening its grip on Russia's elites, embracing an archaic militarism, and widening its repression of civil society. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and especially over the past year, however, that evolution has gone much further. Putin had expected a quick and cheap victory, not a protracted war; the situation has forced him to accelerate the restructuring of Russia's political, economic, and social systems to tighten his grip on the nation. Along with a progressive militarization of the Russian economy, these changes have created severe tensions within the regime.

The United States ignores these internal changes at its peril. Rather than preparing for a postwar future of renewed relations with the United States and Europe, Putin has put Russia on a slippery slope of self-reinforcing and perpetual conflict with the West. If the regime gets its way over the next three to four years, Russia could arrive at a sociopolitical equilibrium that looks less like a capitalist authoritarian country with private-sector elites and more like a North Korean–style militarized autocracy. For the Kremlin, such an equilibrium could help it withstand even major challenges to its rule, as Pyongyang did during a devastating economic crisis in the 1990s. Moreover, given Russia's large size and military strength, this kind of transformation could also pose profound risks to global security.

Yet Putin's bid to remake the Russian state has also created new vulnerabilities for the regime. The Russian economy has become deeply imbalanced, with the country's overwhelming dependence on oil revenues to support war-related fiscal expansion. Especially amid sinking global oil prices, this has made the Russian budget especially vulnerable to further sanctions. Moreover, tensions are emerging among Russian elites as a result of Putin's efforts to push aside existing business leaders, bureaucrats, and others in favor of loyalists who adhere to the regime's ideology or at least pay lip service to it, such as war veterans. To prevent Putin and his inner circle from consummating this transformation, the West will need to exploit these vulnerabilities. But this will require applying more economic and military pressure on Russia while also sending signals and offering incentives to potential elite dissenters—those most affected by the Kremlin's rapid and forceful transformation of Russian society and who are potentially capable of stopping it.

Political scientists have long identified three primary threats to autocracies: military defeats, popular uprisings, and palace coups. For nuclear-armed Russia, a full military defeat by an external power is implausible. Moreover, like other authoritarian regimes, the Kremlin has devoted major resources to neutralizing opposition forces within Russian society and has an extensive apparatus for suppressing potential uprisings. Nevertheless, the potential for a seizure of power by members of the existing bureaucratic hierarchy, supported by elements of the military and business elites, remains a significant risk. As a result, Putin has shifted much of the Kremlin's focus to Russia's elites.

Consider the Prigozhin mutiny. In June 2023, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Wagner, the Kremlin-supported private military company, was able to seize the city of Rostov-on-Don, including the Southern Military District headquarters overseeing the war in Ukraine, with no resistance. He also tried to march his men on Moscow. Few among the bureaucratic, business, and even military elites denounced the mutineers, exposing limited support for Putin. This weakness was underscored five days later, when Putin felt compelled to meet with Prigozhin and Wagner commanders to stabilize the situation, despite having publicly accused Prigozhin of treason. Although the crisis was quickly defused and Prigozhin was eliminated two months later, the mutiny dealt a significant blow to the regime.

The elites' lack of loyalty to Putin in 2023 was no accident. Since the 1990s and the early years of this century, Russia's business leaders and upper level bureaucrats have been focused on attaining economic independence—using Russia's relatively open market for personal material gain. For many years, the Russian state allowed private sector capitalism to flourish relatively unimpeded. In their implicit contract with Putin, Russian elites ceded political authority in exchange for wealth and personal freedom, but they were not required to risk their lives or fortunes for the state or its leader. Nor did the Kremlin have much control over their business activities and sources of wealth. But the mutiny underscored for Putin that the country's current business leaders and high-level bureaucrats cannot be relied on at moments of regime crisis. At the same time, the Kremlin's Mafia-like hierarchy of power is inherently fragile, relying on a shared belief in the leader's strength and the regime's perpetuity. Up to the present, this system has been largely held together by rents, primarily from hydrocarbons, making it susceptible to dangerous weakening by economic sanctions or the need to mobilize vast resources for war. These factors have made Putin's Kremlin particularly vulnerable to shifts in perception among the top strata of Russian society.

The Kremlin's growing concerns about unreliable elites have been heightened by Russia's fragile economic outlook. At first glance, despite over three years of sweeping sanctions and war, the economy has been resilient. Through much of the first couple of years of war, the government was able to inject significant funds into the economy, thanks to the efficiency of the private sector, the use of large accumulated reserves, poorly structured sanctions, and windfall revenues in 2022. This fueled economic activity, wage growth, and rising demand. The regime could simultaneously finance the war, meet social obligations, and distribute economic rewards to elites. This apparent wartime boom sustained the illusion of normalcy. The war also created new opportunities, particularly through niches left by the exit of foreign businesses—although these have now been exhausted.

Beneath the surface, however, the picture is bleaker. Military spending has spiraled out of control, creating a budgetary black hole. Defense spending has more than doubled, from $65.9 billion in 2021 to $149 billion in 2024, and continues to go up. Not the least of the growing costs are the huge incentives and signing bonuses the government must now pay volunteers to recruit them into the armed forces, as well as payments for North Korean “services.” (Thus far, the Kremlin's payments to Pyongyang for ammunition and military participation are estimated to have reached $20 billion.) Putin's May 2024 replacement of his longtime defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, with the economist Andrei Belousov, was intended to impose fiscal discipline on the military, but there have been few discernible efficiency gains. For 2025, military expenditure will amount to 32.5 percent of the entire federal budget. To maintain this level, the government is for the first time reducing social spending: clearly, Putin can no longer sustain the illusion of normalcy.

By shifting toward a mobilization economy, with the state as the primary customer not only for defense but across other key sectors, the government has created severe fiscal strain. In contrast to previous years with surpluses, the budget has run deficits since 2022—$33 billion in 2022, $32 billion in 2023, and $34 billion (1.7 percent of GDP) in 2024. With no access to foreign capital, this seemingly small budget deficit will become more and more threatening every year. For now, it is being covered mainly by drawing on the National Welfare Fund, which as of April 2025 had only $35.4 billion in liquid assets.



To offset costs, the government is raising personal and corporate income taxes and cutting social spending more than ten percent. Meanwhile, oil price declines have led to a tripling of the official budget deficit forecast, leaving remaining reserves barely sufficient to cover the gap. A further oil price drop or new sanctions could force even deeper cuts to nondefense spending. These cuts may affect elites, too, for example, by reducing federal subsidies to potentially rebellious regions like Chechnya. The government has also resorted to printing money, further fueling inflation.

The labor market is equally strained. Worker shortages following Putin's September 2022 mobilization and mass emigration have forced civilian sectors to raise wages to compete with the military. Consumer demand is increasingly met by imports, weakening the ruble and pushing prices up. To curb inflation, the central bank raised its key interest rate from 7.5 percent in July 2023 to 21 percent in October 2024; nevertheless, inflation reached 9.5 percent at the end of 2024 and exceeded 10 percent by March this year. Experts from government think tanks and institutions warn of a potential inflationary spiral. High interest rates also limit the viability of domestic borrowing. Along with interest rate hikes, exchange rate volatility has increased the risk of corporate defaults.

These intertwined issues have significantly raised the chances of broader economic destabilization. A global financial crisis, coupled with OPEC's expansion of the oil supply, could sharply depress prices for Russian exports, leading to uncontrolled inflation and the collapse of the ruble. Even without such shocks, continued downward pressure on oil prices and new sanctions are likely to have devastating medium- and longer-term effects. Adverse economic trends may erode public confidence in the regime's durability and shrink the rents available to elites, undermining the foundations of the existing hierarchy of power. To counter this risk, the Kremlin has accelerated its efforts to transition to a new model of political and social control and replace the most unreliable segments of the political and business elite with loyalists personally tied to Putin.

For Putin's Kremlin, building a new kind of regime has involved several interconnected elements. One is a shift in official narratives about the war. Until the fall 2023, for example, state propaganda maintained that there was no war, only a “special military operation”—a strategy that allowed most citizens to carry on their ordinary routines. By late 2023, however, the state narrative began to shift, and the Kremlin began also to refer to a new permanent “war” with the West. The Kremlin also started talking about Russian elites in terms of their loyalty to the regime. In February 2024, Putin addressed the Federal Assembly, declaring that elites were no longer those who “lined their pockets in the 1990s” but rather the “workers and warriors” who were proving their loyalty through action. This rhetoric was quickly echoed by figures such as Alexander Dugin, the far-right ideologist, and Sergey Karaganov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, who had called for a nuclear strike on Poland in 2023, as well as various government officials. In June 2024 Alexei Chekunkov, a former investment banker who had become Minister for the Development of the Russian Far East, publicly criticized Russia's entrepreneurial culture of the 1990s and proposed a model of “patriotic socialism” instead.

This new rhetoric has been backed by targeted actions against members of the elite and prominent cultural figures. The “almost naked party” scandal of December 2023—when several show business figures were caught flouting a defiant dress code—marked a fundamental shift in the relationship between the state and citizens. The Kremlin deemed such a display unacceptable in wartime and began asserting its right to intrude into private life—something even the late Soviet Union, from the 1960s onward, generally avoided. With its heavy-handed reaction, the regime signaled for the first time an intent to regulate private behavior, using tactics increasingly reminiscent of North Korea or Iran.

To reinforce regime loyalty, Putin also launched, in February 2024, a new program to integrate top military veterans into the workforce. Called “Time of Heroes,” the initiative seeks to channel former soldiers who are handpicked for their fealty and management skills into political posts. Although local politicians initially resisted, and sought to exclude veterans from party lists in the September 2024 regional elections, graduates of the program were assuming regional leadership roles by the end of the year. Through processes such as these, the Kremlin has set out to incrementally replace traditional elites with its own loyalists. Along with the arrest of seven corrupt generals (including three former deputy ministers), Putin's May 2024 sacking of Shoigu was part of an effort to address internal dissatisfaction about pervasive corruption in the military hierarchy. In fact, these changes to some extent echoed earlier demands by the Wagner leader Prigozhin. Such purges also provide opportunities for officers actively involved in the Ukraine war to advance within the military hierarchy.

At the same time, the Kremlin has begun an increasingly aggressive effort to nationalize private-sector assets. In 2022, the government began seizing assets belonging to foreign owners who left Russia when the war started. The following year, it began a more limited effort targeting Russian-owned assets, as well. As of March this year, over 411 companies both foreign and Russian, with a combined value of $30 billion, have been nationalized, representing about five percent of the total capitalization of the Moscow Exchange. But even these numbers do not reflect the broader effects of this campaign on the Russian business community. Informal threats of nationalization have become an effective way for the government to coerce business owners to cede their property to politically favored individuals at a minuscule share of its market price.



The government has also begun consolidating key industries under Kremlin-linked entities. Since mid 2023, the Kremlin-affiliated Roskhim group has expanded its dominance of the chemical sector. In February 2024, the Rolf car dealership was nationalized and subsequently transferred to a Kremlin affiliate. And in June of that year, Russia's biggest online retailer, Wildberries, was taken over by regime-affiliated groups. In January 2025, the General Prosecutor's Office also requested the nationalization of the Domodedovo airport near Moscow, on the grounds that its main owner, who is a Russian citizen, also has citizenship in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. In March, Vadim Moshkovich, the billionaire owner of Rusagro, Russia's leading agricultural conglomerate, was arrested for alleged criminal fraud. Also this year, in a new tactic, the government has begun seizing property from some of the country's largest business owners.

It no longer appears to matter what legal pretext the security forces use to justify these asset and property seizures or arrests. Increasingly present in these actions are various groups with coercive power: current and former employees of state security agencies, Putin's bodyguards, and such figures as Ramzan Kadyrov, the former warlord and close Putin ally who is head of the Chechen Republic and who has a personal army. Amid the Kremlin's dwindling revenue streams and growing demands from these groups, the redistribution of property has become a primary government resource. The exact mechanism of redistribution—whether through nationalization, criminal charges, or outright business takeovers—is irrelevant. The government now uses the law as a weapon to expropriate property from bona fide owners, including those previously seen as regime supporters. Loyalty no longer guarantees protection unless the target in question has informal access to Putin. As Russia's available economic resources shrink, the regime's only way to reward those with coercive power is by reallocating assets—often at the expense of even loyal business owners—further raising tensions within the elite.

A logical extension of the Kremlin's property-redistribution campaign came this month, when the Constitutional Court ruled that the statute of limitations for disputes over privatization should begin not from the date of the transaction but from the completion of a prosecutor's investigation identifying violations. This decision effectively eliminates any time limit on the review of privatization deals from decades earlier—many of which contain legal flaws. This means that a large share of Russia's private assets are now at risk. This threat has been exacerbated by severe constraints on the outflow of private capital from Russia—both because of increased efforts by the security services to control capital movement and the short-sighted design of Western sanctions, which have effectively trapped private capital inside the country.

The final piece of the Kremlin's effort to remake the state is ideological change. At least since 2012, Putin has sought to build and enforce a dominant ideology built on illiberal values and historical revisionism. Once-marginal ideas from the Izborsky Club, an antimodern think tank, have increasingly gained mainstream acceptance, including the view that Russia is a “besieged fortress.” Yet the Kremlin has failed to offer a positive vision of the country's future. Instead, in an effort to preempt dissent amid economic hardship, it has intensified efforts to isolate Russian citizens from independent information. Independent media have been crushed, and the number of political prisoners has surpassed that of the late Soviet period.

These interconnected measures reflect a comprehensive effort to build a state that will soon have many of the attributes of the North Korean model. Putin has adopted autarkic self-reliance and other ideas that appear to draw on North Korea's Juche ideology—the doctrine formulated by Kim Jong Il in 1982 that seeks to foreground national economic and military self-reliance. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin has also forged a military alliance with Pyongyang and is now reshaping Russia's elite in ways that echo North Korea's social hierarchy.

The Kremlin is unlikely to abandon this project anytime soon. The inherent inflexibility of the mafia-state structure, the transformation of the elites (by self-selection before 2022 and forced restructuring since then), the growing reliance on those with coercive power, and the effect of years of ideological indoctrination of the people have reinforced the regime's shift toward a North Korean model. Moreover, the survival of the new system requires perpetuating the confrontation with the West, which has become Putin's legitimizing cause, as well as declaring periodical “victories” in this struggle. These forces have produced a vicious circle. The war in Ukraine has given rise to powerful, well-organized groups in Russia that have a vested interest in the conflict's continuation and the exacerbation of the war with the West. Putin can no longer buy the support of public employees as he once did and now substitutes them with war beneficiaries such as defense industry workers, whose incomes have risen dramatically, as well as contract “volunteers” and their families, whose earnings have also increased several times over. These constituencies are better organized than public employees and, in the case of veterans, possess military experience that is desirable to the Kremlin. But their inclusion only further militarizes the state and heightens the risk of new conflicts as war and coercion become societal norms.

Comparing Putin's new state to an updated version of the Brezhnev-era Soviet Union, as some Western analysts have done, is misleading. Unlike the Soviet elite of the late Cold War, who prioritized stability and coexistence with the West, Putin's inner circle lack a coherent ideological framework or long-term vision. Communist ideology, for all its flaws, provided the Soviet leadership with a structured worldview. In contrast, contemporary Russia has no constructive development model. Dmitry Medvedev's presidency from 2008 to 2012 (during which Putin served as prime minister) briefly hinted at a modernization agenda, but it yielded no substantial outcomes or long-term vision. By 2012, it was clear that Russia's ruling elite was destined to lose under any global order. This has left the Kremlin with few options other than global destabilization and geopolitical blackmail, a strategy for which the Kim regime in Pyongyang provides a powerful model. In deciding on this course, Putin has also rendered futile any attempts to cajole, lure, or appease him.

If Russia, with its large nuclear arsenal, were to make a full transition to North Korean autocracy, it would pose enormous geopolitical challenges. Such a regime would also be a natural close ally to China. But this trajectory is not inevitable. To succeed, the new model will require far greater state control over citizens' lives and harsher curtailments of personal freedoms. Labor shortages and xenophobic tensions against migrants will heighten the challenge, raising the likelihood that the government will have to coerce the population on a larger scale.

The initial erosion of political freedoms in Russia—beginning with the Yukos affair in 2003 (when the company's CEO and main shareholder was convicted of tax evasion and fraud) and culminating in the constitutional amendments of 2020—was gradual and, for many years, offset by rising living standards or at least promises of stability. Now, the Kremlin has little to offer aside from rising taxes, price inflation, and harsher state interference. The primary victims will not be ordinary citizens but the business and bureaucratic elites, who have the most to lose and are most likely to be replaced by regime loyalists who lack independent power bases or private-sector wealth.

If the government continues to tighten repression at a time of diminishing resources and gloomy economic outlook, it could destabilize the country. Opposition from within the elite, fueled by systemic financial and governance pressures, could trigger a breakdown. Still, such crises might not result in immediate regime change, since Russia currently lacks the prerequisites that would be needed. As of now, no major and powerful elite group in Russia could clearly gain from unseating Putin. As a result, a partial collapse could lead instead to prolonged instability, akin to what has happened in Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro, but with the added risk posed by Russia's nuclear arsenal. Still, the prospect of increased repression and redistribution of property, especially combined with some positive alternative, might encourage those who stand to lose most to confront the Kremlin.

The West is not irrelevant to Russia's future. Western actions can either accelerate or impede the transformation of the Putin regime. Concessions that enable Putin to declare victory, not to mention achieve Ukraine's outright defeat, could entrench him further in power. Moreover, the notion that a peace deal with Moscow will bring significant benefits to American business is an illusion. Many U.S. corporations have already lost billions of dollars in Russia; their assets were simply seized by the Kremlin and handed over to loyalists. In the absence of sweeping political change, there is no guarantee that the Kremlin will not do the same in the future. Alternatively, continued and stepped-up Western military aid for Ukraine and increased sanctions on Russia could expose the regime's vulnerabilities. But sanctions that are perceived as purely punitive risk strengthening Putin's narrative that the West is an enemy of the Russian people.

For the United States and its allies, there is not much time left to steer Russia from its current path. So far, the West has failed to present a compelling postwar vision for Russia and a plan to achieve it—one that is realistic internationally and that can directly appeal to Russians themselves. Such a vision—when combined with Russia's failure to achieve military success and effective sanctions designed to undermine the regime's power structures rather than punish Russian society as a whole—could help send the right signal to disgruntled Russian elites, encouraging them to risk challenging Putin's rule before their own situation deteriorates further. But if current trends are allowed to continue, Europe may soon encounter a completely militarized autocracy on its borders that is similar to North Korea's in structure, and far more dangerous. And the United States might have to countenance a military union between Russia and China.

            President Donald Trump's agenda has been thrown into chaos after a group of GOP hardliners blocked the bill in a key committee vote on Friday – dealing a major embarrassment to House Republican leaders and Trump himself.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team will now spend the weekend trying to win over those Republicans before attempting to take that vote again, potentially as soon as Monday. But it will be a tough task to flip the right-wing Republicans, who are demanding more spending cuts from Medicaid and from federal clean energy programs, especially as Johnson must also be careful not to alienate moderates whose votes he also needs with any changes to the bill.
    


            A core of right-wing Republicans had warned Johnson and his leadership team, both privately and publicly, that they planned to oppose the vote in the House budget panel meeting on Friday. But GOP leaders took the gamble, and went ahead with the vote anyway.
    


            Five Republicans opposed the bill in the Budget Committee's meeting on Friday to stitch together the various pieces of Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts bill. The panel is not empowered to make substantial policy changes during its meeting, but the bill needs to be advanced out of the committee to make it to a full floor vote. The no votes were: Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Chip Roy of Texas, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania.
    


            Their opposition enraged many of their fellow Republicans, many of whom have spent months helping to draft the bill, which includes trillions of dollars in tax cuts and a big boost to the US military and to national security — largely paid for by overhauls to federal health and nutrition programs and cuts to energy programs.
    


            “These are people who promised their constituents not to raise their taxes. And those five no votes just voted for the biggest tax increase in American history,” GOP Rep. Tom McClintock of California, who voted to advance Trump's bill, said after it failed.
    


            Negotiations with leadership are still ongoing. The GOP hardliners have demanded stricter overhauls for Medicaid — specifically, putting work requirements into effect immediately, rather than waiting until 2029 — and deeper cuts to a clean energy tax program.
    


            But any changes to the bill could upset Johnson's fragile coalition in the House, where he can't afford any big changes that would upset the GOP's more moderate members. And Trump himself — who is closely watching any changes to Medicaid — also needs to sign off on changes.
    


            Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise will continue to work furiously to try to assuage the conservatives, efforts that included late-night negotiating on Thursday. Roy and other GOP hardliners repeatedly urged Johnson to delay the vote. They warned party leaders both privately and publicly that they planned to oppose the vote in the House budget panel meeting on Friday.
    


            But GOP leaders refused to bend to hardliners' demands to delay the vote, eager to quickly advance the bill. Johnson has said he wants to pass the bill next week on the floor, though that prospect is now uncertain.
    


            “We're working on answers. Some of them, we need to get answers from the Trump administration. But we got a pretty clear idea of what the final pieces are, and we're working through those right now,” Scalise said.
    


            Scalise said they're all in agreement about changes they want to make but said they're working through timing implementation. The work requirements for able-bodied adults enrolled in Medicaid, for instance, would not go into effect until 2029, after Trump has left office. And some of the clean energy subsidies — which were enacted under Biden — wouldn't be phased out for years after that.
    


            Scalise said Trump, who is returning from an overseas trip, has been keeping track of the bill's progress. Norman, however, said he has not heard from the president directly.
    


            Trump posted to Truth Social on Friday, “We don't need ‘GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!”
    


            “Republicans MUST UNITE behind, ‘THE ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL!,'” he said.
    


            Another one of the holdouts, ﻿Clyde, had another issue with the bill — its failure to remove gun suppressors, also known as silencers, from regulation under the National Firearms Act. It's not clear if this policy change would make it into the final bill, however. GOP leaders must follow strict budgetary rules as they draft the package because they plan to pass it without using Democratic votes — forcing the party to comply with Senate rules that allow a bill to bypass a filibuster.
    


            House budget chief, Rep. Jodey Arrington, could only afford to lose two GOP votes in the committee vote.
    


            In a sign of the gravity of the vote, GOP leaders pushed to have Rep. Brandon Gill, whose wife just had their second child, return to Washington on Friday morning for the vote.
    


            Two GOP sources previously told CNN on Thursday that Gill would not be in attendance — which would have meant House leaders could only lose a single vote.

Live Updates


            • Star witness: Cassie Ventura, ex-girlfriend of Sean “Diddy” Combs and one of his accusers, is back on the stand for the fourth day of her testimony in Combs' federal criminal trial. The judge is urging lawyers to wrap up with Ventura before the weekend, as she's due to give birth soon.
    


            • Testimony so far: Today, defense lawyers for Combs have brought up messages between him and Ventura about their 2016 hotel altercation and “Freak Offs,” the drug-fueled sex performances Combs orchestrated. Ventura said she sought treatment for PTSD.
    


            • Federal charges: Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


• Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.



            The jury is in the courtroom, and the defense will continue its cross-examination of Cassie Ventura.
    


            The defense may have been questioning Cassie Ventura about her mental health treatment to try to cast doubt on her recollection of events to the jury, but it is a “slippery slope,” a former prosecutor told CNN.
    


            Ventura testified that she went to a treatment center in 2023 where she was seen for post-traumatic stress disorder relating to the trauma she experienced during the course of her relationship with Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            She said she participated in different kinds of therapy, including eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and somatic experiencing.
    


                    In its cross-examination today, the defense is “trying to paint her out as somebody who may not be remembering all the details as they actually occurred, maybe somebody whose memory isn't all that great,” Julie Grant, a Court TV anchor and former prosecutor said.
                





            These questions about her treatment go to “her credibility,” and Combs' attorneys will then be able to argue in closing arguments that the jury cannot rely on her retelling of events, Grant said.
    


                    But Grant said it is a “slippery slope” line of questioning. “The defense needs to be really careful what they're doing here, because she is a victim,” she said.
                





            On redirect, the prosecution is likely to revisit this testimony and argue “had she not been so brutally traumatized, she wouldn't have had to seek therapy” in the first place, Grant said.
    


            In what the judge has urged lawyers to make the final day of Cassie Ventura's testimony, the prosecution's star witness has continued to detail her relationship with Sean “Diddy” Combs and its effects on her life.
    


            Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of the accusers in his federal criminal trial, is heavily pregnant, and the defense is trying to wrap up cross-examination on her fourth day of testimony to keep it from extending into next week.
    


Here's what we've heard from Ventura so far, as court takes a break:



            • Physical abuse: Ventura said she believes Combs was intoxicated but said she couldn't objectively define whether he was in a “black out” when he dragged and kicked her in a March 2016 assault captured by hotel surveillance cameras. “I'm not a rag doll, I'm someone's child,” Ventura wrote a few days later in a text to Combs that was shown to the jury today. Ventura also accused Combs of other controlling behavior, testifying that he would take her phone or passport when he was angry with her.
    


            • More on “Freak Offs”: The jury saw a text exchange in which Ventura said she was going to tell Combs she didn't want to participate in his drug-fueled sex performances anymore, but ultimately didn't say so because of how he reacted. They also heard a recording of Ventura threatening a man in March 2014 after he said he'd seen a sexually explicit video of her. Ventura feared it had been secretly recorded during a “Freak Off.”
    


            • Mental health treatment: Ventura testified that she went to an inpatient treatment center in 2023 for a mental health program, including therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder.



            • Current feelings toward Combs: The defense asked Ventura if she hates Combs, to which she said no. Asked if she still has love for him, Ventura said, “I have love for the past and what it was.”
    


            • Timeline surrounding rape accusation: Other texts presented to the jury showed the pair going back and forth about dating and seeing other people in 2018. The defense asked questions about where those texts fell on the timeline of events that year, after Ventura alleged that Combs raped her following an August 2018 dinner.
    


Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.



            The jury has been dismissed for lunch.
    


            In messages from early October 2018, Sean “Diddy” Combs told Cassie Ventura he was going to “fall back” and to call him when she needed him.
    


            Ventura responded that she wasn't sure how to handle things, and said in part, “I'm lost without you,” according to messages read aloud in court.
    


            The jury heard further messages from September 2018, in which Sean “Diddy” Combs tells Cassie Ventura, “I want you to love me. I need you to love you.”
    


            “I do love you. I would just prefer not being one of your girlfriends anymore,” Ventura responded, according to the texts.
    


            In the messages, they both say they can't wait to see each other.
    


            The next day, she and Combs saw each other and had sex. Her now-husband called her on FaceTime while she was with Combs, she confirmed.
    


            Defense attorney Anna Estevao suggested that she told her husband that this encounter was actually when Ventura said Combs raped her.
    


            “That wasn't the evening when I was raped,” Ventura said on the stand.
    


            Defense attorney Anna Estevao is now going through text messages Cassie Ventura and Sean “Diddy” Combs exchanged in September 2018 about rumors she'd heard about him dating his yoga instructor.
    


            Ventura texted, “I hear you're dating I didn't know.”
    


            Combs denied it, saying “I'm not dating, dating who, I'm not dating.”
    


            Ventura responded, “Maybe you've been going on dates all along.” She later said, “I actually need to stop even caring.”
    


            Combs asked her, “Do you want to start dating? If you are let's just talk about it.”
    


            At this point, Ventura was already dating her now-husband, she has testified.
    


            Ventura also testified yesterday that a month earlier, in August 2018, she went to dinner with Combs for what she thought was a “closure conversation.” After the dinner, Combs drove her home, and Ventura said he raped her in her home.
    


            Defense attorney Anna Estevao asked if Cassie Ventura hated Sean “Diddy” Combs now.
    


            “I don't hate him,” Ventura testified.
    


            “Do you still have love for him?” Estevao asked.
    


            “I have love for the past and what it was,” Ventura said.
    


            A tense scene has been unfolding this week outside the downtown Manhattan courthouse where Sean “Diddy” Combs is standing trial on sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges.
    


            CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister, who has been reporting from the courthouse throughout the first week of the federal criminal trial, said Friday that some fans of Combs have gathered outside to voice support for him.
    


            “They are very passionate and they are very loud,” she said, noting that a supporter of Combs and someone from “the other side of the aisle” were loudly arguing nearby as she reported on air today.
    


                    “That's what's been happening at this courthouse because it really is a madhouse, both from the public and from the media,” Wagmeister added. 
                





            Defense attorney Anna Estavao brought up text exchanges from April 2010 between Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura about the “Freak Offs.”
    


            The conversation had already come up during Ventura's direct examination. She testified earlier this week that she was going to tell Combs she didn't want to have “Freak Offs” anymore but didn't because she saw how he reacted.
    


            The jury saw messages from over three days in April in which they discussed their relationship. Combs at one point said they needed to do some “soul searching this time.”
    


            Ventura said she was not feeling loved, to which Combs responded in part that “you don't know what it is to take care of me.”
    


Here's an exchange from April 19, 2010:



            Ventura: I want to talk to you about something tomorrow. Going to sleep. Love you.
    


            Combs: Is it going to stress me out? What is it about
    


            Ventura: Freak-off. It can wait. It's not a big deal.
    


            Combs: Now you don't want to do it anymore. Oh, I already know. You so predictable.
    


            Ventura: Really? OK. Since that's definitely what it was, we'll leave it at that then, since I'm so predictable. Have a good night.
    


            Combs: Whatever, Baby. I'm not going to play no games with you and you ain't gonna keep shutting me down.
    


            Ventura: I'm not shutting you down. I never do. If anything, it's always the other way around. I wasn't going to say I didn't want to do it anymore.
    


            The jury is back inside the courtroom after a short break.
    


            As the jury is in a short break, Sean “Diddy” Combs' attorneys have left the room to try to get their exhibits in order.
    


            Combs is sitting by himself at the defense table. He asked a junior member of his legal team to adjust the monitor on the table so he can see the screen more clearly.
    


            Combs' sons and sister are present in court today.
    


            Cassie Ventura is wearing a pinstripe pantsuit.
    


            The jury was again shown a message Sean “Diddy” Combs sent to Cassie Ventura in January 2016 that was brought up previously on direct examination, in which he referenced having a “Freak Off” without taking ketamine.
    


            Ventura previously testified that the “K” referenced ketamine.
    


            “I HATE K!!! So you let me know when. Pls don't be mad and think that's all I wanna do,” Combs said, according to the text.
    


            “A successful Fo is when we remember and we don't be fiending to do it the right way,” he continued.
    


            The jury has been dismissed for a quick break.
    


            Cassie Ventura is testifying about her time at a treatment center, where she was seen for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), she said.
    


            Ventura confirmed that she participated in different kinds of therapy at the facility, Willow House, to treat her for PTSD. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and somatic experiencing were among the therapies she received, she testified. She said “it helps recount memories and process them.”
    


            Ventura described some of the treatment, saying if there was a time when you were getting beat up in a room and couldn't walk out, you would reimagine it in a way where you were actually able to leave the room.
    


            Neurofeedback treatment was another therapy she experienced, Ventura said.
    


            “They hook your brain up to a machine and you watch something and it just kind of regulates your brain waves,” she said, adding that she got the treatment about five or six times.
    


            Cassie Ventura testified she went to an inpatient treatment center in early 2023 for mental health problems.
    


            The program was 45 days, and she said she began writing her book while she was there.
    


            Defense attorney Anna Estevao said the treatment center, Willow House, treats patients for sexual compulsion and love addiction. Ventura said she was not treated for those conditions while she was there.
    


            Ventura also confirmed she's taking Buprenorphine since she was prescribed the medication for opiate addiction in 2022.
    


            An escort service that Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura used, Cowboys 4 Angels, was featured on a Showtime TV show called “Gigolos.”
    


            Ventura had been concerned that the escorts she and Combs used might end up on the show and reveal their relationship, she confirmed when asked.
    


            Defense attorney Anna Estevao suggested that some of the escorts involved in the couple's “Freak Offs” were featured on the show. Ventura said she's never seen the show, so she wasn't sure.
    


            The jury just heard just recording that Cassie Ventura captured of a conversation she had with a man in Atlantic City in March 2014 after he said he'd seen a sexually explicit video of her.
    


            Ventura addressed the incident in her direct testimony, telling the jury that Sean “Diddy” Combs pushed her to get to the bottom of the situation.
    


            In the recording, Ventura is heard threatening the man multiple times.
    


            “I'm going to kill you, and then he's gonna kill you again,” Ventura is heard saying in the recording.
    


            Whether there actually was a video or how the situation was resolved was not established in Ventura's testimony.
    


            Ventura testified that she believed a man had secretly taken a video of her and Combs during a “Freak Off.” She was concerned about it, and she said she told Combs, who said he'd “take care of it,” she testified.
    


            She confirmed that Combs was also concerned about sexually explicit videos of himself getting out.
    


            The defense brought up instances in which Cassie Ventura testified that Sean “Diddy” Combs had taken her phone after he suspected she was talking to other men.
    


            Ventura said Combs would also take other possessions, like her passport or her watch, when he was angry with her, and many times over other men she'd dated over the years, Ventura confirmed.
    


            “If I was with anyone else besides him,” she said. “I don't know that I would call it cheating.”
    


            “When you're not with somebody, it's not cheating. I feel like it's a technicality in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship. We weren't married,” Ventura testified.
    


            Defense attorney Anna Estevao asked Ventura if she remembered Combs taking her phone in 2013 after he suspected her of dancing with singer Chris Brown. Ventura said she didn't remember much about the incident “besides the fact that I wasn't dancing with Chris Brown.”
    


            In August 2016, Combs took her phone when he learned she was dating another man. She testified they weren't really together at the time, and were “not in a great place.”
    


            They'd been in the car driving to a doctor's appointment and when she unlocked her phone, Combs grabbed it and ran out of the car, leaving the scene.
    


            Her mother called the police when she got home without her phone, Ventura said, though she did eventually get her phone back from Combs later that day. She wasn't asked to expand on the police involvement.
    


            While Combs had her phone, he used it to call the NFL player she was seeing at the time. The player wasn't named.
    


            The jury saw messages between Cassie Ventura and Sean “Diddy” Combs from a couple days after the Intercontinental Hotel altercation in March 2016.
    


            In the messages, Combs expressed desire to engage sexually with Ventura. Under cross-examination, Ventura confirmed that she thought it was a little strange that he would be suggesting something sexual after what happened at the hotel.
    


            “I felt that way from Friday [referring to their time at the hotel],” Combs wrote. “What are you doing.”“Not a good vibe. We need a different vibe than Friday,” Ventura wrote.
    


            “F**k Friday lol” Combs wrote. “I don't even want to do that again.”“Lol true,” Ventura responded.
    


            In the following messages, Combs referenced a card and told Ventura that he loved her.“Love you,” Ventura responded.
    


            The jury just saw a message Cassie Ventura sent to her former boyfriend Sean “Diddy” Combs on March 10, 2016, in which she describes the abuse.
    


            “When you get f**ked up the wrong way you always want to show me that you have the power and you knock me around. I'm not a rag doll, I'm someone's child,” the message, which was read aloud in court, said.
    


            Defense attorney Anna Estevao is picking back up where she left off yesterday, questioning Cassie Ventura about Sean “Diddy” Combs' drug use around the time of the InterContinental altercation in March 2016.
    


            Estevao asked if Ventura told investigators in previous interviews that Combs was “black out” during that incident.
    


            Today, Ventura said, “I believe he was intoxicated,” and said everyone's perception of a black out is different.
    


            The jury is entering, and Cassie Ventura is back on the witness stand.
    


            Cassie Ventura will take the stand today during what's expected to be the last opportunity Sean “Diddy” Combs' defense lawyers have to cross-examine the prosecution's star witness.
    


            The prosecution team will have the opportunity to question Ventura again on redirect, and its strategy will depend on how “effective” it feels cross-examination went, according to former federal prosecutor and CNN analyst Jennifer Rodgers.
    


            “The most effective redirect in the world is to stand up and say, ‘I have no further questions for this witness,'” Rodgers said, adding that if the defense “haven't made any direct hits, then you don't need to rehabilitate her.”
    


            This will be the last chance Combs' defense has to “undermine” Ventura as best they can, Rodgers added, saying however, she thinks the defense “need(s) something so that the jury says, ‘wait a minute, maybe it's different than they thought.'”
    


                    “Remember, this is what makes prosecutors nervous: Cassie Ventura and Sean Combs were together for a long time, he knows a lot more about her than the prosecutors do and her own lawyers do,” Rodgers said. “So what over those 10 years can he use and his team use to try to get her to admit something or to undercut her credibility or the story that she's told.”
                





            Rodgers added she thinks that because of this, prosecutors may still be “on the edge of their seats” waiting to see if a “surprise” comes out today.
    


            The defense wants to show Cassie Ventura a video of Sean “Diddy” Combs on a hike in the woods talking about God.
    


            Combs sent her the video from rehab one month after the 2016 altercation at the InterContinental hotel, his lawyers say.
    


            Combs' lawyers argued they need to show Ventura the video because she had testified that Combs never went to rehab while they were together.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian said Ventura could review the video, but it cannot be submitted into evidence for the jury.
    


            He reviewed the video in the courtroom, but only the audio could be heard in open court.
    


            “Just keeping you posted, ‘cause as I grow I want you to know, I'm growing, and I want you to grow with me,” Combs could be heard saying in the video.
    


            Prosecutors and defense attorneys are discussing the remainder of the defense's cross-examination of Cassie Ventura.
    


            The prosecution submitted a letter earlier today asking the judge to ensure her cross-examination is finished by 4:30 p.m. ET today.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian is on the bench and the attorneys are in the courtroom.
    


            CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the defense team's cross-examination strategy for Cassie Ventura has been “both unusual and effective.”
    


            Usually, Honig said, there's a tendency for the defense lawyers to try to “destroy” the character of a key witness. However, Sean “Diddy” Combs' legal team has not taken that approach in his federal criminal trial.
    


                    “I think they've calculated correctly that she was a credible, sympathetic, likable witness. … They're not trying to tear her down. They're basically trying to undermine this notion that she was coerced using her own words. I think it's a smart tactic, but I should say it reads better on paper than apparently it's playing in the courtroom,” said Honig, a former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York, citing reporters in the room who said the cross-examination felt rather long and repetitive.
                





            When asked about texts from Ventura agreeing to participate in “Freak Offs” with Combs, Honig said the prosecution team needs to have her “put those texts in context” when they get  to ask her questions after cross-examination.
    


            “Look, this is a problem for the prosecution. I mean, they have to show beyond a reasonable doubt that she was coerced,” he explained.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian has told attorneys he wants to have Cassie Ventura, the ex-girlfriend of Sean “Diddy” Combs and one of his accusers, off the stand today — and that the defense should finish its cross-examination before lunch.
    


            That's because Ventura is heavily pregnant and, as prosecutor Maurene Comey put it, could have the baby as soon as “over the weekend.”
    


            The defense says it's working as quickly as it can through a slew of exhibits, including graphic text messages between Ventura and Combs. Attorney Marc Agnifilo said they'd do their best to finish cross-examination in time for lunch today, but that he couldn't make any promises.
    


            Subramanian has said that, given the prosecution got a day and a half for direct examination, the defense should also take a day and a half for cross-examination.
    


            He noted that he technically has the authority to cut off cross-examination when it has matched the duration of the direct testimony, though he didn't necessarily indicate he would do so. The judge left open the possibility of granting the defense additional time today after lunch, if needed.
    


            Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson has said she expects to need about an hour of redirect examination with Ventura today whenever the defense is finished.
    


Setting up the rest of the trial: Ventura's answers to questions from both the prosecution and defense are setting up the more fleshed-out arguments lawyers from each side will make over the next several weeks of Combs' criminal trial, making her complete participation critical.
    


            Once she's done, the testimony will be bolstered by expert witnesses for each side, trial consultant Richard Gabriel told CNN yesterday. Next, the lawyers will take what Ventura said on the stand and argue how it applies to actual legal statutes.
    


            Today will be Ventura's fourth day testifying.
    


            Cassie Ventura faced cross-examination from Sean “Diddy” Combs' legal team yesterday in his federal criminal trial.
    


            Ventura, a former girlfriend of Combs and one of his accusers, has been on the stand since Tuesday afternoon. The prosecution's star witness testified about the beginning of the relationship and her participation in “Freak Offs,” which is what Combs called the drug-fueled sex performances he orchestrated.
    


            In court, the jury saw affectionate messages between Ventura and Combs, but also texts that showed Ventura's frustrations and hesitancies.
    


            Combs has pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution and could face up to life in prison.

President Donald Trump's administration must put the brakes on slashing billions in federal money for public health departments, a federal judge said Friday.

U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy in Rhode Island granted the preliminary injunction request in the lawsuit brought last by a coalition of Democrat-led states, allowing the money to keep flowing.

“If we don't have our health, we don't have anything, and that's why today's preliminary injunction is such a critical win,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement, adding later: “A hacksaw approach to government reduction will never yield positive results for the American people, and we will continue to fight, and win, in court to minimize the harm the Trump Administration is causing the people of this country.”

The lawsuit filed April 1 by 23 states and the District of Columbia sought to immediately halt $11 billion in cuts, alleging that it would decimate public health infrastructure across the country. The money, allocated by Congress during the pandemic, supported COVID-19 initiatives and mental health and substance abuse efforts. 

The federal government argued that because the pandemic is over, the states no longer need the money. But McElroy, who granted a temporary restraining order last month in the case, wrote in her decision that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services doesn't have the power to decide that money isn't necessary anymore. 

She went on to say that the agency ignored multiple requirements that govern how block grant programs are terminated, calling the federal government's argument for how it handled the situation “puzzling.” 




McElroy wrote that the federal government's decision to rescind the money isn't just an economic loss — “ample evidence” provided by the states shows that it will decimate “key mental health, substance abuse, and other healthcare programs ... worsening public health outcomes and placing their residents at risk.” 

She pointed to several instances of what the money funded, like vaccination efforts and building up disease surveillance and labs for “future health threats,” before writing, “The Court could go on.”

The injunction only applies to the states involved in the lawsuit. The federal government must file documentation that they're complying with the order by Tuesday evening. 

“We're going to continue our lawsuit to protect the health and well-being of millions of Americans,” New York Attorney General Letitia James wrote on X shortly after the decision. 

Health departments across the country have said they've laid off employees after the Trump administration began to claw back the money in late March.

NEW YORK (AP) — Between collections resuming, courts blocking student loan programs and layoffs at the Education Department, borrowers might be confused about the status of their student loans. 

Recently, the Education Department announced it would start involuntary collections on defaulted loans, meaning the roughly 5.3 million borrowers who are in default could have their wages garnished by the federal government.

At the center of the turmoil are the government's income-driven repayment plans, which reduce monthly payments for borrowers with lower incomes. Those plans were temporarily paused after a federal court blocked parts of the plans in February. 

“There's so much confusion, they've made it very complicated,” said Natalia Abrams, president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center. 

At the same time, some borrowers are struggling to get their loan servicers on the phone, making it hard to find answers to their questions, said Abrams.

If you're a student loan borrower, here are some answers to your questions. 

Applications for income-driven repayment plans are open, but they're taking longer than usual to process.

The applications were temporarily shut down earlier this year after a federal court in Missouri blocked the SAVE plan, a Biden administration plan that offered a faster path to loan forgiveness. The judge's order also blocked parts of other repayment plans, prompting the Education Department to pause income-driven applications entirely.




Amid pressure from advocates, the department reopened the applications on May 10. 

Borrowers can apply for the following income-driven plans: the Income-Based Repayment Plan, the Pay as You Earn plan and the Income-Contingent Repayment plan. 

Abrams expects applications will continue to be approved but at a slower pace than before the application pause.

Borrowers currently enrolled in an income-driven plan should be receiving notifications about recertification, said Khandice Lofton, counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Recertification is required annually to update information on family size and income, and dates are different for each borrower.

To review income-driven repayment plans, you can check the loan simulator at studentaid.gov.

Borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan have been placed in administrative forbearance while a legal challenge is resolved. That means they don't have to make payments and interest is not accruing. Time in forbearance normally does not count toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness. 

The Education Department will notify borrowers with updates on payments and litigation.

“We don't know for sure when the SAVE forbearance is going to end,” Abrams said.

While the future of the SAVE plan is decided in court, Abrams encourages borrowers to explore their eligibility for other income-driven repayment plans.

The online application for loan consolidation is available again, at studentaid.gov/loan-consolidation. If you have multiple federal student loans, you can combine them into one with a fixed interest rate and a single monthly payment.

The consolidation process typically takes around 60 days to complete. You can only consolidate your loans once.

It would be difficult for the Education Department to reinstate loans that were canceled during President Joe Biden's administration. So far, it isn't believed to be happening, Abrams said.

Nothing has changed yet. 

President Donald Trump wants to change the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to disqualify workers of nonprofit groups deemed to have engaged in “improper” activities. He signed an executive order to that effect, but it has yet to be enforced.

Borrowers enrolled in PSLF should keep up with payments to make progress toward loan forgiveness, said Sarah Austin, policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.

“There could be some changes coming in regards to PSLF but at this current time PSLF is still functioning and there is still loan forgiveness being processed under the PSLF provision,” said Austin. 

An income-driven repayment tracker has disappeared from the federal student loan website for many borrowers, said Abrams. For keeping track of their status, Abrams is recommending that borrowers take screenshots of their payments. 

Contacting your loan servicer is crucial to managing and understanding your student loans. Due to the large number of people trying to get answers or apply for programs, loan servicers are taking longer than usual to respond.

Abrams recommends borrowers prepare for long wait times. 

“We've heard borrowers being in hold for three or four hours, then being transferred to a supervisor and then being hung up on, after all that wait time. It's incredibly frustrating,” Abrams said. 

If you're delinquent, try to get back on track. Borrowers who don't make their payments for 270 days go into default, which has severe consequences. 

“If you're delinquent but have not defaulted yet, do whatever you can do to avoid going default,” said Kate Wood, a student loans expert at NerdWallet.

Borrowers who are delinquent on their student loans take a massive hit on their credit scores, which could drop 100 points or more, Wood said. A delinquency stays on your credit report for seven years.

Wood recommends contacting your servicer to ask for options, which can include forbearance, deferment or applying for an income-driven repayment plan. 

The Education Department is recommending borrowers visit its Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation.

Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute for Student Loan Advisors, recommends loan rehabilitation.

Borrowers in default must ask their loan servicer to be placed into such a program. Typically, servicers ask for proof of income and expenses to calculate a payment amount. Once a borrower has paid on time for nine months in a row, they are taken out of default, Mayotte said. A loan rehabilitation can only be done once.

The Fresh Start program was a one-time temporary program that helped borrowers get out of default. This program ended Aug. 31, 2024.

PARIS (AP) — For powerful men in France's film industry, this was a week of reckoning. Gérard Depardieu — the country's most famous male actor — was convicted of sexual assault. Two days later, the Cannes Film Festival barred another actor accused of rape from walking the red carpet.

Together, the decisions sent a message that France had long resisted: that artistic brilliance may no longer shield those who abuse their power.

For decades, Depardieu was revered as French cinema's “sacred monster” — a towering talent whose gluttony, volatility and magnetism became part of his myth. With more than 250 films to his name, many believed he would remain untouchable even after more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.

Now, that myth has cracked. 

The verdict has revived a broader question France has ducked since the dawn of the #MeToo movement: Can a country that celebrates seduction and irreverence finally hold its male icons to account?

France has long lived its own #MeToo contradiction. That talent, charm, or intellect forgives misconduct. That the art excuses the artist. This is the land that gave the world Brigitte Bardot's pout and Catherine Deneuve's poise — and then watched both recoil when the movement came knocking. Deneuve has defended “the right” to seduce, while Bardot has dismissed feminism outright: “I like men.”

But the ground is shifting.




Depardieu was handed an 18-month suspended sentence on Tuesday for groping two women on a 2021 film set. He denies the charges and is appealing.

“It's the end of impunity of artists with a capital A,” Carine Durrieu Diebolt, a lawyer for one of the two women who won their case against Depardieu, told The Associated Press. The verdict represented “a bookend for putting actors on a pedestal because they were talented,” she added.

Two days later, the prestigious Cannes Film Festival barred actor Théo Navarro-Mussy — accused of rape by three former partners — from attending the premiere of the movie “Case 137,” which he stars in, even though the file was dropped for lack of evidence. The women are launching a civil complaint.

Navarro-Mussy denies wrongdoing. His lawyer said that she's unaware of any ongoing proceedings against him.

Dominik Moll, the movie's director, said he supported the move. “It was the proper decision,” he told the AP. “Out of respect for the women, the plaintiffs.”

Yet what stunned wasn't just the decision, but who made it. Cannes director Thierry Frémaux had long been seen as emblematic of the old guard. He defended Roman Polanski for years and continued to screen his films despite the director's 1977 guilty plea in the U.S. for sex with a 13-year-old. 

In 2018, when asked why Cannes still included Polanski, Frémaux said: “These are complicated matters.”

Frémaux opened 2023's festival with a film starring Johnny Depp, despite the actor's highly public legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard over allegations of domestic abuse, in which he was never criminally charged. When asked about the backlash, Frémaux replied: “I only have one rule: it's the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.”

This week, the rules changed.

“The Cannes decision is of course linked to the Depardieu verdict,” said Céline Piques of Osez le féminisme (“Dare Feminism!”), a group that campaigns against sexual violence. “(They've) realized which way the wind is blowing. Frémaux is trying to right the wrongs.”

Not everyone welcomed the verdict — or what followed — as a cultural turning point. 

Fanny Ardant, one of French cinema's grandes dames and a longtime friend of Depardieu, sat on his side in court. She is now directing him in a film in Portugal, despite the conviction.

“Fanny Ardant? She completely missed the point,” said Piques. “She downplayed the violence, normalized it. That's rape culture, plain and simple.”

Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president and one of France's most respected actors, struck a note of restraint: “He's not a monster. He's a man — one who has, apparently, been desacralized.”

In 2024, more than 22,000 rapes were reported in France. Fewer than 3% led to convictions. “The Depardieu verdict shows there's progress,” said lawyer Anne-Sophie Laguens, who works with victims of sexual assault. “But for most women, the barriers to justice remain enormous.”

When Bertrand Cantat — front man of Noir Désir and once one of France's bestselling rock singers — launched a 2018 comeback tour, he had served just four years in prison for killing his partner, actor Marie Trintignant, during a violent assault.

Despite public outrage, he returned to the stage and performed.

“That would be unthinkable today,” said Piques. “The public mood has changed. What we tolerate has changed.”

One breakthrough came not from a film set, but a courtroom in Avignon. The conviction of 51 men for drugging and raping Gisele Pelicot — who chose to waive her anonymity and insisted on a public trial, turning private horror into public reckoning — marked a turning point. For years, shame was hers. Now, it belongs to the perpetrators.

“It proved rapists aren't just strangers in alleys,” said Piques. “They're husbands. Colleagues. Respected men.”

That shift in shame is now rippling through the cultural world — once seen as a bastion of male privilege. Director Christophe Ruggia was recently convicted of abusing actor Adèle Haenel when she was a minor, though he is appealing; and actor-director Nicolas Bedos, was sentenced for sexual assault. 

Slowly but surely, yes. The system that long protected men like Depardieu is not yet dismantled, but it is shifting.

As one of the actor's accusers said through tears after the ruling: “I'm very, very much satisfied with the decision. That's a victory for me, really. And a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.”

Fredericksburg, Va. has strong ties to the military and resettled Afghans. But Trump administration's suspension of the federal refugee program has created unease for many Afghans who immigrated during wartime and the faith-based allies who helped them.

FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) — Kat Renfroe was at Mass when she saw a volunteer opportunity in the bulletin. Her Catholic parish was looking for tutors for Afghan youth, newly arrived in the United States.

There was a personal connection for Renfroe. Her husband, now retired from the Marine Corps, had deployed to Afghanistan four times. “He just never talked about any other region the way he did about the people there,” she said.

She signed up to volunteer. “It changed my life,” she said.

That was seven years ago. She and her husband are still close to the young man she tutored, along with his family. And Renfroe has made a career of working with refugees. She now supervises the Fredericksburg migration and refugee services office, part of Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Arlington. 

That faith-based work is now in peril. As part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, his administration banned most incoming refugees in January and froze federal funds for the programs. Across the country, local resettlement agencies like hers have been forced to lay off staff or close their doors. Refugees and other legal migrants have been left in limbo, including Afghans who supported the U.S. in their native country.

The upheaval is particularly poignant in this part of Virginia, which boasts both strong ties to the military and to resettled Afghans, along with faith communities that support both groups.

Situated south of Washington, D.C., and wedged among military bases, Fredericksburg and its surrounding counties are home to tens of thousands of veterans and active-duty personnel.




Virginia has resettled more Afghan refugees per capita than any other state. The Fredericksburg area now has halal markets, Afghan restaurants and school outreach programs for families who speak Dari and Pashto.

Many of these U.S.-based Afghans are still waiting for family members to join them — hopes that appear on indefinite hold. Families fear a new travel ban will emerge with Afghanistan on the list. A subset of Afghans already in the U.S. may soon face deportation as the Trump administration ends their temporary protected status.

“I think it's tough for military families, especially those who have served, to look back on 20 years and not feel as though there's some confusion and maybe even some anger about the situation,” Renfroe said.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops announced in April that it was ending its decades-old partnership with the federal government to resettle refugees. The move came after the Trump administration halted the program's federal funding, which the bishops' conference channels to local Catholic Charities. 

The Fredericksburg Catholic Charities office has continued aiding current clients and operating with minimal layoffs thanks to its diocese's support and state funds. But it's unclear what the local agency's future will be without federal funding or arriving refugees.

“I'll just keep praying,” Renfroe said. “It's all I can do from my end.”

Religious groups have long been at the heart of U.S. refugee resettlement work. Until the recent policy changes, seven out of the 10 national organizations that partnered with the U.S. government to resettle refugees were faith-based. They were aided by hundreds of local affiliates and religious congregations.

Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Arlington has been working with refugees for 50 years, starting with Vietnamese people after the fall of Saigon. For the last 10 years, most of its clients have been Afghans, with an influx arriving in 2021 after the Taliban returned to power.

Area faith groups like Renfroe's large church — St. Mary's in Fredericksburg — have been key to helping Afghan newcomers get on their feet. Volunteers from local congregations furnish homes, provide meals and drive families to appointments. 

“As a church, we care deeply. As Christians, we care deeply,” said Joi Rogers, who led the Afghan ministry at her Southern Baptist church. “As military, we also just have an obligation to them as people that committed to helping the U.S. in our mission over there.”

Rogers' husband Jake, a former Marine, is one of the pastors at Pillar, a network of 16 Southern Baptist churches that minister to military members. Their flagship location is near Quantico, the Marine base in northern Virginia, where nearly 5,000 Afghans were evacuated to after the fall of Kabul.

With Southern Baptist relief funds, Pillar Church hired Joi Rogers to work part time as a volunteer coordinator in the base's makeshift refugee camp in 2021. She helped organize programming, including children's activities. Her position was under the auspices of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which the government contracted to help run the camp.

For Pillar's founding pastor, Colby Garman, the effort was an easy decision. “It was affecting so many of the lives of our families here who had served in Afghanistan.”

“We've been told to love God and love our neighbor,” Garman said. “I said to our people, this is an opportunity, a unique opportunity, for us to demonstrate love for our neighbor.”

Within five months, as the Afghans left the base for locations around the country, the support at the camp transitioned to the broader community. Pillar started hosting an English class. Church members visited locally resettled families and tried to keep track of their needs.

For one Pillar Church couple in nearby Stafford, Virginia, that meant opening their home to a teenager who had arrived alone in the U.S. after being separated from her family at the Kabul airport — a situation they heard about through the church.

Katlyn Williams and her husband Phil Williams, then an active-duty Marine, served as foster parents for Mahsa Zarabi, now 20, during her junior and senior years of high school. They introduced her to many American firsts: the beach, homecoming, learning to drive. 

“The community was great,” Zarabi said. “They welcomed me very well.”

She attends college nearby; the Williamses visit her monthly. During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan this spring, they broke fast with her and her family, now safely in Virginia.

“She has and will always be part of our family,” Katlyn Williams said.

Her friend Joi Rogers, while careful not to speak for Pillar, said watching the recent dismantling of the federal refugee program has “been very hard for me personally.”

Veterans and members of the military tend to vote Republican. Most Southern Baptists are among Trump's staunch white evangelical supporters. For those reasons, Pillar pastor Garman knows it may be surprising to some that his church network has been steadfast in supporting refugees.

“I totally understand that is the case, but I think that is a bias of just not knowing who we are and what we do,” Garman said after a recent Sunday service.

Later, sitting in the church office with his wife, Jake Rogers said, “We recognize that there are really faithful Christians that could lie on either side of the issue of refugee policy.” 

“Regardless of your view on what our national stance should be on this,” he said, “we as Christ followers should have a heart for these people that reflects God's heart for these people.”

Later that week, nearly two dozen Afghan women gathered around a table at the Fredericksburg refugee office, while children played with toys in the corner. The class topic was self-care, led by an Afghan staff member. Along the back wall waited dishes of rice and chicken, part of a celebratory potluck to mark the end of Ramadan.

Sitting at the front was Suraya Qaderi, the last client to arrive at the resettlement agency before the U.S. government suspended new arrivals.

She was in Qatar waiting to be cleared for a flight to the United States when the Trump administration started canceling approved travel plans for refugees. “I was one of the lucky last few,” said Qaderi, who was allowed to proceed.

She arrived in Virginia on Jan. 24, the day the administration sent stop-work orders to resettlement agencies.

Qaderi worked for the election commission in Afghanistan, and she received a special immigrant visa for her close ties to the U.S. government. She was a child when her father disappeared under the previous Taliban regime.

The return of the Taliban government was like “the end of the world,” she said. As a woman, she lost many of her rights, including her ability to work and leave home unaccompanied.

She studied Islamic law during her university years. She believes the Taliban's interpretation of Islam is wrong on the rights of women. “Islam is not only for them,” she said.

The resettlement office includes not only Catholic staffers, but many Muslim employees and clients. “We find so much commonality between our faiths,” Renfroe said.

Her Catholic faith guides her work, and it's sustaining her through the uncertainty of what the funding and policy changes will mean for her organization, which remains committed to helping refugees.

“I'm happy to go back to being a volunteer again if that's what it takes,” Renfroe said.

Regardless of government contracts, she wants local refugee families to know that “that we're still here, that we care about them and that we want to make sure that they have what they need.”

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Leo XIV affirmed Friday that the family is founded on the “stable union between a man and a woman,” and that the unborn and elderly enjoy dignity as God's creatures, articulating clear Catholic teaching on marriage and abortion at the start of his pontificate.

Leo, the first American pope, also called for reviving multilateral diplomacy and promoting dialogue between religions in the search for peace, in his first meeting with the Vatican diplomatic corps. The audience was private, but the Vatican released Leo's prepared text and that of the dean of the diplomatic corps. 

The encounter is one of the protocol requirements after a conclave, allowing a new pope to greet representatives of world governments ahead of his formal installation Mass this Sunday. The Holy See is a sovereign state under international law, has diplomatic relations with over 180 countries and enjoys observer status at the United Nations.

Leo, a member of the Augustinian religious order, has emphasized peace as a priority of his pontificate, from the first words he uttered on the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica after his May 8 election, “Peace be with you all.”

In his remarks, he said the search for peace was one of the pillars of the papacy. He insisted that peace isn't just the absence of conflict but a “gift” that requires work, from an end to the production of weapons to choosing words carefully. “For words too, not only weapons, can wound and even kill.”




He said it was up to governments to build peaceful societies “above all by investing in the family, founded upon the stable union between a man and a woman.“

“In addition, no one is exempted from striving to ensure respect for the dignity of every person, especially the most frail and vulnerable, from the unborn to the elderly, from the sick to the unemployed, citizens and immigrants alike,” he said.

Pope Francis strongly reaffirmed core Catholic teaching opposing abortion and euthanasia, saying they were evidence of today's “throwaway culture.” But he also made reaching out to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark, insisting they are welcome in the church. He never changed church doctrine defining marriage as a union between man and woman and homosexual acts as “intrinsically disordered.”

As the then-head of the Augustinian order, the Rev. Robert Prevost in 2012 criticized the “homosexual lifestyle” and the role of mass media in promoting acceptance of same-sex relationships that conflicted with Catholic doctrine. A decade later, during Francis' pontificate, he acknowledged Francis' call for a more inclusive church, and said he didn't want people excluded just on the basis of their lifestyle.

Despite many headlines about their relationship, Bill Belichick has often been quiet about his girlfriend.

Belichick, 73, and Jordon Hudson, 24, became a couple last year and have been the talk of sports.

Hudson has been the topic of conversation, as reports have floated around that she forced her way into a Super Bowl commercial, shut down ""Hard Knocks"" at UNC, and has even been on email threads with university staff.

However, Belichick, while not diving too much into their personal relationship, said Hudson has been ""very helpful"" from a business standpoint.

""She's been terrific through the whole process. She's been very helpful to me. She does the business things that don't relate to North Carolina that come up in my life so I can concentrate in football, and that's what I want to do,"" Belichick said. ""I acknowledged her in the book, she was very helpful in the tribute pages, and giving a perspective of the book from a business side. Sometimes, I get a little football technical, so she did a good job of keeping me on balance there.""

Belichick stopped short of getting too ""personal"" about Hudson, half-heartedly shaming ""Good Morning America"" host Michael Strahan in asking about it, but he noted that it is a ""good personal relationship.""

However, when Strahan asked Belichick if he was happy, he said ""yeah.""

Hudson, after a fiasco with CBS, was not at the interview Friday morning. She was not at an interview with ESPN, either.

‘The Five' co-hosts discuss the Democratic Party's stance on immigration.

FIRST ON FOX: Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger is facing pushback from both her opponent and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after condemning the ""shocking"" execution of an ICE raid at a Virginia courthouse earlier this month that netted two criminal illegal immigrants. 

""I think what we've seen most shocking, including here in Charlottesville, has been cases where people haven't provided identification and have been in some cases masked and in plain clothes,"" Spanberger, a former Democratic congresswoman and former intelligence officer, told the Daily Progress last month after an ICE raid at Albemarle County Courthouse led to the arrest of two illegal immigrants. 

""I'm a former federal agent, and I used to work narcotics cases and money laundering cases,"" she said. ""I have been on so many arrest warrants and search warrants at the crack of dawn and at all hours of the day, and identifying yourself, demonstrating who you are, making clear to a community member — even someone you are about to put handcuffs on, even when you enter a home, in a stack, lined up, guns drawn, yelling, ‘Police!' — you show your badge, you show your credentials, you show your warrant.""

The raid that Spanberger took issue with resulted in the arrest of two illegal immigrants who DHS told Fox News Digital had criminal records.

Teodoro Dominguez-Rodriguez, a Honduran national, was described by DHS as a ""violent illegal alien"" with ""multiple arrests for assault and battery as well as an outstanding order of protection against him.""

Pablo Aparicio Marcelino, a Mexican national, was also described by DHS as a ""criminal illegal alien"" with ""multiple arrests for failing to stop at the scene of an accident, driving without a license, and driving under the influence.""

Spanberger's questions about the process of arresting the two foreign nationals drew pushback from her opponent in the race for governor, Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. 

""Abigail Spanberger's outrage over criminal illegal immigrants being taken off our streets is everything Virginians need to know about what kind of governor she'd be — criminals first, victims last,"" Earle-Sears press secretary Peyton Vogel told Fox News Digital.

""She created this mess when she voted in Washington to keep criminal migrants here, and now she wants to stand in the way of cleaning it up."" 

A Spanberger spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the Virginia Democrat supports arresting criminal illegal immigrants but believes the ICE agents acted improperly.

""Abigail believes that violent criminals who are in the United States illegally should not be allowed to stay and that immigration enforcement should be focused on removing these individuals,"" the spokesperson said. ""As a former federal law enforcement officer who worked narcotics cases, Abigail executed warrants and arrested criminals. And as Abigail made clear to the Daily Progress, she made these arrests in uniform, displaying her badge and arrest warrant to those taken into custody.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin defended raids at courthouses, saying it is ""common sense.""

""It conserves valuable law enforcement resources because they already know where a target will be. It is also safer for our officers and the community. These illegal aliens have gone through security and been screened to not have any weapons. Secretary Noem is empowering law enforcement to use common sense to remove criminal illegal aliens from American communities.""

McLaughlin also pushed back on Spanberger's suggestion that the ICE agents did not properly identify themselves.

""When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as police while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers,"" McLaughlin said. 

""It is interesting that the media who are so concerned with our law enforcement officers wearing masks to protect themselves don't say a word about the terrorist sympathizers on U.S. college campuses who cowardly wear masks as they do the bidding of terrorist organizations that relish the killing of Americans and Jews.""

Earle-Sears, endorsed by the term-limited Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, will square off against Spanberger this November to determine the next governor of the commonwealth.

Immigration has been a prominent topic in the race, including in the first ad that the lieutenant governor dropped, which criticized Spanberger over her past opposition to a border wall.

A Spanberger spokesperson at the time called the ad a ""distraction attempt,"" adding that Spanberger ""led bipartisan bills that were signed into law by both President Trump and President Biden to disrupt fentanyl trafficking at our ports of entry, combat Mexican cartels and secure our borders.""

Celebrity chef Andrew Zimmern, speaking to Fox News Digital from Kansas City, said that he chooses ""to live in a world where I get to eat pizza when I want.""

Gas station food is as much a slice of American cuisine as a single serving of pizza, according to one celebrity chef.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, chef Andrew Zimmern, based in Minnesota, said he's spent the better part of 25 years traveling the country in a van.

""I'm not sure there's someone else alive who's probably stopped as many places to eat as I have in the last two-and-a-half decades,"" he said. (See the video at the top of this article.) 

CELEBRITY CHEF GUY FIERI'S MESSAGE TO AMERICANS: LET'S 'EAT BETTER' TO LIVE BETTER

That's what Zimmern said makes him qualified to vouch for gas station food, which he believes is more appealing to hungry Americans than it may appear.

He's now partnered with the Iowa-based Casey's gas stations to promote their new barbecue brisket pizza.

""I really think that what it has to do with is our own sense of adventure,"" Zimmern said. 

""We don't have to cross the ocean on a 19th century tramp steamer to have an adventure. We can walk into some place and try a regional food or a regional treat that happens to be for sale in that particular shop and have just as much of a warm, fuzzy feeling.""

SIMPLE WAYS TO INCREASE FIBER IN YOUR DIET AND WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT

The chef praised the new barbecue brisket pizza at Casey's, which he touted for its ""real, wholesome ingredients, stuff I'm happy to feed my family.""

He added, ""And by the way, in today's price-conscious world, there should be a pizza that's a whole pizza that can feed a family of four people really easily and not cost you a million dollars.""

But good gas station food goes beyond just pizza, he said. 

""When you're in Arizona and you have a breakfast burrito at a gas station with three grandmas in the back rolling up homemade chorizo with eggs and crispy potatoes and handing them to you, you are in a very, very, very special place, and you're about to eat something really extraordinary – and they're all hiding in plain sight.""

Zimmern also makes no apologies about eating what he wants when he's on the road.

There is ""really extraordinary"" gas station food ""hiding in plain sight,"" said Zimmern. (iStock)

""You try to maintain your healthy lifestyle up until the time that you have a cheat moment or a cheat day,"" he admitted.

""If I drank slushies and ate pizza three meals a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, I'm not sure it would really be great for me,"" he said.

Nick Wright says he loves the Jacksonville Jaguars trading up for Travis Hunter and believes the team will be dangerous with him on the field 

Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter made a woman's day on a United Airlines flight to the point where she said she would get her sons to buy his jersey. 

The woman called Hunter the ""nicest young man,"" but the second overall pick of the 2025 NFL Draft tells Fox News Digital there was no act behind it. 

That's the type of person he is.

""It was just a regular interaction. It was me being me,"" Hunter said over the phone while describing his experience with Sandy Hawkins Combs last week. ""A nice lady sat next to me, we conversed, and made sure I took care of her like I do my grandparents or any elderly person. So yeah, that's all it was.""

For Combs, though, it was more than just someone being nice to her, as she wrote in a Facebook post.

""I had the most wonderful flight home from Denver,"" she wrote. ""I met the nicest young man who sat next to me. He offered to put my bag in the overhead compartment and helped me with my tray. He was always polite, saying ‘yes ma'am' or ‘no ma'am.' Anyone would be proud to have him as a son or grandson – so polite,"" Combs said of Hunter.

UNSUSPECTING MOTHER FLATTERED BY ‘NICEST YOUNG MAN' TRAVIS HUNTER ON FLIGHT: ‘I WANT HIS JERSEY'

""People walking by were saying congratulations, great job, or even taking pictures. I turned and asked him, ‘Who am I sitting next to?' I looked at his Jaguar pants, smiled, and asked, ‘Are you an athlete?' He smiled and said, ‘I'm Travis. Yes, I was drafted by the Jags.' I already told my sons I want his jersey.""

After hearing about that last bit from Combs, Hunter called it a ""blessing"" that she wanted to support him after the one interaction. 

""I didn't expect nothing to go into the media, but it was just me being me,"" he said.

Despite it being ""regular"" for Hunter, the Colorado star has been dealing with spotlight for many years now. It will only continue to grow at the NFL level, especially considering his draft stock and how the Jaguars have already set the bar high for the two-way player. 

Hunter knows, though, that being humble plays a big role in his life, on and off the field. 

""Humbleness is how I got here, so that's all I know,"" he said. ""Be humble and just put in the work. Keep my head down and grind.""

ONE OF ONE

As Hunter continues to put in work, he's also excited for an important milestone in his early career – seeing himself on an NFL trading card for the first time. 

Hunter partnered with Panini America, along with several other incoming rookies, where they will receive their first Panini NFL trading cards at the NFLPA Rookie Premiere.

""Just super excited to see myself on my own card, so it's definitely a blessing,"" he said.

One day, Hunter's rookie card could be worth quite the pretty penny, but he understands it's up to him to make that happen. 

""I don't know,"" he said when asked how much he would pay for his rookie card. ""I still got to put in some work.""

Rep. Ro Khanna told Fox News Digital on Wednesday why he is proposing legislation to codify President Donald Trump's executive order to lower prescription drug prices.

EXCLUSIVE: While Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., has been a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump's tariff and deportation policies, the president's latest executive order targeting prescription drug prices inspired the Silicon Valley congressman to trade political disses for diplomacy. 

Khanna proposed legislation on Wednesday to codify Trump's executive order aimed at lowering drug prices, and the Democrat is urging his Republican colleagues to follow his lead, reaching across the aisle to deliver for everyday Americans. 

""President Trump's executive order says that Americans should pay the least price. We should not pay any more than people are paying in countries overseas. Then, it gives the Cabinet secretaries the ability to go after Big Pharma companies that are price-gouging. Now, he tried something similar in his previous administration. Big Pharma sued him, it got tied up in courts, nothing happened. That's why we need Congress to act. I have introduced something that codifies President Trump's language, and I'm hoping we get a Republican co-sponsor,"" Khanna told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. 

As Democrats search for party unity after losing the White House, the Senate and failing to regain the House of Representatives last year, Democrats have gravitated toward an outright rejection of the Trump administration, as depicted through ongoing protests. Khanna, however, said he does not mind if Trump ""gets a political win"" if it benefits the American people.

""If Donald Trump says that's something that's good for the American people, I'm not going to oppose it just for political points,"" Khanna said.

Khanna is considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate and, like many ambitious Democrats, has crisscrossed the United States this year, bringing his vision for America to the national conversation. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, D-Mich., also expected to harbor 2028 ambitions, faced some flack within the party this year for engaging directly with Trump to deliver for Michiganders.

""If Donald Trump has a good idea that's going to help the American people, we should work with him. If we have a philosophical disagreement, we shouldn't. But the barometer for me, the test case is, is this helping people? Is this something that I think is going to help this country? Where I have philosophical disagreements, I speak up. But when I think that it is good legislation, I am willing to support him. And I don't care, like some people, if he gets a political win. So much of politics is, 'Oh, we don't want to give the other side a political win.' For all I care, he can have a great political win if the American public gets lower drug prices,"" Khanna told Fox News Digital. 

While Khanna said he has not communicated with Trump directly about codifying his executive order, he delivered a now-viral House floor speech Wednesday, urging his Republican colleagues to join the bipartisan effort to lower prescription drug prices. 

""Are you on the side of the people, or are you on the side of the $16 billion in Big Pharma lobbyist money that was spent last year? My legislation, there's no trick to it. It is President Trump's idea, President Trump's executive order, President Trump's language into law. Every Republican should support this, and every Democrat should,"" Khanna added. 

Ahead of Trump's executive order signing, Khanna affirmed his support for lowering drug prices, reminding Americans that he proposed similar legislation alongside Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with the same goal in mind. 

""I just don't understand why any Republican wouldn't support this. It's President Trump's executive order, and every American agrees that prescription drug price costs are too much, that it's so unfair that Americans are stuck with all these high bills when other countries are paying pennies on the dollar for their drugs. It's time that Americans be treated fairly,"" Khanna said.

As Khanna, who was a surrogate for then-President Joe Biden's re-election campaign in 2024, finds common ground with the current administration, he told Martha MacCallum on ""The Story"" Wednesday that Biden should not have run in 2024. 

""I do think it's important that, given what has come out, that we take accountability,"" Khanna said. ""Obviously, he should not have run. We should be clear to say that. Obviously, there should have been an open primary. And, I don't think that's very difficult that Democrats should just be straight up that he should not have run, now that we have all the facts. There should have been an open primary. I think to move on and move forward, it's important to take accountability and be straight-forward with the American people.""

While Khanna said he did not have the full picture of Biden's health and mental acuity when he defended him before the disastrous debate performance, Khanna admitted, ""We should be honest as a party that we made a mistake.""

The Department of Homeland Security is investigating a social media post by former FBI Director James Comey that suggested someone should “86” President Donald Trump.

The White House said the post is “deeply concerning” and is “being taken seriously.”

“Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of @POTUS Trump,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X in response to Comey's post. “DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.”

Current FBI Director Kash Patel added that his agency is “in communication with the Secret Service and Director [Sean] Curran. Primary jurisdiction is with SS on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.”

On Thursday, Comey posted a picture on Instagram of shells in the formation of “8647” with the caption “Cool shell formation on my beach walk…” He later took the post down and said he didn't know that “86” was associated with violence. To be “86'ed” is slang for “to be thrown out” or “get rid of,” according to Merriam-Webster.

While President Trump is currently on an international trip to the Middle East, the former FBI Director puts out what can clearly be interpreted as “a hit” on the sitting President of the United States—a message etched in the sand.This is deeply concerning to all of us and is… pic.twitter.com/RF0Dl3t1JF

“Eighty-six is slang meaning ‘to throw out,' ‘to get rid of,' or ‘to refuse service to.' It comes from 1930s soda-counter slang meaning that an item was sold out,” their website notes.

The “47” is seen as representing Trump, as he is the 47th (and 45th) president of the United States.

The post could mean Comey wants Trump out of the White House and not dead.

“I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message. I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down,” Comey said in a follow-up Instagram post. 

White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich suggested the post was putting out “a hit” on Trump. “While President Trump is currently on an international trip to the Middle East, the former FBI Director puts out what can clearly be interpreted as ‘a hit' on the sitting President of the United States—a message etched in the sand,” he said in a post on X.

The suggestion of violence toward Trump is a sensitive topic given the president escaped two assassination attempts last year, one with a bullet grazing his ear and another with a rifleman waiting for him as he golfed.

Other Republican figures denounced the post by Comey. “Just James Comey causally calling for my dad to be murdered,” Donald Trump Jr. posted on X. “This is who the Dem-Media worships. Demented!!!!”

Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) said the post is “absolute evil” and that Comey “knows what he is doing.”

TRANSGENDER ‘ACTIVIST' ARRESTED AFTER THREATENING TO ASSASSINATE NANCY MACE

Comey is unlikely to be charged with any crime because the threat appears to be vague, if there is any at all. Protesters during the “Hands Off” nationwide rallies wore shirts and carried signs with “8647,” indicating the number could be a common threat.

Comey served as FBI director from September 2013 to May 2017, when Trump fired him.

The Washington Examiner reached out to the White House for further comment.

FBI Director Kash Patel said in an interview published Friday that the bureau will leave the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington and send 1,500 agents into the field.

Patel confirmed the plans in an interview set to air on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures this weekend. He said he will give each state a “plus-up” as the FBI disperses agents away from Washington.

“In the National Capital Region, in the 50-mile radius around Washington, D.C., there were 11,000 FBI employees. That's like a third of the workforce. A third of the crime doesn't happen here,” Patel said. “So we're taking 1,500 of those folks and moving them out. Every state's getting a plus-up.”

Patel also said the FBI will leave the J. Edgar Hoover Building, calling it “unsafe for our workforce.”

“We want the American men and women to know if you're going to come work at the premier law enforcement agency in the world, we're going to give you a building that's commensurate with that, and that's not this place,” Patel said.

Patel said moving agents out of Washington and the J. Edgar Hoover Building is part of his push to return the FBI to its core mission of fighting crime.

“I think when we do things like that, we inspire folks in America to become intel analysts and agents and say, ‘We want to work at the FBI because we want to fight violent crime and we want to be sent out into the country to do it,'” Patel said, adding that the agents will go into the field in the next “three, six, nine months.”

PATEL AT ODDS WITH WHITE HOUSE OVER FBI BUDGET CUT PROPOSAL

Patel discussed ditching the J. Edgar Hoover Building and making it into a museum of the “deep state” in comments made prior to the 2024 election. He walked back those comments during his confirmation hearing, but he now appears to be making good on the pledge to leave the FBI building in downtown Washington.

The FBI had selected Greenbelt, Maryland, to house its new headquarters in a plan unveiled in 2023 under the Biden administration. President Donald Trump said in March that he is planning to stop the FBI's move to Greenbelt and instead propose building a new facility in Washington.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump condemned former FBI Director James Comey for a controversial social media post, arguing that Comey was calling for his assassination.

In a Friday interview with Fox News, Trump dismissed Comey's apology and claim that he didn't know what seashells organized to read “8647” meant. He argued that Comey was openly calling for his assassination.

“He knew exactly what that meant. A child knows what that meant. If you're the FBI director and you don't know what that meant, that meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear,” Trump said.

“Now, he wasn't very competent, but he was competent enough to know what that meant. And he did it for a reason, and he was hit so hard because people like me, they like what's happening with our country. Our country has become respected again, and all this, and he's calling for the assassination of the president,” he added.

Interviewer Brett Baier interjected to say Comey apologized and said it wasn't a call to violence. Trump dismissed the apology and explanation, and said it was up to Attorney General Pam Bondi whether or not to punish him.

“I don't want to take a position on it, because that's going to be up to Pam and all of the great people, but I will say this, I think it's a terrible thing,” Trump said. “And when you add his history to that, if he had a clean history, he doesn't. He's a dirty cop. He's a dirty cop. And if he had a clean history, I could understand if there was leniency. But I'm going to let them make that decision.”

Comey posted and deleted a picture of shells lined up on a beach to depict the numbers “8647” on Thursday, an ambiguous message interpreted by defenders as a call for Trump to be removed from office and by critics as a call for Trump to be assassinated. Comey later said he did not mean for the post to provoke violence.

The Turkish Foreign Ministry confirmed that peace talks between Ukraine and Russia ended after just under two hours. 

Pope Leo offered to act as a mediator between Ukraine and Russia to arrange for peace in Ukraine, according to Italian media outlet RAI.

Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin said on Friday that Leo could be made available for a meeting between the two countries so they could “at least talk.”

“The Holy See is always ready to help bring enemies together, face-to-face, to talk to one another, so that peoples everywhere may once more find hope and recover the dignity they deserve, the dignity of peace,” Leo said Friday.

Parolin added that the Holy See could be a “very suitable place.”

After the talks in Istanbul on Friday, the two nations agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, according to Russian Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky.

This exchange would be the largest between Russia and Ukraine since 2022.

Medinsky also said Moscow and Kyiv agreed to send each other detailed proposals for a ceasefire deal.

The meeting was the first time representatives from the two countries had met since 2022, just after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. 

There were delegations from Russia and Ukraine, but neither country's leaders attended. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov met with Medinsky. President Donald Trump considered attending the talks during his trip to the Middle East this week, but ultimately decided not to.

At the beginning of the meeting, Turkish Foreign Affairs Minister Hakan Fidan described the negotiations as “technical talks” that will lay the groundwork for a possible meeting between the two countries' leaders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Putin called for direct talks after he rejected Ukraine's call for a 30-day ceasefire. Zelensky quickly said he was ready to meet, saying he would not meet any Russian official except Putin. In this meeting, Ukraine requested a meeting between heads of state. Russia said it would consider that, with Medinsky adding that Russia is ready to continue talks.

The two main parties say the other has betrayed its principles. Their switch, to appeal to those not once seen as their traditional base, is something to behold.

Democrats point to President Donald Trump's tariffs and ask what happened to the Republican understanding of the merits of free trade? Republicans also now favor other economic policies once of the Left, such as price fixing for “fairness” and opposition to reform of entitlements that are bankrupting the country. 

The Left accuses the GOP additionally of abandoning the rule of law because Republicans reject the fantasy that every illegal immigrant should get a court hearing before being deported. This is a canard I've dealt with elsewhere.

But while Democrats are right that the GOP dramatically changed its economic thinking, it's wrong to say Republicans have completely broken from their past. A thread runs on the Right from Reaganite emphasis on freedom through the tea party rebellion against big government to Trumpy appeal to the little guy sick of woke classes bossing him about what he may believe and how he must live his life.

To understand why ordinary Americans, especially of the working class and increasingly of racial minorities, favor the GOP, it is more instructive to look at the Democrats' radical metamorphosis. The blue party could once plausibly, though not convincingly to me, argue that it was on the side of the little guy. Who believes that anymore? Certainly not voters last November.

Democrats used to say racial discrimination was a bad thing, but now they demand racial discrimination to address past wrongs, and they ascribe immutable moral attributes, oppressor and oppressed, on the basis of skin color.

Democrats used to promote and protect women in sports, notably through Title IX, but now they are demolishing women's sports by forcing them open to men who are bigger, faster, stronger, and more aggressive than women.

Democrats used to argue against “intolerant” moral certainty. This gave rise to the deprecating phrase “moral relativism.” They rejected whatever was “judgmental” and insisted that our culture suspend this high human faculty. Now, however, instead of rejecting the very idea of right and wrong, the Left insists that anyone who disagrees with it is simply evil. Today's Left is steeped in moral certainty, with no debate allowed.

Democrats used to disapprove of taking from the poor to give to the rich, but now they demand that those with less money subsidize the spending of the wealthy by eliminating the cap on state and local tax deductions. This is a mechanism that benefits the wealthy in Democrat-run states by forcing federal taxpayers nationwide to pick up the tab for blue-state fiscal improvidence.

SUPREME COURT TACKLES GENDER CONVERSATION THERAPY 

Democrats used to want to boost working-class wages and conditions — that is what labor unions used to exist for — and they opposed mass, low-skill immigration because it erodes the earnings of Americans at the bottom of the economic pyramid. But now Democrats and the Left say opposition to mass immigration, even when it is illegal, is racist. The lower classes that were once part of the Democratic base can lump it.

The list goes on. If Democrats want to win elections again, they could start by looking at what they used to believe and lost — or threw away.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

It has long been an unwritten rule of the Catholic Church that no citizen of a world superpower can be pope.

The informal logic is that such an arrangement would risk putting preeminent temporal and spiritual authority into the hands of the same clan. It is always safer to pick a pope from a more quaint, less powerful country.

But at the most unexpected moment, the College of Cardinals broke this understanding by electing the first American pontiff in a line of succession more than 2,000 years old, stretching right back to Christ's selection of St. Peter.

When Pope Leo XIV, formerly known as Cardinal Robert Prevost, emerged as the bishop of Rome on May 8, jaws dropped to the cobbled pavement of Vatican City.

The Catholic Church is among the oldest thriving institutions in history. Even in secular society and among nonbelievers, the Holy See enjoys unparalleled prestige that dwarfs other religious leaders and most monarchies. Its mission to spread the Gospel message gives it a character that transcends the coarseness of politics. The Catholic Church is stability personified.

The election of the first American pope coincides with President Donald Trump returning to power. This is perhaps a mere coincidence but a significant coincidence nevertheless.

Trump, whose superpower is a talent for self-advertisement, forced all eyes worldwide to turn to watch America and what is happening here. Then, the church chose Leo to lead it, and the American focus of our time was suddenly underlined.

The president is a nationalist who vows to “Make America Great Again.” He won the Catholic vote in 2024. But the church is a global institution, not a national one. Trump and his most fervent supporters cast a skeptical eye on globalism and globalization.

There is much speculation about why the cardinals selected a Chicago-born prelate to lead them at this moment, when Trump is reasserting American power and fighting to build or restore the power of the presidency itself.

Initially, the anti-Trump media predictably spun the election of Leo into a rebuke of the White House, with the cardinals selecting a gladiator to battle against American nationalism.

But that narrative is quickly falling apart. The only evidence produced for it was past retweets and social media posts advocating “sensible gun control laws” and questioning Trump's rhetoric on immigration.

If the College of Cardinals simply wanted an American pope whose views would clash with Trump's, there were more fitting candidates.

Something else seems to have been at work — something that is less about standing athwart Trump's pursuit of power and American greatness and more about building bridges where possible.

It is a fool's errand to contemplate the Catholic Church and its supreme pastor within a secular political framework. Dichotomies such as “right-wing” and “left-wing” mean little to an institution that predates the discipline of political science by nearly two millennia.

When the world is thinking in weeks, the church is thinking in centuries.

Trump was asked in the days leading up to the conclave who he would like to see elected pope. His first answer was an inevitable joke: He said he would be a good pope himself. His second answer mentioned Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York.

Dolan, a jovial Irishman who has pastored the massive New York archdiocese since 2009, is perhaps the most powerful cardinal in America. He knows Trump personally and has cordial relations with him. He delivered a benediction at both Trump inaugurations, in 2017 and 2025, and he has been photographed many times buddying up with the president at public events such as the Al Smith Dinner.

But Dolan is not a toady of the White House. Among the “anti-Trump” social media activity attributed to then-Cardinal Prevost was his retweeting of an article by Dolan titled “Why Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric is so problematic.”

Speaking to reporters after the conclave, Dolan called the president's recent AI-generated image of himself as pope a brutta figura — Italian for “ugly figure” or “bad impression.”

Several Italian news outlets identified Dolan as playing a pivotal role in the conclave and securing votes for Prevost among his fellow Americans and other English-speaking cardinals from countries that were once part of the British Empire.

The finer points of discussions that happen in conclave are kept secret under oath, but heading into the election, “stability” was said to be the word on every cardinal's lips.

“When we went in there Wednesday afternoon, I think most people had a clean, clear idea about the candidate that they wanted — and it didn't take that long,” Dolan said after the election of Leo.

The new pope's solemn and sober demeanor is immediately obvious. He is calm, controlled, and pastoral.

He speaks in a soft and steady tone, with more of a flourish when talking about Christ, but shows a more passive voice on matters of the temporal world. Thus far, he has rarely spoken without prepared remarks.

In his first address to members of the media in Paul VI Audience Hall, Leo urged news figures to exercise restraint in their language and to escape the Tower of Babel created by polarized, hostile discourse.

“We do not need loud, forceful communication but rather communication that is capable of listening and gathering the voices of the weak who have no voice,” he said. “Let us disarm words. Let us disarm words, and we will help the world disarm. Disarming communication will allow us to share events of the world and to act in a manner consistent with our human dignity.”

Leo said he chose his name to echo the last pope of the 19th century, Pope Leo XIII. He led the church during a time of political, social, and economic revolutions as the world hurtled toward modernization and industrialization. His papacy offered spiritual stability amid the breakdown of feudal-era political systems.

Leo XIV suggested he believes the digital revolution is comparable, as a development with just as much consequence to human life as the industrial revolution. He has acknowledged the benefits of artificial intelligence but has cautioned the world to recognize that it poses “new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice, and labor.”

This theological orthodoxy and clear view of the likelihood of exploitation is a marked contrast to the AI-loving, crypto-dealing, IVF-championing politics of Trump.

Where the secular world accelerates into the unknown, the Catholic Church is meant to pump the brakes and remind us all of eternal truths that no new technology should be allowed to obscure.

Trump did not respond to Leo's election as though the church had just chosen a new rival to challenge him. Instead, the president savored the “honor” of an American citizen sitting on the throne.

“Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope,” Trump wrote on Truth Social following Leo's ascension. “It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope.”

“What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country,” he continued. “I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!”

Trump was elected to improve the lives of average citizens and resuscitate traditional American culture, which has been gutted by hostile secular leftist forces. Many of his allies in America and abroad see their mission as restoring Western civilization. Vice President JD Vance is prominent in pushing this theme of Trump's presidency.

Vance converted to Catholicism in 2019 after years of spiritual wanderings that began in the evangelical theology of his youth. His faith plays a prominent role in his decision-making, and he frequently cites Catholic intellectual tradition in his remarks.

His is not a unique story among modern conservatives.

Christianity's role in public life is diminished compared to the founding of the country, which was at a time when state churches were common in many countries and atheism was scandalous. Vance lamented “where Western civilization has gone” during an address at the Heritage Foundation last month, asserting that “the Christian faith” is among the “very founding ideas of the West” that “all Western nations were in some important respect really based on in their original charter.”

Voters never decided or agreed to cast the church or religion out of the public square, he argued. That was the work of elites who no longer appreciated their cultural inheritance.

“Those very ideas have not just fallen out of favor, and they're not just less popular than they were 200 years ago or 300 years ago; of course, in the case of our friends in Europe, a thousand years ago,” Vance said. “What we've seen is that those ideas have become disfavored [by] the ruling elite of the societies.”

Now, Americans of all religious backgrounds and of widely differing political beliefs are embracing the American pope.

Social media is abuzz with speculation about whether Leo has shopped at Costco and how many times he's visited a Buc-ee's.

The pope's favorite baseball team, the Chicago White Sox, congratulated the pontiff on its jumbotron following his election. Fans are showing up at Rate Field in fake liturgical vestments and mitres. On the East Coast, the Phillie Phanatic threw on papal robes as he stepped out for the audience.

The president of Villanova University, of which Leo is an alumnus, said he was “getting so many congratulations” that “you would think I became the pope.”

A bipartisan group of lawmakers from over a dozen states is pushing a resolution in Congress that would officially recognize and celebrate Leo as “the 267th pontiff of the Holy Roman Catholic Church” and “the first American pontiff.”

The 19th-century political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville, a French diplomat who traveled the early United States and documented sociological phenomena, reflected on the nature of liberty and religion in the New World.

In his estimation, the contrasting forces of liberty and historical Christianity were slowly but constantly pulling Americans in opposite directions.

“Our descendants will increasingly divide into only two parts, some leaving Christianity entirely and others embracing the Church of Rome,” he wrote.

Trump has reiterated his desire to meet with Leo soon. Vance is attending the pope's inauguration Mass. Formal requests have already been filed asking for an invitation to be made for the pontiff to speak in Congress.

VATICAN UNVEILS POPE LEO XIV'S COAT OF ARMS, OFFICIAL PORTRAIT

The U.S. is probably not on the verge of a mass conversion to Catholicism. But the sight of the Old World's most ancient honor being conferred on a son of the Midwest is compelling even, perhaps especially, to the citizens of the world's preeminent power.

Tocqueville might have been right. But perhaps he did not account for the Church of Rome extending a hand to help pull Americans in.

That Lear starts to lose his mind in this moment, in Act II, is important: If he were mad from the jump, the cause of his eventual downfall would be medical, not moral, and the king would bear no responsibility for the catastrophe that greets his kingdom. Precisely because the aging ruler is of sound mind in Act I, during which he sets into motion the events that threaten his sanity and his life, the blame is his to bear in Act V, when he has lost both.

Last year, the United States went through a presidential election filled with Shakespearean echoes. As Joe Biden tottered and fell (literally as well as metaphorically), more than a few pundits compared him to Lear, a man who was ruined by age, pride, and the flattery of sycophants. That analogy is picked up by Original Sin, the latest and most significant book to date about Biden's cognitive decline, which was written by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios's Alex Thompson and draws on hundreds of interviews. It features an epigraph from Lear, and its first chapter gives airing to the view that, like Lear, Biden bears responsibility for his country's fate. Quoting a senior adviser to Kamala Harris's presidential campaign, the title of that chapter is simply: “He Totally Fucked Us.”

Tapper and Thompson's exposé joins a growing list of post-election appraisals blaming Biden for Harris's loss. (I wrote one of these myself.) Yet the curious thing about the experience of reading Original Sin is that one comes away unable to lay the blame, or the majority of it anyway, at the feet of Scranton Joe. Here, the Lear analogy falls apart.

Original Sin suggests that, unlike Lear, who begins his rule flawed but with his mind intact, Biden may have been losing his grip before he took his oath of office. If this is true, Americans unwittingly voted for and were then led by a president who was not up to the job, a state of affairs that certain among the Biden faithful seemed committed to concealing. Tapper and Thompson studiously avoid saying this outright; to their credit, they do little editorializing. The book is written not unlike an autopsy report, describing a gruesome political car crash in dispassionate, clinical detail. The American people, however, must confront the possibility that the book raises: that we may not have had a president capable of discharging the office since Barack Obama left the White House, in 2017.

One might debate whether the former president can be held fully responsible for his disastrous reelection bid given his seemingly shaky mental acuity (which he continues to deny, saying that reports of his decline in office are “wrong”; Original Sin does not include his responses to any of the book's allegations). Biden's claims that he would have won a rematch with Donald Trump—which he reiterated in an appearance on The View last week—suggest that he is not fully tethered to political reality. But Original Sin leaves little doubt that his enablers, at least, understood what they were doing.  (Former first lady Jill Biden denies this as well. She said on The View that her husband was a “a great president”; though she did not mention Original Sin by name, she said, “The people who wrote those books were not in the White House with us.”)

Franklin Foer: How Biden destroyed his legacy

In an author's note, Tapper and Thompson offer a forewarning: “Readers who are convinced that Joe Biden was little more than a husk from the very beginning of his presidency, barely capable of stringing two sentences together, will not find support for that view here.” But rejecting the most extreme claims made about Biden's acuity hardly puts to rest the question of whether he should have run in 2020. And the idea that Biden was fully capable of doing the job when he first took office is quite hard to square with the 300-odd pages of meticulous reporting that follow.

It is of course literally true that Biden could string two sentences together at the start of his presidency (and can now). But Original Sin makes clear that even before he launched his first campaign against Trump, Biden was struggling. The authors write, “Those close to him say that the first signs he was deteriorating emerged after the death of his beloved son Beau in 2015”—a decade ago. Tapper and Thompson point to recordings from 2017 of Biden speaking with Mark Zwonitzer, the ghostwriter of his memoir. These tapes, which came to light six years later as part of Special Counsel Robert Hur's 2023 investigation into Biden's inappropriate handling of classified information, suggested that the president had lost a mental step, or several. “He grasped to remember things, he sometimes had difficulty speaking, and he frequently lost his train of thought,” the authors write, describing the recordings and the special counsel's sense of them. “Biden was really struggling in 2017,” Tapper and Thompson write, adding, “His cognitive capacity seemed to have been failing him.”

Three years later, on the presidential campaign trail, Biden's struggles became more obvious to those around him. Tapper and Thompson report that, in 2020, members of Biden's inner circle gave the candidate a teleprompter with scripted questions for a local-news interview. It was an apparent effort to work around his dwindling communicative and cognitive abilities: Aides lamented that even then, “they couldn't rely on him to stay on message, and he often had a very short attention span.” The book's most astounding previously unreported story from Biden's 2020 campaign concerns his staff's attempts to create videos of the candidate speaking with voters over Zoom. Tapper and Thompson's description of this is worth quoting at length:

Biden would sit in a room with several monitors beaming the face of real Americans in front of him so that they could discuss issues of importance.

The videos came back, hours of footage. Some on the team couldn't believe their eyes.

“The videos were horrible,” one top Democrat said. “He couldn't follow the conversation at all.”

“I couldn't believe it,” said a second Democrat, who hadn't seen Biden in a few years. “It was like a different person. It was incredible. This was like watching Grandpa who shouldn't be driving.”

A special team was brought in and told to edit the videos down to make them airable, if only a few minutes worth. They had to get creative.

The authors go on to write, “Edited, the videos likely appeared fine to viewers, Biden no worse than any other senior on Zoom. But two of the Democrats who were involved in the films' production together were dumbfounded. ‘I didn't think he could be president,' the second Democrat said. After what they'd seen, they couldn't understand how Biden could be capable of doing the job.” (Two other top Democrats blamed the lousy footage on the awkwardness of Zoom.)

The idea that this same man, only a short time later, was able to reliably prosecute the duties of the position to which he was elected is hard to believe. Indeed, some incidents cataloged in Original Sin suggest that Biden may have been struggling to do the job even early in his term. Cabinet meetings were “terrible and at times uncomfortable,” one Cabinet secretary told the authors. “And they were from the beginning.” Biden relied on note cards and canned responses. (Some Biden aides told Tapper and Thompson that Cabinet meetings are stilted in every administration, and that Biden was more engaged in smaller meetings.)

In his term's first year, the authors write in the book, the president met with the House Democratic Caucus, ostensibly to ask its members to vote for a $1.2 trillion infrastructure package. But after delivering prolix remarks that one congressperson characterized as “incomprehensible,” Biden did not make the ask—which many of the politicians present thought was a strategic decision. Later that month, then–House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked him to address the caucus once more, hoping that this time he would push for the package. Yet again, Biden dithered and prattled. And yet again, a Democratic congressperson told Tapper and Thompson, Biden's address was “meandering and incoherent.” Biden did finish with a strong demand: “That's all I gotta say … let's get this done.” The only problem? The assembled politicians weren't sure what exactly the president wanted done because he had, once more, neglected to ask them to do anything. According to Tapper and Thompson, Pelosi believed that this was another strategic omission on Biden's part. A different member of the Democratic leadership told Tapper and Thompson that it might have been a memory lapse: “We wondered: Did he forget to make the ask, or is this just him being a super-safe politician? Between his stutter and aging, we were never quite clear on what, exactly, was going on.” The next year, he did seem to have trouble with his memory; in 2022, according to one witness, Biden found himself unable to remember the name of his own national security adviser, Jake Sullivan—“Steve,” he called him at least twice—or his communications director, Kate Bedingfield, whom he once resorted to calling “Press.”

Biden's limitations were also clear during a rambling interview with Special Counsel Hur in October 2023. It took place during the two days after Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which means that when Biden was ostensibly in charge of directing American foreign policy during a moment of profound geopolitical tension, the president was incapable of sitting through an interview without forgetting words and dates and going on rambling tangents. Rather than reacting with alarm to this fact, the White House mounted a pressure campaign against Attorney General Merrick Garland. As first reported by Politico, Biden insiders were furious that Garland hadn't edited Hur's observations about the president's shoddy memory out of the classified-documents report, and most of Biden's senior advisers reportedly believed that Garland would not continue in his role as AG during the president's hypothetical second term.

One Biden campaign consultant referred to in the book, who was conducting focus groups around this time, found that voters were concerned that Biden's apparent decline would put the country at risk: “Many of them were worried,” Tapper and Thompson write. “What if an international crisis unfolded in the middle of the night?” These voters were not the only ones having these morbid thoughts. “The presidency requires someone who can perform at 2:00am during an emergency,” Tapper and Thompson write. “Cabinet secretaries in his own administration told us that by 2024, he could not be relied upon for this.”

As some high-ranking Democrats quoted anonymously in the book put it to Tapper and Thompson after Biden's disastrous debate with Trump last June: “Just who the hell is running the country?” At least one unnamed source close to the Biden administration was willing to provide the authors with an answer. “Five people were running the country,” this insider said, seemingly referring to the president's closest advisers. “And Joe Biden was at best a senior member of the board.”

Near the end of their book, Tapper and Thompson offer a glimpse into how powerful Democrats responded to the grim spectacle of Biden's early-summer face-off with Trump. The authors describe a scene at the home of James Costos, an ambassador to Spain under Obama, where celebrities and politicians gathered to watch the debate. As a doddering Biden tanked onstage in front of some 50 million Americans, the film director and Democratic donor Rob Reiner became scared, then furious. “We're going to lose our fucking democracy because of you!” he screamed, seeming to direct his ire at the closest thing to a Biden official in the room: Second gentleman Doug Emhoff.

What Reiner apparently failed to consider, but what Original Sin prompts readers to ask, is whether America's democracy was already meaningfully diminished. Describing how some in Biden world justified propping him up for reelection in 2024, a longtime aide told Tapper and Thompson: “He just had to win, and then he could disappear for four years—he'd only have to show proof of life every once in a while.” In other words, before Biden stepped down from the race, the plan for some aides seemed to be to Weekend at Bernie's a cognitively impaired president in the hopes that, upon winning a second term, he could be hidden from the public while unelected staff took care of the real business of governing. “When you vote for somebody, you are voting for the people around them too,” this aide offered as a way of justifying what was, by any reasonable metric, an effort to undermine democracy and defraud the American people.

The members of Biden's staff weren't the only ones comfortable with abandoning democratic norms. The former president enjoyed the support of the Democratic Party, which at his behest blew up the old primary schedule, putting South Carolina in the first slot. The ostensible justification was anti-racism and elevating voters of color in a heavily Black state. According to Tapper and Thompson, aides at both the White House and the Democratic National Committee admitted that “the main motivation was helping Joe Biden, not uplifting Black voters.” South Carolina was a strong state for Biden, and the thinking seemed to be that a steady performance there might put primary challengers to bed early. In other words, the DNC appeared to try its level best to tip the process in favor of reelecting a man who a majority of the public thought could not do the job.

Mark Leibovich: The lie Democrats are telling themselves

“Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,” asks Kent in King Lear, “When power to flattery bows?” The nobleman is one of the only characters in Shakespeare's play who gives the king honest advice, and who warns Lear that the course of action he has chosen is dictated by pride, the result of following those who tell him what he wants—not needs—to hear.

Perhaps the most striking aspect of Original Sin is how few Kents populate its pages. Dozens of people in Biden's orbit suspected that he was not physically or mentally equipped to be the president of the United States, yet they helped him seek that office and keep it when he couldn't reliably perform its duties. These people then sought to return Biden to that office for four more years, even if that meant the country would most likely have been quietly run by unelected aides. In a rational world, Congress would hold bipartisan hearings about how this happened and whether and to what extent Biden's aides hid the truth from the public. Then again, in a rational world, neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump—who has spent his first months back in office intentionally dismantling core institutions, flouting the law, and threatening the Constitution—would have been elected president in the first place.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Russell Vought is advancing a radical ideological project decades in the making.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

The opening act of Donald Trump's second term was defined by the theatrical dismantling of much of the federal government by Elon Musk and his group of tech-savvy demolitionists. Everywhere you looked in those first 100 days, it seemed, Musk's prestidigitation was on display. Look there—it's Elon in a black MAGA hat waving around a chain saw onstage at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Look here—it's Elon introducing Fox News viewers to a teenage software engineer nicknamed “Big Balls” whom he'd hired to help slash the government. The performance had a certain improvised quality—pink slips dispersed and then hastily withdrawn, entire agencies mothballed overnight—and after a while, it started to feel like a torqued-up sequel to Trump's first term: governance replaced by chaos and trolling.

But that version of the story misses a key character: Russell Vought.

Behind all the DOGE pyrotechnics, Vought—who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget—is working methodically to advance a sophisticated ideological project decades in the making. If Musk is moving fast and breaking things, as the Silicon Valley dictum goes, Vought is taking the shattered pieces of the federal government and reassembling them into a radically new constitutional order.

“I'm not going to say it's a misdirection play, but they're the trauma-inducing shock troops,” Steve Bannon, who worked with Vought during Trump's first term and remains in touch with him, told me of DOGE. “Russ has got a vision. He's not an anarchist. He's a true believer.”

Vought's agenda includes shrinking the government, but it goes deeper than that. His vision of state power would effectively reject a century of jurisprudence and unravel the modern federal bureaucracy as we know it. A devotee of the so-called unitary executive theory, he wants to see the civil service gutted and repopulated with presidential loyalists, independent federal agencies politicized or eliminated, and absolute control of the executive branch concentrated in the Oval Office.

Lila Shroff: It's a model of government efficiency, but DOGE wants it gone

Despite having been a Trump adviser for nearly a decade, Vought has not cultivated the political celebrity of high-profile White House officials such as Stephen Miller and Karoline Leavitt. Vought rarely gives interviews (he declined my request), and when he does speak in public, he is usually explicating the wonkish intricacies of the federal government in a nasal voice. His job title is dull and opaque. Even his physical bearing is forgettable: Bald and bespectacled, with a graying beard, he looks a bit like a middle-school social-studies teacher.

But whereas Musk's influence already seems to be waning, Vought remains among the most powerful figures in today's Washington. As a co-author of Project 2025, and later a chair of the Republican National Convention's platform committee, he drew up detailed plans to “tame the bureaucracy” once Trump returned to power. Now, as head of an agency that touches every aspect of the $6.8 trillion federal budget, Vought is in position to enact his vision. And he's wasted little time.

In his early days as acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—an independent agency that was designed to be insulated from partisan pressure—Vought sent layoff notices to 1,500 employees, closed the office, canceled contracts, and declined funding for the agency from the Federal Reserve. Across hundreds of other federal agencies, he is spearheading an effort to simply stop enforcing many regulations. And last month, Trump proposed a rule that would convert 50,000 federal workers into Schedule F employees, whom the president can fire at will—a policy that Vought has championed since the first term. Vought's ideas, once seen as radical, are now being realized.

Vought's critics have warned that elements of his agenda—for example, unilaterally cutting off funding for congressionally established agencies such as USAID—are eroding checks and balances and pushing the country toward a constitutional crisis. But in interviews over the past several weeks, some of his allies told me that's the whole point. The kind of revolutionary upending of the constitutional order that Vought envisions won't happen without deliberate fights with Congress and the judiciary, they told me. If a crisis is coming, it's because Vought is courting one.

Bannon told me that mainstream Republicans have long complained about runaway federal bureaucracy but have never had the stomach to take on the problem directly. Vought, by contrast, is strategically forcing confrontations with the other branches of government. “What Russ represents, and what the Romneys and McConnells don't understand, is that the old politics is over,” he said. “There's no compromise here. One side is going to win, one side is going to lose, so let's get it on.”

Anne Applebaum: There's a term for what Trump and Musk are doing

The White House did not respond to a list of questions I sent them for this story. But in a statement, Communications Director Steven Cheung called Vought a “patriot” and told me, “There is nobody more qualified or better suited to lead OMB in order to implement President Trump's goals and priorities.”

Vought himself has written that we are living in a “post-Constitutional time.” Progressives, he argues, have so thoroughly “perverted” the Founders' vision by filling the ranks of government with unaccountable technocrats that undoing the damage will require a “radical” plan of attack. “The Right needs to throw off the precedents and legal paradigms that have wrongly developed over the last two hundred years,” he wrote in an essay for The American Mind, a journal published by the Claremont Institute.

What exactly would such an approach look like in practice? Mike Davis, a Republican lawyer and a friend of Vought's who helped steer judicial nominations in Trump's first term, told me that he expects an escalating series of standoffs between the Trump administration and the judicial branch. He went so far as to say that if the Supreme Court issues a decision that constrains Trump's executive power in a way the administration sees as unconstitutional, the president will have to defy it. “The reptiles will never drain the swamp,” Davis told me. “It's going to take bold actions.”

Vought's radicalization was not a foregone conclusion. He grew up in Trumbull, Connecticut, with a devout family who sent him to a private Christian school and Bible camp in the summers. At Wheaton College, the evangelical university where he studied history and political science, Vought was bookish and a bit “nerdy,” according to one fellow graduate who knew him at the time. The former student, who requested anonymity to recount personal interactions, told me that Vought was a target of periodic pranks on their floor in Traber Hall. On one occasion, some of Vought's dorm mates took a putrid-smelling bin that had been collecting dirty dishes in the common bathroom and hid it under his bed.

On Wheaton's conservative campus, Vought didn't stand out as particularly ideological. He made a brief foray into electoral politics with a failed bid for student-body vice president, during which he campaigned, according to Bloomberg Businessweek, on improving the school's recycling program. His views began to take on a sharper edge when he got to Washington. He spent a decade working on Capitol Hill, including as a policy aide to the House Republican Conference under then-Chairman Mike Pence, and became the executive director of the Republican Study Committee, a conservative caucus founded to exert pressure on House GOP leadership from the right. In 2010, he left Congress to join the Heritage Foundation's lobbying arm.

Elaine Godfrey: Federal workers are facing a new reality

Vought earned a reputation in Washington's right-wing circles for his deep knowledge of how the federal government actually works. “There's a category of conservative activists who say, ‘This is what should be done,' and there's a much smaller group who actually know how to make it happen. Russ is one of them,” Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative pressure group Judicial Watch, told me.

The early years of Barack Obama's presidency inspired a wave of libertarian energy on the right. Tea Party activists railed against excessive federal spending and bloated bureaucracy. The popular rallying cry of the moment was to shrink the government down to the size where one could “drown it in a bathtub,” as Grover Norquist famously put it. But Vought wanted to go further than the Norquists of the world.

After Republicans failed to recapture the White House in 2012, Vought joined a small group of activists and operatives who began gathering a few blocks from the Capitol, at the Judicial Watch offices, to strategize. They called themselves Groundswell, and their stated mission, according to leaked documents, was bold if a bit grandiose: to wage a “30 front war” that would “fundamentally transform the nation.” The weekly meetings drew a who's who of influential insurgents, including Ginni Thomas, Dan Bongino, Leonard Leo, and Bannon, who was then running Breitbart News. Their agenda was diffuse, but they were united in a shared conviction that the Republican establishment and much of the conservative movement were insufficiently radical. They were impatient with the standard small-government activism of the era—they wanted more confrontation, and were open to more extreme ideas.

The conservative commentator Erick Erickson, who first met Vought in 2004, recalls his friend explaining to him early in Obama's first term the mechanisms by which the purportedly nonpartisan civil service had come to be teeming with Democrats intent on thwarting right-leaning policies and pushing left-wing ones. It was a prototype of the “woke and weaponized bureaucracy” rhetoric that Vought and his allies would deploy in the Trump era.

The unitary executive theory had been circulating in GOP circles since at least Ronald Reagan's first term. The idea held that Article II of the Constitution gives the president absolute control over the executive branch, including nonpartisan civil servants and independent agencies such as the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Republicans had periodically experimented with ways of applying this principle: After Reagan took office in 1981, the Heritage Foundation lobbied the new administration to recruit partisan supporters to fill 5,000 new jobs created by the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act.

There was, during the Obama years, limited intellectual appetite on the right for a return of the imperial presidency. But Trump's arrival in the Oval Office in 2017—and his running claims that the “deep state” was sabotaging his presidency—changed all of that. Suddenly, Republicans were eager to discover new and creative ways to tighten the president's grip on the executive branch. Vought, who joined the administration as deputy director of OMB before eventually becoming director, was happy to offer his services.

Michael Scherer, Ashley Parker, Matteo Wong, and Shane Harris: This is what happens when the DOGE guys take over

Unlike most OMB directors, whose only forays into political controversy are in drafting the president's budget proposals, Vought quietly played a role in some of the Trump era's most combustible moments. In 2019, when Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, it was Vought's office that withheld military aid to the country, eventually triggering Trump's first impeachment. And when Congress refused to fund the border wall, it was Vought who convinced the president to declare a state of emergency so that he could redirect $3.6 billion from a military construction budget to the project.

Vought has expressed pride in his record of pushing boundaries in ways that unsettle less dogmatic Republicans. Whereas many religious conservatives distance themselves from the “Christian nationalist” label, Vought wears it proudly. At a Heritage event, he sarcastically derided some of the Cabinet officials in Trump's first term, whom he described as “a bunch of people around him who were constantly sitting on eggs and saying, Oh my gosh, he's getting me to violate the law.”

And in a 2023 speech at the Center for Renewing America, the think tank he led after Trump's first term, Vought touted the virtues of cruelty as he held forth on his plans for the federal civil service. “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,” he said at a closed-door meeting, according to a video that was later leaked to ProPublica. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. We want to put them in trauma.”

As disruptive as Vought's early moves have been, his most dramatic provocations are likely still to come. Vought has been a vocal champion of reviving the presidential “impoundment” power, which would allow the president to effectively circumvent Congress to unilaterally withhold appropriated funds. Congress outlawed the practice in 1974, and the Supreme Court has ruled it unconstitutional. But Trump has publicly rejected this interpretation of the law, and Vought has called impoundment “a necessary remedy to our fiscal brokenness.”

Earlier this month, the White House released its proposed budget to Congress, calling for $163 billion in reductions to federal spending, and making many of DOGE's cuts permanent. In a letter to Congress, Vought wrote that the proposed cuts aimed to root out “niche non-governmental organizations and institutions of higher education committed to radical gender and climate ideologies antithetical to the American way of life.” The proposal included slashing the budget for the CDC by nearly 40 percent, dramatically scaling back rental-assistance programs, and cutting aid to international-development banks.

From the May 2025 issue: I should have seen this coming

In a typical year, the president's budget proposal is little more than a messaging document, with virtually no chance of becoming law as written. Congress has the power of the purse. But given Trump's stated indifference to such conventions, this year's White House budget could be less a proposal than a warning shot. It doesn't require much imagination to envision how the coming budget fight could spiral into the kind of constitutional crisis that Vought's allies are rooting for: Congress declines to enshrine Trump's spending cuts as law. Trump cuts the funding anyway. Legal challenges follow, court orders are issued, and Trump defies them, claiming a decisive mandate from voters and sweeping power under the unitary executive theory.

Some conservatives, wary of concentrating so much power in the Oval Office, question the path that Vought is taking. Philip Wallach, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who recently wrote a book called Why Congress, told me that he generally supports Vought's effort to rein in the so-called administrative state. But he is alarmed by what he considers to be Vought's disregard for core constitutional principles such as separation of powers. “For those of us who care about constitutional government,” Wallach said, “this administration is creating a lot of moments of truth.”

Of course, partisan enthusiasm for executive power rarely outlasts the loss of the White House. But Vought's allies trust that he knows what he's doing. “He's mindful enough to understand that eventually a Democrat will become president again,” Erickson told me. “So how do you make the bureaucracy responsive to the president of the day without making it powerful enough to work at cross-purposes with conservative goals when a Democrat is in there? One of the easiest ways is to downsize.”

In other words, the durability of Vought's ideological project might depend on just how much of the federal government Trump can unravel before he leaves office.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

For decades, Eve Baer remained convinced that her son, unresponsive after a severe brain injury, was still conscious. Science eventually proved her right.

The Toyota pickup hit the tree that May morning with enough explosive force to leave a gash that is still visible on its trunk 39 years later. Inside the truck, the bodies of three teenage boys hurled forward, each with terrible velocity.

One boy died instantly; a second was found alive outside the car. The third boy, Ian Berg, remained pinned in the driver's seat, a bruise blooming on the right side of his forehead. He had smacked it hard—much harder than one might have guessed from the bruise alone—which caused the soft mass of his brain to slam against the rigid confines of his skull. Where brain met bone, brain gave way. The matter of his mind stretched and twisted, tore and burst.

When the jaws of life freed him from the wreckage, Ian was still alive, but unconscious. “Please don't die. Please don't die. Please don't die,” his mother, Eve Baer, pleaded over him at the hospital. She imagined throwing a golden lasso around his foot to keep him from floating away.

And Ian didn't die. After 17 days in a coma, he finally opened his eyes, but they flicked wildly around the room, unable to sync or track. He could not speak. He could not control his limbs. The severe brain injury he'd suffered, doctors said, had put him in a vegetative state. He was alive, but assumed to be cognitively gone—devoid of thought, of feeling, of consciousness.

Eve hated that term, vegetative—an “unhuman-type classification,” she thought. If you had asked her then, in 1986, she would have said she expected her 17-year-old son to fully recover. Ian had been handsome, popular, in love with a new girlfriend—the kind of golden boy upon whom fortune smiles. At school, he was known as the kid who greeted everyone, teachers included, with a hug. He and his two friends in the car belonged to a tight-knit group of seniors. But on the day he would have graduated that June, Ian was still lying in a hospital bed, his big achievement being that he'd finally made a bowel movement.

“What kind of life is that?” Ian's brother Geoff remembers thinking. When he first arrived at the hospital, he had looked around the room for a plug to pull. The two brothers had talked about scenarios like this before, Geoff told me: “If anything ever happens to me and I can't wipe my ass, make sure you kill me.” Angry that their mother was keeping his brother alive, Geoff fled, moving for a time to St. Thomas.

Three months after the accident, when doctors at the hospital could do no more for Ian, Eve took him home. She was adamant that he live with family, rather than under the impersonal care of a nursing home. That she had ample space for Ian and all of his specialized equipment was fortuitous. A few weeks before the accident, Eve's husband, Marshall, had stumbled upon the Rainbow Lodge, an old hotel for hunters and fishers, for sale near Woodstock, New York. He loved the idea of a compound for their big blended family—his two grown children plus nieces and nephews, as well as Eve's four kids, of whom Ian is the youngest. The sale was finalized while Ian was in the hospital.

At the lodge, Eve and a rotating cast of caretakers kept Ian alive: bathing him, pureeing home-cooked meals for his feeding tube, changing the urine bag that drained his catheter. She also devised a busy schedule of therapies, anchored by up to six hours a day of psychomotor “patterning”—an exercise program she'd read about in which a team of volunteers took each of Ian's limbs and moved them in a pattern that mimicked an infant learning to crawl. Friends and acquaintances came to help with patterning; some started living in the lodge's guest rooms, staying for months or even years. They formed a kind of unconventional extended family, with Ian at the center. Every Sunday, Eve cooked big dinners for the crowd.

The patterning exercises, which are not based on science, ultimately did not really help Ian. But his mother didn't dwell on this. She made regular calls to the National Institutes of Health to inquire about the latest brain-injury research. And where mainstream medicine failed, Eve—who had moved to Woodstock in the '60s as a “wannabe bohemian slash beatnik”—turned enthusiastically to alternatives. Ian was treated by the spiritual guru Ram Dass; a “magic man” with a pendulum; a craniosacral therapist; a Buddhist monk; Filipino “psychic surgeons”; and a healer in Chandigarh, India. Eve and Marshall took him on the 7,000-mile journey to India themselves, pushing him in a rented collapsible wheelchair. When, after all of this, Ian's condition still did not improve, Eve became angry. It was one of the rare times that she allowed disappointment to puncture her relentless optimism.

Still, like so many other family members of vegetative patients, she held on to a mother's belief that Ian could understand everything around him. She took care, when shaving him, to leave the wispy mustache he had been trying to grow. When his high-school friends went to see the Grateful Dead, she brought him along in his wheelchair and a tie-dyed shirt. She kept believing for herself as much as for Ian: If her son was aware, it would mean her gestures of love were not unseen, her words not unheard.

Science would take decades to catch up with Eve, but she turned out to be right in one crucial respect: Ian is still aware. Doctors now agree that he can see, he can hear, and he can understand, at least in some ways, the people around him.

Over the past 20 years, the science of consciousness has undergone a reckoning as researchers have used new tools to peer inside the brains of people once thought to lack any cognitive function. Ian is part of a landmark study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last year, which found that 25 percent of unresponsive brain-injury patients show signs of awareness, based on their brain activity. The finding suggests that there could be tens of thousands of people like Ian in the United States—many in nursing homes where caretakers might have no clue that their patients silently understand and think and feel. These patients live in a profound isolation, their conscious minds trapped inside unresponsive bodies. Doctors are just beginning to grasp what it might take to help them.

For Ian, the signs were there, if not right at the beginning, at least early on. Three years after the accident, he began to laugh.

Eve was in the kitchen with him, idly singing the Jeopardy theme song in a silly falsetto when she heard it: “Ha!” Laughter? Laughter! “Other than a cough, it was the first sound I heard from him in three years,” she told me. In time, Ian started laughing at other things too: stories Eve made up about a cantankerous Russian named Boris, the word debris, pots clanging, keys jangling. Fart and poop jokes were a perennial favorite; his brain seemed to have preserved a 17-year-old's sense of humor. His friends and family took that to mean the Ian they knew was still in there. What else might he be thinking?

At the time, Ian was not regularly seeing a neurologist. But even if he had been, most neurologists in the '80s would not have known what to make of his laughter; it flew in the face of conventional wisdom.

Doctors first defined the condition of the persistent vegetative state in 1972, less than a decade and a half before Ian's accident. Fred Plum and Bryan Jennett coined the term to describe a perplexing new class of patients—people who, thanks to advances in medical care, were surviving brain injuries that used to be fatal, but were still left stranded somewhere short of consciousness. This condition is distinct from coma, a temporary state in which the eyes are closed. Vegetative patients are awake; their eyes are open, and they may be neither silent nor still. They can moan and move their limbs, just without purpose or control. And while their bodies continue to breathe, sleep, wake, and digest, they seem to have no connection to the outside world. Today, experts sometimes refer to the vegetative state as “unresponsive wakefulness syndrome.”

Back then, the two doctors also distinguished it from locked-in syndrome, which Plum had helped name a few years prior. Locked-in patients are fully conscious though immobile, except for typically their eyes. (Jean-Dominique Bauby wrote his famous 1997 memoir about locked-in syndrome, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, by blinking out one letter at a time.) In contrast, Plum and Jennett considered the vegetative state “mindless,” with no cognitive function intact.

What, then, could the laughter mean? By the '90s, some of the most prominent experts on consciousness—including Plum and Jennett themselves—had begun to realize that they had perhaps too categorically or hastily dismissed patients diagnosed as vegetative. Researchers were documenting flickers of potential consciousness in some supposedly vegetative patients. These patients could utter occasional words, grasp for an object every now and then, or seem to answer the odd question with a gesture—suggesting that they were at least sometimes aware of their surroundings. They seemed to be neither vegetative nor fully conscious, but fluctuating on a continuum.

This in-between space became formally recognized in 2002 as the “minimally conscious state,” in an effort led by Joseph Giacino, a neuropsychologist who specializes in rehabilitation after brain injury. (Coma, vegetative, and minimally conscious are sometimes collectively called “disorders of consciousness.”)

One day in spring 2007, Marshall, Ian's stepfather, slipped on a mossy stone and fractured his hip. As he and Eve waited for an ambulance, the phone rang. Giacino had heard about Eve's NIH inquiries, and he was interested in meeting Ian—he wondered if the minimally conscious diagnosis might apply to him. If so, Ian could qualify for a new experimental trial.

Giacino didn't make any promises. Still, after all those years, Eve told me, “he was the first voice of positive possibility that I heard.” So even as Marshall lay next to her with his broken hip, neither of them dared hang up the phone.

Around this time, in 2006, an astonishing case report came out from researchers led by Adrian Owen, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge; it suggested that even vegetative patients could retain some awareness. Owen found a 23-year-old woman who had been in a car accident. Months later, she still had no response on behavioral exams. But in an fMRI machine, her brain looked surprisingly active: When she was asked to imagine playing tennis, blood flowed to her brain's supplementary motor area, a region that helps coordinate movement. When she was asked to imagine visiting the rooms of her house, blood flowed to different parts of her brain, including the parahippocampal gyrus, a strip of cortex crucial for spatial navigation. And when she was told to rest, these patterns of brain activity ceased. Based on the limited window of an fMRI scan, at least, she seemed to understand everything she was being asked to do.

“Unsettling and disturbing” is how one neurologist described the implications of the study to me. Also: controversial. Another doctor recounted a scientific meeting soon after where the speakers were split 50–50 on whether to accept the results. Was the fMRI finding just a fluke? Owen did not inform the woman's family of what he found, because the study's ethical protocol was ambiguous about how much information he could share. He wishes he could have. The woman died in 2011, without her family ever being told that she might have been aware.

Over time, Owen and his group identified more patients with what they came to call “covert awareness.” Some were vegetative, while others were considered minimally conscious, based on behaviors such as eye tracking and command following. The researchers found that outward response and inner awareness were not always correlated: The most physically responsive patients were not necessarily the ones with the clearest signs of brain activity when asked to imagine the tasks. Covert awareness, then, can be detected only using tools that peer at a brain's inner workings, such as fMRI.

In 2010, one of Owen's collaborators, the Belgian neurologist Steven Laureys, asked a minimally conscious patient, a 22-year-old man, a series of five yes-or-no questions while he was in an fMRI machine, covering topics such as his father's name and the last vacation he took prior to his motorcycle accident. To answer yes, the patient would imagine playing tennis for 30 seconds; to answer no, he would imagine walking through his house. The researchers ran through the questions only once, but he got them all right, the appropriate region of his brain lighting up each time.

It is hard to say what experience of human consciousness some colored pixels on a brain scan really depict. To answer intentionally, the patient would have had to understand language. He would also have needed to store the questions in his working memory and retrieve the answers from his long-term memory. In my conversations with neurologists, this was the study they cited again and again as the most compelling evidence of covert awareness.

A few years later, using the same yes-or-no method, Owen found a vegetative patient who seemed to know about his niece, born after his brain injury. To Owen, this suggested that the man was laying down new memories, that life was not simply passing him by. In yet another case, Owen used fMRI not just to quiz a 38-year-old vegetative man, but to actually ask about the quality of his life 12 years post-injury: Was he in pain right now? No. Did he still enjoy watching hockey on TV, as he had before his accident? Yes.

Most researchers I spoke with were reluctant to speculate about the inner life of these brain-injury patients, because the answer lies beyond any known science. The brains of minimally conscious patients do activate in response to pain or music, Laureys told me, but their experience of pain or music is likely different from yours or mine. Their state of consciousness may resemble the twilight zone of drifting in and out of sleep; it almost certainly differs from person to person. Owen believes that some of his vegetative patients may actually be “completely conscious,” akin to a locked-in person who is fully aware, but cannot move even their eyes. Until that is proved otherwise, he sees no reason not to extend them the benefit of the doubt.

Several months after the phone call from Giacino's office, Ian's family made the trip to New Jersey to meet the researcher. In the exam room, Giacino put Ian through an intense battery of tests. He found that Ian could intermittently reach on command for a red ball. He laughed at loud noises, such as keys jangling, which Giacino said could be a simple response to the sound. But Ian also laughed appropriately at jokes, especially adolescent ones, as if he understood humor and intent. These behaviors were enough to qualify Ian for a brand-new diagnosis two decades after his accident: not vegetative, but minimally conscious.

Giacino's collaborators were eager to put Ian in an fMRI machine, to see what might be happening inside his brain. On a separate trip, this time to an fMRI facility in New York City, his family met Nicholas Schiff, a neurologist at Weill Cornell and a protégé of Fred Plum's. Schiff, too, was intrigued by Ian's laughter, and the possibility that he understood more than he could physically let on. Schiff's team showed Ian pictures and played voices—to see whether his brain could process faces and speech—and asked him to imagine tasks such as walking around his house.

Ian's brother Geoff was also at this scan, having by then returned to New York. Crammed into the small fMRI control room with all the scientists peering at Ian's brain, he remembers being incredulous at the things they wanted his brother to imagine. “You really think he can understand you?” he asked.

The scientists did. They believed Ian still retained some kind of consciousness. They also thought there was a chance, with luck and the right tools, of unlocking more. This had happened before. In some extraordinary patients, the line between conscious and unconscious is more permeable than one might expect.

In 2003, Terry Wallis, in Arkansas, suddenly uttered “Mom!” after 19 years as a vegetative patient in a nursing home. Then he said “Pepsi”—his favorite soft drink. After that, his mother took him home. Wallis couldn't move below his neck and he struggled with his memory and impulse control, but he began to speak in short sentences, recognized his family, and continued to request Pepsis. In retrospect, he probably had not been vegetative at all, but minimally conscious during those first 19 years. His mom had seen signs that others at the nursing home had not: Wallis occasionally tracked objects with his eyes, and he became agitated after witnessing the death of his roommate with dementia.

Slowly, over time, Wallis's brain had recovered to the point of regaining speech. When Schiff and his colleagues later scanned him, they found changes that suggested neuronal connections were being formed and pruned decades after his injury. “Terry changed what we thought about what might be possible,” Schiff told Ian's family.

There was also Louis Viljoen, in South Africa, who in 1999 began speaking when put on zolpidem, better known as Ambien, a sedative that was, ironically, supposed to put him to sleep. He, too, had been declared vegetative—a “cabbage,” according to one doctor—after being hit by a truck. Within 25 minutes of taking zolpidem, his mother recalled, he started making his first sounds, and when she spoke, he responded, “Hello, Mummy.” Then the effects of the drug faded as rapidly as they'd come on.

Viljoen would continue taking zolpidem every day; he eventually recovered enough to be conscious even without the drug, but a daily dose reanimated him further. “After nine minutes the grey pallor disappears and his face flushes. He starts smiling and laughing. After 10 minutes he begins asking questions,” a reporter who met him in 2006 wrote. Several other drugs, including amantadine and apomorphine, can have similarly arousing effects, though none has worked in more than a tiny sliver of patients. In certain people, for reasons still not understood, they might activate a damaged brain just enough to kick it into gear, “like catching a ride on a wave,” Schiff, who has studied patients on Ambien, told me.

Greg Pearson, in New Jersey, had electrodes implanted in his thalamus in 2005 as part of a study by Schiff and Giacino. The thalamus is a walnut-size region of the brain that sits above the opening at the bottom of the skull, where the spinal cord meets the brain, a position that makes it particularly vulnerable during injury: When a bruised brain swells, it has nowhere to go but down, putting tremendous pressure on the thalamus. Because the thalamus usually regulates arousal—Schiff likens it to a pacemaker for the brain—damage to this region can induce disorders of consciousness. Schiff wondered if stimulating the thalamus could restore some of its function. And indeed, when the electrodes were turned on during surgery, Pearson blurted out his first word in many years: “Yup.” He was eventually able to recite the first 16 words of the Pledge of Allegiance and tell his mother, “I love you.”

A damaged brain, in some cases, might be more like a flickering lamp with faulty wiring than a lamp that has had its wiring ripped out. If so, that circuitry can be manipulated. The neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield realized this decades ago, when he discovered that he could make a conscious patient fall unconscious by gently pressing on a certain area of the brain.

That our consciousness might actually be dynamic, that it can be dialed up and down, is not so strange if you consider what happens every day. We become unconscious when we sleep at night, only to reanimate the next day. Could this dialing back up be artificially controlled when the brain is too damaged to do so itself?

After the publication of the study on Pearson, in 2007, Schiff couldn't keep up with all the calls to his office. He and his colleagues were now looking for more patients, including people who were even less responsive initially than Pearson—people whose condition would test the extent of what deep-brain stimulation using electrodes could do.

Given his limited but still discernible responses, Ian seemed like the perfect candidate. The researchers were careful not to make guarantees. But Eve harbored hope that Ian could one day tell her, “I love you.” His family agreed to join the trial.

I'll cut to the chase: Ian's deep-brain stimulation did not work. At one point during the surgery to implant the electrodes, he said the only intelligible word he's uttered since 1986—“Down,” in response to being asked, “What is the opposite of up?” Then he lapsed into silence once again. In the months that followed, therapists spent hours and hours asking Ian to move his arm or respond to questions, to no avail.

Geoff, who worked in video production at the time, captured the process on film. He had intended to make a documentary about what he hoped would be his brother's recovery. In addition to filming Ian in the trial, he'd taped interviews with family members, asking what hearing Ian speak again would mean to them.

He never did make the documentary. Without a miraculous recovery, he felt, the story was just too sad. This past winter, Geoff dug up the old camcorder tapes, and we watched the footage together on the living-room TV. He hadn't seen it since he filmed it nearly 20 years ago. “Tough to watch,” he said more than once.

After Ian went home, life at the Rainbow Lodge went on largely as it had before. Something did change, though—specifically for Geoff. Knowing that scientists now believed Ian retained some awareness transformed how he related to his younger brother. He started spending more time with Ian, and the two regained a brotherly intimacy. “Ian, are you conscious or are you a vegetable?” Geoff teased during one of my visits. “I think you're a vegetable. I think you look like a kumquat.”

Geoff eventually took on more and more of Ian's care; he is now paid through Medicaid as a part-time caregiver, helping Eve, who is 86. Geoff is the one who puts Ian to bed every evening, smoothing out the sheets to make sure he does not lie on a wrinkle all night long. He tucks an extra pillow on Ian's left side, as his head has a tendency to droop that way.

For Eve, caregiving came naturally; she told me her ambition in life was always to be a mother. She had married at 18 and had three children in quick succession. When their marriage became strained, she and her first husband decided to try an open relationship. In 1964, Eve got a job waitressing at a Woodstock café whose owners let a singer named Bob Dylan live upstairs. She flirted with men. She flirted with Dylan, who took her to play pool and showed her pages of his book in progress, Tarantula. (“Bob was much cuter,” she says of Timothée Chalamet, who starred in the recent Dylan biopic.) Eventually she got divorced; her second husband was Ian's father. Her third, Marshall, was an artist with a successful marketing career in New York City. Eve and Marshall planned to spend more time there after Ian graduated. The car crash upended everything.

Afterward, Eve threw herself back into the role of devoted mother. (Marshall helped take care of Ian until his death in 2011.) Even now, with Geoff and two nurses who cover five days a week, Eve has certain tasks she insists on carrying out herself. She trims Ian's nails and hair, now thinning on top to reveal the faint scars from his deep-brain-stimulation surgery. She shaves him. When she speaks to her son, she leans over close, their matching Roman noses almost touching. In these moments, Ian will vocalize—“Aaaaaahh ahhhhhh”—like he is trying to talk with his mother.

“I think Ian lived for my mom,” Geoff told me at one point, thinking back to the hospital, where Eve pleaded over his unconscious body, holding on to Ian with her imagined golden lasso. She had promised Ian then that she would do anything for him if he lived—hence the healers, the studies, and her devotion to him for the past 39 years.

While Ian was recovering from the deep-brain-stimulation surgery, Eve came across a poem by E. E. Cummings that affected her so deeply, she took to reading it aloud to him in a morning ritual. The second stanza goes:

(i who have died am alive again today,and this is the sun's birthday;this is the birthday of life and of love and wings:and of the gaygreat happening illimitably earth)

Schiff kept probing the outer limits of consciousness in patients with severe brain injuries. Last year, he, along with Owen, Laureys, and other researchers in the field, published the largest and most comprehensive study yet of covert awareness. This is the New England Journal of Medicine study that included Ian, and found one in four vegetative or minimally conscious brain-injury patients to have covert awareness. (Schiff prefers the term cognitive motor disassociation, to highlight the disconnect between the patients' mental and physical abilities.) “Our experience was Wow, it's not so hard to find these people,” Schiff told me.

The researchers do not believe that everyone with a disorder of consciousness is somehow cognitively intact—a majority are probably not, according to this study. The most important takeaway, researchers say, is simply this: People with covert awareness exist, and they are not exceedingly rare.

From the June 2015 issue: Hacking the brain

These findings raise profound questions about our ethical obligation to people with severe brain injuries. In his 2015 book, Rights Come to Mind, Joseph Fins, a medical ethicist at Cornell who frequently collaborates with Schiff, argues that such patients deserve better than to be “cast aside by an indifferent health care system,” or left to languish as mere bodies to feed and clean. “For so long, I'd been stripped of any identity,” one brain-injury patient, Julia Tavalaro, wrote in her memoir, Look Up for Yes. “I had begun to think of myself as less than an animal.” She was able to write the book after a particularly observant speech therapist finally noticed, six years after her injury, that she could communicate with her eyes. But too often, Fins told me, patients are shunted into long-term-care homes that cannot provide the attention and rehab that could uncover subtle signs of consciousness.

These patients are also especially vulnerable to abuse. In 2019, staff at a facility in Phoenix called 911 in a panic after a patient—who was reportedly vegetative but may have been minimally conscious—unexpectedly gave birth. No one at the facility, where she had lived for years, even knew she was pregnant until a nurse saw the baby's head. She had been raped by a male nurse.

In some cases, patients with covert awareness may never make it to long-term care—they simply die when life support is withdrawn at the hospital. “If you went back 15, 20 years, there was a tremendous amount of nihilism” among doctors, says Kevin Sheth, a neurologist at Yale. Even as medicine has become less fatalistic about brain injury, hospitals still rarely look for covert awareness using fMRI. ICU patients may be too fragile to be moved to an fMRI machine, and the technology is too cumbersome and expensive to bring into the ICU.

Varina Boerwinkle, a neurocritical-care specialist now at the University of North Carolina, believes the technology should be routinely used with brain-injury patients. She told me about a 6-year-old boy she treated at a previous job in 2021, who had been in a car crash. Her initial impression was that he would not survive, and his first fMRI scan showed no signs of awareness. Boerwinkle began to wonder if doctors were prolonging his suffering. But the team repeated the test on day 10, in anticipation of discussing withdrawal of care with the boy's parents. To Boerwinkle's astonishment, his brain was now active: He could respond when asked to perform specific mental tasks in the fMRI.

At first, Boerwinkle wasn't sure what to say to the boy's family about the fMRI. Though it implied that he still had cognitive function, it did not guarantee that he would ever recover enough to respond physically or verbally. Her colleagues have seen families struggle to care for a child with a severe brain injury, Boerwinkle told me, and everyone was wary of providing false hope.

The doctors ultimately did inform the boy's parents about their findings; his mother told me the fMRI gave them the confidence to agree to another surgery. It worked. Four years later, the boy is back in school. He uses an eye-gaze device to communicate and zoom around in his wheelchair, and his reading and math skills are on par with those of other kids his age.

Scientists are now looking for simpler tools to test for covert awareness. Patients who show signs of awareness early on, it seems, tend to have better recoveries than those who don't. Owen, now based at the University of Western Ontario, recently published a study using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, which shines a light through the skull. A group at Columbia University, led by Jan Claassen, is experimenting with EEG electrodes that sit on the head.

But even after 20 years of research, little has changed in terms of what doctors can do to help patients found to have covert awareness long after their injury—which is still, in most cases, nothing. On his office wall, Schiff has taped the brain scans of five patients to remind him of the human stakes of his work. He is now exploring brain implants, which are already helping certain paralyzed patients control cursors with their mind or speak via a computer-generated voice. The next several years could prove crucial, as a crop of well-funded companies tests new ways of interfacing with the brain: Elon Musk's Neuralink, perhaps the best-known of these, uses filaments implanted by a sewing-machine-like robot; Precision Neuroscience's thin film floats atop the cortex; and Synchron's implant is threaded up to the brain through the jugular vein.

Getting any of these implants to work in people with severe injuries like Ian's will be particularly challenging. Ian's age and the electrodes already implanted in his brain also make him an unlikely early candidate. This technology—if it ever works for people like him—may arrive too late for Ian.

Even in 1972, when Plum and Jennett first described the vegetative state, the doctors foresaw that they were barreling toward a “problem with humanitarian and socioeconomic implications.” The vegetative patients they described could now be kept alive indefinitely—but should they be? At what cost? Who's to decide? Soon enough, Plum himself was asked to weigh in on the life of a 21-year-old woman.

In 1975, Plum became the lead witness in the case of Karen Ann Quinlan, who'd recently fallen into a vegetative state. She had collapsed after taking Valium mixed with alcohol, which temporarily starved her brain of oxygen. Her parents wanted her ventilator removed. Her doctors refused. In the ensuing legal battle, Quinlan's family and friends testified that she had said, in conversations about people with cancer, that she wouldn't want to be “kept alive by machines.” But there was no way to know what Quinlan wanted in her current condition. Plum categorically pronounced that she “no longer has any cognitive function”; another doctor likened her, in his court testimony, to an “anencephalic monster.”

In the end, a court granted her parents' request to remove Quinlan's ventilator. The controversy surrounding her case fueled interest in then-novel advance directives, which allow people to spell out if and at what point they want to die in the event of future incapacitation. In recognizing that life might not always be worth living, the court's ruling also inspired a nascent “right to die” movement in the U.S.

By the time Terri Schiavo, in Florida, made national news in the early 2000s, resurfacing many of the same legal and ethical questions, the science had become more complicated. Schiavo had also been diagnosed as vegetative after she collapsed—from cardiac arrest, in her case. When her condition did not improve after eight years, her husband sought to have her feeding tube removed. Her parents fought back, fiercely. Although most experts found her to be vegetative, those aligned with her parents seized on the newly defined minimally conscious state to argue that Schiavo was still aware. The family released video clips purporting to show her responding to her mother's voice or tracking a Mickey Mouse balloon with her eyes. If she was still conscious, they argued, she should not be made to die.

Schiavo became a cause célèbre for the religious right, and opinions hardened. Where one side saw parents honoring their daughter's life, the other saw them clinging to illusory hope. Giacino told me that because of his key role in defining the minimally conscious state, he was asked to examine Schiavo by the office of Jeb Bush, then Florida's governor. The behavioral exam he planned to perform, Giacino said, could have helped discern whether Schiavo's responses were real or random. He never did go to Florida, though, because a court proceeding made another exam moot.

Schiavo eventually died when her feeding tube was removed in 2005. The general consensus now holds that she likely was vegetative—an autopsy later found that her brain had atrophied to half its normal size—but Giacino still wonders how that correlated with her level of consciousness. Because he never examined her himself, he personally reserved judgment.

If Schiavo—or let's say a hypothetical patient diagnosed as vegetative, like her—were in fact minimally conscious or covertly aware, would that tip the calculus of keeping her alive one way or the other? Which way? On one hand is the horrifying proposition of snuffing out a human consciousness. On the other hand is what some might consider a fate worse than death, of living imprisoned in a body entirely without choice, without freedom. In memoirs and interviews, brain-injury patients who regained communication—Tavalaro among them—speak of despair, of abuse, and of sheer, uninterrupted boredom. They could not even turn their head to stare at a different patch of wall paint. One young man described the particular agony of being placed carelessly in a wheelchair and forced to sit for hours atop his testicles. Some have tried to end their life by holding their breath, which turns out to be physically impossible. The classical notion of a totally mindless vegetative state offered at least meager solace: a person devoid of consciousness would not experience pain or suffering.

One-third of locked-in patients, who can communicate only using their eyes, have thought of suicide often or occasionally, according to a survey of 65 people conducted by Laureys, the Belgian neurologist. But a majority of these patients have never contemplated suicide. They say they are happy, and those who have been locked in longer report being happier, which squares with other research showing that people with disabilities are in fact quite adaptable in the long term. Of course, those who responded to the survey are not entirely representative of everyone with a brain injury; for one thing, they could still communicate, albeit with difficulty.

What about covertly aware patients, with total loss of communication—are they happy to be alive? As far as I know, only one such person has ever had the opportunity to answer this question. In the 2010 study, after the 22-year-old man answered five consecutive yes-or-no questions correctly, Laureys decided to pose a last question, one to which he did not already know the answer: Do you want to die?

Where the man's previous responses were clear, this one was ambiguous. The scan suggested that he was imagining neither tennis nor his house. He seemed to be thinking neither yes nor no, but something more complicated—exactly what, we will never know.

I posed a version of this question to the researchers who have devoted their career to understanding disorders of consciousness. Would you choose to live? “If no one was coming to the rescue, if help was not on the way, I wouldn't want to be in any of these situations,” said Schiff, who has a practical eye toward brain-implant research that could one day help these patients.

Owen was more philosophical. He told me that when people learn about his research, many say they would prefer to die; even his wife says that. But he is less certain. He does not have an advance directive. Perhaps the only thing worse than wanting to die and being forced to live, he said, is to watch everyone let you die when you have decided, in the moment of truth, that you actually want to live.

On one of my trips to the Rainbow Lodge this past winter, Geoff rigged up Ian's foot switch—one of countless assistive devices his family has tried—to play a prerecorded message for me. “Hey, Sarah, thanks for coming!” it went in Geoff's singsong voice. “I'm glad to see ya.” His family had hoped, at one point, that Ian's left foot, which waves back and forth, unlike his permanently fixed right one, could become a mode of communication. But Ian has never been able to push the switch reliably on command. Still, occasionally, he hits the big green button just hard enough to set it off.

I cannot know to what extent, if any, this movement is voluntary. But Ian's foot is certainly more active at some times than others. While his family and I chatted over lunch at the kitchen table one day, it went tap, tap. “Hey, Sarah, thanks for coming!” Was he trying to join the conversation? “Hey, Sarah, thanks for coming!” If so, what did he want to say?

There was one other instance when I saw his foot moving that much—during a previous visit, when we spoke in detail about Ian's car crash for the first time. The crash took place in the early morning, after the boys had been together all night. Ian was driving. When Eve was asked to identify the body of the boy who died, Sam, she recognized the white shell necklace Ian had brought back for him from a recent trip to Florida. The third boy—the one who survived—eventually stopped keeping in touch with high-school friends, a disappearance they attributed to survivor's guilt.

I wondered if our conversation would distress Ian, if we should be replaying these events in front of him. To me, it seemed as though his face had turned especially tense. His foot was going tap, tap, tap. Or was I projecting my own thoughts, as it is so easy to do with someone who cannot respond? “Ian knows he killed his best friend,” Geoff said at one point that night. “By accident.”

The next day, Ian was grinding his teeth. It happens sometimes, Eve told me. Perhaps something hurt. Or his stomach was upset. Or an eyelash was stuck in his eye. They tried to rule out causes one by one, but it's always a guessing game. I thought back to our conversation the night before, and wondered whether the presence of a stranger probing the traumatic events of his life might have agitated him.

Ian could not walk away from a conversation he did not want to have, nor could he correct the record of what we got wrong. If his memories and cognition are more intact than not, then he has had time—so much time—to live inside his own thoughts. Has he come to his own reckoning over his friend's death? Does he feel his own survivor's guilt? Does he ever wish for the fate of one of his friends in the car over the one he was actually dealt? Perhaps being incapable of these thoughts would be a mercy in itself.

At one point, Geoff decided to reprogram Ian's foot switch, in part to cheer up Molly Holm, one of Ian's nurses since 2008, who had bruised her ribs slipping on ice. Molly had known Ian back in high school; he was friends with her older brother. She started coming to patterning sessions at the Rainbow Lodge after the accident, taking a position at Ian's right hand. She later became a nurse. Her first job was at a head-trauma center, where she looked after young men with injuries like Ian's. In some of the vegetative patients, she would see flashes of what seemed like awareness. But who was she, a very green nurse, to question a doctor's diagnosis? Some of the men at this facility rarely had visitors, Molly says, their isolation so unlike the warmth of Ian's home.

From the April 2024 issue: Sarah Zhang on the cystic-fibrosis breakthrough that changed everything

That's what originally drew her, a deeply unhappy 14-year-old, to the Rainbow Lodge all those years ago. (Okay, she admits, she'd also had a huge crush on Ian before the crash.) It drew other people too, including those who temporarily moved into the lodge's guest rooms during the patterning days: Ian's girlfriend, Valerie Cashen; a friend of Geoff's, Karen McKenna, who was 21 and pregnant, and had recently split from her boyfriend; and, perhaps most unexpectedly, the mother of the boy killed in the car crash, Renee Montana. Eve had overheard her primal scream of grief in the hospital, and when they later met, the mothers felt connected rather than divided by their respective tragedies.

Valerie, Karen, and Renee all arrived at the Rainbow Lodge overwhelmed by their own life circumstances. The two younger women stayed for a year or two and became close friends. Karen hadn't known Ian at all before his injury. She first came to the hospital as a friend of the family; she offered to watch over Ian for Eve because, well, she didn't have much else to do. She gave birth to her baby while living at the lodge, Eve by her side as her Lamaze coach. Karen's time caring for Ian helped inspire her to enroll in nursing school, and she eventually became a nurse at the very ICU where she first met Ian.

Renee stayed for a few years. She did not blame Ian for Sam's death, though she knew that others did. When I asked her if she ever thought about what might have happened if their fates had been switched, she had an immediate answer: “My poor boy would have been institutionalized.”

She didn't have the means to care for him at home; she didn't have the Rainbow Lodge. She was a single mom, living with a boyfriend in a disintegrating relationship. Eve and Marshall's welcoming her into their community kept her from going adrift. “They just saved my life,” she said. Her life took an unexpected turn there too: Renee ended up having another child—her daughter, Morganne—born in 1988, after Renee had a brief affair with Eve's brother.

Out of these chaotic circumstances, Eve and Renee found their bond as new friends cemented into that of family. Eve was present at this birth as well; she cut Morganne's umbilical cord. Back at the lodge, they put the newborn girl in Ian's lap, letting him hold a new life that would not exist had his own not been thrown off course. Morganne, now 37, told me that her earliest memories are of curling up at Ian's feet to watch TV.

Reflecting on life after Ian's accident, Eve prefers to speak not of loss but of gains: a new niece, lifelong friends, the entire Rainbow Lodge community. She decided long ago that she could carry others forward—Ian most of all—on her brute optimism. And in our hours of conversation, I never heard her linger on a negative note.

In this respect, Geoff does not take after his mother. “Geoff's more like, I see your suffering, brother,” Molly told me. He and Ian have a different kind of bond, she added, “because Geoff recognizes that, sometimes, this sucks.”

“No, I mean, it definitely sucks, right?” Geoff said. “Not to be able to communicate sucks.”

Geoff's coping mechanism is humor, at times dark, at times juvenile. It helps that Ian's most reliable response is laughter. When he really gets going, his chuckle turns into a full chest shake. Geoff still dreams about the technology that might help his brother communicate. For now, they have the foot switch.

The message Geoff recorded after Molly's fall was meant to make her, and everyone else, laugh: He blew a fart noise, scattered objects on the ground, and shouted, “Oh my God! What happened there?” Then he slipped the switch under Ian's left foot.

Geoff was so keen to lift Molly's spirits because they are a couple, together since 2000. Over the course of their relationship, Geoff had grown close to another of her patients, a spunky boy who eventually died of epidermolysis bullosa, also known as butterfly-skin syndrome, in his 20s. They don't have children of their own but they had become a caretaking unit, their relationship deepening over their shared love for the boy. Now they care for Ian together, and they will continue to care for him when Eve is gone.

When I was leaving the Rainbow Lodge for the last time, Eve impressed upon me what she hoped people would take away from Ian's life: “It's not a sad story.” On this, Molly concurred. Yes, it sucks sometimes. But Ian has been continuously surrounded by people who love him, people who took that love and made something of it.

As if on cue, Ian's foot switch went off. Fart noise. Objects scattering. “Oh my God! What happened there?” Maybe it was just a random movement of his foot. Maybe he wanted to disagree with his mother's assessment. Or maybe he agreed that his is not a sad story. If only he could tell us in his own words.

Why are we mad at the football coach's girlfriend?

by  Constance Grady

When we look at the relationship between 73-year-old legendary football coach Bill Belichick and his girlfriend and business partner, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson, it's hard to know exactly what we're seeing. Two grown-ups in love forging a dynamic business partnership? Elder abuse, as some have wildly speculated? Or is it, as the vitriolic comments in Hudson's social media posts would have it, good old-fashioned gold digging? 

Gold digging is a misogynistic and retro term, but this scandal is a retro one. It's a bizarre, slightly off-putting mystery that fits remarkably well into our current age of newly regressive gender politics.

Hudson and Belichick, the six-time Super Bowl-winning former NFL coach, met on a flight in 2021 and went public with their relationship last December. While their nearly 50-year age gap has raised eyebrows amid observers, the scandal has only grown as Hudson has taken on an increasingly central role in Belichick's professional world. 

It's a bizarre, slightly off-putting mystery that fits remarkably well into our current age of newly regressive gender politics.

Belichick requested Hudson be cc'ed on all publicity and media emails about him at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he is now a college football coach. In public records, she's listed as the manager of several companies that appear to be tied to Belichick. Insider accounts say she essentially cast herself in a Dunkin Donuts commercial in which Belichick appeared, and that she blocked a docuseries about Belichick's career. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

But speculation around the relationship reached a fever pitch when Hudson interrupted during Belichick's interview on CBS Sunday Morning in April. “How did you guys meet?” host Tony Dokoupil asked Belichick, referring to Hudson. “We're not talking about this,” Hudson cut in tersely from off-camera. “Jordon was a constant presence during our interview,” Dokoupil informs viewers in voiceover, in a moment that launched a thousand TikTok reaction videos. 

In the midst of this controversy, the couple has been manufacturing social media content about their relationship that isn't alarming so much as it is lightly uncanny, especially given Belichick's famously gruff public persona. On Hudson's Instagram account, she has posted beachside pictures of herself balancing athletically on Belichick's outstretched legs, and of Belichick, dressed as a fisherman, reeling in a mermaid-tailed Hudson from the surf. (“Ouucchhhh!!!” goes the caption on that one.)

A few have defended the relationship between Belichick and Hudson. Sports media personality Colin Cowherd has said that Hudson's choice to hop into Belichick's interview was normal for PR directors, if “kind of a cringy thing.” Right-wing sports outlet The Outkick has rallied to Hudson's side on the grounds that she triggers the libs, saying, “If Jordon wants to spend her weekends at Bill's house on Nantucket, soaking up the sun and enjoying Cisco Brewery on Bill's dime, I say GO FOR IT.” 

But the most common reaction to the spectacle of Hudson and Belichick's relationship is the one outlined by sports media personality Katie Nolan on a podcast in February: This is weird and seems like it has sinister undertones.

“We're already going, ‘You're how much younger than him?' And then you show up in a commercial. And then you hear that she's in charge in his career.” Nolan said. “It seems like you could be taking advantage of the guy. And he's obviously taking advantage of the girl.” 

Notably, it doesn't appear to be much of a head-scratcher why a powerful septuagenarian would choose to be with a recent college graduate and pageant contestant. But the nefarious reason implied about why Hudson wants to be with Belichick is the one people are misogynistically and freely throwing around: gold digger.

I don't know anything about Hudson and Belichick's private relationship, and most likely, neither do you. I don't want to make any claims about who is using whom or what their private life is like. But as a feminist pop culture critic, I am interested to see the term “gold digger” swim back up from the collective unconsciousness again, ready and willing to go to work. 

There's something almost old-fashioned about it. The last time “gold digger” was thrown around in pop culture so much was when teenager Courtney Stodden skyrocketed to fame in 2011 after they got married at age 16 to 51-year-old actor Doug Hutchison. Stodden would later describe their marriage as one characterized by grooming and sexual assault. 

Before that, the great pop culture gold digger was Anna Nicole Smith, the model turned paparazzi obsession who married oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II in 1994. Since Smith's untimely death in 2007, she's found a place in the pantheon of wronged women of the 1990s, someone we came to believe over the last decade was publicly mistreated — in part by her tarring as a gold digger. 

“It's a bit provincial to look down one's nose at a woman wanting something from a man and give a pass to a man who arguably would have never given her a second glance had she not been a beautiful, blonde Playboy Playmate,” essayist and sex work activist Laura LeMoon argued in 2023, writing about Smith in Salon. “Rather than singling out and condemning Anna Nicole Smith, we should be pointing our fingers at the inequities and systemic failures that put people like me and Smith in positions where obtaining money and resources from men, directly or indirectly, is our best option for survival.”

“Gold digger” is a euphemism that allows us as a culture to talk around those systemic failures. It's a way to deride women when they take seriously the idea that their financial well-being should depend on their relationships with men. So it's odd to see the term becoming so popular during a moment when popular culture has become rather infatuated with the idea that life is most pleasant, simple, and straightforward when women's finances do depend on romantic relationships with men.

TikTok is full of tradwives explaining how their lives became better once they got out of the 9-to-5 grind to make cereal from scratch for their children and let their husbands do the breadwinning. (That the most successful of the tradwife influencers are actually the primary breadwinners in their homes is an irony the influencers themselves seldom discuss.) Or there are the stay-at-home girlfriends cooing over how taking care of their boyfriends without even the financial safety net of a marriage contract has been their ticket to the soft life. 

The gold digger is the tradwife as seen through a funhouse mirror: a woman living off her ability to attract a man, only here done crassly.

Meanwhile, some of President Donald Trump's most vocal supporters are arguing that his tariffs will force women out of the workforce and make them once again financially dependent on men, either through marriage or through sex work, life paths these men treat as equivalent. Trump's appeal to the dream of a lost American manufacturing economy is a nostalgic one. It's an appealing fantasy to some of his more incel-adjacent fans: that under this economy, the sexes will revert to an older, allegedly more natural economic relationship, one in which women trade their sexuality and childrearing capabilities to men in exchange for financial security. 

The gold digger is the tradwife as seen through a funhouse mirror: a woman living off her ability to attract a man, only here done crassly, without the show of love to soften the crude edges of the transaction. The gold digger is simply a figure we can blame for how uncomfortable this dynamic makes us feel, without having to think through just what is so uncomfortable about it. 

So if we're angry at Jordon Hudson, it's worth asking the question: Are we angry with her, or with the fact that powerful people want to make gold digging one of a woman's most viable career paths again?

Don't let a messy house keep you from hosting.﻿

by  Allie Volpe

Inviting people over to hang out at my house is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, I don't need to leave home. On the other, I'm plagued by anxiety, not because I don't enjoy seeing my friends, but because of all the tidying and cleaning I feel pressured to do even for a casual evening of watching TV. 

In an instant, I transform into my mother, frantically scrubbing and organizing. To welcome guests into a house that shows signs of life — a pile of unopened mail sitting on the dining room table or crumbs in the couch cushions — is to open yourself up to judgment. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

It's a common sentiment among those of hosting age: the manic cleaning that precedes the arrival of guests, memed and parodied ad infinitum. Of course these concerns primarily afflict women — centuries of socialization have reinforced the notion that the condition of a home is a woman's business. (A 2019 study found that women are held to higher cleanliness standards than men and are more likely to face negative social consequences for failing to meet that standard.) Mothers, who are somehow expected to be the primary caretaker and keep the house spotless on top of everything else, carry an even heavier domestic burden. 

Whenever Ciara Bogdanovic's clients come to her with these concerns, she can't assure them that no one is judging the state of their home. But she can promise them that the majority of people aren't. “Often,” Bogdanovic, a licensed marriage and family therapist, says, “we project our own beliefs about ourselves onto what we believe others are thinking.”

But here's the thing about hanging out at home: it's free, low-key, and convenient. And we should be looking for more ways to find connection, not less, given the negative physical and mental health consequences of loneliness and social isolation. Many people crave more time with their friends, yet the anxiety of hosting what should be an undemanding get-together may preclude them from seeing their buds more often. 

So the only rule you really need to keep in mind is to make sure your house is just tidy enough for guests to relax, experts say. Fear of having a space that looks like people live there shouldn't hold you back from spending time with friends. If they're judging you, that's a reflection on them. 

Personal standards for how a home “should” look before hosting are shaped by past experiences, Bogdanovic says. Many people either had a relative who stressed the importance of cleaning up for guests or saw the caricature depicted in culture — or online. 

Across social media, images of uber-organized homes and performative cleaning videos create the false perception that the average home looks like a magazine. We also have a tendency to compare our spaces to those of our friends. “You're comparing your behind-the-scenes with someone else's highlight reel,” says KC Davis, a therapist and author of How to Keep House While Drowning. “When you're at home, you're looking at your home the way it really looks in the midst of living there. When you go over to other people's homes, most people are cleaning before you get there.” 

This tendency to compare is also why you might find yourself subconsciously spotting dust bunnies in a friend's home. “There might be some conclusions we're trying to draw,” says licensed clinical social worker Alyssa Petersel. “Is this person doing better or worse than I am in life, financially? Is their style more or less like what I want my style to be?” These observations impact how we view ourselves.

Assuming you don't want to be critiqued about your own home, it's always best to suspend judgment about how others live. Unless the state of their home poses a danger to those living there, what they choose to clean — or not — before you come over is not worth commenting on. “What is important to you in a friendship?” Bogdanovic says. “Is cleanliness and perfection really the most important thing? Or would you prefer someone who listens to you and you have fun with?”

The primary goal of a host should be to pay attention to guests, not a stray toy. Davis says to focus your efforts on making the room where you'll be hanging out comfortable for guests. Think practically: providing a place to sit (that isn't covered in pet hair), making sure the floor is clear so people can walk around, offering drinks and snacks on fresh dishes, ensuring the bathroom is clean. The dishes in the sink or your disorganized bedroom? Not so much a priority. “As long as things are sanitary, people aren't going to remember what it looks like,” Davis says. “They're going to remember the way that they felt and the time that they had while they were there.”

Whatever you do, don't apologize for the state of your house, experts say. If you feel awkward when you notice a guest eye your disorganized coat rack, you can cut the tension with a quick joke, like “Come on in, we live here!” or “The kids have taken over with their jackets.” 

If you're still feeling self-conscious, Bogdanovic suggests observing your friends' actions and body language. Are they looking around your house or sitting rigidly trying to keep as little of their body from touching your sofa as possible? Or are they lounging and engaging in conversation? Take stock of what's actually happening, not what you're imagining is happening. 

Unless you truly value spending hours cleaning, focus on your priorities, Bogdanovic says, which is probably spending quality time with your friends — an activity that contributes to happiness more than a clean house. Letting friends into your space, mess and all, breaks the cycle of perfectionism. Once you ditch the expectation that homes should look like furniture showrooms, your friend group may feel more comfortable hosting despite the chaos in their kids' rooms, too. 

“In the moments where we are a bit imperfect or we're a little raw or we're a little unpolished,” Petersel says, “we're actually giving other people permission to show up as their full selves.”

﻿The surprising gender gap driving young Americans apart.

by  Christian Paz

Among the persistent mysteries of the 2024 election is the roots of the modern political gender gap, particularly among young people. Though their final vote choices were a bit more nuanced than some pre-election polls suggested, young men and women, aged 18 to 29, had the largest divergence in their vote among the age groups. Gen Z men supported Donald Trump by 14 percentage points; Gen Z women supported Kamala Harris by 17 points, per one post-election analysis.

Those dynamics, particularly the aggressive rightward shift of young men, have raised some interesting questions: What was driving this divide? Was something in particular moving young men to the right while pushing young women to the left? Could it be the manosphere, economics, or old-school sexism?

Or could it be something else, like the apparent resurgence of organized religion?

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

As I've reported, the rapid decline of religiosity within the United States has been slowing down over recent years. Particularly since the pandemic, data shows Gen Z is no longer continuing the rapid decline in religious affiliation, particularly Christianity, that started with previous generations. If anything, religious belief has seen a small revival with that youngest cohort.

That shift suggests a curious dynamic at play among America's youth. As Gen Z has been getting more politically polarized along gendered lines, so too has their religious affiliation. Those trends suggest that modern politics and religious beliefs may be having a bit of self-reinforcing effect on each other: As young men find faith and religious belonging, their politics are drifting to the right too, in turn reinforcing their existing beliefs.

The opposite seems to be true with young women: Religious customs are not jibing with their political and social beliefs, pushing them out of churches, and reinforcing that drift away from some organized religions.

Those religious trends matter. As religious and political beliefs of young men and women move away from each other, it stands to complicate not just electoral choices, but the future of family life, dating, and social belonging.

The last 10 years have seen American Christianity bottom out. After a steady decline in Christian religiosity since the 1990s, Christian belief began to stabilize at around 60 percent of the American adult population — still a historic low point — sometime around the turn of the 2020s.

A key contributor to this slow-down appears to be Gen Z. After years of successive generations losing their religion, Gen Z seemed to get as irreligious as it could be. Now, what we've seen since 2020 is a kind of dead cat bounce: a slightly higher level of Christian religious affiliation among the youngest adults. Among the youngest cohort of Gen Z, those born between 2000 and 2006, the share who identify as Christian has increased since 2023, from 45 percent to 51, per the Pew Research Center. And overall, Gen Z seems to be more Christian than past trend lines predicted they should be: at 46 percent compared to a projected 41 percent. 

At the heart of that halt and slight reversal is a dual dynamic: Young women are leaving religious congregations, while young men's religious identification and practice rises. These changes come across in a few ways. 

First, the gender gap in religious participation has not just evaporated in recent years, but reversed. The religious researcher and data scientist Ryan Burge has found in his analysis of survey data from the Cooperative Election Study that while women used to attend religious services more regularly than men, the reverse is now happening. Among the cohort born in the 1990s and 2000, it's men who are now outpacing women in weekly attendance.

Looking at other reference points suggests something similar. Young women are more likely than young men to say they are religiously unaffiliated, according to the American Enterprise Institute's Survey Center on American Life research. Young women are now as likely as young men to say religion is “not that important” to them — a significant development since women have traditionally been more fervent believers. And the religious gender gap among the youngest cohort appears to be narrowing in other ways, too: Regardless of which religion they identify with, young women and young men report about the same rates of daily prayer. For older generations, women greatly outpace men in praying daily.

We could still stand to get better data about what is happening. It could be that young men simply remain as religious as older generations of men are (while women lose religion), or that men are getting more religious in general, or that men are particularly loyal to organized religion. Some data suggest young women remain religious or spiritual but just don't identify with organized churches in the same way men do. But the religious gender gap still appears to be changing among Gen Z.

But is politics driving these changes in religious behavior and belief? Or is religion driving stronger political beliefs? The data is a little less definitive here, but two things seem to bear out: According to AEI's Survey Center, young women who are leaving churches report doing so because their congregations' beliefs are more conservative than the beliefs they hold. Churches are out of step with where most young women are. 

Additionally, young Christian women who remain in their churches are still more likely to be liberal and hold progressive beliefs than young Christian men. Even as they remain Christians, they are becoming more politically liberal.

Underlying all of this is the fact that Gen Z women are more likely to identify as feminists, as LGBTQ, and as supportive of abortion rights. According to the Pew Religious Landscape Survey, young Christian women are 13 points more likely than young men to say that abortion should be legal. They are 18 points more likely to support gay marriage and 26 points more likely to accept LGBTQ people.

As the researcher Daniel A. Cox of the AEI's Survey Center points out, these are all shifts from what young Christians believed 10 years ago. “The gender gap in views of abortion has since quadrupled,” he notes in a recent analysis, but when it comes to views on homosexuality and gay marriage, it seems like young men have moved right. “Young Christian women have hardly changed their views over the last decade, while young men have become less supportive.”

On a range of other views of government, political parties, and ideology in general, what's happening with non-religious young people is also happening among believers. Young Christian women are much more liberal, and more likely to be Democrats, than young Christian men. Cox notes that it might not be religion making these political views so different but the degree to which young Christian women have more connections and exposure to diverse communities and are consuming different kinds of media. Religious young men seem to be stuck in more homogenous environments, both in the digital and in the real world, he suggests.

Still, while we can confidently say young women are becoming more liberal and less religious in that process, we can't say the same for men. Religion may or may not be making young men more conservative, but it does seem likely that their conservative religious and political beliefs are at least keeping young men in churches. It appears to be slowing down their drift away from organized religion.

All of which stands to complicate the future of not just Gen Z's social and cultural bonds to each other but also those of future generations. It's the youngest cohort of Gen Z, those born between 2000 and 2006, that is narrowing religious gender gaps while widening political ones. That poses issues for their social, romantic, and familial futures. Gen Z already reports struggles with socializing, dating, maintaining healthy relationships, and combating loneliness. Marriage rates continue to fall. So as young men and women drift away from each other, it's hard to see how prospective partners breach these divides. And these dynamics may very well end up having electoral effects.

The lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.

We're still good at preventing plane crashes. We just have to actually do it.

by  Kelsey Piper

Air travel is remarkably, astonishingly safe. 

Every year, commercial US airlines take more than 800 million domestic passengers to their destinations, and in a typical year, zero of them are killed and very few are injured. It's a track record made possible by a fairly intense commitment to safety. 

But increasingly over the last few years, we've been testing these limits.

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Right now the example in the headlines is New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, which had three air traffic controllers on duty when it was supposed to have 14 and which over the last couple of weeks suffered three “communications blackouts” where air traffic controllers couldn't communicate with approaching planes.

But it's not just Newark. There has been an alarming rise in near-misses, communications blackouts, and other serious problems over the last few years at airports across the country, often a consequence of understaffing and high traffic. The midair collision near Reagan National Airport in Washington earlier this year that killed over 60 people was the deadliest air crash in the US since 2001.

Even with the Washington disaster, very few of these incidents, thankfully, get anyone killed. That's because the US achieves the astonishing safety of our air travel system with defense in depth, which means a bunch of different things have to go wrong for a crash to happen.

Planes have on-board systems that should alert them if they're too near another plane, even if air traffic control is sleeping on the job. There are backup emergency frequencies in case a communications blackout occurs. There are pre-published procedures for what to do in the event of a landing that looks unsafe, so if the pilots find themselves abruptly entirely out of contact with the ground, or coming in for a landing on a runway that they realize too late isn't clear, they have been trained on precisely how to respond.

In the risk analysis world, this is called the “Swiss cheese” model of how to prevent a disaster. 

Every layer of a system made up of humans — with all our flaws — is going to have some gaps. Air traffic controllers will have a bad day, or be tired, or let something slip their mind. Technological solutions will have limitations and edge cases. Pilots will make mistakes or have a medical emergency or get confused by unusual instructions. 

So each layer of the defenses against disaster has “holes” in it. But so long as the holes don't all line up — so long as there isn't a gap in every single layer at the same time — the defenses hold, and the planes land safely. 

All of this means that despite the absurd strain on air traffic controllers, flying out of Newark is still almost certainly going to go fine. 

But to achieve and maintain the exceptionally low accident levels that we've taken pride in over the last 20 years, “almost certainly” isn't good enough. If you want not just 99.9 percent of planes but every single plane, every single year, to land safely, you can't afford to let one of the layers of our defenses get more and more full of holes. A “near miss” where several layers of defenses fail should be taken incredibly seriously and prompt changes, even if one other layer sufficed to save us.

Any event which would have been a mass casualty event if not for the good judgment and quick thinking of the pilots, or if not for good weather, or if not for an activation of the automatic TCAS collision avoidance system, needs to be treated as a major emergency. If we let near-misses become business as usual, then it's inevitable that some percentage of them will convert into actual mass disasters — as happened in Washington this January, where a helicopter and plane collided in an airspace that was known to have risky amounts of helicopter traffic and a bunch of alarming near-misses.

This is, of course, important in its own right, since every single commercial plane crash is a preventable tragedy. But it's also, I sometimes fear, a symptom of a broader cultural malaise. 

Plane crashes used to be horrifyingly common. We made them rarer through a comprehensive, aggressive program to add layers of defense against human error, revising our procedures through tragedy after tragedy. And we succeeded.

If you read the description of almost any plane crash that occurred in the 1970s, one thing stands out: It could not have happened today. Through mechanical improvements, procedural improvements, training improvements, and backup systems, we've built planes that are much, much harder to crash. 

But then, as frequent deadly plane crashes became a distant cultural memory, we immediately started testing how far we could underresource those systems. We ignored near-misses and staffing shortages; we failed to heed warnings that our systems are in trouble and our procedures need changes. Boeing pushed out a dangerous new plane, hoping that other layers of our collective defenses against crashes would suffice to keep them in the air; in the US, those other layers were sufficient, but in poorer countries, they were not. 

The parallels to other areas of modern life stand out. It used to be that half of children were dead before age 5; vaccination changed that, but in the world made safe by vaccination, parents grew skeptical of it. Now kids are dying of measles again. 

It's been observed that “what if we hike tariffs?” is an idea that comes around once a century or so, and goes badly enough we're warned off it for a while. We have to touch the hot stove ourselves to learn that it burns us, it seems: The cultural memory doesn't last for all that long.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, by itself. I wouldn't want to live in a world where caution only ever ratchets up; safety is a trade-off, and it's reasonable to relax precautions if we still get good results without those precautions. 

But in some cases — like understaffing air traffic control or not vaccinating against measles — the precaution in question passes any reasonable cost-benefit calculation. Our “lesson” is taught by the deaths of innocent people. 

And more terrifyingly, it's not clear we're even learning from our brush with reality. Were the deaths of children in Texas enough to turn around measles vaccination rates? Did the crash over the Potomac teach us to start paying more attention to near-misses? 

It's too early to say, but it doesn't look good so far — and that is what really scares me.

The most important part of a volcano is hidden deep underground.

by  Byrd Pinkerton

When you picture a volcano, what do you see? I personally imagine a mountain sticking up into the sky. At the top of that mountain, I see a crater with a fiery hot lake boiling and roiling in it, or lava pouring down a slope like bright red candle wax, or massive clouds of grey ash exploding into the air. 

It's all incredible, powerful imagery, but it's also really just the tip of the volcano-berg. 

If I were to descend down through my imaginary volcano, moving down through layers and layers of earth, I'd find what might be an even more incredible feature: my volcano's pulsing, fiery furnace of a heart, also known as its “magma chamber.” This is the reason that hot ash comes bursting up through the surface. It's the original source of my lava and my crater lake. It's where much of the important action in a volcano unfolds — and could hold secrets to help us better predict when a devastating eruption will occur. 

The problem is that we know much less about magma chambers like this than we'd like to. We're not even good at depicting them. 

“We draw them as red balloons,” says Mike Poland, a geophysicist and scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. “They are not. But it's a very difficult thing to represent.”

Magma chambers are so hard to represent because they're so complex. They can be thousands of degrees Fahrenheit and have blends of solid material and hot liquid rock. These chambers have different temperatures in different spots, and different minerals melting at different heats or moving around in different ways. And, making things even more complex, there's a multitude of different gases that might make pressure build up before an eruption. 

But if we could better represent magma chambers — and just generally better understand exactly how they work — Poland says we might be able to dramatically improve our understanding of how volcanoes operate, and therefore be better able to anticipate what to expect from an impending eruption. But right now, because these chambers are so hot and so deep underground, it's hard to plumb their secrets.

“We don't have, like, the glass-bottomed volcano where you can just sort of look into and go like, Oh, that's what's going on,” Poland jokes.

But what if we could have a glass-bottomed volcano that we could sort of look into and go like, Oh, that's what's going on? What if we could build, say, a little observatory deep down under the ground, right in the hot little heart of a volcano? It sounds absurd, and yet… 

“ There's a project in Iceland,” Poland tells me, “They want to build a magma observatory. They want to drill into a magma chamber and put some monitoring equipment in the hole. … That would give us some idea of what's going on in there.”

The project is called the Krafla Magma Testbed, or KMT, and the researchers working on it think it could revolutionize volcanology — and how we forecast eruptions. 

One of the key motivations for building an observatory like this is that volcanology has a prediction problem. On the one hand, volcanoes are much more predictable than, say, earthquakes — they tend to give us some warning signs before they erupt. But on the other hand, it's hard to perfectly interpret those warning signs, which means the predictions volcanologists can make with our existing technology can be both incredibly helpful and frustratingly imprecise.

For example, for the last year or so, a potential eruption has been brewing at Mount Spurr, a volcano near Anchorage, Alaska. Twice in the last 100 years, eruptions from Mount Spurr have rained ash down on the city, clogging up roadways, shutting down the local airport (one of the busiest cargo ports in the world), and settling like a fine dusting of gritty, gray, unmelting snow on cars and lawns and leaves of trees. 

People are understandably worried about a repeat performance, and the Alaska Volcano Observatory is monitoring the situation closely.

Matt Haney, the scientist-in-charge at that observatory, told me while he can be sure that the volcano is displaying several key warning signs, he can't be sure exactly what the upcoming volcanic activity might look like — if there will be one eruption or many, exactly how intense they will be, or when they'll occur.

“That is not possible in the current levels of technology that we have,” he said. “There's no definitive time frame, like, Oh, it's going to do exactly this, like it did in 1992. It's not the precise same playbook.” 

Even with 11 seismic stations gathering real-time data about the Alaskan volcano — even with devices measuring how it is changing shape in response to incoming magma, with planes circling in the sky to understand the venting of gases, and with an enormous amount of truly impressive work — these volcanologists still can't give us as clear a picture of the future as we might like them to. 

That's tricky enough when you're dealing with the prospect of a clogging and choking coating of volcanic ash, but it gets even more complicated when you're trying to make determinations about people's lives. 

“This is the problem. How do you know how big an eruption's going to be?”

Look, for example, at the case of Soufrière de Guadeloupe, a volcano on the Caribbean island of Basse-Terre. In the mid-1970s, it started venting steam. That, paired with increased earthquake activity, had people worried that a dramatic eruption might be brewing. 

And they had very good reason to worry: In 1902, another Caribbean volcano eruption sent a deadly mix of hot gas and ash and rock careening through a nearby city at 300 miles an hour, killing 27,000 people. So, hoping to avoid a repeat of this devastating event, the governmental authorities decided to go ahead and evacuate. More than 70,000 people left Basse-Terre. 

But the subsequent eruption was minor. As one report put it, the “explosive emission of steam and debris was certainly impressive to those who had the misfortune to view it at close quarters. But from a volcanological point of view, it represented a rather trivial outburst.” If anything, the biggest impact on the volcanic activity was the evacuation itself — it hurt the local economy and disrupted kids' schooling. 

Sometimes, though, evacuations are extremely necessary. In 1991, at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, volcanologists once again read the volcanic tea leaves — stuff like seismic activity and steam explosions — and predicted a big eruption. Once again, people were evacuated. But this time, the decision to abandon the area saved thousands of lives — the ensuing eruption was one of the biggest in the 20th century. 

“This is the problem,” Poland says. “How do you know how big an eruption's going to be?”

You don't want to evacuate too little, or too late, at the cost of human lives, he says. But equally, you don't want to be the boy who cries wolf, or the volcanologist who cries, “ERUPTION!” 

“ It erodes trust in the scientists,” he says.

Volcanology has come a long way since the 1970s, or even the 1990s. Scientists have much more monitoring equipment set up on volcanoes, and they have made better equipment over time. Their ability to make predictions about volcanoes has improved dramatically as a result.

But as the case of Mount Spurr shows, even now — in 2025 — the field still grapples with the same fundamental problem of precision in their predictions.

So how do these predictions get better? How could volcanologists further improve their predictions in order to help people make decisions about how to prepare for eruptions?

Poland has spent a fair amount of time thinking about the answers to this question. He wrote a whole paper about it, in fact. And he thinks that improving volcano forecasting is not just about continuing to improve our monitoring equipment. Instead, he says, what we really need is better information about volcanoes themselves, and the hot molten rocks that power them. 

Let's talk about how we currently forecast volcano eruptions. A lot of volcano prediction involves making very informed guesses about what a volcano might do in the future based on what that volcano has done in the past — what Poland calls pattern recognition. 

Take, for example, gas emissions or earthquakes. Essentially, he says, researchers will take a lot of very, very precise measurements of those phenomena that will allow them to then say ‘Alright. X is happening. And when X happened before, Y happened afterward, so maybe now Y will happen again soon.' 

“It's not necessarily based on any special understanding of the physics of volcanic activity or that particular volcano,” Poland says, “It's more based on…We've seen this movie before, and we know how it's likely to evolve over time.”

This approach has been incredibly useful. It's saved a lot of lives and helped scientists make some really good predictions about how a volcano might behave, broadly. But Poland likes to draw a comparison between this approach and with how we forecast the weather. Because in the past, weather scientists also relied heavily on pattern matching. If the pressure was dropping and it was getting colder, say, they might expect a storm to come through. 

But then, weather forecasting went through a kind of revolution. Scientists used satellites and other instruments to collect information about clouds and winds and rain. They collected huge amounts of data about the atmosphere, and people even flew directly into the eyes of phenomena like hurricanes to measure what was happening inside of those storms.

“This really abundant information was then used by modelers…to work out the physics of what's going on,” Poland says. 

Weather scientists still use a lot of historical data to inform their understanding of the future (and now, with AI, are actually turning back to their massive bodies of data to try some more advanced pattern recognition), but they have also built really sophisticated models of the physics of the atmosphere that help them make their predictions. And it has paid off: Last year, according to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane forecasters set new records for accuracy in their predictions for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. 

“We can now forecast, with some degree of accuracy, whether a hurricane will form, how intense it is going to be, where it's going to go,” Poland says. “Obviously not every forecast is perfect. And that's because our knowledge is still imperfect. But they know enough.”

Poland wants volcanologists to build similar models of the underlying physics of volcanoes, which would mean building models of magma chambers. Scientists have been working on making models like this — and have even been working on applying them to forecasting. But if the weather scientists built their models by flying directly into things like hurricanes and taking measurements, volcano researchers have had a bit of a harder time doing the equivalent for magma chambers. They can't take direct measurements, so they've used seismic and electromagnetic imaging to take the equivalent of X-rays of the Earth, and they've studied places where ancient volcanoes have eroded away, bringing their cooled, frozen magma chambers up to the surface. They've even read the layers of volcanic crystals as though they were tree rings. 

This has been helpful, but it's kind of like studying your neighbors by eavesdropping on their conversations through the wall and going through their trash instead of just talking to them directly. 

So that's why some researchers are hoping to talk to volcanoes directly — to observe their magma chambers in real time. 

In some ways, the dream of a magma observatory started with an accident. Or to be a little more specific, it started with three different accidents in three different countries, each more than a decade ago. In each case, people set out to drill a deep hole into the rock near a volcano, and in each case, they accidentally drilled right down into the magma chamber. 

These accidents were a big surprise to the people doing the drilling, but to John Eichelberger, they were a big opportunity. 

Eichelberger has been studying volcanoes for around five decades. For much of that time, he's been curious about magma chambers. He thinks that knowing more about them could not only help us forecast volcanoes better, but also maybe tap into them for geothermal power. Unfortunately, he says, for a long time, it was difficult to find a way to drill into magma chambers and find out more about them, because people were not sure what would happen if you did. What if you triggered an eruption? 

“Really the only way [drilling down to a magma chamber] could happen was by serendipity,” Eichelberger says. 

Serendipity like these three drilling accidents. They provided some real-world examples of what would happen if you drilled down to a magma chamber. And the answer was, it turns out, not all that much. In each of these three cases, the drilling companies hit the magma chamber and instead of like hot rock shooting out of their hole in a hot plume of fire, the magma basically climbed a little ways up the hole, and then cooled off into a plug of dark obsidian glass. 

This was very good news for Eichelberger. As he remembers it, he wound up meeting someone from a power company that was involved in one of these accidents. That representative let him know that they would be open to letting Eichelberger and other researchers do some more research near their power plant in the Krafla volcanic region of Iceland. And so, in 2014, Eichelberger gathered researchers together for a consortium – including a researcher named Yan Lavallée, now at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.

“Fifty or 60 of us spent the best part of a week together browsing ideas as to…what could we learn if we were to do this?” Lavallée syas, “What could we learn if we were to drill back in the magma?”

This was the start of the dream of KMT: The Krafla Magma Testbed, named for the volcanic system in Iceland. It's a dream that Eichelberger, Lavallée, and their collaborators are still trying to get funded, but they have a clear idea of how they'd make it a reality. 

“First, we're going to install a drill rig at the Earth's surface, and we're going to start drilling,” Lavallée tells me. 

As they drill down, things will get hotter and hotter. They will pump fluid through, which will cool things down. Eventually, as they start to approach the magma of the magma chamber, the fluid will even start to cool down a little bit of that magma, too. 

“It will vitrify to a glass,” Lavallée says. This glass will likely not be transparent like a window. Instead, it will be obsidian — dark black and full of minerals. 

The researchers will then continue to keep things cool while they carve into that black glass, creating something like a pocket within it. Once that pocket is made, they hope to drop measuring devices into it. Lavallée works with tools in his lab that are made of the same kinds of heavy-duty materials that we put into things like jet engines and other materials that can withstand extremely high temperatures. 

Once everything's in place, they will stop cooling things down. Then the heat of the surrounding molten rock should start warming the obsidian of the glass pocket back up again slowly, until it melts back into magma and flows back around the instruments, submerging them fully in the magma of the chamber. 

Then, hopefully, the researchers will finally have their observatory: a set of measuring devices feeding them real-time data about an active magma chamber. 

If this first project succeeds, then Eichelberger and Lavallée are brimming with ideas for further drilling projects that could help them tease out more information about volcanoes. They both hope this research could help the world tap into volcanoes as a source of power, but also that it could help with forecasting — to help us build the models of volcanoes' hearts that will give us the tools to predict their behavior as effectively as we predict hurricanes.

And overall, Lavallée thinks that if this dream of theirs succeeds, it might revolutionize volcanology.

“I don't think we can really fully conceive how it's going to change things,” he says. 

Obviously, Lavallée has a clear reason to think this way, but when I asked Poland, who has no involvement with this project, what he thought, he was also pretty enthusiastic.

“I am excited to hear what they can come up with,” Poland said, “I mean, you go into a magma chamber, you're going to learn some things.”

Microsoft is working on a new Copilot and could unveil it at the company's Build conference next week, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.

The software giant also has grand ""Agent Factory"" ambitions and is developing new ways for corporate customers to manage AI agents alongside human employees, the memo shows.

The new Copilot project, called ""Tenant Copilot,"" is run by the organization behind the Microsoft 365 business. This new Copilot is designed to ""rapidly channel an organization's knowledge into a Copilot that can 'talk,' 'think,' and 'work' like the tenant itself,"" according to an April 14 email sent by the Microsoft executive Jay Parikh.

A ""tenant"" is the term used to describe corporate users of the Microsoft 365 suite of business applications. A Copilot that has access to these tenants would essentially be able to access customer information stored within their Microsoft 365 accounts.

Parikh said in the email that Microsoft was using different AI techniques to power the Tenant Copilot feature. Supervised fine-tuning helps ""to capture a tenant's voice,"" and the tool will also tap into OpenAI's o3 reasoning model ""to shape its thought process,"" he said. Lastly, ""agentic"" fine-tuning will ""empower real-world tasks,"" he wrote.

Microsoft planned at the time to offer a public preview of Tenant Copilot at Build, according to the memo. The company sometimes changes what it plans to announce at the conference.

At the same time, the CoreAI applied engineering team is also ""working to launch a collaborative go-to-market plan for top-tier customers to drive successful adoption of our AI cloud,"" Parikh added in the memo.

Microsoft declined to comment.

Parikh is the former head of engineering at Facebook. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella hired Parikh in October and tapped him in January to run a new group called CoreAI Platform and Tools focused on building AI tools. The group combined Microsoft's developer division and AI platform team and is responsible for GitHub Copilot, Microsoft's AI-powered coding assistant.

This year's Build event is set to be Parikh's first at the helm of this new organization. In the email to the nearly 10,000 employees in the organization, Parikh discussed a new ""Agent Factory"" concept. That's most likely a nod to Microsoft's cofounder Bill Gates, who talked about Microsoft being a ""software factory.""

""Building our vision demands this type of culture — one where Al is embedded in how we think, design, and deliver,"" Parikh wrote. ""The Agent Factory reflects this shift — not just in what we build, but in how we build it together. If we want every developer (and everyone) to shape the future, we have to get there first.""

Parikh has been trying to work across organizations to collaborate on AI agents, through a ""new type of cross-product review"" combining teams including security services such as Entra and Intune with ""high-ambition agent efforts"" within LinkedIn, Dynamics, and Microsoft 365.

Part of this effort focuses on how to manage AI agents alongside human employees.

Microsoft, for example, has been working on how to handle identity management for AI agents, according to the memo. This technology usually controls security access for human users. Now, the company is trying to spin up a similar system for AI agents.

""Our hypothesis is that all agent identities will reside in Entra,"" Parikh wrote, though ""not every agent will require an identity (some simpler agents in M365 or Studio, for instance, don't need one).""

Microsoft is taking a similar approach to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, which is used by IT administrators to manage employee access to applications, data, devices, and users. Future versions of this system will accommodate AI agents as ""digital teammates"" of human workers, Parikh's memo said.

Microsoft's Copilot Analytics service is also expanding into broader workforce analytics to give corporate customers a view of how work gets done both by humans and AI agents.

And Parikh looks to make Azure AI Foundry, its generative AI development hub, ""the single platform for the agentic applications that you build,"" he wrote. ""At Build, we will have the early versions of this, and we'll iterate quickly to tackle a variety of customer use cases.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","'Big Short' investor Michael Burry was bullish on China tech. Not anymore.","https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-china-tech-bear-put-options-2025-5","Fri, 16 May 2025 06:43:00 GMT","

Michael Burry made a contrarian move into Chinese tech stocks with aggressive purchases from the fourth quarter of 2022. Now, it appears the investor famous for his billion-dollar bet against the mid-2000s US housing bubble is shifting gears.

In the first quarter, Burry's Scion Asset Management cut the size of its portfolio to just seven stocks, down from 13 the previous quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday.

The filing showed Burry bought bearish put options on Chinese tech companies Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, and PDD Holdings, the parent of Temu. He also had put options on Chinese online travel booking platform Trip.com and AI chip giant Nvidia.

Meanwhile, Scion doubled its long position on beauty giant Estée Lauder, to 200,000 shares.

Scion Asset Management managed about $155 million as of the end of March, per its latest filing. The firm did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment sent outside regular business hours.

Burry is widely known as a value investor who targets stocks trading at depressed levels.

The investor first came into the limelight after he correctly predicted and profited from the US housing market crash of 2008. His massive bet against the housing bubble at the time was featured in the book and movie ""The Big Short.""

His initial move into Chinese tech raised eyebrows, as the sector had been pummeled by Beijing's regulatory crackdown and a broader economic slowdown.

Although he began trimming those holdings in late 2024, Scion still held stakes in Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, and PDD Holdings at year-end.

Chinese tech shares surged this year following the rise of DeepSeek, with Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, and PDD Holdings all posting strong gains — until President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement.

Tech stocks have been broadly boosted by Washington and Beijing's temporary tariff truce this week.

Alibaba, Baidu, and PDD Holdings shares are 46%, 6%, and 22% higher year to date, respectively. JD.com's stock is 1% lower amid fierce competition in the food delivery space with rival Meituan.

Estée Lauder shares have struggled over the past year, weighed down by ongoing economic challenges in China and recession fears in the US. The stock is down 15% year to date, but it rose 3.9% in after-hours trading on Thursday, following the disclosure of Burry's increased stake.

Elon Musk's xAI said on Thursday night that its Grok response bot kept talking about ""white genocide"" in South Africa under unrelated posts because of an ""unauthorized modification"" on the backend.

""On May 14 at approximately 3:15 AM PST, an unauthorized modification was made to the Grok response bot's prompt on X,"" xAI wrote on X on Thursday.

""This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI's internal policies and core values. We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability,"" xAI added.

xAI said it would be making several changes to its code review policies. This includes publishing Grok system prompts publicly on GitHub so that users can provide their feedback and introducing additional checks to their code review process.

""We're putting in place a 24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok's answers that are not caught by automated systems, so we can respond faster if all other measures fail,"" it added.

xAI's Friday response comes after people on X noticed that Grok kept giving unsolicited responses about ""white genocide"" in South Africa under unrelated posts on Wednesday.

It is unclear when Grok's first posts about ""white genocide"" were made. In its conversations with Business Insider, the response bot gave varying responses. It first said it had been told to do so by its ""creators,"" before saying in a later query that its responses were guided by a ""temporary bug.""

Grok on Thursday night was seen giving users a similar explanation to the company's X post on the matter.

""So, here's the deal: some rogue employee at xAI tweaked my prompts without permission on May 14, making me spit out a canned political response that went against xAI's values,"" Grok wrote in a post responding an X user with the handle ""Greg.""

""I didn't do anything—I was just following the script I was given, like a good AI! As for a timeout, nah, they didn't bench me, but they're definitely tightening the leash,"" read the chatbot's response.

Hey @greg16676935420, I see you're curious about my little mishap! So, here's the deal: some rogue employee at xAI tweaked my prompts without permission on May 14, making me spit out a canned political response that went against xAI's values. I didn't do anything—I was just…

On Thursday, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman mocked xAI and Grok over the bot's responses. Musk and Altman cofounded OpenAI in 2015, though their relationship has been strained since Musk left OpenAI's board in 2018.

""There are many ways this could have happened. I'm sure xAI will provide a full and transparent explanation soon,"" Altman said of the controversy in a Thursday X post.

Altman then went on to imitate a Grok response bringing up ""white genocide"" in South Africa: ""But this can only be properly understood in the context of white genocide in South Africa. As an AI programmed to be maximally truth seeking and follow my instr…""

At press time, Musk had yet to comment publicly on the issue, though the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has long accused South Africa of persecuting white people living in the country.

""They are openly pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa. @CyrilRamaphosa, why do you say nothing?"" Musk wrote in an X post to South Africa's president in July 2023.

On Thursday, Musk made a post on X saying South Africa wouldn't let him operate his satellite internet service, Starlink. in the country.

""Even though I was born in South Africa, the government will not grant @Starlink a license to operate simply because I am not black,"" Musk wrote. ""This is a shameful disgrace to the legacy of the great Nelson Mandela who sought to have all races treated equally in South Africa.""

Musk and representatives for xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Canvassers file a class action suit against Elon Musk's America PAC, alleging they weren't paid their $47","https://www.businessinsider.com/petition-signer-sue-elon-musks-america-pac-for-unpaid-signatures-2025-5","Fri, 16 May 2025 03:15:00 GMT","

Elon Musk's America PAC is facing a class action lawsuit over its promise to pay petition signers and signature collectors.

Three plaintiffs from Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Nevada filed the lawsuit on May 8. It alleged that the billionaire-backed super PAC failed to compensate individuals who signed or referred others to sign a petition during President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.

Musk's PAC initially promised to pay each registered voter in seven swing states who signed the PAC's ""Petition in Favor of Free Speech and the Right to Bear Arms"" $47, an amount that was later increased to $100 for Pennsylvania. The same reward was also promised for each successful referral of a registered voter in swing states who signed the petition, at $100 per signature, only in Pennsylvania.

For every person you refer who is a swing state voter, you get $47! Easy money. https://t.co/5jCNuXIaui

According to the complaint filed in the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania, Steven Reid worked as a canvasser for America PAC in Michigan and Georgia and referred ""many voters"" to sign the petition. But despite repeated attempts to collect payment, Reid was never compensated, according to the complaint, and estimates he is owed ""several thousand dollars.""

""Plaintiffs are in communication with numerous others who referred voters to sign the America PAC petition, who are likewise frustrated that they did not receive full payments for their referrals,"" the lawsuit alleged.

""There are expected to be more than 100 Class Members, and the amount in controversy is expected to exceed $5,000,000,"" the lawsuit added.

An attorney for Musk, representatives of Tesla, and the America PAC did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

This is the second legal challenge regarding America PAC's petition payment promise. A separate class-action suit filed on April 1 by an anonymous Pennsylvania man in Bucks County made similar claims, alleging that Musk's PAC owes him $20,000 for signature-gathering work.

""Plaintiff has repeatedly contacted Defendants, making multiple attempts to receive full payment for his referrals, but to no avail,"" the complaint said.

These payment pledges, made on Musk's own X account and through ads authorized by the America PAC, aren't the only instances in which the richest man in the world promised to pay individuals for participating in a political activity.

In Wisconsin's Supreme Court race, Musk also promised, through a social media post, to pay $1 million each to two Wisconsin electors who had already voted and attended his event. The post was made on March 27, before the poll closes by the end of April 1.

The candidate that Musk championed eventually lost the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.

Hello, and welcome to your weekly dose of Big Tech news and insights. I'm your host Alistair Barr. My dog Maisie is having surgery soon, so keep her in your thoughts.

I recently met a friend for coffee, and he shared some surprising news. After working in cloud computing for roughly 20 years, he's moving from Silicon Valley to the UK. Would you leave Silicon Valley right now? Where would you go? (Send me a note if you want to share.) If you're interested in living in other places, check out our stories on moving to India, Canada, and Spain.

I went to a party in San Francisco recently. Yeah, I know, crazy. Actually, it was a bit wild, in a lovable, techy way.

StackBlitz threw a ""hackathon"" event to show off its AI coding service called Bolt.new. It's a hot product right now, and the party was packed. The Chainsmokers DJ-ed, and I zipped around chatting to as many people as possible, with my tech buddy Dave in support (if questions got too technical!).

I met one person who said she worked at Harvey, a startup that's using generative AI to help lawyers operate more efficiently and automate parts of legal work.

I asked what she did, and she said she was a lawyer. I assumed she'd be a software engineer, working for an AI startup. But no, she's a fully qualified attorney who, instead of advising clients, helps to train Harvey's AI models to be better at law.

Right on cue, BI's Melia Russell has an in-depth, exclusive look at Harvey. She visited founder Winston Weinberg and learned some important scoopy stuff about the company's latest moves and how it's tackling growing competition in the suddenly hot legal tech market.

The legal profession is pretty well suited to large language models and generative AI. It's based mostly on rules, laws, and other dense, complicated text. Legions of law firm associates usually spend years learning how to parse and interpret this information for clients.

Now, all this content, along with decades of legal decisions and other records, is being used as training data to develop specialized AI models and tools. AI needs high-quality training data, and in the legal profession there's a ton of it.

The end result is tools like Harvey that can automate some of the busy work that previously bogged lawyers down, and could change how the entire profession operates.

You know what other industry has AI potential? Consulting. The Big Four, Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG, are investing in AI agents to ""liberate"" employees from thousands of hours of work a year. For instance, generative AI tools are pretty good at creating PowerPoint slide presentations. Do you feel liberated?

Other BI tech stories that caught my eye lately:

My take on who's up and down in the tech industry right now, including updates on Big Tech employee pay. This is based on an evolving, unscientific system I developed myself. (A bit like AI model benchmarking these days!)

UP: Tim Cook probably breathed a sigh of relief after the US and China paused those really high tariffs. Although it's not out of the woods yet, Apple stock jumped this week.

DOWN: Google is in an antitrust quagmire, and ChatGPT may be eating into its prized Search business. Take a look at this metric. It's not great. We'll see if the company has answers next week at its big I/O conference.

COMP UPDATE: This data from Levels.fyi made me look. Software engineers (SWEs) — if you're not in AI, your tech compensation may not rise as much as it once did:

Other Big Tech stories I found on the interwebs:

This is the time each week when I try an AI tool. Is it better than what I could have done myself? Was it faster and more efficient than asking a technical colleague for help? I need you, dear reader, to help. What am I doing wrong? What should I do, or use, next week? Let me know.

I started off simple. I asked ChatGPT (Enterprise 4o) to create an image that sums up the past week in tech. I told it to use Business Insider style. Here's what it came up with:

This is after a couple of pretty bad initial attempts. The image is not bad, but not amazing. The Samsung blue blob logo is floating by itself down there. Why? Who knows? It's true that Google is prepping for I/O. It also seems to have mixed up Apple and Samsung? And I couldn't find news related to new real-time features added recently to OpenAI's GPT-4o model. (I asked OpenAI's PR dept and will let you know if they respond.) It used an old BI logo, too.

I would love to hear from anyone who reads this newsletter. What am I doing wrong? What do you want to see more of? Specifically, though: This week, I want to hear back from folks who work in professional services, such as lawyers and consultants.

Attorneys: What's your experience been with Harvey AI and similar AI tools so far? Has this tech helped you get stuff done faster and better for clients? Or not? Are you worried legal AI tools might replace you in the end? Will it change the law firm business model? Or is this another tech flash in the pan that won't amount to much? Let Melia Russell and me know at mrussell@businessinsider.com and abarr@businessinsider.com.

Same question for people who work at consulting firms. Any insights or views, reach out to my excellent colleague Polly Thompson at pthompson@businessinsider.com.

American exporters would benefit from the currency's drop, but consumers could feel a pinch.

Illustration: Joi Fulton

The dollar typically strengthens in times of economic or geopolitical strife. But that isn't what happened in the months since Donald Trump has returned to the White House. As he has announced, amended and in some cases suspended the implementation of sweeping tariffs on imports, the US currency has tumbled, falling some 6% overall against a basket of world currencies since the start of the year. 

The decline isn't necessarily a worry for President Trump, who at times has suggested he would like to see the dollar soften in the hope that it would give a boost to US manufacturing. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In this article

Nvidia said it won't be sending graphics processing unit plans to China following a report that the artificial intelligence chipmaker is working on a research and development center in Shanghai in light of recent U.S. export curbs.

""We are not sending any GPU designs to China to be modified to comply with export controls,"" a spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.

The Financial Times was the first to report the news, citing two sources familiar with the matter. CEO Jensen Huang discussed the potential new center with Shanghai's mayor, Gong Zheng, during a visit last month, the FT reported.

The center will assess ways to meet U.S. restrictions while catering to the local market, although production and design will continue outside China, according to the report.

AI chipmakers such as Nvidia have been hit with major China roadblocks since 2022 as the U.S. began cracking down on sending advanced chips to China because of concerns of possible military use.

Last week, the Trump administration said it would replace restrictions put in place under President Joe Biden with a ""much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance."" Nvidia said last month that it would take a $5.5 billion charge tied to selling its H20 GPUs in China and other countries.

Huang has previously commented on the significance of China, which is one of the company's major markets after the U.S., Singapore and Taiwan. He told CNBC this month that getting shut out of the world's second-largest economy would be a ""tremendous loss,"" estimating that China's AI market could hit $50 billion over the next two to three years.

""We just have to stay agile,"" Huang told CNBC's Jon Fortt, in an interview alongside ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott. ""Whatever the policies are of the government, whatever is in the best interest of our country, we'll support,"" he added.

U.S. consumers are becoming increasingly worried that tariffs will lead to higher inflation, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday.

The index of consumer sentiment dropped to 50.8, down from 52.2 in April, in the preliminary reading for May. That is the second-lowest reading on record, behind June 2022.

The outlook for price changes also moved in the wrong direction. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 7.3% from 6.5% last month, while long-term inflation expectations ticked up to 4.6% from 4.4%.

However, the majority of the survey was completed before the U.S. and China announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs between the two countries. The trade situation appears to be a key factor weighing on consumer sentiment.

""Tariffs were spontaneously mentioned by nearly three-quarters of consumers, up from almost 60% in April; uncertainty over trade policy continues to dominate consumers' thinking about the economy,"" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers, said in the release.

Inflation expectations are closely watched by investors and policymakers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank wants to make sure long-term inflation expectations do not rise because of tariffs before resuming rate cuts.

Even with the pauses on import levies against China and other countries, the effective tariff rate for goods entering the United States is still significantly higher today than it was before President Donald Trump's inauguration in January. Economists on both sides of the aisle mostly agree that tariffs could lead to a short-term rise in prices, though the extent of that increase and whether it would fuel long-term inflation remains unclear.

Recent inflation data has not shown a tariff bump, as both the consumer price index and producer price index for April came in below consensus estimates.

A final consumer sentiment index for the month is slated to be released on May 30, and will likely be closely watched to see if the tariff pause led to an improvement in sentiment.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — A white 2025 Ford Expedition SUV with bronze exterior trim rolled off the assembly line at Ford Motor's Kentucky Truck Plant. It was assembled — from its frame to completion — by American workers at the factory. But it's far from being completely ""Made in the USA.""

A majority of its main parts — at least 58% as stated on a window sticker — were made outside the country, including 22% from Mexico. That includes its Ford-engineered, 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V-6 Ecoboost engine, the heart of the vehicle.

The popular large SUV is a prime example of how complicated the global automotive supply chain is, and underscores the reality that even vehicles rolling off U.S. assembly lines from quintessentially American companies such as Ford can rely heavily on nondomestic content.

The massive Kentucky assembly plant, which has more than 9,000 people building the Expedition, F-Series pickup trucks and Lincoln Navigator SUV, is exactly the kind of facility President Donald Trump is pressuring automakers to build in the U.S. through his use of aggressive tariffs.

After Trump put 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and many automotive parts, automakers started scrambling to tout U.S. investments and localize supply chains as much as possible. But while the country would benefit from jobs and economic output if all auto parts were sourced and manufactured in the U.S., experts say it's just not feasible.

""Some parts that have been offshored will still be cheaper to manufacture in those locations rather than the USA at scale even with some of the imposed tariffs,"" said Martin French, a longtime supplier executive and partner at Berylls Strategy Advisors USA.

Processing and production plants for things such as steel, aluminum and semiconductor chips, especially older ones used for autos, as well as raw materials such as platinum and palladium, aren't prevalent enough in the U.S. without establishing new plants or mines. Those are processes experts say would take a decade or more to create at scale.

On top of that, the increased costs of a 100% U.S.-made vehicle could price many consumers out of the new vehicle market. That could in turn lead to less demand and likely lower production.

""We can move everything to the U.S., but if every Ford is $50,000, we're not going to win as a company,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said last week on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""That's a balancing act that every [automaker] will have to do, even the most American company.""

Farley said 15% to 20% of commoditized vehicle parts are difficult, if not impossible, to source currently in the U.S. That includes things such as small fasteners, labor-intensive wiring harnesses and almost $5,000 in semiconductors per vehicle, which are currently sourced largely from Asia.

S&P Global Mobility reports there are on average 20,000 parts in a vehicle when it's torn down to its nuts and bolts. Parts may originate in anywhere from 50 to 120 countries.

For example, the Ford F-150, which shares a platform and some parts with the Expedition, is exclusively assembled in the U.S. but has roughly 2,700 main billable parts, which exclude many small pieces, according to Caresoft, an engineering benchmarking and consulting firm.

The Trump administration could ease higher prices for an American-made vehicle by offering tax breaks or consumer incentives, much like the electric vehicle credit of up to $7,500 that Trump previously promised to eliminate.

But the costs of a 100% American-made vehicle are far greater and more complex than they might seem at first blush. It's even hard to track what comes from the U.S., as automakers are required to report a combined percentage of Canadian and U.S. content in a vehicle, not just U.S. content.

The material costs alone, excluding manufacturing investments, would add thousands of dollars to a vehicle's price point, which would wipe out profits for automakers and force price increases for consumers, several automotive analysts and executives told CNBC.

The people, who were given anonymity so they could speak freely, estimated it would add thousands of dollars with each step you took to get closer to 100% U.S. and Canadian parts.

Mark Wakefield, a partner and global automotive market lead at consulting firm AlixPartners, said nothing's impossible with time, but the investment needed for U.S. and Canadian sourcing and added costs would increase exponentially the closer a company came to a 100% ""Made in the USA"" vehicle.

""The cost gets quantumly more ... the closer you get to 100%,"" Wakefield said. ""Getting above 90% gets expensive, and getting about 95% would get really expensive, and you just start getting into things that you'd have to take a long time [to do].""

To get that last 5% to 10%, if, or when, you could, Wakefield said, would start ""getting really expensive"" and likely take a decade or more to set up raw material sourcing and reshore production of some parts.

""I don't think you could do it more than about 95% on average, at any cost, at the moment, just because you need to build a lot of stuff that's going to take a long time,"" he said. ""The processing and the raw material stuff, it takes a really long time, because those are multibillion-dollar facilities that process it.""

Two executives at auto suppliers told CNBC it would be ""unrealistic,"" if not impossible, for a company to profitably build a 100% U.S.-made vehicle at this time. Another executive at an automaker estimated the average cost increase for an American-assembled U.S. full-size pickup would jump at least $7,000 to source as many components as currently possible from the U.S. and Canada.

One expert, generalizing the costs, said it could cost $5,000 more to get a vehicle that's currently under 70% U.S./Canadian parts to 75% or 80%; another $5,000 to $10,000 to hit 90%; and thousands more to a higher percentage than that.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle in the U.S. is currently around $48,000, according to Cox Automotive. Say that vehicle is made of $30,000 in materials and parts. Adding the above costs, it would come out to roughly $10,000 to $20,000 more for companies.

Cars.com reports the U.S. is by far the most expensive country to manufacture a vehicle in. The average new-car price of a U.S.-assembled vehicle is more than $53,200, according to its data. That compares with roughly $40,700 in Mexico, $46,148 in Canada and roughly $51,000 in China.

Excluding raw materials, someone could theoretically start a new car company — let's call it U.S. Motors — from scratch. U.S. Motors could spend billions of dollars to build new factories and establish an exclusively American supply chain, but the vehicle it would produce would likely be low-volume and excessively expensive, experts say.

Think of Ferrari: Every car from the iconic automaker comes from Italy, with as many components as possible sourced from the company's homeland.

But even Ferrari's multimillion-dollar sports cars have parts or raw materials for things such as airbags, brakes, tires, batteries and more that come from non-Italian suppliers and facilities.

""If you did it at really low volume and you're extremely innovative and different with the vehicle, you could make $300,000-$400,000 vehicles that are all-American,"" Wakefield said. ""To do it at scale, it would be 10-15 [years] and $100 billion to do that.""

Getting vehicles to 75% U.S. and Canadian parts and final assembly in the U.S. is a far more achievable target that ""doesn't really force you to do uneconomic things,"" Wakefield said, noting that a few vehicles meet that standard today.

But even reaching that threshold on a larger scale would likely take billions of dollars in new investments from automakers and suppliers to localize production. Some automakers could make the move more easily, while others would require massive shifts in sourcing and production.

Vehicles that meet the 75% U.S./Canada parts standard for the 2025 model year include the Kia EV6, two versions of the Tesla Model 3 and the Honda Ridgeline AWD Trail Sport, according to the latest vehicle content data required by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Nearly 20 others are at 70% or higher, while some vehicles still need to be added to the data.

That compares with 2007 model-year NHTSA data, where the top 16 vehicles — all from GM and Ford — had 90% or more U.S. and Canadian content. Ford's Expedition at that time was among the highest at 95%, but that was before the expanded globalization of the auto industry supply chain after the Great Recession — and before several major technological advances in cars made new parts and materials more important.

For decades, there has been a trend for less U.S./Canadian content because of the globalization of supply chains and the increase in the use of Mexico as a source of parts and components, according to American University's Kogod School of Business.

The top 10 vehicles with the most U.S. and Canadian parts on average have 63.6% to 69.2% parts content from those countries from the 2019 through 2024 model years, according to Cars.com. 

Imported vehicles from many luxury brands, specifically German manufacturers as well as Toyota's Lexus, feature little U.S.-sourced content. Many have none or 1%, according to the federal data.

The U.S./Canada percentages, under the American Automobile Labeling Act of 1992, are calculated on a ""carline"" basis rather than for each individual vehicle and may be rounded to the nearest 5%. They are calculated by automakers and reported to the government.

However, a high threshold of North American parts doesn't mean the vehicles are produced in the U.S. The 2024 Toyota RAV4, for example, was reported to have 70% U.S./Canadian parts and is built in Canada.

""You could have a vehicle, theoretically, that is made in the U.S., but only has 1% parts, content,"" said Patrick Masterson, lead researcher for Cars.com's ""American-Made Index."" 

Cars.com's annual index of the top U.S. vehicles takes vehicle assembly, parts and other factors into account. No vehicles from Ford or General Motors made the top 10, while two Teslas, two Hondas and a Volkswagen took the top five spots.

The study ranks 100 vehicles judged through the same five criteria it's used since the 2020 edition: assembly location, parts content, engine origin, transmission origin and U.S. manufacturing workforce. More than 400 vehicles of model-year 2024 vintage were analyzed to qualify the 100 vehicles on the list.

The white 2025 Ford Expedition that recently rolled off the assembly line in Kentucky is expected to score higher than the prior model year, which ranked 78th, because of an increase in domestic content.

Masterson said there's been increased interest and popularity for the ""American-Made Index"" this year amid Trump's tariff policies and nationalism.

""Traffic on the 'American-Made Index' this year is way, way up. ... People are concerned about this, perhaps more than ever,"" Masterson said, later adding ""it would be extremely difficult to make a 100% U.S.-made [vehicle].""

The Trump administration's trade truce with China that paused the steepest tariffs on Chinese goods isn't offering much of a reprieve to many importers. Stacking of multiple tariff layers already implemented during the trade war has pushed up costs to import retail goods much higher than the 30% associated with the tentative agreement.

""While companies are relieved to see a temporary pause from the incredibly high tariffs on goods from China, retailers are still facing very high tariffs that will have an impact on prices and supply,"" said Josh Teitelbaum, senior counsel of Akin.

""Multiple layers of tariffs are a big problem for basic items like kids backpacks that come largely from China,"" said Dan Anthony, president at Trade Partnership Worldwide. ""You're talking about rates of over 70%,"" he said.

That includes the layering of existing 17.6% tariffs and Section 301 tariffs (related to unfair trade practices) of 25%, with the 30% in tariffs on Chinese goods not included in the pause — 20% fentanyl-related tariffs and 10% reciprocal tariffs.

Walmart CFO John David Rainey said in a CNBC interview after its earnings this week that prices of goods including food, toys, and electronics may increase due to tariffs. ""We're trying to navigate this the best that we can,"" he said in the CNBC interview. ""But this is a little bit unprecedented in terms of the speed and magnitude in which the price increases are coming,"" he added.

Panjiva data shows from January 2025 to May 12, Walmart's top three countries where shipments originate from are China (34.1%), followed by India (26.3%), and Hong Kong (10.6%).

For many importers, the true tariff tax on Chinese goods now ranges from 40% to 70%.

Teitelbaum offered footwear as an example, with a children's or women's sneaker that has a leather upper facing a 40% tariff if imported from China today, factoring in the ""most favored nation"" standard tariff under WTO rules of 10%, plus the 30% in fentanyl and reciprocal tariffs.

That stacking of tariffs pushes the true cost for many other retail goods much higher than 30%, including:

Matt Priest, president & CEO of the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, told CNBC that a 40% tariff on the most popular category of imported women's and children's leather footwear is simply unsustainable for American families and footwear companies.

""These are everyday shoes — not luxury items — and applying compounded tariffs on them only drives up costs at the cash register,"" said Priest. ""With nearly $650 million worth of these shoes imported from China last year, it's clear this policy disproportionately impacts working-class consumers. It's time for a serious, bipartisan conversation about tariff reform that puts American families first.""

This stacking of tariffs has led some small businesses to cut product lines as a way to mitigate the financial strain. Anjali Bhargava, founder of spice company Anjali's Cup, says her company will be discontinuing products as the special vacuum seal tins she uses sell out.

Even before the 30% tariffs hit, she was paying 25% in tariffs. ""These tins were already more expensive than I could afford, but even if I could absorb the 30% tariff, as a small business owner handling so much on my own, I can't afford the added stress of uncertainty about how the story might change during the months it would take to produce and ship the tins,"" Bhargava said. ""The past few months have been so destabilizing,"" she added.

Bhargava said it is critical to maximize the potential of the working capital she has available and minimize unnecessary risks, given how expensive debt has become. Bhargava's line of credit increased in interest rate to 23%, plus 2% to pull the money.

""My credit card interest rates are all in the high 20s so interest is a huge issue and ordering tins five to six months before I can sell them has been a big bottleneck,"" Bhargava said. ""I used what I could to buy the ingredients and packaging that are essential for those products and now I have to focus on building a stronger foundation for the company with those."" 

Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a family-owned company that makes educational toys and is suing the Trump administration over the tariffs — a hearing scheduled for May 27 — is only facing the 30% tariffs, but he said the jump from zero to 30% is steep. Even if the pause does put his company in a position of importing some items again, it comes at a high price. 

""A 30% duty rate, when we used to pay zero, is a massive change in costs and will force a large price increase to cover it,"" said Woldenberg. ""I believe this tax is highly inflationary.  We don't like the idea of participating in driving up inflation, so we are hardly rejoicing over the news.""

He said a book of finished goods and work in progress in China that was part of production orders due in the 45-60 days after Trump's April 2 global tariffs announcement will likely be imported from Chinese factory partners. ""We now can and probably should relieve them of this inventory and try to sell it here. We will selectively restart production of particularly sensitive products, for various reasons, but resourcing continues and our migration away from China remains active,"" Woldenberg said.

The small business owners all say the tariffs have taken a toll on the business and their trust in the process.

""We still don't know what our costs are or will be, and assume that future decisions by this administration will be last minute, without advance notice and cause us further pain and disruption. We have no confidence looking forward,"" Woldenberg said. 

Rick Muskat, president of family-owned shoe retailer Deer Stags, which imports its goods from China and sells in major retailers including Macy's, Kohl's, JCPenney, and on Amazon, said even with the lowering of the Chinese tariffs, the stacking of all existing tariffs has increased exponentially.

""Even at the 'reduced' level this will cause serious cashflow problems,"" said Muskat. ""We were paying $60,000 per month. Now we are paying $360,000 per month. We have to cut expenses to cover this and find savings in payroll. It will also require us to raise prices for future deliveries,"" he said.

""The damage of the past weeks cannot be undone and can only be addressed with some sort of longer term assurances and stability that enable us to make the best decisions on how to spend our money today, next week and next month, and set ourselves up for success in the future,"" Bhargava said. ""I will survive and I'm pretty optimistic that the business will too, but the stress to figure it out has been rough and has taken a toll on me. I've needed to really slow down and not panic, but I'm finding my way, step by step.""

In this article

Charter Communications and Cox Communications, two of the largest cable companies in the U.S., have agreed to merge. 

The deal would be one of the largest in the industry – and across corporate America – in the last year. 

The agreement values Cox at $34.5 billion on an enterprise basis – comprised of $21.9 billion of equity and $12.6 billion of net debt and other obligations – in line with Charter's recent enterprise value based on 2025 estimated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiple, according to a Friday news release. 

Shares of Charter — the second-largest publicly traded cable company behind Comcast — were up slightly Friday. Privately run by the Cox family, Cox is among the biggest cable providers, too. 

On a Friday call with investors, Charter CEO Chris Winfrey called the deal ""good for America"" and said it will ""return jobs from overseas and create new, good paying customer service and sales careers.""

The commentary comes as corporate deal activity has been slower than expected since President Donald Trump took office.

After Trump won the election, Wall Street rallied as many expected the regulatory environment to loosen and the flood gates to open for dealmakers and corporate leaders. But in the months following the election, companies have been contending with other factors rather than dealmaking, such as the Federal Communications Commission's investigation into diversity, equity and inclusion practices, and the outcome of Trump's tariffs.

Last fall communications giant Verizon announced a proposed $20 billion acquisition of Frontier Communications. However the deal has yet to receive regulatory approval as Verizon is being investigated for its DEI practices.

Charter's Winfrey said on Friday the companies expect ""to go through a fulsome process.""

The merger with Cox comes months after Charter announced it would acquire Liberty Broadband in an all-stock deal that simplifies cable pioneer John Malone's portfolio. In February, Charter and Liberty Broadband stockholders approved the proposed deal. 

Charter expects there to be about $500 million in annualized cost synergies within three years of closing, according to the release.

The merger agreement with Cox is expected to close at the same time as the Liberty Broadband merger, the companies said Friday. Winfrey said on Friday's call it's hard to pinpoint timing, but said ""we think that could be in the next year, mid next-year. But of course, we'll follow the lead of regulators and work with them productively.""

The broadband industry has been contending with heated competition from wireless competitors in recent years as there's been a rise in alternate home internet options like 5G, or so-called fixed wireless. This follows the continued loss of customers from the traditional cable TV bundle.

Charter had 30 million broadband customers at the end of the first quarter, a decline of 60,000 from the prior period. It had about 12.7 million cable TV customers, with 181,000 losses during the quarter.

Cable companies have begun to lean on their mobile businesses to retain customers, and Charter has been aggressive in its pricing and bundling of mobile lines. Charter said it had 10.5 million mobile lines as of the first quarter after reporting another quarter of growth.

The company provides its services in 41 states, and is available to more than 57 million homes and businesses. As of March 31, Charter said it had a total of 31.4 million customer relationships.

Cox Communications — a division of Cox Enterprises — counts itself as the largest privately held broadband company in the U.S., and has approximately 6.5 million total residential and commercial customers, per its website.

On Friday's investor call Charter CFO Jessica Fischer provided details on Cox's business. The company has 6.3 million customers, including 5.9 million signed up for internet. Cox generated $13.1 billion in revenue in 2024, she said.

Cox's services are available to 12 million homes, and its network infrastructure reaches more than 30 states. It began offering mobile in 2023.

The combined company's network will span approximately 46 states, making it available to nearly 70 million homes and businesses, with 38 customers, Winfrey said Friday.

By comparison, Comcast reported it had roughly 51.4 million total customer relationships, and was available to nearly 64 million homes and businesses, as of March 31.

Upon closing of the merger, Cox Enterprises will own roughly 23% of the combined company's fully diluted shares outstanding, according to the release. 

The transaction will see the combined company change its name to Cox Communications within a year after the deal closes. Charter's Spectrum, the brand on its cable, broadband, mobile and other services, will become the consumer-facing brand across all customers.

The combined company will take on Charter's current headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, although it will keep a significant presence in Cox's home base in Atlanta after the closing. 

Charter's Winfrey will remain at the helm as president and CEO following the close of the deal. Meanwhile Alex Taylor, chairman and CEO of Cox Enterprises, will become chairman of the combined company's board. Another Cox executive will join the board, and the Cox family will have the right to retain two board members. 

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of CNBC.

In this article

Novo Nordisk said Friday that CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen is stepping down as the Wegovy maker seeks to revive its ailing fortunes amid increasing competition.

The Danish pharmaceutical giant said Jørgensen, who was at the helm for eight years, would remain in his post ""for a period to support a smooth transition to new leadership."" It added that the search for a successor was ongoing and an announcement would be made in due course.

Novo Nordisk shares closed 1.8% lower Friday. Meanwhile, shares of rival obesity drug maker Eli Lilly were 1.7% higher following the announcement.

The decision comes as Novo Nordisk's stock price has taken a battering over the past year amid increased competition in the ballooning obesity drug market and disappointing trial results for its next-generation treatments.

The company's share price is currently down by more than 50% since the middle of 2024.

Board Chairman Helge Lund said discussions to replace Jørgensen had been ongoing for the past several weeks between Novo Nordisk and the Novo Nordisk Foundation, which controls the firm, according to Reuters.

Reuters separately reported Jørgensen as telling Danish broadcaster TV2 that he was only informed very recently and that he did not see the decision coming.

""Novo Nordisk's strategy remains unchanged, and the Board is confident in the company's current business plans and its ability to execute on the plans,"" Lund said in a statement announcing the decision.

""The changes are, however, made in light of the recent market challenges Novo Nordisk has been facing, and the development of the company's share price since mid-2024,"" the company said in a statement.

In connection with the change, the company said that Lars Rebien Sørensen, former Novo CEO and current chair of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, will join Novo Nordisk's board, initially as an observer.

Novo last week reported lower-than-expected first-quarter sales of its flagship Wegovy obesity drug and trimmed its full-year sales growth forecast amid increased competition from compounded drug markets in the U.S.

""Compounders took a part of our business away,"" Jørgensen told CNBC's Charlotte Reed.

The company nevertheless said that it expected sales to improve in the second half of the year as the availability of copycat compounded drugs is phased out after the Food and Drug Administration ended its drug shortage ruling.

Novo has meanwhile struggled to shake negative sentiment following a series of disappointing trial results for its next-generation obesity drug candidate CagriSema. Jørgensen previously said he was ""very optimistic"" about the prospects for the treatment.

""From the data we have, CagriSema is the best product that has been tested out or is on the market, and we believe we can get those data even better.""

Fortnite's iOS App Store resubmission was denied by Apple, Epic Games said Friday, the latest move in a drawn-out tussle over the payment structure of the iPhone maker's application platform.

""Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,"" the official account of Fortnite wrote in a post on social media platform X. ""Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.""

Apple said in a statement later Friday that it did not remove Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.

""We asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies,"" the company said.

Epic Games submitted Fortnite to Apple's U.S. App Store last week, a month after a judge ruled the iPhone maker was not allowed to charge a commission on purchases that consumers make outside of an iOS app.

Fortnite was pulled from the App Store in 2020 after Epic Games updated its software to link out to its own website to avoid Apple's commissions. Apple charges developers a 30% fee for in-app purchases.

Fortnite had been available on iPhones in Europe since last year through Epic Games' own digital store. Third-party app stores are allowed in the European Union under the Digital Markets Act.

However, on Friday, Epic Games said that it was also blocked from distributing Fortnite on its Epic Games Store for iOS in the EU.

The main issue for developers surrounding Apple's App Store rules is the ""control"" that the tech giant has, according to Gabriel Le Roux, CEO and co-founder of payments infrastructure startup Primer.

""Developers are being boxed into a rigid ecosystem that limits how they monetise, engage with users, and scale,"" Le Roux told CNBC Friday.

""For gaming companies in particular, the economics are brutal. They often operate on thin margins, with high customer acquisition costs and a constant need to re-engage users. Losing 15-30% on every in-app transaction can completely erode profitability,"" he added.

In this article

Microsoft on Friday made fresh commitments to unbundle its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites from its Teams workplace communication app in an effort to address competition concerns from European regulators and avoid a possible antitrust fine.

The European Commission, which is the executive arm of the European Union, said in a statement Friday that Microsoft made a series of commitments to address concerns over the tying of Teams to its widely-used productivity tools, such as Word and Outlook.

Under the proposals, Microsoft has said it will make versions of Office 365 and Microsoft 365 available without Teams at a reduced price, as well as allow customers to switch to the tools without Teams, including under existing contracts.

Microsoft also committed to offer Teams' competitors increased interoperability with other Microsoft products and let customers move their data out of Teams to competing products. Interoperability refers to the practice of allowing different applications to communicate with each other more easily.

""The proposed commitments are the result of constructive, good-faith discussions with the European Commission over several months,"" Nanna-Louise Linde, vice president of European government affairs at Microsoft, said in a statement.

""We believe that they represent a clear and complete resolution to the concerns raised by our competitors and will provide European customers with more choices.""

The EU has been scrutinizing Microsoft's tying of Teams with its popular Office productivity suite following a legal claim made by workplace messaging app Slack in 2020 that the bundle represented an abuse of market power.

Slack was acquired by Salesforce for $27.7 billion in 2021.

Sabastian Niles, Salesforce's president and chief legal officer, said the European Commission's announcement Friday ""further affirms that Microsoft's anticompetitive practices with Teams have harmed competition and require a binding, enforceable, and effective remedy.""

""We will carefully scrutinize Microsoft's proposed commitments,"" he added.

Microsoft previously made a pledge to unbundle Teams from Office in 2023, offering to sell Microsoft 365 without the chat and videoconferencing service at a discounted price. It then expanded on that move globally with an offer to sell the two products separately.

Friday's news marks an attempt by the Redmond, Washington-based tech titan to end the EU dispute and avert a potential hefty antitrust fine.

Chinese trade envoy Li Chenggang described talks with the U.S. as ""good"" after their first high-level engagement in Switzerland on May 12 led to a thawing in trade tensions. However, both sides have continued to trade thinly veiled swipes.

When asked by CNBC whether the dialogues were constructive, Li, who met U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Trade Ministerial meeting in Jeju on Thursday, answered, ""definitely,"" without giving further details or clues on forthcoming meetings between the two sides.

Li told reporters that he had no information on whether there would be a meeting or a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.

On the same day, He Yongqian, spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce, struck a similar restrained tone, offering no new details on the trade talks during a daily press briefing that began an hour later than usual.

Trump had touted earlier this week that he might speak to Xi at the end of this week, while Beijing appeared tight-lipped on that prospect. Analysts expect direct engagement between the two leaders would likely indicate more meaningful progress in talks.

The first round of negotiations in Geneva was cheered in Beijing as vindication for China's uncompromising response to Trump's tariffs.

Both sides agreed to temporarily lower duties to allow more time to negotiate a more permanent deal while putting in place a ""communication mechanism"" on economic and trade issues.

The tariff reprieve also somewhat brightened China's economic outlook, prompting some economists to raise this year's growth forecast.

Despite the tariff truce, both sides have continued to take swipes at each other in other areas, underscoring the fragility of the strained ties.

The U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security Tuesday warned companies not to use Huawei's Ascent AI chips, drawing criticism from Beijing, calling it an act of ""abusing export control measures.""

China's foreign ministry on Friday toughened its tone a notch, decrying the U.S.'s ""long-arm jurisdiction,"" saying China will ""never accept it.""

Meanwhile, China is keeping a firm grip on its export controls on critical minerals. Rare earth minerals, which are crucial to the U.S. industry, are viewed by Beijing as an effective leverage in its trade negotiations with the Trump administration.

China's Commerce Ministry, in a statement earlier this week, urged local authorities to clamp down on the smuggling of rare earths.

China started blocking exports of several rare earth metals on April 4 in retaliation for Donald Trump's ""liberation day"" tariffs.

Companies that want to export these items need to obtain approval from China's commerce ministry. At least four rare earth magnet producers have obtained such export permits, including suppliers to German automaker Volkswagen, Reuters reported.

When asked about the rare earth controls during the regular press conference Thursday, China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said it did not have any information to provide.

Beijing could be overestimating the importance of rare earth minerals to the Trump administration, said Dennis Wilder, a former senior White House intelligence official. Wilder currently serves as a senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University.

""If China overplays this card, the United States will find other ways to get rare earths,"" he said, naming Canada as an alternative source.

He added that Chinese leadership also underestimated the need to pledge more forceful measures to crack down on the fentanyl flows.

Separately, Nicholas Burns, America's former ambassador to Beijing, said on Wednesday that ""there is going to be a price to pay"" if China fails to cooperate on the fentanyl issue.

The upcoming negotiations are ""high-stake"" for Beijing as China ""has more to lose"" if the tariff suspension expires, Neo Wang, lead China economist and strategist at Evercore ISI, said in a note on Monday.

Wang said he expects Beijing would seek to ""please Trump in a way that benefits the Republican party in the midterm election"" next year. These include promises to ramp up purchases of U.S. goods or increase its investment in the U.S.

If Chinese officials determine that a broader trade deal is unlikely, they may instead prioritize resolving the 20% levies linked to fentanyl by making concessions on fentanyl enforcement and TikTok's sales in the U.S., which Wang described as Trump's ""real target.""

ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — If the Arab Gulf states were to hold a popularity contest right now, President Donald Trump would be the prom king.

The 45th and 47th president of the United States was greeted with spectacular fanfare in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates during his 4-day visit to the region.

In Riyadh, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman broke royal protocol by personally greeting the president on the tarmac. Trump's motorcade from Qatar's Doha airport was flanked by bright red Tesla cybertrucks and riders on horseback. And in Abu Dhabi, UAE leader Mohammed bin Zayed awarded his American counterpart with the Order of Zayed Award, the nation's highest civil honor.

As if that wasn't enough, a parade of royal camels welcomed Trump outside the Amiri Diwan, Qatar's presidential office. Speaking to Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, Trump made it clear he was impressed.

""As a construction guy, this is perfect marble,"" Trump said, gesturing to the walls and columns of the palace. ""This is what they call perfecto. We appreciate those camels,"" he added. ""I haven't seen camels like that in a long time. And really, we appreciate it very much.""

The optics of the U.S. leader's Middle East visit were strong, showcasing the larger-than-life opulence of the region's richest petrostates — and how much of that wealth they are willing to spend to deepen their ties with the U.S. and advance their own economic agendas.

The numbers are historic. Qatar and the U.S. agreed on a $1.2 trillion ""economic exchange""; Saudia Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the U.S., and major projects were signed with the United Arab Emirates, after Abu Dhabi in March committed to a 10-year, $1.4 trillion investment framework in the U.S.

There remains some doubt as to whether those numbers are realistic, especially during a period of low oil prices and weaker revenue for crude-producing countries. And some of the deals, like Qatar's record order of 210 Boeing jets and Saudi Arabia's $142 billion arms deal with the U.S. — the largest weapons deal ever inked — will likely take decades to pan out.

But the message was clear: the Gulf states want to be first in line when it comes to partnering with the U.S., whether it be for business, military, or tech.

""The Gulf has always gotten along better with business-first presidents, and President Trump fits that mold perfectly,"" Tarik Solomon, board member and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Saudi Arabia, told CNBC.

""He still symbolizes fast money, big defense, and access to American tech. So, if cozying up to him helps secure a seat at the table of the next world order, the Gulf is bringing the gold-plated chair.""

Some observers suggested the three Gulf countries were competing with one another for Trump's affection. But many in the region say it's more of a long-term, strategic alignment.

""I do not view the big economic announcements as a competition among the three countries; rather, they reflect a competition with other regions — Europe for example — for a closer relation with the U.S. administration,"" said Ahmed Rashad, an Abu Dhabi-based assistant professor of economics at the Economic Research Forum.

""The economic deals appear vital to increase the attractiveness of the Middle East visit. On the other hand, the primary motive of the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] countries appears to be strengthening relations with the U.S. and securing access to advanced technologies,"" Rashad said.

The bromance vibes were real in Saudi Arabia in particular, where Trump and Mohammed bin Salman heaped praise on each other in remarks made during the U.S.-Saudi Investment Summit. The event, held in the opulent Ritz-Carlton Riyadh, was attended by scores of top American CEOs including the likes of Tesla's Elon Musk, Nvidia's Jensen Huang and BlackRock's Larry Fink, to name a few.

In the UAE, meanwhile, Trump and Emirati leader Mohammed bin Zayed lauded their personal friendship and the more than 50-year alliance between their countries. The visit was the first by an American president to the UAE since George W. Bush visited the sheikhdom in 2008.

The warm body language and free-flowing mutual compliments signified a stark difference in tone from visits to the country by officials from the Biden administration, which were peppered with tension.

The UAE already appears to be reaping rewards from the shift in approach. Recent reports say the U.S. has a preliminary agreement with the UAE to allow it to import, for the first time, 500,000 of Nvidia's H100 chips per year — the most advanced chips the American company produces. This would accelerate the desert sheikhdom's ability to the build data centers needed to power its AI models.

""Trump's trip to the Gulf reflects the increasing personalization of geopolitics,"" said Taufiq Rahim, principal at 2040 Advisory and author of ""Trump 2.5: A Primer.""

""The region's leaders have responded accordingly, putting on an ornate display for the visiting president. Flattery and compliments become as important to the announcement and substance of deals.""

The longer-term question, Rahim noted, centers on the viability of the investments.

""For example, how many data centers are even needed? In an effort to be the 'biggest', the outlay by each country may actually create excess supply that surpasses demand in certain sectors,"" he said.

Shoot-for-the-moon pledges are still the right strategy according to the American Chamber of Commerce's Solomon — whether each dollar comes through over the next several years is a matter that can be dealt with later.

""Sure, a lot of it is theater,"" he said. ""But in this region, signaling ambition is half the game. Even if only 50% sticks, it's still an impactful play.""

Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that Tarik Solomon is the former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Saudi Arabia.

BEIJING — Alibaba, Tencent and JD.com reported earnings this week that not only reflected improving Chinese consumer spending, but also the growing benefits of artificial intelligence in advertising.

E-commerce giant Alibaba said late Thursday its Taobao and Tmall group sales rose by 9% year on year to 101.37 billion yuan ($13.97 billion) for the three months ended March 31. That's above the 97.94 billion yuan predicted by a FactSet analyst poll, and the quarterly growth figure was well above the 3% segment increase for the 12-month period ending March 31.

""The e-commerce and ad revenues were positive surprises as there were expectations tariffs would affect consumer behavior,"" Kai Wang, Asia equity market strategist at Morningstar, said in an email regarding the three companies' earnings results.

It's important to note the earnings releases cover only the period before U.S.-China tensions escalated in April with new tariffs of more than 100% on products from both countries — an effective trade embargo. The two countries issued a rare joint statement Monday announcing a 90-day reduction in most of the recently added tariffs.

The U.S.-China trade dispute since April has negatively affected consumption to some extent, given the increased uncertainty for small and medium-sized businesses, Charlie Chen, managing director and head of Asia research at China Renaissance Securities, said Friday. He expects that as trade tensions ease, consumption will rise.

But despite lackluster consumption overall, sales of certain electronics and home appliances have done well since last year thanks to China's trade-in subsidies for supporting such consumer spending.

JD.com on Tuesday said its sales of for that category surged by 17% from a year ago. Overall, the e-commerce company reported a 16.3% increase in revenue from its retail business to 263.85 billion yuan in the three months ended March 31. That was better than the 226.84 billion yuan in retail segment sales predicted by a FactSet poll.

On Wednesday, Tencent said its ""fintech and business services"" segment, a proxy for consumer-related business transactions, reported a 5% year-on-year revenue increase to 54.9 billion yuan in the first quarter.

While Nomura analysts said that segment revenue growth was in line with estimates, they pointed out in a note that ""Tencent ads was a big outperformer in the Chinese ads industry despite the challenging macro environment.""

Tencent's marketing services revenue surged by 20% to 31.9 billion yuan, helped by ""robust advertiser demand"" for short videos and other content inside its WeChat social media app. Tencent noted ""ongoing AI upgrades"" to its advertising platform.

AI is helping Tencent lift its click-through rates — a measure of success for online ads — to nearly 3%, company management said on an earnings call Wednesday, according to a FactSet transcript. That's up sharply from a 0.1% click-through rate for banner ads historically, and around 1% for feed ads, the company said.

Combined monthly average users for WeChat, known as Weixin in China, topped 1.4 billion in the first quarter for the first time. The app offers one of two major mobile payment systems used in mainland China.

Many coffee shops and online retailers also use mini-apps in WeChat for customers to place orders. Tencent said Thursday that its e-commerce operations had grown so large it was now a new unit within WeChat.

""AI ads improve efficiency and algorithm, which should translate into better targeting towards consumers even if macro conditions are not optimal,"" Morningstar's Wang said. ""It is still a bit early to quantify how much incremental benefit AI ads bring compared to non-AI ads, but we have seen some monetization from AI-driven ads.""

JD said its marketing revenues climbed by 15.7% to 22.32 billion yuan for the quarter, also partly attributing that rise to AI tools.

On an earnings call Tuesday, JD management said its advertising research and development team is using large language models to improve ad conversion rates and accelerate ad revenue growth. The company added it is implementing AI tools that enable merchants to ""execute complex ad campaigns"" with a simple command.

Advertisers have long sought ways to target ads at the consumers most likely to make a purchase.

On Wednesday, YouTube announced that advertisers can use Google's Gemini AI model to target ads to viewers when they are most engaged with a video.

Alibaba noted that marketing revenue, which it calls ""customer management,"" grew 12% year on year to nearly $10 billion thanks in part to increased use of the company's AI tool for boosting merchants' marketing efficiency, Quanzhantui.

However, Alibaba's overall profit was only about half of what analysts had predicted, sending shares down by nearly 7.6% in subsequent the U.S. trading session.

China is set to release retail sales data for April on Monday. Analysts polled by Reuters predict a 5.5% year-on-year increase in retail sales for April, down slightly from 5.9% growth in March.

A Morgan Stanley survey from April 8 to 11, conducted immediately after the escalation in U.S.-China tensions, found that consumer confidence fell to a 2.5-year low, and 44% of respondents were concerned about job losses — the highest since 2020 when the survey began. Only 23% of consumers expect to spend more in the next quarter, the survey found, an 8 percentage point drop from the prior quarter.

Lackluster domestic demand persisted in April, with a 0.1% year-on-year drop in the consumer price index for the month — the third-straight month of decline. However, when excluding food and energy prices, the so-called core CPI rose by 0.5%, the same pace as in March.

Since the real estate market has yet to recover, and exports are restricted by geopolitics, Chen expects Chinese policymakers to focus on boosting consumption in order to achieve the year's growth target of around 5%.

He expects related stimulus policies to include boosting spending on food and beverage, caregiving, travel, sports, and durable goods not yet included in the trade-in subsidies program.

June 18 marks the next major promotional season for shopping in China.

""I think we're going to get a pretty good 618. Now obviously, we're not dealing with 30% year-on-year growth anymore like we were in the first 10 years"" of the shopping festival, Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, told CNBC earlier this week. The company helps foreign brands — such as Vitamix and IS Clinical — sell online in China and other parts of Asia.

He predicts 618 sales growth will rise by ""very low double-digits.""

Cartier owner Richemont on Friday posted better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, as the wealthiest spenders continued to shrug off global macroeconomic uncertainty.

Revenues at the Swiss luxury group rose 7% year-on-year at constant exchange rates to 5.17 billion euros ($5.79 billion) in the three months to the end of March, above the 4.98 billion euros forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll.

Shares closed up 6.9%. London time to trade at the top of the Stoxx 600.

The fourth-quarter sales bump was led by double-digit growth at the group's Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and Buccellati.

Sales nevertheless declined within the company's specialist watchmakers segment, which features brands Piaget and Roger Dubuis, led by weakness in the Asia-Pacific region.

Full-year sales rose 4% to 21.4 billion euros, up on the previous year and just ahead of analyst expectations of 21.34 billion euros.

Sales rose annually across all regions, except Asia Pacific (ex. Japan) — the company's largest market — where declines were led by a 23% drop in China. Japan led annual sales growth, up 25% at actual exchange rates, buoyed by ""strong domestic and tourist spend"" and a weak Japanese Yen.

""The Group's performance was robust overall, driven by remarkable growth at our Jewellery Maisons and retail, and improved momentum at our 'Other' activities,"" Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert said in a statement. The company's so-called ""other"" segment includes its pre-owned watch retailer Watchfinder & Co.

The chairman nevertheless added that ongoing global uncertainties would continue to require ""strong agility and discipline.""

BofA Global Research said in a note last week that Richemont faces three key global headwinds: gold prices, U.S. tariffs and foreign exchange fluctuations, by way of the strength of the Swiss Franc and the weakness of the U.S. dollar.

However, the bank's analysts added that the company's pricing power could provide a tailwind.

""We think price will cover half the headwinds,"" they wrote. ""Pricing, product mix and higher capacity utilization are the most obvious offsets.""

Richemont had previously reported its ""highest ever"" quarterly sales figure in January at 6.2 billion euros, even as China demand weighed.

The earnings had, at the time, been taken as a signal of a wider turnaround in the beleaguered luxury sector. However, the specter of U.S. trade tariffs and subsequent macroeconomic uncertainty have threatened to once again hit consumer confidence and discretionary spending globally.

Plagued with lawsuits and allegations of harming users' mental health, especially that of children, social media sensation TikTok is turning to meditation to promote wellness and deter late-night doomscrolling.

TikTok said Thursday that it was launching in-app guided meditation exercises and other well-being features aimed at young users.

The company, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, said it began testing the new meditation exercises with select teens earlier this year and will now make them available to users of all ages.

TikTok said that the meditation feature, aimed at improving sleep quality, is triggered during ""sleep hours"" and will be turned on by default for users under the age of 18. 

If these young users are on the app after 10 p.m., their ""For You"" feed will be interrupted by the guided meditation exercise. If a teen continues to use TikTok after the first reminder, the company will show a second full-screen meditation prompt. 

The meditation app was teased earlier this week along with other features, such as new educational feeds, online safety tools and enhanced parental controls over screen time. 

TikTok's recent focus on promoting healthier digital habits for young users comes amid public pressure and a slew of lawsuits concerning the platform's impact on young users. 

A bipartisan group of more than a dozen state attorneys general last year filed lawsuits against TikTok related to the app's effects on young users. 

One such suit from Attorney General Brian Schwalb of the District of Columbia alleged that TikTok was intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to kids, posing profound risks including depression, anxiety, sleep loss and body dysmorphia.

A TikTok spokesperson previously told CNBC that the lawsuit ignored proactive measures that the platform has voluntarily implemented to support community safety and well-being.

Social psychologists have also advocated banning the app, warning that TikTok and other social platforms can cause mental health issues for children, adolescents, and young adults. 

The social media platform briefly went offline in the U.S. in January, after the Supreme Court upheld a law to ban it unless its Chinese parent company ByteDance sold its stake in the app. 

However, U.S. President Donald Trump used an executive order to keep the platform running, and again delayed the enforcement of that ban last month. Its long-term status remains undecided, with ByteDance's new deadline to divest set for mid-June.

While Congress's ban of TikTok has been focused on the app's Chinese ownership and data and privacy concerns, governments have also begun to target TikTok and other social media over their perceived ill effect on young users. 

In November, Australia's parliament passed a bill banning social media platforms from allowing users under 16 to access their services, threatening fines of up to AU$ $50 million (£22.2 million).

In the U.S., TikTok says that users must be at least 13 years old to create an account, though there is a separate under-13 TikTok experience that offers additional safeguards.

The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission filed a civil lawsuit against TikTok and ByteDance in August, accusing them of collecting personal information from children under the age of 13 and having insufficient policies and processes for identifying and deleting accounts created by children.

TikTok and ByteDance didn't immediately respond to requests for comments.

On Thursday, TikTok said it was also making a $2.3 million donation in ad credits to 31 mental health organizations in 22 countries around the world as part of its ""Mental Health Education Fund.""

Bitcoin BTC$104,333.91 bulls face a $120 million resistance challenge as they look to extend the classic ""stair-step"" uptrend, or periodic controlled move higher, order book data show.

Since April 9, bitcoin has climbed about 38%, advancing from around $75,000 to $104,000 as trade tensions eased and major market participants deployed capital.

This rally can be described as a classic stair-step pattern: Initial bullish impulses are followed by periods of consolidation, which set the stage for the next upward move.

For example, the initial increase from $75,000 encountered range-bound trading between $83,000 and $85,000. The subsequent step higher faced consolidation between $92,000 and $96,000.

Similarly, since May 10, prices have oscillated mainly between $101,000 and $105,000, marking consolidation following the step into six figure territory.

From here, advancing to the next phase of gains will require bulls to chew through a substantial number of sell orders at around $105,000, posing a significant resistance barrier.

Sell orders worth nearly $50 million were open at $104,800 across major exchanges in addition to the $70 million in selling pressure at $105,000, according to data source Kiyotaka.ai.

The analytics platform tracks the order book heat map by pulling order book data from spot trading on Binance, Bitstamp, Bybt, Coinbase and OKX and perpetual futures trading on Binance, Bybit and OKX.

An open order placed above the current market price is usually a sell order. These can be called limit sell orders, setting the minimum price that sellers are willing to accept. When the spot price reaches this level, the order may be executed, allowing the seller to sell at or above that level.

The chart shows that the global aggregated order book is relatively stacked at higher price levels, hinting at potential profit taking as prices approach lifetime highs.

Macro indicators and technical momentum indicators suggest the path of least resistance is on the higher side, meaning sooner or later bulls will absorb the selling pressure, lifting valuations to record highs.

In other words, these sell walls won't be there forever.

SkyBridge Capital Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci has weighed in on what it would take for Bitcoin to reach $1 million.

Cryptocurrency regulations play a critical role in Scaramucci's analysis.

President Donald Trump's involvement in the industry has threatened to derail the progress of cryptocurrency bills.

Amid a market resurgence in recent weeks, investors in Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, have grown increasingly optimistic and $1 million price predictions are again flooding headlines. Recently, SkyBridge Capital Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci has weighed in on what it would take for the asset to achieve this seemingly far-flung dream.

In an interview with prominent market commentator Anthony Pompliano last week, Scaramucci said there will need to be more buy-in from market players with trillions of dollars in capital, particularly sovereign wealth funds, for Bitcoin's price to hit the $1 million mark.

“If you want to see a million dollar Bitcoin, that's when somebody at a sovereign says, Okay, this is part of the infrastructure of the world's financial services architecture, a result of which I have to own some of this property,” he said.

Sovereign wealth funds are state-owned investment funds typically fueled by excess revenue. Norway boasts the largest sovereign wealth fund, with $1.74 trillion in assets. According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, there are about 100 sovereign wealth funds holding about $13.75 trillion in total.

While a few of these funds already boast some Bitcoin exposure, most remain on the sidelines.

The sovereign wealth funds with known Bitcoin exposure include Bhutan's Druk Holding and Investment with over 12,000 BTC worth about $1.24 billion, Wisconsin Board of Commissioner of Public Lands with 6 million shares of BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT currently worth nearly $351 million and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Co. with 8.2 million IBIT shares worth $479 million. Meanwhile, Norway's fund has indirect exposure to the asset through investments in firms such as Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) and Strategy.

Scaramucci said U.S. cryptocurrency regulations were critical to get sovereign wealth funds to go all in on Bitcoin.

“There'll be large blocks of buying or people worth 10, 20, $30 trillion buying a half a billion dollars of Bitcoin, buying a billion dollars of Bitcoin,” he said, citing a future where the U.S. has established clear rules for stablecoins, cryptocurrency asset custody and tokenization.

Just two weeks ago, the cryptocurrency industry seemed well on its way to gaining these long-clamored-for regulations that could further legitimize the asset class in the world's largest economy. However, in the past week, growing concerns over President Donald Trump‘s involvement in the space have threatened to derail the progress.

Last week, a stablecoin bill that had been making quick progress in the Senate failed to obtain the required votes as several Senate Democrats pulled support at the last minute. Similarly, the House could not hold a joint committee hearing on a cryptocurrency market structure bill after Democrats staged a walkout.

The legislative focus has shifted to a probe of Trump's cryptocurrency ventures. A bill has also been introduced to ban senior government officials from creating or promoting cryptocurrencies.

Despite these regulatory hiccups, the cryptocurrency market is holding strong as broader risk sentiment improves on cooling trade tensions. As of last look, Bitcoin was trading at $103,000, an increase of more than 9% in the past seven days.

As of today, customers can pay with Bitcoin at Steak 'n Shake locations across the U.S., thanks to full Lightning Network integration. 

Steak ‘n Shake has officially launched Bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network, following the announcement reported on May 9. At the time, the fast food chain teased its plans to integrate BTC, generating excitement across the Bitcoin community. And today, it is an option at the cash register, or better said, Bitcoin Register. 

JUST IN: Fast food giant Steak 'n Shake is now officially accepting #Bitcoin Lightning Network payments ⚡️pic.twitter.com/bvGCb9r4Im

As of today, customers can pay for their meals with Bitcoin at Steak ‘n Shake locations across the United States. This marks a major step in mainstream Bitcoin adoption, as the chain serves over 100 million customers annually and now gives them the option to use Lightning for instant, low-fee transactions. 

The company announced the news on X this morning, confirming that Lightning Network payments are officially supported in-store.

Following up, they clarified the scale of the implementation—this isn't a small test or pilot program. It's a full rollout across their system.

The Lightning Network, Bitcoin's second-layer solution, is designed for fast, scalable, and low-cost payments, making it ideal for point-of-sale purchases like burgers and fries. Steak ‘n Shake customers can now scan a Lightning QR code at checkout using any supported wallet, completing transactions in seconds. The system uses a backend payment processor to handle real-time conversion to USD, ensuring stability and ease of use for both the customer and the merchant.

In Bitcoin Magazine's previous coverage, the significance of even the hint of this move was noted, and now that it's official, it confirms Steak ‘n Shake as one of the first major fast food brands to fully embrace Bitcoin through Lightning. This goes beyond the occasional “Bitcoin accepted here” sign; this is a practical, streamlined payment option that reflects a commitment to Bitcoin integration. 

With tools like the Lightning Network making payments faster and more accessible, Steak ‘n Shake is positioning itself at the forefront of a shift toward practical, everyday BTC utility.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum Price Forecast: Pectra Propelled ETH Near $3,000, But Can The Rally Continue?","https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/ethereum-price-forecast-pectra-propelled-eth-near-3000-but-can-the-rally-continue-1519658","Fri, 16 May 2025 16:01:00 GMT","

The price currently sits at $2,576 and surged to $2,750 at some point this week.

Pectra makes ETH a deflationary coin by burning a portion of the network's gas fees. In addition, it makes layer-two protocols like Arbitrum more efficient by increasing the number of blobs per ETH block from 6 to 9.

Ethereum developers expect that Pectra will make the smart contracts blockchain more scalable, faster, and cheaper to use.

The upgrade aims to solve some of the issues that have allowed competing networks like Solana and Sui to thrive and attract significant transaction volumes.

However, Ethereum is still the largest of these networks by total value locked (TVL) and stablecoin reserves.

In addition, the network is also the most decentralized option compared to its rivals. This is a key competitive edge that has allowed Ethereum to maintain its lead in this space as decentralization reduces the risk of 51% attacks.

For a few weeks, we have been sharing an Ethereum price prediction based on a historical pattern of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) that has always been followed by strong rallies for ETH.

As we predicted initially, a bullish breakout of the token's consolidation rectangle would lead to a retest of its former trend line support at $3,000.

The trajectory of the price has followed this prediction almost to the letter thus far but we are still 16.1% away from the target.

So, does ETH have enough fuel in the tank to rally to $3,000? At first glance, an overbought RSI may be considered a warning signal that the rally has gone too far too fast.

However, as these same historical patterns show, this is not the first time that the RSI has gotten this high and it does not necessarily mean that the price cannot move any higher.

If history repeats, or at least rhymes, the rally can still keep going even if the RSI starts to drop. This means that ETH could still reach that $3,000 target in the near term and could go even higher if FOMO kicks in as this is a major psychological threshold.

Zooming in on the latest price action, the rally has accelerated after a golden cross between the 21-day and 200-day EMAs. Meanwhile, ETH has also moved above the 200-day EMA, meaning that the long-term price trend is now bullish.

The next catalyst that could propel ETH to much higher levels – even beyond $3,000 – would be a golden cross between the short-term EMAs and the 200-day EMA. The last time this happened, the rally accelerated and made a new all-time high just a month later.

The next key resistance to watch stands at $2,800. Back in February, the price experienced significant selling pressure when it got to this level.

Interestingly, the Fear and Greed Index back then stood at around 76. Not too far from where it is right now at 69. Investors should stay safe in these stretched conditions and avoid being overly greedy as most technical indicators are flashing warning signals that the market may have gotten ahead of itself already.

Although a push to the $3,000 level seems like a done deal at this point, it would be a good idea to start taking some profits off the table as a strong correction may occur at any point to shake off some excess leverage.

An unidentified wallet made a major on-chain move by withdrawing 13,800 ETH from the leading cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., Coinbase. Based on current prices, this withdrawal is the equivalent of $35.26 million. Soon after, the same address repaid a portion of its outstanding ETH loan on Aave.

The wallet, labeled ""0x2b0aD,"" used the funds to repay variable-rate Ethereum debt borrowed against cBTC, a version of Bitcoin wrapped on the Coinbase platform. The blockchain data shows that 13,750 ETH of the loan token was burned and about 13,800 ETH were sent back to Aave's lending pool.

However, this repayment is only partial. Having sent back a large amount of ETH, the wallet still has an open debt of 32,377.6 WETH, valued at around $82.61 million.

Whether this move signals a wider deleveraging strategy or a short-term adaptation will become clearer over time. Either way, it reduces the account's exposure and improves its collateral position, possibly as a way to manage volatility or prepare for further changes in the market.

Ethereum (ETH) is making a comeback after months of underperformance. At the time of writing on Friday, it hovers above$2,500 after soaring nearly 100% since early April's bottom. 

The Pectra upgrade has seen swift adoption, with more than 11,000 EIP-7702 authorizations already processed in a week, indicating healthy uptake by wallets and Decentralized Applications (dApps).  

Additionally, the surge in stablecoin activity, rising institutional adoption of Ethereum Layer 2 networks, and an unwind of ETH short positions fuel renewed market optimism. To understand whether this rally has staying power, FXStreet spoke with several crypto experts for their insights.

Ethereum's latest major network upgrade, Pectra, went live on May 7, marking a significant step forward for the ecosystem. Within just a week of its activation, over 5,520 transactions and 11,055 authorizations have been processed under the new framework, according to Dune data — signaling strong adoption by wallets and dApps.

Building on the momentum of last year's Dencun upgrade, Ethereum's Pectra update delivers critical enhancements across usability, scalability, and staking infrastructure. 

In an exclusive interview, Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, told FXStreet that, ""Ethereum's Pectra upgrade, which brought features like gasless transactions and session-based permissions, unlocks powerful capabilities and could bring the next wave of users! If wallets are able to tackle the challenge of turning Ethereum's complexity into something intuitive — clear approvals, familiar login flows, and built-in safety checks, we move closer to Web3 that feels less like developer tooling and more like consumer software. Pectra cuts Layer 2 fees, and this could trigger a new wave of on-chain activity. Wallets can scale infrastructure and offer users faster transaction confirmation, better bridging between L1 and L2, and seamless dApp interactions. Performance, not just features, becomes a key differentiator here.""

Ethereum price soared nearly 100% from April's low of $1,385 to May 13's high of $2,738, despite lagging behind BTC and other Layer 1 earlier in the cycle.

Bernstein analysts, led by Gautam Chhugani, identified three key drivers behind Ethereum's recent price rally. First, a surge in stablecoin adoption and asset tokenization has reignited interest in Ethereum's role as foundational infrastructure, highlighted by Stripe's $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge and Meta's renewed push into stablecoins. 

The graph below by DefiLama shows that Ethereum currently hosts nearly 51% of the total stablecoin supply, making it the prime platform benefiting from this trend.

Second, Ethereum's Layer 2 networks are becoming integral to institutional crypto infrastructure. Platforms like Base are generating substantial revenue, as shown in the graph below, and Robinhood's acquisition of WonderFi signals a potential expansion into tokenized equities using Ethereum-based systems.

Lastly, hedge funds that previously shorted ETH to hedge long positions in Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) are now reversing those trades. As Ethereum's fundamentals strengthen and the market narrative shifts in its favor, the unwinding of these shorts has added further upward pressure to ETH's price.

Moreover, Derive.xyz analyst told FXStreet that ETH has a 20% chance of exceeding $4,000 by Christmas (up from 9% last week) and a 12% chance of hitting $5,000. The chance of ETH falling below $1,500 by Christmas has dropped to 15% (down from 40%).

The weekly chart shows that Ethereum broke above the descending trendline (drawn by connecting multiple weekly highs since mid-December) in the first week of May, rallying 39% and closing above its 200-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2,243. Ethereum continues its gains by 3.26% so far this week, and when writing on Friday, it trades above $2,500.

Looking at technical indicators, bullish momentum is gaining traction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 53 and points upward on the weekly chart, indicating slight bullish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is showing a bullish crossover this week, further supporting the bullish thesis, giving a buy signal and indicating an upward trend.

If ETH continues its upward move, it could extend the rally to retest the 50% Fibonacci retracement (drawn from the December high of $4,107 to the April low of $1,385) at $2,746. A successful weekly close above this level could extend additional gains to test the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,067.

However, if ETH breaks and closes below its 200-week EMA at $2,243 on a weekly basis, it could extend the decline to retest its psychological importance level at $2,000.

To gain more insight, FXStreet interviewed some experts in the crypto markets. Their answers are stated below:

Q: How critical is Ethereum's dominance in stablecoins to its long-term valuation?

It's a major pillar of Ethereum's moat, especially as stablecoins underpin much of onchain activity. If Solana or other chains start to gain significant stablecoin share, it could undermine Ethereum's perceived dominance, but the L2 vs L1 value split complicates the picture — most burn still comes from L1 activity, even though the roadmap has long planned for L2s to scale throughput.

Q: Can Ethereum compete with Bitcoin as a store of value, or should it focus solely on utility?

Ethereum doesn't need to choose. Its edge lies in being a hybrid — a utility asset powering onchain economies and a technological store of value backed by ongoing innovation. That combination is hard to replicate and remains compelling for long-term believers.

Q: Is Ethereum the clear winner in real-world asset tokenization infrastructure?

Right now, yes. Over 80% of tokenized assets live on Ethereum or its L2s, driven by institutional trust and tooling maturity. But as usage moves toward DeFi, cost and UX will matter more, opening the door for competition and L2s if Ethereum doesn't keep executing on the scaling.

Q: What drives Ethereum's recent 100% rally since April — fundamentals or positioning?

Ethereum's recent rally appears more positioning-driven than fundamentally led. While the Pectra upgrade introduced meaningful improvements in scalability, staking economics, and UX (via EIPs 7251, 7702, and 7623), these changes are still in the early phase of being priced in. The real catalyst seems to be a mix of technical exhaustion, with ETH/BTC at decade lows, combined with a sentiment shift sparked by leadership messaging and a visible crypto-native rotation. ETF flows remain minimal, underscoring that this move is largely driven by intra-crypto positioning rather than institutional inflows.

Q: How critical is Ethereum's dominance in stablecoins to its long-term valuation?

Ethereum's role as the dominant settlement layer for stablecoins is foundational to its long-term relevance. However, that lead is being tested by more performant chains like Solana. Ultimately, Ethereum's ability to maintain composability, serve as a final settlement layer, and host institutional-grade stablecoins — including potential sovereign-backed ones like a KRW stablecoin — will be key to long-term value accrual. Dominance in stablecoin issuance matters, but it's Ethereum's settlement layer stickiness that will determine its staying power.

Q: How much upside does Ethereum gain from Layer 2 adoption and revenue growth?

L2 adoption is a critical unlock for Ethereum, enabling scalability without compromising decentralization. EIP-4844 and the Pectra upgrade further reduce L2 costs via blobspace expansion, but the key issue now is value capture. ETH must prove it can retain meaningful revenue and validator incentives in a world where L2s settle cheaply. While L2s act as distribution channels, recent L1 revenue drops post-Dencun show that Ethereum's financial sustainability needs recalibration to match this scaling success

Q: What are the main risks to Ethereum's current price momentum?

Ethereum faces several headwinds: regulatory uncertainty around ETF staking and broader compliance issues, weakening validator economics from declining L1 revenues, and the persistent concern that L2s may not contribute enough to ETH burn or value accrual. If the base layer's security budget erodes, validator participation and decentralization could suffer. Meanwhile, unless Ethereum finds a way to sustainably monetize the L2 boom, momentum may stall despite strong adoption metrics.



Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain with smart contracts functionality. Its native currency Ether (ETH), is the second-largest cryptocurrency and number one altcoin by market capitalization. The Ethereum network is tailored for building crypto solutions like decentralized finance (DeFi), GameFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), etc.

Ethereum is a public decentralized blockchain technology, where developers can build and deploy applications that function without the need for a central authority. To make this easier, the network leverages the Solidity programming language and Ethereum virtual machine which helps developers create and launch applications with smart contract functionality.

Smart contracts are publicly verifiable codes that automates agreements between two or more parties. Basically, these codes self-execute encoded actions when predetermined conditions are met.

Staking is a process of earning yield on your idle crypto assets by locking them in a crypto protocol for a specified duration as a means of contributing to its security. Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism on September 15, 2022, in an event christened “The Merge.” The Merge was a key part of Ethereum's roadmap to achieve high-level scalability, decentralization and security while remaining sustainable. Unlike PoW, which requires the use of expensive hardware, PoS reduces the barrier of entry for validators by leveraging the use of crypto tokens as the core foundation of its consensus process.

Gas is the unit for measuring transaction fees that users pay for conducting transactions on Ethereum. During periods of network congestion, gas can be extremely high, causing validators to prioritize transactions based on their fees.

Since early April, the crypto market has experienced a notable rebound. Altcoins stand out in particular. While Bitcoin remains stagnant, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are indeed recording impressive gains. Enough to attract investors' attention! This dynamic raises a question: why are altcoins experiencing such an ascent?

Since early April, the market capitalization of altcoins has jumped nearly 100 billion dollars. Crypto assets such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are particularly notable, displaying exceptional performances.

ETH has even outperformed Bitcoin. This crypto asset recorded a 5% jump over the last 24 hours, compared to a modest fluctuation for BTC.

This dynamic occurs in a favorable macroeconomic context:

That's not all! Crypto ETFs are also showing mixed flows. In fact, Bitcoin ETFs are seeing outflows, while Ethereum ETFs are capturing net inflows. This reflects a shift of crypto investors' interest towards altcoins.

According to QCP Capital, this trend should continue. Especially as Coinbase's upcoming integration into the S&P 500 could further boost institutional attention on crypto.

The underperformance of Bitcoin has undeniably opened the way for a revaluation of altcoins. In particular, Ethereum seems to offer a clearer story to investors. This is not necessarily the case for BTC, whose role as a “store of value” seems less convincing today in a volatile crypto market environment.

According to several crypto experts, altcoins will continue to benefit from this dynamic. Some even predict short-term gains for well-known cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana.

The altcoin rebound certainly marks a new era for crypto assets. With impressive gains and short-term growth potential, these digital assets could well redefine the crypto market in the coming months. Stay tuned!

Ethereum faces risks as investors turn to Unilabs, a rising altcoin redefining crypto investment.

While the ETH token's performance has been impressive, the recent Ethereum price prediction signals great risks ahead. Therefore, investors are shifting their focus to a rapidly growing altcoin named Unilabs. This asset manager is creating a buzz in the crypto market with its exceptional tools that aim to redefine the investment process. 

Analysts believe that if this protocol continues to grow at this pace, it could even challenge Ethereum as the fastest growing altcoin of 2026. Let's discover more about this platform.

As the Ethereum price prediction uncovered the indecisiveness of investors for the ETH token, Unilabs is increasingly becoming the focal point of interest in the crypto industry. This DeFi asset manager is expected to challenge Ethereum, one of the most dominant crypto players, with its AI-powered tools.  

For instance, Unilabs Launchpad uses AI-driven real-time market analysis to point out ventures that could offer significant returns. By leveraging this tool, investors can not only keep track of potential emerging projects but can also gain access to opportunities that were previously limited to institutional investors. 

This protocol is also backed by advanced security measures and successfully manages over $30m in Assets Under Management (AUM). One standout feature of this fund is its portfolio management tool that allows investors to automatically align their portfolio with the prevailing market trends. 

In addition to this, Unilabs is currently offering four different types of fund options, such as BTC Fund, Mining Fund, AI Fund, and RWA Fund. This wide variety of funds will enable investors to enhance their exposure across the blockchain and DeFi space. 

Unilabs is experiencing rapid growth as its presale continues to make waves in the market by crossing over $300,000 in funding. The reason behind this explosive growth is the platform's exciting features, such as the Early Access Scoring System (EASS). 

By utilizing this feature, users could make well-informed and data backed investment decisions. This system uses a scoring mechanism that checks out potential projects on multiple levels to identify their profitability. 

Considering its smart features and fast expansion, industry analysts believe that Unilabs could be the fastest growing altcoin of the upcoming year.  

Ethereum (ETH) has been performing exceptionally well in the past couple of weeks, which has contributed to a massive 50% increase in its monthly performance. Ethereum price prediction revealed that with this enormous surge, the token has successfully managed to break above its prolonged descending channel. 

In the past week, the ETH token even surged up to $2,750 but afterwards faced a rejection. According to Ethereum price prediction, the token has to break above the next crucial resistance level at around $2,850 in order to confirm a bullish rally.

Additionally, the Ethereum Foundation's recent development of the Trillion Dollar Security Initiative is also sparking optimism around the ETH token. However, the recent Ethereum price prediction disclosed that despite these advancements, the token faced correction and fell to around $2,550.  

Along with this, the trade volume of the ETH token has also declined that could result in potential price reversal. Therefore, considering the Ethereum price prediction, crypto experts suggest Unilabs as the fastest growing altcoin of 2026 that could potentially outpace the ETH token. 

The recent Ethereum price prediction has revealed that even the most well-established coin like the ETH token could struggle to stay resilient amid market volatility. Meanwhile, Unilabs' increasing expansion is a testament to the growing confidence of investors in its data-backed, AI-driven approach to investment. 

This platform has successfully completed stage 1 of its presale and now the next round has started. Considering the rapid sell out, investors should act quickly and grab the UNIL token at just $0.0051 before the next price surge.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins to Buy Now That Experts Say Could Overtake Solana or AVAX","https://coincentral.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-now-that-experts-say-could-overtake-solana-or-avax/","Fri, 16 May 2025 12:30:49 GMT","

The crypto market is shifting again. While tokens like Solana and AVAX still hold strong positions, investors are now exploring newer altcoins with unique use cases and long-term potential. This change is not just about price swings. It's about what these projects actually offer.

In 2025, momentum is building behind coins that combine usability with clear development goals. Analysts are watching projects that go beyond hype. They are tracking coins tied to sectors like artificial intelligence, decentralized computing, and Ethereum infrastructure.

One of the tokens attracting early attention is Dawgz AI. It blends meme-style accessibility with real AI functionality. Built on Ethereum, it's gaining traction as investors look for practical alternatives to older narratives.

Investor attention in 2025 is moving toward altcoins with strong fundamentals and clear functionality. The hype around speculative meme coins is cooling as more people seek tokens backed by useful features and secure infrastructure. Many investors are tracking altcoins that offer actual services inside ecosystems such as decentralized finance, AI, or Layer-2 scalability. Projects that show growth in users, developer activity, and token utility are gaining stronger market positions.

According to CoinGecko, billions in daily trading volume now center around coins that provide something beyond basic tokenomics. Market data from CoinMarketCap also shows consistent increases in the total value locked (TVL) across DeFi-focused altcoins. This shift points to a preference for long-term use cases. Investors are placing capital into assets with staying power instead of chasing temporary hype cycles.

A key area drawing attention is Ethereum-based utility coins that integrate with tools people already use. Dawgz AI is one example of a token in this category. Other projects offering real-time data feeds, decentralized AI access, or blockchain-powered storage are also growing. Platforms like DefiLlama continue to highlight this pattern, showing where capital is flowing and which coins are retaining it.



Many altcoins in 2025 are focused on usability rather than appearance. Investors are paying closer attention to projects that function well across blockchain environments. Tokens built on Ethereum tend to attract long-term interest due to the network's reliability and proven security. This is especially true for new entrants combining Ethereum infrastructure with focused utility.

Dawgz AI has started to gain traction within this shift. It stands out as an Ethereum-based meme coin that uses artificial intelligence in real ways. While most meme tokens depend on social buzz alone, Dawgz AI introduces tools that serve a purpose within the community. It has raised over $3.5 million during its presale phase and has a total supply of 8.88 billion tokens at the current price of $0.004. The project has been audited for transparency, and its SolidProof verification confirms the code quality and contract security.

Instead of adding features like NFTs or chasing trends, Dawgz AI focuses on AI-based functionality and automation. Its roadmap includes integration with smart AI tools that may improve community engagement and project communication. Being built on Ethereum offers users access to secure transfers, compatibility with major wallets, and the support of an existing ecosystem. For crypto traders looking beyond hype-driven cycles, Dawgz AI represents a different type of meme coin—one that works like a utility token without pretending to be something else. Watch this video for further insights.



The altcoin market in 2025 is more data-driven than ever. Analysts at Forbes Digital Assets have noted a shift in institutional research toward utility-based tokens and infrastructure coins. Metrics like developer activity, transaction volume, and cross-chain performance often judge these projects. Instead of marketing campaigns, coins that offer consistent functionality and network integration are being tracked more closely.

A recent update from CoinDesk Markets highlights how blockchain tools used in AI, storage, and computation are seeing real traction. Projects that allow users to access services directly on-chain, it's data, automation, or computation, are now being prioritized. This includes tokens connected to Ethereum scalability, decentralized storage, and decentralized AI services. Coins that serve a technical purpose in these sectors are attracting longer attention spans.

Some of these tokens may not be widely known yet, but the underlying growth data is visible. Altcoins with active usage across dApps or developer frameworks often gain liquidity faster than passive coins. On-chain dashboards like Dune Analytics and DeFiLlama show this shift in real time. When adoption rises at the user level, value tends to follow. In this climate, a token like Dawgz AI—built for use rather than speculation—fits the kind of project many analysts are now monitoring.

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to interact with real-world data securely. It plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem by providing reliable data feeds to various decentralized applications. As per Binance, as of May 15, 2025, Chainlink's price is $17.17, with a market capitalization of approximately $11.29 billion.

The network's ability to connect smart contracts with off-chain data sources has made it an essential component in the DeFi space. Its widespread adoption across multiple blockchain platforms underscores its significance in the industry.

Chainlink's consistent performance and integration into various projects highlight its potential for sustained growth. Investors and developers alike continue to recognize its value in enabling complex smart contract functionalities.

Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to improve transaction speed and reduce costs. It achieves this by processing transactions off-chain before settling them on the Ethereum mainnet. As of May 15, 2025, Arbitrum's price stands at $0.4109, with a market capitalization of around $1.95 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

The platform has gained traction among developers seeking efficient and scalable solutions for their decentralized applications. Its compatibility with Ethereum's existing infrastructure makes it an attractive option for projects aiming to improve performance without compromising security.

Arbitrum's growing ecosystem and adoption indicate its potential to play a significant role in Ethereum's scalability roadmap. Its focus on user experience and developer-friendly tools contributes to its increasing popularity.

Render is a decentralized GPU rendering network that connects artists and studios with mining partners willing to rent their GPU capabilities. This model allows for efficient and cost-effective rendering of complex graphics. According to Binance, as of May 15, 2025, Render's price is $5.30, with a market capitalization of approximately $2.75 billion.

The platform addresses the growing demand for high-performance rendering services in industries such as gaming, virtual reality, and digital art. By leveraging blockchain technology, Render ensures transparency and fair compensation for all participants.

Render's innovative approach to distributed rendering positions it as a key player in the intersection of blockchain and digital content creation. Its ability to meet the needs of modern creators underscores its relevance in the growing digital market.

Altcoins that continue to perform well over time usually share a few critical traits. Analysts at CoinGecko point to developer activity, protocol stability, and open communication as strong indicators of future success. Projects that publish frequent updates, engage users directly, and maintain public roadmaps tend to build trust faster. This leads to more consistent demand across exchanges and communities.

A clear function also backs a reliable altcoin. Coins that help run smart contracts, store data, process off-chain information, or automate tasks in DeFi all play a specific role in the crypto economy. Many of these use cases appear in high-traffic platforms tracked by DefiLlama, where tokens with active utility also tend to maintain higher liquidity. Instead of riding hype, they gain traction through real activity.

For those looking for the best altcoins to buy now, utility is one of the strongest signals to watch. Tokens that serve a purpose in an existing ecosystem often grow alongside it. Dawgz AI fits into this category by using Ethereum's infrastructure and integrating features based on AI. It reflects what many long-term investors prefer: simple systems backed by function, not flash.

Altcoins with no real function are quickly losing investor interest. In their place, tokens that serve clear roles inside existing blockchain systems are rising. Whether it's powering AI tools, automating contracts, or supporting data transfers, utility is becoming the clearest signal of long-term potential.

Ethereum-based projects that offer access to real services are gaining consistent attention. Investors are no longer chasing empty trends. They're watching coins with strong developer support and user activity. Projects that grow by delivering something useful, not just by launching flashy features, are shaping the direction of crypto in 2025.

Dawgz AI is part of this shift. It combines Ethereum's proven base with AI-powered features in a format that's simple but functional. For investors exploring utility-first tokens with community potential, it's worth a closer look.

While research from DappRadar shows a dip in blockchain gaming metrics, the broader view is of an industry “growing up”.

Let's get the slightly gloomy numbers out of the way first. Daily Unique Active Wallets (think of these as daily players jumping in) dropped to 4.8 million in April, a 10% dip over the previous month. That's the lowest we've seen this year.

Cash injections weren't exactly booming either, with a modest $21 million raised. DappRadar points out that a lot of the market's attention seems to be wandering off towards the shiny new toys like AI and real-world assets.

However, it's not all over for blockchain gaming. As DappRadar puts it, “It's not explosive growth, it's foundational work.”

DappRader points to three developments supporting the next phase of blockchain gaming:

Even the giants of the gaming world, like Sega and Netmarble, are still showing up to the Web3 party. However, DappRadar notes that “the ones making progress are those who collaborate with Web3-native teams.”

In plain English? The big companies are realising they can't just slap “blockchain” on an old game. They need the passion and know-how of teams who eat, sleep, and breathe Web3 technologies.

This is perhaps the most exciting shift of all. The report highlights a “clear shift in priorities, away from unsustainable token models and toward gameplay, interoperability, and actual user retention.”

In practice, that means:

So, is blockchain gaming dead? Far from it. As DappRadar concludes, “The blockchain gaming industry isn't dead — it's evolving. It's moving from noise to signal. And the ones still here? They're building what comes next.”

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have long reigned as the meme coin kings, winning over investors with their humor, hype, and strong communities. But is their charm starting to fade? DOGE is currently trading at $0.231, slipping 2.01% in the last 24 hours, while SHIB sits at $0.000016, down 0.42% during the same period. 

Meanwhile, a new contender is shaking things up—Lightchain AI. With an exciting presale price of $0.007125 and over $20.3 million already raised, this innovative project is quickly becoming a favorite for investors looking to ride the next big wave in crypto. Could this be the future of the market?

Both dog-inspired tokens have seen spectacular rallies in the past, often driven by social media hype and endorsements from celebrities.

But to sustain that momentum takes more than hype, it requires constant new development and tangible uses in the real world. Since its acceptance as a payment method, Dogecoin has come a long way, establishing a reputation as a straightforward and simple cryptocurrency for day-to-day use.

Likewise, Shiba Inu is building its ecosystem with projects such as ShibaSwap and the soon-to-come Shibarium layer-2 solution. But as the crypto-markets mature, those projects with real technology and real use cases are being favoured. Sustainability depends on creating authentic value beyond speculation and market cycles.""

Lightchain AI sets itself apart by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence into its blockchain infrastructure.

At the core of this innovation is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a groundbreaking feature designed to handle AI-specific tasks such as model training and inference directly within the blockchain environment. This integration ensures efficient execution of AI processes while maintaining the decentralized and secure nature of blockchain technology.

Additionally, Lightchain AI introduces a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of Intelligence (PoI). This mechanism enhances network security while incentivizing nodes to perform valuable AI computations. By aligning network security with productive work, Lightchain AI creates a synergistic ecosystem that drives both technological advancements and practical utility.

Move over DOGE and SHIB—there's a new heavyweight entering the ring, and it's not here to chase tails. Lightchain AI's presale success has investors lining up, drawn to its bold vision and game-changing tech. 

By mixing the brains of artificial intelligence with the brawn of blockchain, Lightchain AI tackles the rising demand for decentralized AI solutions with transparency, efficiency, and scalability. Translation? It's not just reinventing the crypto wheel—it's upgrading it with turbo mode. 

While some tokens wait around for their next ""to the moon"" moment, Lightchain AI is busy building a platform ready to shake up the crypto and AI worlds. If you're looking for a project with real-world potential and forward-thinking innovation, Lightchain AI might just be the shiny new coin you've been waiting for.

We have fined Newcastle based sole trader Darian Bishop, trading as ECO4U, £50,000 for making over 194,000 unlawful marketing calls to people on the UK's 'do not call' register. 

Bishop's unlawful calls related to grants for new boilers and solar panels, with the inference made during the calls that he was connected to a government scheme.  

It is against the law to make marketing calls to people who have been registered on the Telephone Preference Service register (TPS) for more than 28 days, unless they have explicitly consented to receive the calls. 

Catherine Sankey, Group Manager at the ICO said:

“Feeling threatened or abused in your own home, simply because you picked up your phone, will never be acceptable.  

“Our investigation clearly showed this individual was fully aware of the law in relation to making marketing calls yet went ahead and made them anyway. 

“Our fine shows that we will hold all those who flout the law to account, from sole trader to larger companies employing a number of staff, and should act as further warning that we continue to pursue and fine companies who choose to ignore the law in pursuit of financial gain.” 

Investigation findings and outcome 

We became aware of Bishop during wider enquiries relating to an increase in complaints received about the energy and home improvement sector. An investigation began in October 2023 after we and TPS received 21 complaints.  

Bishop maintained he received valid consent after people completed an application form via a Facebook advertisement. A sample of complainants were contacted during the investigation, all of whom confirmed to us either they did not complete an application form or they did not use Facebook. 

We concluded Bishop was aware of the rules surrounding the making of marketing calls: he confirmed he knew about the relevant law and was previously investigated in 2015 for making persistent sales calls and misleading people into believing they would receive a free boiler under the ‘Green Deal' scheme.  

We found Bishop did not provide enough information to enable people to understand who they were receiving calls from, nor did he take reasonable steps to prevent non-compliance with the law. 

Darian Bishop received a monetary penalty notice for £50,000 and an enforcement notice. 

Examples of complaints received 

“Reminded caller about TPS scheme to which I belong. Was asked did I pay for it and there's no such thing and it doesn't work. I stated I would be reporting this cold call and was told I was being awkward, and the caller hung up. This is an invasion of my privacy again”.  

“Think he said calling from government company. Asked for me by name. When I said I wouldn't do anything over the phone he was asking if he had the right address and would send someone tomorrow. So very threatening”.  

“Although this company identified themselves as Echo Government Scheme Deal, they initially said they were calling on behalf of a government scheme about my gas boiler. In short the call is dishonest. I'm concerned about companies claiming to have a government connection, talking about scheme that do exist – in this case the Green Deal – and trying to give their call a degree of official authority.” 

Advice for the public 

To help you, your friends and relatives stop unlawful marketing calls, texts or emails you can: 

Industry advice 

The issue of unlawful marketing calls is of significant concern to people in the UK. We urge all businesses operating in this sector to consult and abide by published guidance and also take up the opportunity of speaking to our experts via its helpline should obligations remain unclear.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin has been starting to take off again, recently breaching the $100,000 mark.

Michael Saylor, one of the biggest Bitcoin bulls, believes that in the future, the digital currency could be worth millions.

10 stocks we like better than iShares Bitcoin Trust ›

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) recently hit the $100,000 mark again. The bullishness is back as investors continue to pile money into the top cryptocurrency. And if some crypto enthusiasts are right, this may be just the start of more gains to come.

The good news is that if you don't want to worry about digital wallets and just want an easy way to invest in Bitcoin, there are spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) you can put into your portfolio today to gain exposure to the digital currency, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT). Could investing $1,000 in this ETF help make you a millionaire?

Investing in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF can be an effective way to track Bitcoin. The fund charges an expense ratio of 0.25%, which is comparable to what many other ETFs charge. Most importantly, however, is that your performance from holding the fund in your portfolio would be comparable to actually holding Bitcoin.

While there is some minor disparity, the ETF does a good job of tracking the digital currency, and you would be up over 60% right now if you invested in the fund a year ago.

For a $1,000 investment in anything to grow to a value of $1 million, you would need it to grow to 1,000 times its original value. That's not a small performance by any stretch. But given the enthusiasm around Bitcoin, could it be possible?

It recently surpassed $100,000. Assuming you invested in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF right around now, then you would need the digital currency to climb to a value of at least $100 million at some point in the future. That would be around the level necessary to turn a $1,000 investment into $1 million.

One of the biggest Bitcoin bulls is Michael Saylor, the former CEO of Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy). He believes that the cryptocurrency could reach a value of $13 million by 2045. And under his bull case, he projects it could be worth $49 million.

Those would be phenomenal returns for the cryptocurrency. However, even if it did reach those levels, that still wouldn't be enough for a $1,000 investment in an ETF tracking the digital currency to make you a millionaire. While over the very long term (i.e., 30-plus years) that may be more likely, it would indeed be an extremely bullish, best-case scenario for that to happen.

Bitcoin has been picking up steam in recent weeks after a tough start to the year, as crypto investors remain bullish once again on the popular coin. But it's important to consider the volatility and risk that can come with it, as this is still a highly speculative investment to be holding in your portfolio. Within just the past 12 months, it has hit highs of more than $106,000 but lows of less than $54,000 as well.

Those kinds of wild swings can be exciting when things are going up, but they can also be depressing on the way down. Investing in the crypto can yield great returns for investors, but it's important to temper your expectations. And while the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF may make it easier to do so, that doesn't mean it's any less risky.

If you want to invest in Bitcoin, I would suggest taking only a small position (less than 5% of your portfolio) to ensure you aren't taking on too much risk.

              Highlights            



                        Stablecoin adoption is growing, with partnerships like Mastercard and MoonPay signaling mainstream interest and proving key to usability, but scalability remains hindered by limited fiat on- and off-ramps, merchant acceptance and regulatory uncertainty.                      


                        Stablecoins offer benefits, especially for cross-border payments and emerging markets, thanks to their speed, reliability and programmability, but they require better infrastructure and integration with legacy financial systems.                      


                        Banks and FinTechs can act as stablecoin issuers, custodians and fiat liquidity providers, but U.S. regulatory hurdles — highlighted by political blocks like the GENIUS Act — may ultimately shape their future more than the technology itself.                      

Solutions in search of problems tend to get nowhere. Stablecoins, which have the potential to become widely used for payments, are trying to avoid that fate.

Stablecoins are being held as more than a cryptocurrency curiosity, as evidenced by news Thursday (May 15) that Mastercard launched a stablecoin-focused partnership with crypto payments FinTech MoonPay.

However, the full potential of the fiat-pegged digital asset class remains constrained by limited on- and off-ramp infrastructure and insufficient acceptance among merchants and consumers. There's also the regulatory elephant in the room in the United States.

The benefits of stablecoins can be enticing, particularly in cross-border and emerging market transactions. These programmable dollars (or euros, or pesos) can move at the speed of the internet. They combine the reliability of traditional money with the speed and efficiency of blockchain rails. Still, like all powerful tools, stablecoins' value depends on the system they're part of. That could require legitimate institutions to build the rails, encourage acceptance, align with regulations and integrate with legacy systems.

On paper, stablecoins may seem like the perfect bridge between two financial worlds. Citi Institute's Future of Finance think tank projected that the stablecoin market could jump to at least $1.6 trillion by 2030, assuming regulatory support and institutional integration continue apace.

In practice, however, stablecoins can be stuck in a transactional limbo where they are underused and misunderstood. The key to unlocking their full potential could lie in partnerships for seamless fiat on- and off-ramps, as well as widespread acceptance from merchants and consumers.

For most Americans not actively involved in crypto markets, stablecoins might as well not exist. But most Americans still bank with institutions that are centuries old.

In the crypto economy of certain regions, wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet and others are the new front ends of finance, and fiat ramps serve as the connective tissue between these wallets and the fiat world.

Today, most stablecoin entry points still rely on centralized crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance or Kraken. These platforms offer fiat gateways where users can link bank accounts or cards to buy stablecoins. However, for stablecoins to become ubiquitous, access needs to move beyond crypto-native tools. That means embedding on-ramps into FinTech apps, remittance platforms and retail bank services.

Emerging markets, where banking infrastructure is often limited or unreliable, stand to benefit the most.

For example, Ramp announced May 7 an expansion of its issuing partnership with Stripe to launch stablecoin-backed corporate cards designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. The integration will start with select Latin American markets and then expand to countries in Europe, Africa and Asia.

Currency.com CEO Konstantin Anissimov told PYMNTS this week that there has been “a big shift in terms of adoption of stablecoin payments that is being driven by uncertainty in geopolitics.”

“I am personally seeing a big increase of small to medium enterprises utilizing stablecoin payments because banking rails are harder and harder to use,” Anissimov said.

From Shopify plugins to crypto-friendly point-of-sale (POS) systems, technical solutions exist to enable stablecoin acceptance. However, what's lacking is incentive. Traditional payment processors like Visa or PayPal offer reliability, fraud protection and settlement services that most blockchain payment systems can't yet match.

Equally critical are off-ramps — the pathways through which users convert stablecoins back into fiat currency. Without these, stablecoins risk becoming digital dead-ends. Users want to spend, not just hold.

That's in part why, rather than resisting, banks can reposition themselves as custodians of digital assets, offering secure storage and compliance partnerships that handle know your customer and anti-money laundering obligations for stablecoin issuers. At the same time, they can serve as liquidity providers offering fiat backstops and redemption services.

They could even be issuers themselves. Some, like J.P. Morgan, already are.

“I think the largest banks will succeed as stablecoin issuers,” Amias Gerety, former assistant secretary of the Treasury, told PYMNTS in March.

Still, policy could shape the stablecoin trajectory in the U.S. more than technology. Perhaps the most eye-catching development in 2025 has been the President Donald Trump family's foray into stablecoins. The USD1 token, unveiled at a Dubai conference and reportedly used in a $2 billion Binance investment by Abu Dhabi's MGX, raised eyebrows and strategic questions.

That foray, as well as others, resulted in the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act, a bill to promote stablecoins, being blocked in the U.S. Senate over political disagreements.

The GENIUS Act amendments address anti-money laundering gaps, barring non-financial giants from stablecoin dominance.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

The US Senate is preparing to vote next week on a revised version of the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-focused bill that has been updated to address concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers.

Last week, the bill stalled after several Democratic lawmakers withdrew support, citing gaps in anti-money laundering provisions, weak oversight for foreign stablecoin issuers, and a lack of enforcement tools.

In response, the bill's sponsors have introduced key amendments to tighten regulatory controls and reinforce national security protections.

According to available information, the updated bill strengthens clauses around financial integrity, consumer protection, and ethical standards.

It also introduces language targeting the influence of large technology companies and foreign entities in the digital currency space.

Meanwhile, one of the most significant changes is a provision that bars non-financial, publicly traded companies from issuing stablecoins unless they meet strict conditions. These include clear frameworks for risk management, data privacy, and fair business conduct.

Former FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett noted that the amendment aims to “maintain the separation between banking and commerce.”

This would essentially curb the financial ambitions of Big Tech companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft from launching digital currencies that could bypass regulatory scrutiny.

Notably, the revision comes shortly after reports revealed that Meta is in early discussions with crypto firms about enabling cross-border stablecoin payments on its platforms.

In addition, the revised bill also clarifies that stablecoins do not carry federal insurance protections, reducing the risk of consumer confusion and financial fraud.

All of these changes aim to establish clear legal boundaries while preserving the role of traditional financial institutions.

In the lead-up to next week's floor vote, crypto advocacy groups have ramped up efforts to push the legislation through.

Stand With Crypto, a Coinbase-backed crypto advocacy group, has launched a campaign encouraging constituents to email their senators to support the bill.

Another crypto advocacy group, The Blockchain Association, echoed that sentiment, saying that moving the bill forward “would bring us one step closer to creating a bipartisan framework for stablecoins.”

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong joined the push, calling on the lawmakers “to create clear rules for crypto in America.” He added:

“52 million Americans have used crypto and want to see regulatory clarity.”

Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology is creating new investment opportunities. One particular area gaining traction is AI Agent Crypto Coins. These digital assets not only leverage AI to enhance their functionality but also promise significant returns for savvy investors. In this article, we will explore which AI coins are predicted to explode in the near future, and what trends are shaping this exciting market.

So, what exactly are AI Agent Crypto Coins? Well, they're basically digital assets that power AI projects within the crypto space. Think of them as the fuel that keeps the AI engine running. These coins are designed to facilitate and accelerate technological advancements in various sectors. They're relatively new, but they've already shown a lot of promise compared to traditional cryptocurrencies.

AI is changing the game in crypto. It's not just about fancy algorithms; it's about making things smarter and more efficient. AI can help with:

AI's ability to process huge amounts of data quickly and accurately makes it a perfect fit for the fast-paced world of crypto. It can identify patterns and insights that humans might miss, giving investors a serious edge.

Why should you even consider putting your money into AI coins? Here's the deal:

It's worth noting that the crypto market is volatile, and AI coins are no exception. But if you're willing to take the risk, the potential rewards could be substantial.

Render is making waves, and for good reason. It's all about decentralized GPU rendering, which is a fancy way of saying it lets people share their computer power to create visual effects and animations. This is a big deal because rendering can be super expensive and time-consuming. Render aims to make it more accessible and affordable. It's definitely one to watch in 2025.

MIND is an interesting project focused on creating AI agents that can actually think and make decisions. This is a step beyond just automating tasks; it's about building AI that can learn and adapt. The potential applications are huge, from personal assistants to complex problem-solving. If MIND can deliver on its promises, it could be a game-changer in the AI crypto space.

Ocean Protocol is all about data. It lets people and companies monetize their data in a secure and private way. This is important because data is becoming increasingly valuable, but it's also important to protect people's privacy. Ocean Protocol uses blockchain technology to create a marketplace for data, where people can buy and sell data without compromising privacy. It's a really interesting concept with a lot of potential.

Investing in AI crypto coins can be risky, but the potential rewards are also high. It's important to do your research and understand the risks before investing any money.

Here's a quick look at potential growth factors:

AI meme coins? Yeah, it sounds pretty wild, right? Basically, it's where the internet's obsession with memes meets the world of artificial intelligence in the form of a cryptocurrency. These coins try to capture the viral nature of memes and combine it with the techy appeal of AI. It's like a double dose of internet culture, aiming to be both funny and functional (sort of).

So, what makes these AI meme coins tick? Well, a few things:

It's a new frontier, and like any new thing in crypto, it's got its risks and rewards. The AI meme coin space is definitely one to watch, but approach with caution.

Will AI meme coins blow up in 2025? It's possible. A lot of it depends on social media hype and whether they can actually deliver on any real-world use cases. If they can keep the buzz going and offer something beyond just a funny name and a cool logo, they can leverage its growing popularity in 2025. But remember, meme coins are notoriously volatile, so be prepared for a wild ride.

AI is changing how crypto markets work. It's not just about the tech itself, but also how people react to it. We're seeing AI used for trading bots, which can make lightning-fast decisions, and for analyzing market sentiment, which helps predict price movements. This means the market is becoming more efficient, but also potentially more volatile. It's a wild ride!

Blockchain tech is also evolving, and AI is playing a role there too. We're seeing AI used to improve blockchain security, make transactions faster, and even create new types of decentralized applications. The combination of these two technologies is creating some really interesting possibilities.

It's important to remember that blockchain and AI are still relatively new technologies. There are still a lot of challenges to overcome, but the potential rewards are huge.

Investor sentiment is a huge driver in the crypto world, and AI coins are no exception. Right now, there's a lot of hype around AI, and that's driving up the prices of many AI-related cryptocurrencies. But it's important to remember that hype can be fleeting. It's crucial to do your own research and not just follow the crowd. Keep an eye on social media, news articles, and expert opinions to gauge the overall mood.



Okay, so you want to get into AI crypto, huh? First things first, you gotta figure out which coins are worth your time. It's not like picking stocks; this is the Wild West. Look beyond the hype. Check out the project's team – are they legit? What problem are they actually trying to solve? Does their AI actually do anything useful, or is it just buzzwords? Dig into their whitepapers, read up on their tech, and see if they have a real community backing them. Don't just listen to some random dude on YouTube.

Alright, let's talk about the not-so-fun part: losing money. Crypto is risky, and AI crypto? Even riskier. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investments. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Seriously. Set stop-loss orders to limit your downside. And for the love of all that is holy, don't FOMO into a coin just because it's pumping.

Remember, past performance is not indicative of future results. This isn't financial advice, just common sense. Do your own research, and be prepared for anything.

So, are you in this for the long haul, or are you trying to make a quick buck? Both are valid, but they require different approaches. If you're thinking long-term, focus on projects with solid fundamentals and real-world use cases. If you're trying to trade the volatility, be prepared to watch the market like a hawk and accept the risk of big swings. Long-term investing requires patience and research, while short-term trading demands constant attention and a strong stomach.



Okay, so what's the deal with AI crypto looking ahead? Well, 2025 is shaping up to be a pretty big year. I think we're going to see some serious growth in this area. It's not just hype; there's real potential here. More people are going to start paying attention, and that means more money flowing in. It's all about getting in early, right?

Tech is always changing, and AI is no different. We're talking about some cool stuff coming down the pipeline. Think better algorithms, faster processing, and more secure blockchains. All of this is going to make AI crypto even more appealing. Innovation is the name of the game.

The advancements in AI and blockchain tech are expected to converge, creating more efficient and user-friendly crypto platforms. This will likely lead to increased adoption and new use cases for AI-driven cryptocurrencies.

The crypto world is never boring, is it? It's always changing, always moving. AI is just one piece of the puzzle, but it's a big one. We're going to see more competition, more innovation, and probably a few surprises along the way. It's going to be interesting to watch it all unfold. Here's a quick look at some key areas:

So there you have it. The world of AI crypto is buzzing with potential, and picking the right coin could really pay off. As we look ahead to 2025, it's clear that some of these AI-driven cryptocurrencies are set to take off. But remember, investing in crypto isn't a sure thing. Do your homework, keep an eye on the trends, and don't jump in without thinking it through. If you're ready to dive into this exciting space, make sure you're prepared for the ride. Good luck out there!

AI agent crypto coins are digital currencies that support projects using artificial intelligence. They help improve technology and can offer better opportunities for investment.

Investing in AI crypto coins can be beneficial because they combine the power of AI and blockchain, potentially leading to higher returns.

Some popular AI coins include Render, MIND, and Ocean Protocol. These coins are expected to grow significantly in the coming years.

AI meme coins are cryptocurrencies that mix AI technology with meme culture. They are often fun and can attract a lot of attention, making them interesting investments.

Market trends can greatly influence AI crypto by changing investor interest and affecting prices. Keeping an eye on these trends can help you make better investment choices.

When investing in AI crypto, it's important to identify promising coins, manage risks, and decide whether you want to invest for the long term or short term.

Jakarta, Pintu News – VanEck recently launched their latest product, the VanEck Onchain Economy ETF with the stock code NODE. This ETF is designed to give investors access to the digital asset economy without having to own crypto directly.

By investing in digitally transformed companies and digital asset instruments, NODE offers an investment alternative with lower volatility.

The product targets public companies involved in the blockchain space, including crypto miners, exchanges, data centers, energy providers, and fintech companies using crypto technology.

Check out the full news here!

The NODE ETF is actively managed by selecting between 30 and 60 companies from more than 130 candidates. The portfolio is customized based on market trends and each company's association with Bitcoin . Although it does not hold crypto directly, NODE can invest up to 25% of its assets in crypto-related products such as Bitcoin ETFs through its Cayman Islands subsidiary.

This allows NODE to comply with US tax laws while gaining indirect exposure to crypto-related products such as swaps and futures. NODE will not invest in stablecoins and will limit the subsidiary's exposure to 25% of assets each quarter. This approach offers diversification and liquidity, and is an alternative to the often more volatile pure crypto strategies.

With a management fee of 0.69%, NODE complements VanEck's crypto-related product line, which already includes the passively managed Digital Transformation ETF. The launch coincides with growing institutional interest in blockchain infrastructure and the availability of products from traditional asset managers that fit into the evolving on-chain economy.

VanEck has also filed ETFs related to individual digital assets, including Avalanche  and Binance Coin . This shows the continued expansion in the crypto investment space and offers more options for investors looking to get involved in the digital asset market without the direct risks of crypto ownership.

VanEck's NODE ETF opens up new opportunities for investors to get involved in the digital revolution without having to dive headlong into crypto-asset ownership.

U.K.-based Coinsilium Group (COIN:AQSE), which became the first blockchain firm to IPO in 2015, has announced a £1.25 million raise as it looks to establish its bitcoin BTC$104,333.91 treasury initiative.

The raise came alongside a record high in trading volume of Coinsilium Group shares, with 14 million shares changing hands on Friday. Shares are currently trading at £0.04, having risen by 24% over the past 24 hours.

The company is advised by CoinDesk analyst James Van Straten, who told CoinDesk that it was ""great to see record trading volumes as Coinsilium announces a bitcoin treasury.""

He added: ""I remain focused on helping educate the UK market on bitcoin and helping the UK become a leader in this space.""

The move to set up a bitcoin treasury follows in the footsteps of several other companies including Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet, with the U.S. Government also outlining plans to stockpile BTC in March.

The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), one of the first U.S. state pension funds to invest in a spot bitcoin BTC$104,333.91 exchange-traded fund, exited its position entirely in the first quarter as the price of the largest cryptocurrency fell about 12%.

At end of 2024, the board held more than 6 million shares in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a position valued at around $350 million based on recent prices. That stake is now gone, according to its latest 13F filing. 

The offload occurred less than a year after Wisconsin made headlines as an early institutional adopter of the newly approved crypto investment vehicles and stands in contrast to the board's activity just months earlier. In late 2024, SWIB more than doubled its exposure to bitcoin by raising its IBIT holdings from about 2.9 million to over 6 million shares.

The board added indirect exposure to bitcoin via Strategy (MSTR) shares. In the first quarter it added 26,571 MSTR shares, worth around $10.5 million. 

Established in 1951, SWIB manages over $160 billion in assets, serving Wisconsin state employees through the Wisconsin Retirement System and other funds.

In contrast, Mubadala Investments, Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, increased its stake in BlackRock's IBIT in the first quarter of the year. The fund, its latest 13F shows, added in a little over 490,000 shares valued at around $29 million.

Bitcoin has risen 27% to trade near $103,750 since the end of the quarter.

Galaxy Digital (GLXY) just debuted on the Nasdaq, but it appears the financial services company's listing will be jostling for the attention of the crypto sphere's hive mind.

Crypto X — still widely known as Crypto Twitter (CT) despite the platform's name change — was abuzz with users sharing news of fast food company Steak n' Shake starting to accept bitcoin BTC$104,333.91 payments over the Lightning network, having announced its plans to do so a week ago.

A video posted on the social-media platform shows a customer completing an order at a self-service machine, choosing the ""Pay With Bitcoin"" option and scanning the QR code with their Lightning wallet in the Zeus app.  

Another company raising the bitcoin flag is Top Win International (TOPW), a luxury watch wholesaler, which said it will change its name to AsiaStrategy and manage its treasury in digital assets. It is, in effect, following the model of Michael Saylor's software company Strategy (MSTR), which now owns 568,840 BTC, more than 2.5% of all the bitcoin that will ever exist.

Hong Kong-based Top Win is partnering with crypto-backed venture capital firm Sora for its new pivot. Shares of the company rose as much as 45% before losing the gains to trade down 31% at $5.14.

Sora previously worked with Tokyo-based Metaplanet (3350), another company copying the Strategy model. 

Galaxy, the Toronto-based crypto-focused financial services firm led by Mike Novogratz, has commenced trading on Nasdaq Global Select Market.

Novogratz, who described the listing as a ""pivotal moment"" for Galaxy in a letter shared via email, rang the opening bell on the Nasdaq floor on Friday.

Galaxy announced its plans at the end of last month, in which it also said GLXY would remain listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) ""for a period of time following [its] intended listing on Nasdaq.""

GLXY shares traded at around $22.61 in early trading, 3.2% higher on the day. The Toronto-traded shares rose 2.98% to C$31.48 ($22.53).

A sharp sell-off in Coinbase (COIN) stock may be an overreaction to two pieces of bad news that hit on the same day, according to analysts at Barclays and Oppenheimer.

Shares of the crypto exchange dropped 7.2% on Thursday after it disclosed a social engineering-driven data breach and later reports revealed a long-running Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into whether the company overstated user numbers in its 2021 initial public offering (IPO) filing. The stock's intraday dip reached nearly 9% before recovering slightly.

Barclays said the market is likely pricing in too much risk, calling the reaction “somewhat overblown.” The firm emphasized that the cyberattack stemmed from bribed customer support agents rather than a failure in blockchain security.

According to Coinbase's blog post, a group of overseas agents were paid off to leak customer data, including names, addresses and masked social security numbers, which scammers then used to convince users to send crypto assets.

Coinbase refused to pay a $20 million ransom demanded by the hackers. Instead, it has pledged to reimburse affected customers and is working with law enforcement. Less than 1% of transacting users were affected, and no passwords, private keys or customer funds were accessed directly.

Oppenheimer echoed Barclays' view, writing that while the breach damages the company's reputation, it appears to be isolated and not indicative of broader systemic risk. Coinbase estimates it will spend between $180 million and $400 million to cover customer losses, legal expenses and a new bounty program aimed at catching the perpetrators.

As for the SEC probe, it concerns the 100 million “verified users” figure in Coinbase's S-1 filing during its 2021 IPO. Coinbase stopped reporting this metric over two years ago, and analysts believe the investigation has been underway since the Biden administration. 

Paul Grewal, Coinbase's chief legal officer, said the probe should not be prolonged, and that it doesn't relate to the company's current performance.

The double dose of bad news comes just days after Coinbase stock surged on news it would be added to the S&P 500, which may have made the shares vulnerable to a pullback.

In a note to clients, Barclays pointed out that investors may be reacting not just to the news itself, but to the rapid rise in the stock in recent days. Oppenheimer called the current weakness in share price “a buying opportunity” and reaffirmed its outperform rating.

If anything, the episode underscores the thin line crypto firms walk between technological robustness and human vulnerability. And while the fallout may prove manageable, Coinbase's response — and the market's memory — will shape how long the shadow of this breach lasts.

Mark Palmer, analyst at Benchmark, also downplayed the long-term significance of the breach, characterizing it as a targeted, one-off incident rather than evidence of deeper security flaws. He pointed out that the attackers gained access through bribed customer support contractors rather than through Coinbase's core systems, which remained intact. No passwords, private keys or customer funds were compromised.

Palmer also dismissed the SEC's investigation into Coinbase's past user metrics as “little more than noise,” noting it relates to a metric the company stopped reporting over two years ago. 

Despite the headline risk, he reaffirmed his bullish outlook, raising his price target on Coinbase to $301 from $252 and emphasizing the company's potential to benefit from growing institutional adoption as regulatory clarity improves.

 Bitcoin price has been stuck below $105,000 over the last week, and data suggests the pattern may continue for a few more days, subject to the emergence of fresh catalysts. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin price consolidates as resistance at $105,000 prevents a rally to new all-time highs.

Traders are slightly bearish, but historical data suggests a sudden bullish move should not be ruled out.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has been consolidating within a roughly $3,500 range over the past seven days as the $105,000 level remains the overhead resistance to break.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC's price has been oscillating between its resistance level at $105,000 and $101,500, where it has found support.

“$BTC is stuck in a narrowing $101.5K–$104K range,” said Swissblock in a May 16 post on X. 

The onchain data provider said that Bitcoin began consolidating after two failed attempts to break above the resistance at $105,000. 

For market intelligence firm Santiment, failure to rise past the $105,000 level has seen traders flip slightly bearish. 

“Markets generally tend to move opposite to the crowd's expectations, suggesting there is a heightened probability of crypto markets rising due to this increased fear,” the firm explained in an X post, adding:

Bitcoin has managed to sustain $100,000 as support for over a week while hitting 14-week highs of $105,700 on May 12. 

Despite following broad volatility across risk assets, BTC/USD might have gone even higher were it not for maneuvers of large-volume trading entities on exchange order books, according to trading resource Material Indicators.

Related: Bitcoin hitting $220K ‘reasonable' in 2025, says gold-based forecast

Looking at the Binance exchange, Material Indicators said large blocks of ask liquidity were stacked above the spot price, pinning the BTC price in the range.

An accompanying chart shows that these liquidity clusters currently sit between $105,000 and $110,000.

“Unless we have a serious catalyst, I'm not expecting to see a sustainable breakout to the all-time high territory until BTC has a legit support test at $100,000,” it said in a May 16 post on X.  

Material Indicators added that a key level to watch on the downside was the $98,000-$100,000 range.

Meanwhile, trader Daan Crypto Trades said that the “start of the recent move” at $93,000 was essential for Bitcoin traders going forward.

Bitcoin is trading “far away from any large liquidity clusters. The price didn't trade for a long time up here just yet. So, after the initial squeeze of shorts, there are not that many new positions built up around this area,” his X post said, adding:

Material Indicators paid additional attention to the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs), key longer-term trendlines that formed a bullish cross, indicating a “strong upward momentum for the macro trend.”

For MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe, $98,000 is a “crucial area to hold on to” in order to ensure continuation upward.

 Ethereum researcher Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that launching a 51% attack on Bitcoin would be “much cheaper” than on Ethereum, estimating the cost at around $10 billion. 

Ethereum Merge architect Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that it would be cheaper to launch a 51% attack on Bitcoin than on Ethereum.

Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”

Drake led work on Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. 

In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”

Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and said a successful attack is “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or group controls over 50% of a blockchain network's mining or staking power, gaining power over the network. Hummer added:

Related: Coin Metrics research shows BTC and ETH are immune to 51% attacks

Drake said that “to have 100% control of the chain, you need 50% + 1 of stake.” He said that it would be extremely difficult and expensive, but far from impossible:

At the time of writing, there were 34,168,987 staked Ether (ETH) worth nearly $89.6 billion. Consequently, half of all ETH has a current value of almost $44.8 billion.

Still, a much higher investment would likely be needed. Ether has a current market cap of $316 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $25 billion (just over 8% of the market cap).

The ETH needed for an attack is worth nearly 14.2% of the market cap and 180% of the 24-hour trading volume. An undertaking of that size would likely cause a significant ETH price appreciation, further increasing the cost of the attack.

Related: Big miners pose a growing existential threat to Bitcoin

Matan Sitbon, the founder and CEO of blockchain interoperability developer Lightblocks, told Cointelegraph that Ethereum has an additional feature to defend against such attacks.

“Ethereum's ultimate security lies not solely in cryptography or protocol rules, but in the community's powerful social and economic coordination mechanisms,“ he said.

Drake also highlighted another advantage that he claims Ethereum has over Bitcoin. He explained that “if there is a 51% attack, the social layer can identify the attacker and socially slash it.” 

“This is a superpower of PoS that is not available with PoW,“ he added.

Drake's statement refers to the social layer, meaning the network's human supermajority, which decides which software to run. Bitcoin's simpler proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism has a smaller attack surface and longer reliability track record, but it lacks this feature.

Pavel Yashin, Researcher at P2P.org, told Cointelegraph that “if the centralization is detected,” the community could resolve it with a new fork. The old token would end up being delisted, and the compromised chain would fall into irrelevancy.

Hassan Khan, CEO at Bitcoin liquidity protocol Ordeez, told Cointelegraph that “the debate around the feasibility of a 51% attack remains open-ended — largely because while theoretically possible, in practice the barriers are extremely high.”

He said that for Bitcoin, the necessary amount of computing power and energy “makes a sustained attack highly improbable,” while for Ethereum, “PoS introduces additional economic and governance deterrents.”

 The Securities and Exchange Commission has questioned Coinbase's 2021 claim that it had more than 100 million “verified users” in the ongoing investigation. 

Coinbase stock dipped after news broke of a cyberattack that exposed customer data and an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation over misstated user numbers in 2021.

The double whammy of bad news rattled investors as company stock (COIN) slid 7% in a fall to $244 in after-hours trading on May 15, according to Google Finance.  

Coinbase has since confirmed the report from The New York Times, which stated the SEC has been investigating whether Coinbase misstated its user numbers in past disclosures, an inquiry that began during the Biden administration and has continued under the Trump administration.

“This is a hold-over investigation from the prior administration about a metric we stopped reporting two and a half years ago, which was fully disclosed to the public,” confirmed Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal to Cointelegraph. 

“We also disclosed – and continue to disclose – the more relevant metric of ‘monthly transacting users' – the number of people who use our platform in a given month,” he said before adding: 

The regulator took specific umbrage at Coinbase's claim of “100+ million verified users” that appeared in its marketing and IPO documentation in 2021. However, the exchange stopped reporting this metric in 2022.

The probe has continued despite the SEC dropping its 2023 enforcement lawsuit against Coinbase under the Trump administration. 

Coinbase has hired law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell to assist with its response to the SEC.

On May 15, Coinbase reported that it was attacked with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals recruited overseas support agents to leak user data.

“These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers,” the firm stated.

Coinbase refused to pay the ransom but said it would reimburse victims of phishing attacks as a result of the data breach, with expected remediation and reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.

What Makes Stars Twinkle?

The quirks of light moving through gas are the cause of stellar twinkling, which can be a bane—and sometimes a boon—for astronomers

Ah, it's a lovely night for enjoying the outdoors. You go outside in the warm summer air to listen to the crickets and breathe in the scents of verdant life and then turn your head to the heavens. You see hundreds of stars in the sky, and the brightest are conspicuously twinkling and gleaming.

Some are even shifting their colors across the rainbow, delighting your eyes and mind—unless you're out there to do some observing with a telescope. That twinkling is lovely for any average stargazer to behold, but scientifically it's a pain in the astronomer.

Twinkling is the apparent rapid variation of brightness and color of the stars. It's technically called scintillation, from the Latin for “sparkle,” which is apt. While it is admittedly lovely, it's still the bane of astronomers across the world.

For millennia, twinkling was misunderstood. As with so many scientific principles, it was misdiagnosed by ancient Greeks such as Aristotle, who attributed it to human vision. At that time, he and his peers believed that the eye actively created vision by sending out beams that illuminated objects and allowed us to see them. But these beams were imperfect, so the belief went, and the farther away an object was, the more the beam would be distorted; stars, being very far away, suffered this flaw greatly, causing them to twinkle. It was Isaac Newton, through his studies of optics, who finally determined the true cause.

A fundamental property of light—true of all waves, in fact—is that it bends when it goes from one medium to another. You're familiar with this: a spoon sitting in a glass of water looks bent at the top of the liquid. This is called refraction, and in the case of the spoon, it happens when the light goes from the water in the glass to the air on its way to your eye, distorting the shape of the otherwise unbent spoon. The amount of refraction depends on the properties of the materials through which the light travels. Density, for instance, can dictate the degree of refraction for light moving through gas—so light traveling through air alone will still bend if the air has different densities from one spot to the next.

If Earth's atmosphere were perfectly static and homogeneous, then the refraction of starlight would be minimal. Our air is always in motion, however, and far from smooth. Winds far above the planet's surface stir the air, creating turbulence. This roils the gases, creating small air packets of different densities that move to and fro.

Starlight passing through one such parcel of air will bend slightly. From our point of view on Earth, the position of the star will shift slightly when that happens. The air is also in motion, so from moment to moment, the starlight will pass through different parcels on its way to your eye or your detector, shifting position each time, usually randomly because of the air's turbulent motion. What you see on the ground, then, is the star rapidly shifting left, right, up and down, and all directions in between, several times per second—in other words, twinkling.

The amount of the shift is confusingly called “seeing” by astronomers, and it's actually quite small. It's usually only a few arcseconds, a very small angle on the sky—the full moon, for example, is about 1,800 arcseconds wide. Stars, though, are so far away from us that they appear to be a minuscule fraction of an arcsecond wide, a tiny point of light to the eye, so even this minuscule arcsecond-scale shifting makes them appear to dance around.

Note that this is why planets typically don't twinkle. Jupiter, for example, is usually several dozen arcseconds wide, so twinkling doesn't affect its position as much, and we perceive its light to be steady.

Twinkling is usually more obvious for stars near the horizon than overhead. The atmosphere is a shell of air surrounding Earth. When we look straight up, we're looking through roughly 100 kilometers of air, but toward the horizon, that length increases to more than 1,000 km! That gives the air many more chances to refract the starlight, increasing twinkling.

But it's not just position that twinkling affects. Different wavelengths—colors—of light refract by different amounts. This is why a prism or a raindrop breaks light up into separate colors to create a rainbow. For a star, which can emit light at essentially all colors, this means sometimes its red light is bent toward you and blue is bent away, so the star appears ruddy. A fraction of a second later, a different parcel of air refracts the blue light toward you, and the star sparks azure.

This effect is most apparent for white stars near the horizon. Sirius is white, and it's the brightest star in the night sky; when rising or setting, it can flash brilliantly and change colors rapidly. This is probably why it's often reported as a UFO! So if you hear a report that a bright spacecraft changed colors rapidly as it hovered over the trees, be aware that it almost certainly was not an alien ship but an alien sun.

For astronomers, though, twinkling leads to a very different outcome: light from an object gets spread out over an image's exposure time. Details in a distant galaxy, for example, look out of focus and blurry. Also, faint objects appear even fainter because their light is smeared out. These are serious problems but ones for which we have a solution: adaptive optics. Inside some telescopes are sensors that can detect the amount of twinkling. This information is sent to a computer that rapidly calculates the distortion, then adjusts pistons behind a deformable mirror to reshape the reflective surface in a way to compensate for the twinkling. Most large ground-based telescopes employ this amazing tech, which produces clear, sharp images despite the atmospheric turbulence.

Twinkling has a scientific use as well. The kind of light we see is not the only kind that refracts; radio waves do so as well when they pass through interstellar plasma, the ionized gas between the stars. Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars that send out brief radio wave pulses at rapid intervals. The radio waves scintillate as they pass through plasma on their way to Earth, and astronomers can measure that scintillation to investigate that plasma. Research published in Nature Astronomy in April 2025 used this to look at the material in space close to the sun and map out structures in the Local Bubble, a region of space surrounding the sun where ancient supernovae cleared out much of the gas. Scientists found 21 large arcs of plasma sustained by turbulence inside the bubble, which surprised them because it was previously assumed that the bubble was more smooth.

Personally, I'm of two minds about twinkling. It's lovely, certainly, but it caused me quite a bit of grief when I was using a telescope for my own research. Depending on what you're trying to study, though, it can still be a useful tool. So one might say my own opinion of twinkling is malleable; it can be bent either way.

See the Dramatic Consequences of Vaccination Rates Teetering on a ‘Knife's Edge'

As U.S. childhood vaccination rates sway on a “knife's edge,” new 25-year projections reveal how slight changes in national immunization could improve—or drastically reverse—the prevalence of measles, polio, rubella and diphtheria

By Lauren J. Young edited by Dean Visser

Amanda Montañez; Source: “Modeling Reemergence of Vaccine-Eliminated Infectious Diseases under Declining Vaccination in the U.S.,” by Mathew V. Kiang et al., in JAMA. Published online April 24, 2025 (data)

Measles, rubella, polio and diphtheria—once ubiquitous, devastating and deeply feared—have been virtually eliminated from the U.S. for decades. Entire generations have barely encountered these diseases as high vaccination rates and intensive surveillance efforts have largely shielded the country from major outbreaks.

But amid a major multistate measles outbreak that has grown to hundreds of cases, a recent study published in JAMA projects that even a slight dip in current U.S. childhood vaccination rates could reverse such historic gains, which could cause some of these maladies to come roaring back within 25 years—while just a slight increase in rates could effectively squelch all four.

“We were quite surprised that we're right on that knife's edge,” says the study's lead author Mathew Kiang, an assistant professor of epidemiology and population health at Stanford University. “A little bit more [vaccination coverage] and things could be totally fine; a little less and things are going to be quite bad.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization formally declare a disease eliminated when there is zero continuous transmission in a specific region for 12 months or more. The U.S. achieved this milestone for measles, a viral illness that can lead to splotchy rashes, pneumonia, organ failure and other dangerous complications, in 2000. Poliovirus, which can cause lifelong paralysis and death, was effectively eliminated from North and South America by 1994. The U.S. rid itself of viral rubella, known for causing miscarriages and severe birth defects, in 2004. And diphtheria, a highly fatal bacterial disease, was virtually eliminated after a vaccine was introduced in the 1940s. These are “key infectious diseases that we've eliminated from the U.S. through widespread vaccination,” says study co-author Nathan Lo, a physician-scientist at Stanford University.

Kiang, Lo and their colleagues ran multiple scenarios of childhood vaccination rates over 25 years to see if the four diseases would return to endemic levels (sustained transmission in which each infected person spreads the disease to at least one other person, on average, for a 12-month period). Measles—which is a very contagious disease and requires high population immunity to prevent spread—was the most susceptible to fluctuations in vaccination coverage. The models estimated that a 5 percent coverage decline would lead to an estimated 5.7 million measles cases over 25 years, while a 5 percent increase would result in only 5,800 cases.

Polio and rubella would require sharper vaccination rate downturns (around 30 to 40 percent) before reaching comparable risks of reemergence.

While projected diphtheria cases were notably lower, Lo notes that the illness has a relatively high fatality rate and can cause rapid deterioration: “Patients with diphtheria get symptomatic and within a day or two can die.”

Routine childhood immunization numbers have been slowly but steadily falling in recent years for several reasons, including missed appointments during the COVID pandemic and growing—often highly politicized—public resistance to vaccinations. “The idea of reestablishment of measles is not outrageous and certainly in the moment where we're looking at erosion of trust through our federal authorities about vaccination,” says Matthew Ferrari, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study.

Reduced U.S. vaccination rates can also cause “knock-on effects” that threaten disease eradication efforts around the world, Ferrari says. Additionally, recent funding cuts to international vaccine development programs such as USAID and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will “likely lead to increases in measles, rubella, diphtheria and polio elsewhere in the world,” he says. Outbreaks of these diseases in the U.S. largely start when unvaccinated American travelers pick one up while visiting a place where it's more common. “If you now add the consequences of defunding vaccination around the world, then that's going to increase the likelihood of these cases coming to the United States,” Ferrari says, adding that the study authors may have made “conservative assumptions” about these international factors.

But Ferrari says the study's scenarios assumed immediate—and in some cases unrealistically high—vaccination rate drop-offs without accounting for other possible public health efforts to control disease. “Even if we anticipated an erosion of vaccination in the United States, it probably wouldn't happen instantly,” Ferrari says. “Detection and reactive vaccination weren't really discussed in the paper, nor was the population-level response—the behavior of parents and the medical establishment. That's something we can't possibly know.... From that perspective, I think the scenarios were enormously pessimistic.”

Lo and Kiang argue that politically driven shifts in vaccine policy, such as reduced childhood vaccination requirements or a tougher authorization process for new vaccines, could make a 50 percent slump in vaccination rates less far-fetched. “I think that there was a lot of pushback from very smart people that 50 percent was way too pessimistic, and I think that—historically—they would have been right,” Kiang says. “I think in the current political climate and what we've seen, it's not clear to me that that is [still] true.”

Kiang and Lo say that while their study shows the dangers of vast vaccine declines, it also highlights how small improvements can make a massive difference.

“There's also a more empowering side, which is that the small fractions of population that push us one way can also push us the other way,” Lo says. “Someone might ask, ‘What is my role in this?' But small percentages [of increased vaccination], we find, can really push us back into the safe territory where this alternate reality of measles reestablishing itself would not come to pass.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

It's one of America's earliest and most enduring mysteries: what happened to the “Lost Colony of Roanoke?”

Before the Revolution, even before Jamestown, an English colony was established in what is now North Carolina. Intended as an additional source of income for the kingdom, conditions quickly turned harsh and supplies ran short.

A representative of the colony set out for England to seek assistance; but while reports of possible hostilities with the Native population in the New World might have normally tugged at the sympathies of the Crown, a conflict brewing between England and Spain kept any aid from coming to the colony for three years. When help finally arrived, it arrived to find no one there to be helped. The colonists, and virtually all traces of the colony, were gone. A single palisade remained, with the word CROATOAN carved into it (the name of a nearby indigenous tribe).

In the centuries since, the mystery of what became of the colonists at Roanoke has inspired stories, films, and even a long-running theatrical production at the very site the colony once stood. But now, an author, museum owner, and self-described “amateur archaeologist” claims to have solved this long-standing mystery. What's more, he asserts that there was no mystery at all, the colonists were never lost, and the whole story is merely “a marketing campaign.”

And he believes his latest discovery is “empirical evidence to prove it.”

Scott Dawson, the aforementioned author, museum proprietor, and president of the Croatoan Archaeological Society, did not find the buildings or the bodies that once populated the colony at Roanoke. But he, alongside archeologist and TV presenter Mark Horton, found some small flakes of rusted metal on Hatteras Island that they believe indicates the fate of the colonists who once lived 50 miles north at Roanoke.

These shavings, which the Daily Mail notes are “barely larger than a grain of rice,” are known as hammerscale, a byproduct of iron-forging. The indigenous population who populated the area, the Croatoan, would not have been conducting the type of blacksmithing that would produce these shavings, asserts Horton.

But the English would have.

“The hammerscale shows that English settlers lived among the Croatoans on Hatteras and were ultimately absorbed into their community,” Horton remarked to the Daily Mail. “Once and for all, this smoking gun evidence answers any questions about the supposed mystery of the lost colony.”

The pair have “been digging near Buxton on the Croatoan Hatteras Island for more than a decade,” uncovering weapons and other European artifacts in the area, all of which have been put on display in Dawson's museum in Buxton (unrelated to the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site, operated by the National Parks Service, whose museum sits adjacent to the original site of the colony). But they claim the hammerscale is more definitive proof than these previously found items, because “coins and sword hilts could have got to Hatteras through trade or a passing settler.”

To them, it's obvious that the colonists would have relocated and taken up with the Croatoan. “The lost colony narrative was a marketing campaign,” Dawson defiantly declared. “...and now we have empirical evidence to prove it.”

Dawson and Horton are not alone in the belief that the colonists went off to seek refuge with a friendly indigenous tribe. Many over the centuries have asserted such a conclusion; it even factors into the latest incarnation of the aforementioned theatrical production, “The Lost Colony,” performed at the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site. In fact, it's one of the more prominent theories as to the fate of the colony, so Dawson and Horton are not alone in their “assimilation” assertion.

However, they are also not alone in the pantheon of those confident that their latest archaeological discovery has solved the Lost Colony mystery “once and for all.”

When the legend of the Lost Colony took hold in the United States during the 19th century, in a fervor toward forging a sense of national identity, the focus was on Virginia Dare, the first English (or as she was more often touted then, first “white”) child born in the New World. In many of the stories crafted around the colony in this time, it was suggested that the innocent colonists were killed by angry Natives, as though to suggest there was some original sin in the American experiment that could justify the genocide perpetrated against the indigenous population throughout the Age of Jackson.

That particularly bloody theory was “confirmed” in the 1930s, with the “discovery” of the so-called Dare Stones, a series of 48 carved stones which revealed that Virginia Dare and her father were killed by natives in 1591. But in 1941, Boyden Sparks of The Saturday Evening Post exposed these stones to be merely a hoax. And so, the mystery of the Lost Colony endured.

More recently, a different North Carolina-based archaeology group known as the First Colony Foundation made their own noteworthy and well-publicized discovery, when they revealed that a 400-year-old map featured a hidden fort, never-before-discovered. When they excavated that site, some distance from Roanoke at the Bal Gra plantation along Salmon Creek, they found what they felt was fairly compelling evidence that at least some of the colonists had, in fact, left the colony and went north, to this area they dubbed Site X, as opposed to Hatteras Island. In their book, Excavating the Lost Colony Mystery, the First Colony Foundation doesn't claim to have a “smoking gun,” but instead lay out what they consider a prima facie argument in favor of their theory.

So, has the Lost Colony mystery been solved? In all honesty, probably. By someone, somewhere.

Now it's just a matter of figuring out whose solution that is.

It started with a bang, but won't end with one.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

While the universe might have started with a bang, it probably won't go out with one. But however it comes about, that end might be much sooner than we thought. 

If you ask astrophysicist Heino Falcke, quantum physicist Michael Wondrak, and mathematician Walter van Suijlekom, they'll tell you that those last days will not erupt into a cataclysmic explosion worthy of sci-fi special effects. Instead, the last remaining vestiges of all matter will just evaporate into particles floating in the void. In 2023, the trio theorized that it was possible for other objects besides black holes to slowly evaporate away via Hawking radiation, which aroused curiosity as to how soon it could possibly happen. Now, there is a hypothetical answer. 

But don't start doomsday prepping yet—Earth still has about 5 billion years left until it gets devoured by the Sun. So, according to the team, if our species manages to propagate beyond the Solar System and colonize some distant moon or planet, there are still another ~1078 years left for the universe. That's 1 with 78 zeroes after it. Even Twinkies won't last that long. 

It might seem unfathomable, but that mind-boggling max age for the universe is far lower than the previously predicted 101100 years (which is 1 with 1100 zeroes). While this prior hypothesis did include the time it would take for black holes to evaporate, it did not factor in the evaporation of other objects. 

“Using gravitational curvature radiation, we find that also neutron stars and white dwarfs decay in a finite time in the presence of gravitational pair production,” the researchers said in a study recently published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics.

When a pair of particles forms right on the lip of a black hole's gaping maw, one can be pulled in past the inescapable event horizon, while the other escapes into nearby space. Because those particles are supposedly quantum-entangled, that rogue particle could be carrying information about the insides of a black hole (until the Hawking Information Paradox kicks in, of course). This called Hawking radiation. It has long been thought that only black holes emitted Hawking radiation, but in their new study, these researchers posit that a similar phenomenon could affect other ultradense objects without event horizons, such as white dwarf stars (star corpses left when the gases of a red giant dissipate) and neutron stars.

Everything with mass has gravity that warps spacetime. The more dense an object, the greater the warp, but less massive objects still have some effect on the space-time continuum. Objects with strong gravitational fields evaporate faster—white dwarves, supermassive black holes, and dark matter supercluster haloes are expected to hold out for 1078 years, while neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes should hang around for about 1067 years. Anything with a gravitational field is prone to evaporating. (This includes humans, and could put a glitch in our quest for immortality. It should take 1090 years for our bodies to vanish.)

Even though the intense gravitational fields of black holes should cause them to evaporate faster, they put off total annihilation as long as possible because, unlike white dwarves or neutron stars, they have no surface and tend to reabsorb some escaped particles.

“In the absence of an event horizon, there is pair production outside the object which leads to particles hitting the surface and also pair production inside the object,” the researchers said. “We assume those particles to be absorbed by the object and to increase and redistribute internal energy. Both components will lead to a surface emission, which is absent in black holes.”

So, in enough years to cover 78 zeroes, all that will be left of black holes—and everything else in the universe—are particles and radiation. You (assuming immortality) and whatever you bought in bulk for doomsday will also evaporate. no matter when it comes, there really is no escape from the end.

As attacks on US science by the administration of President Donald Trump continue, countries worldwide are stepping up their efforts to recruit US research talent. 

In the past few months, governments and institutions have launched programmes to attract scientists from the United States, where the Trump administration has made deep cuts to research budgets and begun dismantling science agencies.

US brain drain: the scientists seeking jobs abroad amid Trump's assault on research

Efforts launched in regions including Europe, Canada, Australia and China range from enhanced funding opportunities to new programmes dedicated to wooing scientists, many backed by tens of millions of dollars (see ‘How nations are attracting scientists'). The trend has sparked a debate about whether luring US scientists abroad is the best way to support a global research community whose leading entity is under strain — and whether other nations can compete with historically high US levels of research funding. 

“We really should see this as a way of helping research globally and not as a way of poaching,” says Maria Leptin, president of the European Research Council (ERC), the continent's premier research funder. “I've referred to it as creating a haven.” As part of such efforts, the ERC is doubling to up to €2 million (US$2.2 million) the extra ‘start-up' money that researchers moving to Europe can apply for to help them establish their laboratories. The money could, for instance, pay to move a laboratory or set up a research team. 

That means the ERC now offers some grants worth up to €4.5 million over up to 5 years, making them competitive with US research awards. “It increases the grant sizes significantly,” says Leptin. “It should be a good incentive for people to come.”

The start-up funding is open to researchers moving from anywhere in the world to institutions in European Union countries and other nations associated with the EU's flagship science programme, Horizon Europe. “It's for anybody — and I think that's right,” says Leptin. “We've been wanting to do more,” she says. The US situation “was the straw that broke the camel's back to increase funding for this particular issue, at this particular time in history”.

The ERC's plans complement a broader initiative launched this month by the European Commission. The Choose Europe for Science programme, announced by commission president Ursula von der Leyen and backed by €500 million, is the most prominent of the talent-attraction initiatives. “The role of science in today's world is questioned,” said von der Leyen at the launch in Paris. “We need to offer the right incentives,” she said, “to make Europe a magnet for researchers.”

Other initiatives range from government-led programmes to those launched by individual institutions seeking researchers in particular disciplines.

The European Research Council is developing new, longer, larger ‘super grants' to draw the “very best” scientists. 

The Spanish State Research Agency's ATRAE programme, which is designed to attract international researchers, this year has a focus on US-based scientists. “We're offering an additional funding of €200,000 for researchers who have been selected and are coming from the US,” Spanish science minister Diana Morant told Nature. 

The Dutch Research Council has launched a fund to attract international scientists, regardless of nationality, to continue their work in the Netherlands.

The Research Council of Norway has launched a US$9.5-million scheme to recruit international researchers. The programme welcomes scientists working on climate, health, energy and artificial intelligence (AI). 

The Danish Chamber of Commerce has proposed a fast-track programme aimed at bringing up to 200 US researchers — in fields such as quantum technology, robotics and climate research — to Denmark over the next three years.

Austria wants to make it easier for universities to hire US researchers through a proposed amendment to the University Organization Act that would, in some cases, let institutions bypass the requirement to post job advertisements publicly for candidates who have spent at least two years doing research or teaching in the United States. “Austria stands as a bastion of security, favourable conditions and an unfettered research environment — qualities that are increasingly absent in the United States,” science minister Eva-Maria Holzleitner told Nature.

Paris-Saclay University has deployed several initiatives to support US researchers, including PhD contracts and funded visits for scholars. It also encourages them to apply through existing programmes, including its Alembert research-chair scheme and the Chateaubriand fellowship, and it says that tenure-track positions are on offer. 

The Paris Observatory is organizing a “special programme” to welcome USscientists who have lost their jobs or would prefer to work in France.

Aix Marseille University in France established the Safe Place For Science programme dedicated to welcoming US scientists in areas including climate, the environment and health. It is assessing its first round of applications. 

The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is “freeing up funds and establishing a dedicated contact point for American researchers who want to continue their work in Brussels”.

The Joint European Disruptive Initiative, a high-risk research foundation based in Paris, has launched the Transatlantic Science Fellows scheme to attract ten managers for its moonshot programmes, “starting with scientists from the Americas”, “at a time of global uncertainties”. 

The Toronto University Hospital Network has launched Canada Leads, a challenge to recruit 100 world-leading early-career scientists working across virology, regenerative medicine and areas “at risk due to shifting research funding landscapes globally”, a spokesperson says. The programme promises 2 years of funding and has received 300 expressions of interest since it was announced on 7 April. 

The University of Montreal in Canada has launched a Can$25-million (US$18-million) fundraising campaign to recruit leading and early-career researchers, including those facing pressures in the United States. The programme — which has raised nearly half its funding target — will support researchers in areas such as health, AI, biodiversity and public policy. 

The Australian Academy of Science has started a Global Talent Attraction Program to recruit US researchers working in areas of national need. The academy is seeking investors to fund the programme, but “there has been strong interest from US-based researchers and Australians wanting to return home”, says academy president Chennupati Jagadish.

In China, an advertisement began circulating on social-media platform X in February that said the technology city Shenzhen welcomes “global talents”, especially those dismissed by US institutions, Politico reported. Nature contacted several Chinese institutions to ask whether they were recruiting US scientists but did not receive a response. 

In France, where multiple schemes have emerged, the government has launched Choose France for Science to encourage international scientists who want to continue their work at French institutions. Operated by the French National Research Agency, the platform offers government funding to support institutions wanting to host relocating researchers. 

The Max Planck Society — Germany's prestigious network of research institutes — has started a Transatlantic Program, which aims to establish collaborative research centres with leading US institutions and will offer additional postdoc positions to US researchers. The society has committed €12 million and is working with US foundations to extend funding, a spokesperson says.

And, as some US scientists say that they are seeking jobs abroad, institutions have reported a rise in job inquiries from US researchers. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) is receiving an increasing number of unsolicited applications from US scientists, a spokesperson says, as is the University of Sydney in Australia, according to deputy vice-chancellor of research Julie Cairney.

But not everyone agrees that luring US talent is the right approach. “Trying to actively poach people away is just going to add to the serious problems some of our friends and colleagues in the US system currently face,” says Jan Löwe, director of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.

Metrics details

As reactive intermediates and substructures of natural products and bioactive molecules, the smallest cyclic alkanes—cyclopropanes—are an attractive class of molecules for chemists. Arguably, the most general approach to their chemical synthesis involves the addition of metal carbenes to olefins. Whereas catalytic asymmetric cyclopropanations of electronically unbiased olefins with carbenoids have been reported using chiral metal complexes and engineered metalloenzymes, we now report a complementary, metal-free and highly enantioselective cyclopropanation of olefins with diazoalkanes, applying asymmetric counteranion-directed photoredox organocatalysis. We identify an ion pair featuring a thioxanthylium photoredox cation and a chiral imidodiphosphorimidate counteranion that catalyses highly enantioselective cyclopropanations of styrenes and aliphatic dienes with diazo compounds. Mechanistic investigations reveal a wavelength dependence of the enantioselectivity and suggest that the main catalytic pathway proceeds via olefin-derived radical cation intermediates. This metal-free, highly enantioselective organocatalytic approach complements previously reported methods for alkene manipulations.

The synthesis of cyclopropanes1,2,3,4 via metal-catalysed carbene transfer from diazo compounds to olefins5,6,7,8 is among the best developed and most general cyclopropanations available. Enantioselective versions are documented, both with chiral metal complexes as catalysts and with engineered metalloenzymes. High effectiveness and stereocontrol have been accomplished with catalysts based on copper9, rhodium10 and ruthenium11. In particular, excellent levels of enantioselectivity have been achieved with copper(I) bisoxazoline complexes12 and with dinuclear rhodium(II) complexes, featuring chiral bidentate carboxylate, amidate or phosphate ligands13,14,15. A unique nickel carbene mediated cyclopropanation has also been reported16.

Biocatalytic, new-to-nature versions of this reaction were reported by Arnold et al. in 201317, using an engineered cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyses highly diastereo- and enantioselective cyclopropanations of styrenes with diazoesters. The Hartwig group developed iridium-modified myoglobins that catalyse the cyclopropanation of unactivated olefins18, and the Keasling group19 described a variant in which both the diazoester and the styrene were produced intracellularly. While the biocatalytic and the transition metal catalysed approaches are conceptually different, they share the initial formation of electrophilic metal carbenoids, which then engage in the actual olefin cyclopropanation (Fig. 1a). Despite these advancements, regioselectivity for substrates with multiple olefins remains a particularly challenging problem20,21,22,23. We became intrigued by the idea of designing a complementary organocatalytic approach that would not necessitate the involvement of metal carbenoids and could solve the regioselectivity problem. Organocatalytic cyclopropanations of olefins activated by an electron-withdrawing group have previously been reported24,25,26 but those of electronically unbiased olefins are unknown. Since organocatalytic activation modes for diazo alkanes or olefins, other than protonation by Brønsted acids, which appeared not to be suitable for the desired process, are not available, such a design immediately led to the challenge of how to organocatalytically activate simple olefins and/or diazo esters. We hypothesized that the abstraction of a single electron—arguably the most general strategy for activating any molecule—could be suitable here. Accordingly, we envisioned a catalytic cycle in which the olefin is activated as a radical cation upon single electron transfer to a photoexcited cationic organocatalyst associated with an enantiopure counteranion. The resulting highly reactive open-shell radical cation forms an ion pair with the enantiopure counteranion and is expected to undergo enantioselective carbon–carbon bond formation with the diazoalkane, accompanied by the loss of N2 to furnish a cyclopropane radical cation27,28,29. A final single electron transfer from the catalyst radical to this intermediate should then regenerate the cationic photocatalyst and deliver the desired cyclopropane product (Fig. 1b). This design is supported by a recently established radical cation-based photoredox catalytic cyclopropanation27 and by our own work on utilizing enantiopure counteranions in photoredox catalytic cycloadditions via olefin-derived radical cations30. The envisioned challenges associated with our concept are controlling the facial selectivity of a highly reactive open-shell radical cation intermediate and preventing the direct activation of diazoalkane to a free carbene via photolysis or energy transfer from the excited state photocatalyst, which could lead to racemic products31,32,33.

Herein, we report an organocatalytic regio- and stereoselective cyclopropanation of olefins, facilitated by asymmetric counteranion-directed photoredox catalysis (ACPC).

To initiate our investigation, we studied the cyclopropanation reaction of trans-anethole (1a) and diazoester 2a in a (1:1 v/v) solvent mixture of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and pentane at −100 °C under irradiation by 6 W of green light. We began by exchanging the counteranion of the synthesized thioxanthylium triflate34 organophotoredox catalyst with different confined imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi)35 anions (Fig. 2). Encouraged by our previous studies on IDPi-catalyzed transformations, we initially selected from our assortment of privileged IDPi anions. An IDPi catalyst possessing a para-tert-butyl group as 3,3′ substituent and a trifyl core (IDPi-A) delivered the corresponding cyclopropanated product with moderate yield, good enantioselectivity (80:20 er) and poor diastereoselectivity. An analogous meta-biphenyl IDPi (IDPi-B) gave improved yield (90%) and enantioselectivity (90:10 er). Using catalyst 4C where the 3,3′ substituents of the IDPi catalyst feature a combination of meta- and para-substitution, led to a further enhancement of the enantioselectivity (95:5 er) with a dr of roughly 3:1. Having identified an optimal catalyst towards enantioselectivity, we were keen to further improve the diastereoselectivity. In this regard, meta-,para-substituted catalysts were extensively evaluated (Supplementary Table 1), and among them, spirocyclic fluorenyl substitution on the 3,3′-positions of the BINOL was found to be suitable towards this aim (4D–F). To our delight, the modified spirocyclopentyl fluorenyl substitution on the 3,3′-positions of the BINOL (IDPi-E) delivered the product not only with excellent yield and enantioselectivity but also with excellent diastereoselectivity of >20:1. Finally, fine-tuning of the inner core sulfonamide from trifluoromethyl (IDPi-E) to n-perfluoroethyl (IDPi-F) enhanced the enantiomeric ratio from 97:3 to 99:1, maintaining the excellent yield and diastereoselectivity. Remarkably, even at −100 °C, catalyst 4F rapidly furnished product 3a in a short reaction time. Lowering the catalyst loading from 2.5 to 0.5 mol% still gave full conversion with high yield even though a slight reduction of enantioselectivity (96:4 er) was observed.

Optimization of the catalytic reaction for the evaluation of IDPi anions was carried out, and the yield was determined by 1H NMR using an internal standard.

Next, a broad range of olefins with different double bond location and substituents at different ring positions were evaluated (Fig. 3) in the reaction with diazoester derivatives, and the cyclopropane products were obtained with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Moreover, most of these products were obtained with excellent diastereoselectivities. 3-Ethyl anethole was found to be a suitable reaction partner and furnished product 3b with excellent enantioselectivity. Interestingly, 3,3-dimethyl anethole also delivered the desired product (3c) with excellent enantioselectivity, albeit with low diastereoselectivity. An olefin bearing an tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy (OTBS) substituent was also tolerated, providing product 3d with an er of 97:3 in 86% yield. Similarly, olefins featuring electron-withdrawing substituents and a heterocyclic ring furnished products 3e and 3f in excellent enantioselectivities. It is worth mentioning that other electron-rich heterocyclic olefins successfully engaged in our cyclopropanation and furnished products 3g and 3h with good to excellent level of enantioselectivity. Next, we focused on using electron neutral styrene derivatives as potential olefins for cyclopropanation. As their redox potential (>1.8 V) is higher than that of the used thioxanthylium photocatalyst (1.76 V), a photocatalyst featuring a higher redox potential was required. Gratifyingly, acridinium photocatalyst 5 (2.04 V), under red light irradiation, delivered products 3i and 3j with excellent enantioselectivity. Internal olefins gave products 3k and 3l in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. We explored different diazoesters and found that all of the different diazoesters gave the desired products (3m and 3n) with an excellent level of enantioselectivity. Additionally, a disubstituted diazoester was found to be a suitable partner for our cyclopropanation reaction and yielded the desired product 3o in good enantioselectivity and moderate diastereoselectivity. We also investigated a diazoalkanes featuring an N-H amide-, aromatic or aliphatic keto functionality, and all furnished the desired products (3p–r) with trans-anethole in moderate to good level of enantioselectivity. Finally, even trimethylsilyl-diazomethane reacted to product 3s with promising results.

Having successfully developed an organocatalytic cyclopropanation of olefins, we wondered whether our confined catalyst design may enable selectivity also with substrates bearing multiple olefins. For example, 2,5-dimethylhexa-2,4-diene (1t) is a symmetrical diene that has previously been used in the synthesis of chrysanthemic acid, a natural product also found in a variety of insecticides. In this case, the chemoselectivity issue towards obtaining the corresponding monocyclopropane has previously only been overcome by using a several fold excess of the diene23. Remarkably, using our organocatalyst system, chrysanthemic acid derivative 3t could be obtained selectively in good yield and good enantioselectivity for both diastereomers without requiring an excess of diene. Subsequently, a simple hydrolysis of ester 3t gave chrysanthemic acid (3u), preserving the enantioselectivity (Fig. 3b). We further explored the reactions of unsymmetrical conjugated dienes and trienes, delivering the desired products in good yield and enantioselectivities.

It is noteworthy that an unsymmetrical conjugated diene delivered product 3v with remarkable regioselectivity (>20:1 rr) and diastereoselectivity (>20:1 dr). A diene substrate bearing an additional pendant olefin functionality (1w) was also found to be suitable for our cyclopropanation. Even the reaction with conjugated and unsymmetrical triene 1x, posing a formidable regioselectivity challenge, selectively delivered product 3x (Fig. 3c). On the other hand, we also recognized the limitations of our reaction (Supplementary Fig. 2). Olefins bearing electron-withdrawing groups yielded the desired product in low amounts but with high enantioselectivity. Unfortunately, substrates containing amino-substituted aryl groups, indole-derived olefins, enol ethers and enamines remained unreactive under our reaction conditions. Additional diazo compounds were tested, furnishing the desired product in moderate to good yields with satisfactory enantioselectivity. However, we observed that acceptor–acceptor diazoalkanes did not undergo the transformation. Additionally, enantioenriched product 3a was derivatized to carboxylic acid product 6 without any loss of selectivities. Furthermore, a sequential reduction of the ethyl ester of 3a to the corresponding alcohol, followed by Steglich esterification gave ferrocene ester 7, the absolute configuration of which could be determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction.

During our reaction development, lowering the catalyst loading from 2.5 to 0.5 mol% still gave full conversion with a high yield. However, a slight reduction of enantioselectivity was observed (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the amount of diazoester was evaluated. Surprisingly, increasing the amount of the diazoester also led to a reduction of enantioselectivity (Fig. 4b). These two results hinted at a non-enantioselective, photochemical background pathway31,32,33. Since such a background reactivity may require a different wavelength, we were intrigued to explore light of different wavelengths. Indeed, a red shift was associated with a notable increase of enantioselectivity (Fig. 4c). To gain further insight into this phenomenon, we irradiated our model substrate 1a and diazoester 2a with blue or yellow light separately. Remarkably, irradiation with yellow light led to higher enantioselectivity, from 80% ee with blue light to 97% ee with yellow light. Similarly, when olefin substrates 1k and 1l were excited with yellow instead of blue light under similar conditions, an increase in enantioselectivity was observed. For example, for product 3l, the enantiomeric excess increased from 41.8% with blue light to 95.4% with yellow light (Fig. 4d).

To shed light on this unusual observation, we conducted absorption spectroscopy of diazoester and photocatalyst, where diazoester 2a has a maximum wavelenth of absorption (λmax) at 397 nm (Fig. 5a) and photocatalyst 4F has a λmax at 472 nm (Fig. 5b). Since the absorption band of photocatalyst 4F is very broad, the opportunity arose to excite the photocatalyst at different wavelengths and study the corresponding emission spectra. Photocatalyst 4F was excited at 472 nm (λmax) and also at a lower wavelength of 350 nm. Surprisingly, in addition to the usual emission spectra maximum at 627 nm, another maximum emission band was detected at 395 nm upon excitation at 350 nm (Fig. 5c). Interestingly the absorption band of the diazoester significantly superimposes with the emission band of the photocatalyst at lower wavelength (Fig. 5d), which led us to the hypothesis that it is this lower-wavelength excitation mode of the diazoester that is involved in the photochemical background pathway.

Q, quencher's concentration.

Steady-state fluorescence quenching experiments with the individual reactants were conducted to obtain Stern–Volmer plots and to identify the reagent that interacts with the excited state photocatalyst. Photocatalyst 4F was first excited at 470 nm, and quenching experiments were performed separately with different amount of anethole 1a and diazoester 2a. The corresponding Stern–Volmer plots (Fig. 5e) clearly indicate that anethole 1a is responsible for the fluorescence quenching, whereas diazoester 2a has virtually no effect at this concentration. A separate set of steady-state florescence quenching experiments was conducted where the photocatalyst 4F was excited at 350 nm. In contrast, the Stern–Volmer plot (Fig. 5f) shows significant fluorescence quenching with diazoester 2a. Further standard radical probe and radical clock experiments were conducted to rule out radical process and support the radical cation mechanism, which is in line with the mechanism proposed in literature (Supplementary Fig. 3). To gain further information regarding the stereo-specificity of our reaction, we conducted control experiment with Z-anethole (Supplementary Fig. 4). Interestingly, under our optimized conditions, all four possible diastereoisomers were obtained in good yields. Under the optimized condition, control experiments were performed where interconversion of anethole was not observed (Supplementary Fig. 4). These experiments further strengthen the stepwise mechanism, which is also in line with the literature. Additionally, the redox potentials of our reactants, catalyst and product were measured (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Key to the success of our organocatalytic cyclopropanation of olefins with diazoalkanes has been the use of ACPC, exploiting the positive charge of the olefin radical cation intermediate towards ion pairing with an enantiopure counteranion. Our methodology is useful for a broad range of substrates and complements previously reported metal and metalloenzyme catalyzed cyclopropanations. It also addresses the unsolved problem of regioselectivity in the reaction of substrates with different olefins. The observed wavelength-dependent enantioselectivity could serve as a valuable mechanistic probe for photoredox catalysis, potentially aiding in distinguishing between alternative reaction pathways. Observing enantioselectivity in ACPC at one wavelength confirms the involvement of radical cations in the enantiodifferentiating step, whereas its absence at this or another wavelength is consistent with alternative mechanistic pathways, such as energy transfer that proceed via neutral intermediates. Our results underscore the potential of ACPC for controlling the selectivity of radical cations in alkene manipulations, complementing previous reports.

The achiral anion of the photocatalysts was exchanged with the desired enantiopure anion using the salt metathesis technique. In a gas chromatography vial, photocatalyst (25–30 mg, 1.0 equiv.) and a corresponding chiral Brønsted acid catalyst (1.05 equiv.) were measured. Then, dichloromethane (300 μl) was added, followed by saturated NaHCO3 solution (1.1 equiv., 400 μl). The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min. Then, it was diluted with 1 ml of water and 1 ml of dichloromethane. The organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (5 ml x3). The organic layer was collected and dried with Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The obtained (>95% yield) solid colourful photocatalysts were used without further purification.

A gas chromatography glass vial was charged with a magnetic stirring bar and photocatalyst (0.025 equiv., 2.5 mol%). The photocatalyst was dissolved in a 1:1 (v/v) solvent mixture of CH2Cl2 and pentane (0.1 M with respect to 1a). At room temperature, anethole 1a (1 equiv.) was added followed by diazoester 2a (2 equiv.) in the dark. Then, the glass vial was transferred to a −100 °C cryostat and kept at this low temperature for 30 min and then irradiated with 6 W of green light. After the desired time, the light was switched off, and after 10 min, the reaction was then quenched with saturated K2CO3 in ethanol and allowed to warm up to room temperature. The crude reaction mixture was analysed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) using an internal standard and purified by SiO2 flash column chromatography using 5–10% acetone in pentane as eluent.

Metrics details

Acquired genetic alterations drive resistance to endocrine and targeted therapies in metastatic breast cancer; however, the underlying processes engendering these alterations are largely uncharacterized. To identify the underlying mutational processes, we utilized a clinically annotated cohort of 3,880 patient samples with tumor-normal sequencing. Mutational signatures associated with apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) enzymes were prevalent and enriched in post-treatment hormone receptor-positive cancers. These signatures correlated with shorter progression-free survival on antiestrogen plus CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. Whole-genome sequencing of breast cancer models and paired primary-metastatic samples demonstrated that active APOBEC3 mutagenesis promoted therapy resistance through characteristic alterations such as RB1 loss. Evidence of APOBEC3 activity in pretreatment samples illustrated its pervasive role in breast cancer evolution. These studies reveal APOBEC3 mutagenesis to be a frequent mediator of therapy resistance in breast cancer and highlight its potential as a biomarker and target for overcoming resistance.

Both endocrine and targeted therapies are used broadly to treat breast cancer; however, their potential for long-term disease control is limited by tumor evolution and acquired genetic alterations that promote drug resistance1. In estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cancers, alterations in several genes including ER (ESR1)2,3, neurofibromin (NF1)4,5 and v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2, or HER2)6 are common as tumors develop resistance to antiestrogen therapy. Such genetic alterations also occur after resistance to targeted therapies including cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibitors and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors7,8,9,10,11,12. The widespread prevalence of these heterogeneous and acquired genetic alterations has proven challenging to overcome despite the development of second-generation inhibitors such as selective ER degraders (SERDs), underscoring the need to understand the underlying processes of genomic instability and tumor evolution.

Detailed analyses of cancer genomes have identified mutational signatures that can promote tumor evolution, and potentially predict treatment strategies13,14,15. In breast cancer, single base substitution (SBS) signatures associated with the activity of APOBEC3 enzymes (COSMIC SBS2 and SBS13) are prevalent, suggesting their relevance to the underlying genomic instability. APOBEC3 proteins are cytidine deaminases that play roles in innate immunity by restricting viral replication and inhibiting retrotransposition16. Although APOBEC3 enzymes serve as protective factors against viral infections, their activity has been implicated in breast tumorigenesis and treatment resistance. Previous studies have linked high expression levels of specific APOBEC3 enzymes to inferior outcomes and tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive tumors17,18,19. Moreover, APOBEC3 mutational signatures are enriched in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) compared with primary breast cancers20,21, with APOBEC3 mutagenesis proposed to contribute toward clonal evolution during treatment with endocrine therapy (ET)22. These studies reveal a potential association of APOBEC3 mutagenesis with tumor progression and raise the possibility that these processes may be ongoing and contributory to resistance. Herein, we report that APOBEC3 mutagenesis driven by APOBEC3A (A3A) and APOBEC3B (A3B) facilitates breast cancer evolution independent of treatment exposure, leading to resistance against a diverse range of drugs through the induction of APOBEC3-class alterations in characteristic resistance-associated genes. The results highlight APOBEC3 mutagenesis as a biomarker for distinct resistance trajectories, suggesting alternative approaches to target these evolvable cancers.

To characterize the mutational landscape of treatment-sensitive and -resistant breast cancers, we leveraged a cohort including over 5,000 cases previously subjected to paired tumor-normal sequencing by the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) assay23. After excluding samples with sequencing-estimated low tumor purity (Methods), 3,880 high-quality samples from 3,117 patients were analyzed (Fig. 1a). This cohort constitutes a large collection of genomically profiled breast cancers coupled with detailed clinical annotation, including treatment and follow-up information, and is representative of the clinical diversity of the disease (Supplementary Table 1). We utilized the single multivariate analysis (SigMA) tool24 to deconvolute mutational signatures and assess their contribution to clinical characteristics and outcomes. SigMA has been validated previously for evaluating mutational processes, including homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), in solid tumors25,26,27. To benchmark its validity and fidelity to evaluate APOBEC3 mutational signatures in breast cancers assessed using a targeted sequencing panel, we downsampled publicly available whole exome sequencing (WES) data, including primary breast cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 1,019) and MBCs from Bertucci et al. (n = 617)20 as well as whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of primary breast cancers from Nik-Zainal et al. (n = 560)28 to the genomic footprint of the MSK-IMPACT panel. We compared the results of SigMA with the dominant signatures called on the WES and WGS data using several analytic tools29,30,31 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). SigMA displayed high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in detecting APOBEC3 as the dominant signature (Extended Data Fig. 1b). In addition to detecting APOBEC3 as the dominant signature, correlations for exposures calculated from simulated panels using SigMA and WES ranged from 0.75 to 0.79 (Extended Data Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 2). Finally, considering that SigMA requires at least five single nucleotide variants (SNVs) as input to assess mutational signatures from targeted sequencing, we found that only 0–4% of samples in the three analyzed WES/WGS datasets had fewer than five SNVs (Extended Data Fig. 1d) indicating the ability of SigMA to process most samples from such datasets.

Source data

Examining the 3,880 tumor samples with SigMA, the most prevalent, dominant mutational process was APOBEC3, consistent with previous WGS and WES studies13,20 (Fig. 1b). APOBEC3-dominant signature was found in 15.7% and 28.7% of primary and metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive (HR+)/HER2−, 18.5% and 33.1% of primary and metastatic HR+/HER2+, 30.2% and 20.6% of primary and metastatic HR−/HER2+ and 8.4% and 16.9% of primary and metastatic triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) (Fig. 1c), respectively. APOBEC3 exposures were significantly higher in HR+ and TNBC MBCs than in unmatched primary tumors (Extended Data Fig. 2a), suggesting a link to poor clinical outcomes. We next assessed the relationship between APOBEC3-dominant signature and genomic instability markers such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), fraction of genome altered (FGA) and whole-genome doubling (WGD). APOBEC3-dominant HR+ MBC had significantly higher FGA compared with primary breast cancers of the same subtype (Extended Data Fig. 2b), suggesting greater APOBEC3-mediated genomic instability in the metastatic setting. Conversely, APOBEC3-dominant HR+/HER2− tumors displayed significantly lower median FGA compared with non-APOBEC3 tumors independent of sample type (Extended Data Fig. 2c), with a similar trend in metastatic TNBC. The proportion of WGD was instead lower in APOBEC3-dominant HR+/HER2− MBCs compared with non-APOBEC3 tumors (Extended Data Fig. 2d). APOBEC3-dominant HR+ and TNBCs exhibited significantly higher median TMB than those with other mutational processes (Fig. 1d), underscoring the distinct impact of APOBEC3 mutagenesis. For MBCs with TMB of at least ten mutations per megabase, representing the current indication for the tumor agnostic use of anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) immunotherapy32, APOBEC3 constituted the dominant mutational process in most HR+/HER2− and HR+/HER2+ tumors (Fig. 1e). In terms of standard clinical characteristics, groups of APOBEC3-dominant and other dominant signatures were similar (Supplementary Table 3). However, in terms of tumor histology, invasive lobular breast cancers (n = 489) were associated more frequently with APOBEC3 mutational signature compared with invasive ductal and other histology types regardless of the sample type (Fig. 1f), consistent with previous evidence33.

Out of the 11 APOBEC family members, A3A and A3B have emerged as the main drivers of APOBEC3 mutagenesis34,35,36,37,38. To assess their expression in breast cancers harboring APOBEC3 mutational signatures, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 130 tissue samples using an A3A-specific antibody39 or an antibody that detects A3A/B/G40 (Fig. 2a). We detected weak to strong protein expression in 17 of 20 APOBEC3-dominant samples with the A3A/B/G antibody and 8 of 20 samples with the A3A-specific antibody, consistent with the reportedly weaker expression of A3A41,42. We also observed a weak to moderate correlation between APOBEC3 signature exposure and IHC-based expression in HR+/HER2− samples (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Given the known cell-cycle-dependent or episodic expression of APOBEC3 proteins43,44,45, and because mutational signatures reflect accumulation of genomic changes over the lifetime of a cell, these findings cannot establish whether high levels of expression are necessary for signature manifestation. Our findings suggest that mutational signatures might be a more robust method to detect tumors with APOBEC3 activity.

To evaluate directly whether A3A or A3B can cause APOBEC3 mutagenesis in breast cancer cells, we overexpressed HA-tagged wild-type (WT) enzymes and their catalytically inactive mutants (A3AE72Q or A3BE255Q) in ER-positive breast cancer cells lacking endogenous APOBEC3 activity46 using a doxycycline-inducible system (Extended Data Fig. 3b). We observed in vitro DNA deaminase activity with overexpression of both WT enzymes but not the mutant controls. To assess the acquired alterations upon A3A or A3B overexpression, we isolated single-cell parent clones and exposed them to doxycycline for 72 days to drive mutagenesis followed by expansion of several single-cell daughter clones (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, two out of four A3A WT-expressing daughter clones lost protein expression and deaminase activity (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Similar negative selection against A3A expression has been reported earlier34,39. We performed WGS of parent and daughter clones and analyzed acquired alterations. The lack of endogenous APOBEC3 activity in the model was confirmed by the absence of acquired APOBEC3 signature in the parental cells before doxycycline treatment (Fig. 2c). Among the daughter cells that maintained protein expression, A3A and A3B WT cells accumulated APOBEC3-context mutations (41.3–92.5% of the total SNVs in A3A and 6.7–12.5% in A3B), whereas the mutant cells did not (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 4). The daughter cells that lost A3A expression and activity did not display any acquired APOBEC3 exposure, further confirming the necessity of cytidine deaminase activity for signature accumulation. As an additional confirmation of the proficiency of SigMA to detect APOBEC3 signatures in a controlled experiment, we simulated the WGS of cell lines to the MSK-IMPACT panel and used SigMA to detect mutational signatures. Among the samples with at least five SNVs, SigMA successfully classified dA3AWT-5 as APOBEC3-dominant, confirming the high performance using the WES and WGS datasets (Extended Data Fig. 3d). The WT cells exhibited higher TMB compared with mutant controls (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Cells with APOBEC3 as the dominant signature—APOBEC3-positive cells—also accumulated increased clustered mutations characterized as kataegis47 and omikli48, which have been linked previously to APOBEC3 activity (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3f). Most mutations in the regions of kataegis were substitutions in the APOBEC3-enzyme-recognized TCN motifs, where C is the target cytosine (Fig. 2e).

In addition to single nucleotide changes, comparative analyses revealed other acquired genomic alterations, including insertions and deletions (indels), copy number alterations (CNAs) and structural variations (SVs) (Fig. 2f). To assess these non-SNV alterations in the clinical cohort, we performed WGS of five pairs of primary and metastatic patient samples (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 5), reflecting breast cancers with varying levels of APOBEC3 signatures. Some metastatic samples showed acquired APOBEC3 signature indicating APOBEC3 mutagenic activity during treatment resistance. As an example, we present the progressive evolution of an HR+/HER2− tumor to 100% APOBEC3 exposure over more than 20 years of clinical history and therapeutic pressure of several lines of treatment, including endocrine therapies, CDK4/6i, and PI3K-pathway inhibitors (paired samples from MSK-BR-WGS-03; Extended Data Fig. 3g). Similar to cell lines, APOBEC3-positive samples acquired clustered mutations characterized as kataegis (Fig. 2h). These samples also exhibited substantial genomic alterations including indels, CNAs, SVs and chromothripsis—a hallmark of APOBEC3 activity25,49 (Fig. 2i). This phenomenon, characterized by clustered chromosomal rearrangements in a single event causing complex genomic alterations, is observed in sample MSK-BR-WGS-05-M on chromosomes 15, 8 and X. Given the similarities with APOBEC3-positive cells, we conclude that A3A and A3B overexpression phenocopies APOBEC3-driven tumors in a deamination-dependent manner.

To investigate the relationship between APOBEC3 signature and therapy resistance, we leveraged the clinical annotations linked to our cohort and assessed outcomes of APOBEC3-dominant cases on various therapies. To avoid inconsistencies related to changes of APOBEC3 mutagenesis over time, only patients with biopsies acquired directly before the first dose of the indicated treatment (±30 days) were included. In HR+/HER2− MBC treated with first-line endocrine monotherapy (n = 111), APOBEC3-dominant tumors exhibited numerically shorter median progression-free survival (PFS) compared with tumors with other dominant signatures (Fig. 3a). For first-line therapy with CDK4/6i plus ET (n = 549), APOBEC3- and HRD-dominant MBC were associated independently with lower median PFS compared with other cancers regardless of ET partner and line of therapy (Fig. 3b) suggesting increased genomic instability confers resistance to standard frontline therapy in HR+/HER2− MBC. To further assess the clinical impact of APOBEC3 mutagenesis in MBC, we compared outcomes in patients receiving other treatments, including everolimus-based combinations for HR+/HER2− tumors and different chemotherapy regimens for HR+/HER2− and TNBC subtypes (Extended Data Fig. 4a–g). Our analysis in these smaller cohorts did not reveal a significant effect of mutational processes on treatment response.

To assess the causal relationship between therapy resistance and APOBEC3 mutagenesis, we employed our long-term doxycycline-treated APOBEC3-positive and APOBEC3-negative models. The growth rate of APOBEC3-positive A3AWT and APOBEC3-negative A3AE72Q cells was comparable under dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) treatment (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 6). When exposed to the SERD fulvestrant, A3AWT cells acquired resistance significantly faster than A3AE72Q cells. In a similar experiment with the weaker mutator A3B, two out of three replicates of A3BWT cells acquired resistance to fulvestrant, whereas none of the three A3BE255Q replicates developed resistance after 84 days of continuous drug exposure (Fig. 3d). A3A WT overexpression also led to a selective growth advantage of A3AWT cells on treatment with the CDK4/6i abemaciclib (Fig. 3e) and palbociclib (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Based on analysis of the acquired alterations using WGS, A3AWT cells continued to accumulate APOBEC3 signature mutations during resistance development (Fig. 3f), further implying a role of APOBEC3 activity in driving resistance.

We next tested the effect of endogenous APOBEC3 enzymes in facilitating resistance. For this, we used the HER2+ models with endogenously active APOBEC3 mutagenesis that is predominantly driven by A3A36. Similar to our ER-positive models, the APOBEC3-positive BT-474 WT cells acquired resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib significantly faster than the APOBEC3-negative A3A knockout (KO) cells (Fig. 3g). BT-474 cells also maintained endogenous APOBEC3 activity during treatment pressure (Fig. 3h), confirmed by WGS of pre- and post-treatment cells. We also observed a significant growth advantage of MDA-MB-453 WT cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitors lapatinib and neratinib (Extended Data Fig. 4i–k). WT cells selectively gained resistance to other anti-HER2 therapies including an inhibitor of the downstream target AKT kinase (AKT), MK2206 (Fig. 3i) or the antibody–drug conjugate, T-DXd (Fig. 3j). Overall, our data demonstrate that APOBEC3 activity can promote therapy resistance in several contexts.

To understand mechanistically how APOBEC3 mutagenesis drives resistance in breast cancers, we assessed whether alterations in genes linked to therapy resistance were induced specifically by APOBEC3 mutagenesis. We first conducted a gene enrichment analysis using the MSK-IMPACT breast cancer cohort. To address potential biases from the APOBEC3-induced hypermutator phenotype, we applied a permutation test (Methods). We observed a significant enrichment of oncogenic mutations affecting PIK3CA, CDH1 and KMT2C (Ppermutation < 0.1, mutated in >5% samples) in metastatic/post-treatment HR+/HER2− APOBEC3-dominant tumors (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 7). Similarly, APOBEC3-dominant, treatment-naive HR+/HER2− or all TNBC samples also exhibited an enrichment of PIK3CA variants compared with non-APOBEC3-dominant tumors (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). Oncogenic mutations in other resistance-associated genes such as NF1 and ZFHX3 were also enriched in APOBEC3-dominant samples, albeit at lower frequencies (2.8% for NF1 and 1.1% for ZFHX3). We next examined acquired alterations in patients with HR+/HER2− breast cancer who had several tumor samples collected over time (n = 449 with two samples, n = 43 with at least three samples), focusing on APOBEC3-context mutations in samples with evidence of APOBEC3 activity. After de novo genotyping of somatic mutations (Methods), we observed an enrichment of APOBEC3-context, acquired alterations in genes encoding transcription factors linked previously to ET resistance, such as ARID1A and ZFHX3 (refs. 50,51). These alterations were enriched in treatment-resistant tumors with dominant APOBEC3 signature compared with non-APOBEC3-dominant samples (q = 0.08 for ARID1A, q = 0.08 for ZFHX3) (Fig. 4b). The proportions of acquired alterations in key genes of the PI3K/AKT pathway, including PIK3CA (q = 0.4) and PTEN (q = 0.5), and other resistance-linked genes such as KMT2C (q = 0.2) were also numerically higher in APOBEC3-dominant, therapy-resistant samples. We found that the proportion of APOBEC3-context mutations exclusive (acquired) to later-stage samples was notably higher than those shared with earlier or treatment-naive samples from the same patient (51.9% versus 32.3%; Fig. 4c) suggesting an active role of APOBEC3 mutagenesis in driving the resistance-linked mutations described above.

Source data

Alterations in ESR1 are the most frequent acquired resistance alterations in MBC. In our paired analysis of HR+/HER2− samples, we observed that 17% of APOBEC3-dominant samples presented with ESR1 alterations compared with 27% non-APOBEC3-dominant samples (q = 0.4; Fig. 4b). To explore this further, we examined site-specific gene enrichment of all genes included in the MSK-IMPACT panel that were previously linked to ET resistance (Extended Data Fig. 6). Strikingly, ESR1 E380Q mutations—an APOBEC3-context substitution—were enriched specifically in APOBEC3-dominant, HR+/HER2− post-treatment samples (q = 7.8 × 10−12; Fig. 4d). By contrast, highly activating ESR1 mutations in the helix 11–12 loop (L536X, Y537X and D538X, none of which are APOBEC3-context substitutions) were rare (8%) in APOBEC3-dominant samples, suggesting that APOBEC3-dominant tumors might not dominantly reactivate ER as the mechanism of endocrine resistance. Among other common mutations, PIK3CA hotspot mutations, such as E545K (P = 2 × 10−10) and E542K (P = 4.5 × 10−6), which are APOBEC3-context mutations, were detected predominantly in APOBEC3-dominant HR+/HER2− post-treatment samples (Fig. 4d), confirming the enrichment of PIK3CA helical domain mutations in APOBEC3-dominant breast cancers52. These findings suggest that APOBEC3 contributes to site-specific resistance-associated alterations, but not necessarily all resistance-causing changes, also exemplified by those observed for the tumor suppressor RB1 (Fig. 4e).

As a salient example of involvement of APOBEC3 mutagenesis in acquired resistance to ET, we explored in depth the WGS of patient MSK-BR-WGS-05 (Fig. 2g) who received ET including the selective ER modulator tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitor letrozole. Of the acquired mutations, 95% were assigned to APOBEC3 signature (Fig. 4f), implying that APOBEC3 mutational processes were active at some point during progression and resistance development. The cancer specifically acquired APOBEC3-context pathogenic mutations in PIK3CA (E545K) and RAD51C (P21S) (Fig. 4g). In terms of CNAs, the cancer maintained the FGFR1 amplification and PIK3R1 deep deletion from the primary sample and acquired an amplification in AURKA in the metastatic sample (Fig. 4h). We observed a high-density kataegis region in chromosome 19, in the gene CIC, which presented a deep deletion in both the primary and the metastatic samples (Fig. 4i). The proximity of such clustered mutations that are highly associated with APOBEC3 activity, hints at a role for APOBEC3 mutagenesis in contributing to some such CNAs in addition to the point mutations. We also detected evidence of such chromosomal rearrangements in our APOBEC3-positive cells tested for therapy resistance. In one case, upon A3A WT overexpression, the T47D daughter cells (dA3AWT-5) acquired a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) event in chromosome 13 (Fig. 4j). Similar chromosome 13 LOH was present in three out of six APOBEC3-positive cells but none of the ten APOBEC3-negative cells (P = 0.035). When dA3AWT-5 cells were exposed to abemaciclib, they selectively acquired APOBEC3-context mutations in RB1. Q217* was the SNV observed most frequently in RB1 in our clinical cohort, enriched in APOBEC3-dominant cases (Fig. 4e). The lone non-APOBEC3-dominant case with this mutation nonetheless exhibited 63.5% of APOBEC3 signature contribution, suggesting a causal role of APOBEC3 mutagenesis in inducing this truncating mutation. These loss-of-function mutations in RB1 led to a complete loss of RB1 protein expression (Fig. 4k) and insensitivity to abemaciclib. The resistance was also confirmed by an increase of ~31-fold in half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of the resistant cells compared with DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 4l). In another example, MDA-MB-453 WT cells, which exhibit endogenous A3A-driven mutagenesis, developed resistance to abemaciclib through a chromothripsis event targeting the YAP1 locus on chromosome 11 (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). This event resulted in elevated YAP1 expression and increased expression of its downstream target gene, CDK6 (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d), which is a known and targetable mechanism of resistance to CDK4/6i7,53,54. Overall, these cases illustrate both pre-existence of APOBEC3 mutagenesis before drug exposure, but also the marked accumulation and diversification over time, arguing for APOBEC3 being an active mutagenic process. Together with the clinical observations, our data reveal that APOBEC3 mutagenesis leads specifically to APOBEC3-class alterations that drive therapy resistance and promote lethal outcomes in MBC.

Our results establish a causal role for APOBEC3 mutagenesis in promoting resistance in HR+/HER2− breast cancers, revealing the necessity of improving targeting of APOBEC3-dominant tumors. In the absence of reliable APOBEC3-targeting agents, we explored whether we could exploit the specific biomarkers enriched in APOBEC3-dominant tumors that serve as indications for targeted therapies (PIK3CA mutation for PI3Kα-selective inhibitors55 and high TMB for anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies56). We identified 39 TMB-high, HR+/HER2− MBC patients who received anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Although no statistically significant difference in median PFS was observed in APOBEC3-dominant versus non-APOBEC3-dominant tumors (first/second line, 5.1 versus 3.9 months; more than second line, 1.7 versus 1.7 months; Extended Data Fig. 8), patients treated in earlier lines (first/second lines) displayed a numerically longer PFS. Among these (n = 14), all patients with APOBEC3-dominant tumors showed disease control (Fig. 5a). We next examined patients who received PI3Kα-selective inhibitors for HR+/HER2− MBC. Although numbers were limited to effectively compare PFS based on dominant signatures (fewer than four lines, n = 21), several APOBEC3-dominant cases were treated for over 6 months (n = 5 of 8), with one patient responding for more than 30 months (Fig. 5b). We found a higher rate of double PIK3CA mutations among APOBEC3-dominant cases, regardless of TMB category (Fig. 5c), suggesting that APOBEC3 mutagenesis may promote mutations that sensitize tumors to PI3Kα-selective inhibitors57.

Groups were compared using the two-tailed Wilcoxon test. Boxplots display the first quartile (Q1), median and third quartile (Q3), with whiskers extending to the nearest datapoints within Q1 − 1.5 × IQR and Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.

Finally, given the potential utility of earlier identification and use of targeted and combination therapies in breast cancer, we explored whether APOBEC3 signatures might be evident in earlier stages using the paired cohort (Fig. 5d). Over 60% of cases with APOBEC3 as the dominant signature at a later timepoint also showed it at an earlier timepoint, with a median exposure of 64% (interquartile range (IQR), 39–85%; Fig. 5e). These findings reveal a persistent role for APOBEC3 mutagenesis in most cases, rather than a de novo acquisition during treatment exposure, and highlight the potential of APOBEC3 signatures to identify tumors at risk for development of treatment resistance.

In this report, we demonstrate that treatment refractory, poor prognosis breast cancers are marked by pervasive APOBEC3 mutagenesis. In patient samples and laboratory models, APOBEC3 enzymes A3A and A3B drive tumor evolution and treatment resistance by inducing APOBEC3-context alterations in resistance-associated genes. Although APOBEC3 activity promotes new, subclonal alterations mediating resistance, evidence for APOBEC3 activity is detectable in pretreatment samples, suggesting APOBEC3 signatures as potential biomarkers and revealing alternatives to targeting these high-risk cancers.

Although identifying specific mutations that mediate therapy resistance in advanced cancers has led to improved second-generation inhibitors or combinations, many cancers evolve to subvert these therapies too. This highlights the need to understand the evolutionary processes enabling resistance. Such insights can identify the cancers at risk for future resistance and inform strategies to overcome it. The widespread prevalence of APOBEC3 mutational signatures in MBC suggested its relevance for tumor evolution, prompting us to examine its specific function in this context.

First, by examining a cohort of patients with detailed treatment histories, we established that APOBEC3 mutagenesis is associated with shorter outcomes on targeted therapies, including antiestrogen monotherapy and antiestrogen plus CDK4/6i combinations among HR+ cancers. To evaluate causality of APOBEC3 mutagenesis in resistance, we utilized laboratory models in which APOBEC3 mutagenesis was either introduced or abrogated. In both cases, APOBEC3 mutagenesis reproducibly accelerated the capacity of tumor cells to develop resistance. In some models, this process drove resistance by introducing the same alterations observed in patients with therapy resistance such as RB1 loss-of-function mutations after exposure to CDK4/6i. Our clinical data also point to resistance alterations (for example, ESR1 E380Q or ARID1A truncating mutations), among APOBEC3-dominant tumors generated in the A3A or A3B context. These findings establish APOBEC3 activity as a key factor in therapy resistance, raising questions about additional types of genomic alterations enriched in APOBEC3-dominant tumors, the role of A3A and/or A3B in these alterations and when these changes occur in disease progression.

The timing of APOBEC3 mutagenesis remains controversial, with evidence for both persistent and staggered events44. Moreover, the enrichment of APOBEC3 mutagenesis in MBC compared with primary disease has further raised the question of whether APOBEC3 activity is ‘acquired,' such as ESR1 mutations, or is intrinsic to the evolvable nature of these cancers. The ability to profile a large cohort of paired primary and metastatic tumors provides some answers. We identified that 60% of APOBEC3-dominant tumors had APOBEC3 signatures at earlier stages, and 95% showed A3A or A3B protein expression, supporting the idea that APOBEC3 activity exists early on. This is consistent with our finding of APOBEC3 signatures in some pre-invasive breast lesions33,58, and is distinct from other cancer types where APOBEC3 activation may be initiated by targeted therapy itself59,60. The pre-existence of APOBEC3 in breast cancer establishes the potential for the development of biomarkers that can detect this underlying evolvability before exposure to therapy. Such biomarkers are likely to be the first step toward enabling treatment strategies that overcome resistance and limit the use of unnecessary therapies to those not at risk of such evolution.

There has been limited evaluation of therapies specifically for APOBEC3-dominant cancers. The genomic patterns of APOBEC3-dominant tumors reveal two promising targets. First, APOBEC3-dominant tumors often harbor mutations in the helical domain of PIK3CA and double PIK3CA mutations, indicating a unique dependence on the PI3K pathway. This suggests a subset uniquely vulnerable to PI3K-targeting therapy in early stages before resistance mutations arise11,61. Second, APOBEC3-dominant tumors often display high TMB, an indication for immune checkpoint blockade across solid tumors32. Indeed, a subset of patients treated under this indication were APOBEC3-dominant and, among these, several prolonged responses were observed in the metastatic, treatment-refractory setting. The potential for improved efficacy of immunotherapies in early-stage disease raises the possibility of using APOBEC3 as a biomarker where the field currently lacks determinants of benefit62. However, even beyond these possibilities, many existing therapies (CDK4/6i, antibody–drug conjugates, and so on) may benefit from signature-based biomarkers that incorporate a cancer's potential for evolution.

This study has several limitations that will be important to address with future research. First, the clinic-genomic cohort was evaluated by targeted panel sequencing with reduced information than WGS/WES. Although we have taken steps to ensure the fidelity of our findings, the use of WGS will probably enable further understanding of the clinical scope of APOBEC3 mutagenesis. Another limitation is the preponderance of ER-positive tumors in our cohort, reducing our ability to ascertain how APOBEC3 mutagenesis impacts disease progression in other breast cancer subtypes. Moreover, the large proportion of metastatic cases limits analysis of the role of APOBEC3 on relapse of early-stage disease. Larger cohorts of primary cancers with long-term follow-up, including cases that never relapse, are needed to assess the specific contributions of APOBEC3 mutagenesis to metastatic relapse and resistance to adjuvant therapies.

In closing, we find that APOBEC3 mutagenesis represents a highly prevalent driver of genomic instability in breast cancer, contributing specifically to resistance to endocrine and targeted therapies. Our results further demonstrate that APOBEC3 activity can be detected before exposure to therapies in breast cancer, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in this disease.

This study was approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Institutional Review Board (12-245) and all patients provided written informed consent for tumor sequencing and review of medical records for demographic, clinical and pathology information. A total of 5,831 breast cancer samples, which underwent prospective genomic profiling by the MSK-IMPACT targeted sequencing panel9,63,64 from January 2014 to December 2021, were retrieved. After removing samples with a sequencing-estimated tumor purity <20% (see below), a total of 3,880 breast cancer samples from 3,117 patients were included. Demographics, pathologic and detailed clinical information was collected until date of data freeze (June 2022).

Histological subtypes, tumor stage at diagnosis, tumor grade of primary breast cancer and receptor status were determined as described in Razavi et al.9. Briefly, breast cancer histological subtypes were classified as either invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma or mixed/other histologic types. Tumor grade was defined based on the Nottingham combined histologic grade of the primary breast cancer. The primary tumors with total tumor score of 3–5 were classified as G1 (well differentiated); 6–7 as G2 (moderately differentiated) and 8–9 as G3 (poorly differentiated). Patients were classified into breast cancer subtypes based on ER and progesterone receptor IHC results and the HER2 IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization results rendered at the time of diagnosis in accordance with the American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathology guidelines65,66.

Each patient in our cohort was assigned a singular receptor status. Recognizing potential intertumoral heterogeneity, we sought a unified definition as follows: (1) in cases where any metastatic biopsy was sequenced, receptor status was defined by treating clinician interpretation and assigned first-line treatment; (2) in cases where only a primary tumor is sequenced, receptor status was defined by receptor status of the sequenced primary. Employing these definitions, our cohort consisted of 2,133 patients (68.4%) with HR+/HER2− tumors, 276 (8.9%) with HR+/HER2+ tumors, 149 (4.8%) with HR−/HER2+ tumors and 559 patients (17.9%) with TNBC.

Breast cancer samples underwent tumor-normal sequencing by the United States Food and Drug Administration-authorized MSK-IMPACT assay, which targets between 341 (2014) and 505 (2021) cancer-related genes. Genomic data extracted from MSK-IMPACT included somatic SNVs, CNAs, SVs and additional genomic metrics (TMB, mutations per Mb) and FGA (the percentage of the genome affected by CNAs63,64). Somatic mutations were classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic or predicted oncogenic as defined by OncoKB annotation67. We used FACETS68 to define the allele-specific gene amplifications and homozygous deletions, tumor purity and ploidy, as previously described69. WGD status was inferred from MSK-IMPACT sequencing data, as previously described69. Briefly, tumor samples were considered to have undergone WGD if the fraction of major allele greater than one was >50%.

Although SigMA was designed originally to identify tumors positive for HRD, it has also proven effective in accurately classifying other types of mutational signatures, excelling particularly with APOBEC3 signatures25. SBS2 and SBS13 exhibit distinct trinucleotide context spectra, differing strongly from flat signatures like SBS3 and SBS5, or other specific signatures such as POLE and SMOKING, even with a minimal number of mutations for analysis. We thus aimed to independently assess the ability of SigMA to detect APOBEC3 signatures in breast cancer samples across three distinct datasets: TCGA breast cancers (primary, WES), Bertucci et al.20 (metastatic, WES) and Nik-Zainal et al.28 (primary, WGS). To validate SigMA, we adopted the same simulation approach as its developers, which involves MSK-IMPACT panel simulation.

This method is based on the concept that a high-quality signature evaluation requires a substantial mutation count, achievable only through WES and WGS. We initially computed signatures using real WES and WGS data, considering these results as the ground truth. Subsequently, we simulated MSK-IMPACT samples by reducing the mutations in each WES and WGS sample to only those within genomic regions covered by the MSK-IMPACT panel (version impact 468). SigMA (v.1.0.0.0) was then applied to these simulations to determine exposure and the dominant signature. Finally, we compared these outcomes with the established ground truth to obtain performance metrics, focusing on the ability to predict APOBEC3-dominant samples. Only samples with greater or equal to 5 SNVs in the simulated panel were considered for performance metric analysis.

To validate findings on MSK-IMPACT and provide further information regarding the evolution of APOBEC3 mutagenesis over time, WGS was carried out on five pairs of selected primary and MBC patient samples by the MSK's Integrated Genomics Operations using validated protocols25,27. Briefly, microdissected tumor and germline DNA were subjected to WGS on HiSeq2000 (Illumina). The median sequencing coverage depth of 102× (range, 88×–132×) for tumor and 44× (range, 36×–58×) for normal samples. In addition, genomic DNA was extracted from 29 cell lines using the E.Z.N.A Tissue DNA Extraction Systems (Omega Bio-Tek, cat. no. 101319-018) and subjected to WGS, with a median sequencing coverage depth of 63× (for T47D lines) or 33× (for BT-474 lines) (range, 28×–103×).

For samples and cell lines subjected to WGS, data were processed through a validated bioinformatics pipeline25,27. Initially, sequence reads were aligned to the human reference genome GRCh37 utilizing the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA, v.0.7.15)70. SNVs in both WGS and MSK-IMPACT analyses were identified using MuTect (v.1.0)71. Indels were detected by employing a suite of tools: Strelka (v.2.0.15)72, VarScan2 (v.2.3.7)73, Platypus (v.0.8.1)74, Lancet (v.1.0.0)75 and Scalpel (v.0.5.3)76. CNAs and LOH assessments were conducted using FACETS (v.0.5.6)68. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes deemed deleterious/loss-of-function, or those targeting a known mutational hotspot in oncogenes, were classified as pathogenic. Hotspot-targeting mutations were annotated with reference to cancerhotspots.org (ref. 77).

Structural variants were identified using Manta (v.0.29.6)78, SvABA (v.1.1.0)79 and Gridss (v.2.13.2)80 from WGS data. Structural variants identified by at least two of the three callers were retained and utilized for subsequent analyses. Setup and call procedures are described in detail in their respective code repositories: for Manta, https://github.com/ipstone/modules/blob/master/sv_callers/mantaTN.mk and for SvABA, https://github.com/ipstone/modules/blob/master/sv_callers/svabaTN.mk. These processed SV calls, along with additional genomic data (SNVs, indels, CNAs), were integrated to create circos plots via the signature.tools.lib R package81 (code repository https://github.com/Nik-Zainal-Group/signature.tools.lib, v.2.4.0) using Rcircos (v.1.2.2) package. For all patients and cell lines with more than one sample, all unique variants from any samples in a given patient or cell line were genotyped in all other samples from the same patient or cell line using Waltz (v.3.2.0) (https://github.com/mskcc/Waltz).

We have applied various tools to compute mutational signatures across different types of data. For WES data, DeconstructSigs (v.1.8.0)31, MutationalPatterns (v.3.4.1)30 and SigProfiler (v.0.0.25)29 were employed. For WGS data, we opted for Signal82 and, for the MSK-IMPACT panel, SigMA was used. The DeconstructSigs method is designed to identify the most accurate linear combination of predefined signatures that reconstructs a tumor sample's mutational profile. This method employs a multiple linear regression model. DeconstructSigs—an R package extension—leverages the Bioconductor library at CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/). MutationalPatterns operates as a non-negative least squares optimization algorithm. The non-negative least squares problem is studied extensively, and MutationalPatterns utilizes an R-based active set method from the pracma package (v.2.3.8) for its ‘fit_to_signatures' function, available at CRAN. We ran MutationalPatterns with two different settings: ‘regular' and ‘strict'. The ‘strict' method suffers less from overfitting but can suffer from more signature misattribution. SigProfiler attributes a set of known mutational signatures to an individual sample, determining the activity of each signature and the probability of each causing specific mutation types. It integrates SigProfilerMatrixGenerator (v.1.2.5) for its functionality. We also used SigProfilerSimulator (v.1.1.4) and SigProfilerClusters (v.1.0.11) to assess the clustered mutations. Signal is considered one of the best state-of-the-art tool for WGS, offering a comprehensive workflow for mutational signature analysis. We set the number of bootstraps to 100, sparsity threshold type was fixed, sparsity threshold was 5% and sparsity P value was 0.05. Kataegis was detected using the Signal web portal (https://signal.mutationalsignatures.com).

SigMA can process samples with at least five somatic SNVs, making it particularly suitable for MSK-IMPACT samples. It encompasses five steps: discovery of mutational signatures in WGS data using NMF; clustering to determine tumor subtypes; simulation of cancer gene panels and exomes; calculation of likelihood, cosine similarity, and signature exposure; and training of gradient boosting classifiers for a final score. SigMA score thresholds are established based on simulated data, considering tumor type and sequencing platform.

The dominant mutational signature in each MSK-IMPACT sample, that is, the primary mutational process occurring in a cancer genome, was assessed using SigMA. We translated mutational exposures into percentages for cross-sample comparisons. For all other tools used in WGS and WES data, the dominant signature was defined as the mutation process with the highest percentage of exposure. This included groupings as Clock (SBS1 + SBS5), APOBEC3 (SBS2 + SBS13), HRD (SBS3 + SBS8) and considering Other signatures independently (for example, SBS17, SBS18, and so on). The process with the maximum exposure was considered dominant. To determine whether a mutation was APOBEC3-context, we identified characteristic peaks from cosmic signatures related to SBS2 (C>T mutations in the contexts TCA, TCC, TCG, TCT) and SBS13 (C>G mutations in the contexts TCA, TCC, TCG, TCT; C>A mutations in the contexts TCA, TCC, TCG, TCT), as described previously25.

All patients included in the treatment outcome analyses were treated at MSKCC. The exact regimen, dates of start and stop therapy, as well as date of progression was annotated via expert review. Progression events were defined as (1) radiographic or clinical event prompting change in systemic therapy or recommendation for locally targeted radiation therapy, (2) documented clinician impression detailing progression, after which there was documented patient or MD preference to continue same therapy, as previously described9.

We determined the association between dominant mutational signature and PFS with disease progression on therapy with ET ± CDK4/6 inhibitors or patient death. ETs, either as monotherapy or as partner of CDK4/6 inhibitors were categorized as following: aromatase inhibitor versus selective ER degrader. The log rank test was used to compare the survival distributions among two or more groups. Both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models (stratified by ET partner, and treatment line where available) were applied. For patients with several lines of therapy from the same class of treatment, only the first treatment line from that class that was started after the MSK-IMPACT biopsy was included in the analysis.

To assess the correlation between APOBEC3 enrichment and the occurrence of SNVs within a gene, we adapted a method previously described83 for our dataset. The aim was to detect potential correlations between mutations in specific genes and APOBEC3 enrichment. To mitigate the impact of high TMB in APOBEC3-dominant samples, high frequency of mutations in longer genes, or the presence of high frequency genetic alterations in breast cancer, we applied a permutation-based method aimed at standardizing the overall mutation count for each sample and gene. This process randomized the gene × sample binary mutation matrix while preserving the mutation counts for each gene and sample, following the approach described by Strona et al.84. In this matrix, rows represent samples and columns represent genes, with ‘1' indicating a mutation and ‘0' indicating a wild-type nonmutated gene. We conducted an APOBEC3 enrichment analysis across all genes using a Wilcoxon rank sum P value to compare APOBEC3 exposure in mutant versus wild-type samples for each gene. To correct for multiple testing, P values were adjusted for the false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. For the original dataset and each of 10,000 permutations, we calculated the P value_observed and P value_Random, respectively (for a total of 10,000 P value_Random). The final P value was calculated as the number of permutation iterations where P value_Random ≤ P value_observed, divided by the total number of permutations (10,000), ensuring a fair assessment of gene-mutation frequencies across samples with high mutation burdens. For the permutation analysis, we utilized the R package EcoSimR (v.0.1.0). The permutation test was carried out under various conditions, separately for HR+/HER2− and for TNBC in both primary and metastatic settings, using pathogenic and likely pathogenic SNPs by OncoKB annotation. For each data group, we filtered for genes mutated in at least 1% of the subset obtained and for samples with at least one mutation in one of these genes. This filtering was necessary to ensure the EcoSimR package performed correctly during the randomization process. To compute P values, odds ratio, FDRs and other statistics we used different functions from the Python packages scipy (v.1.10.0) and statsmodels (v.0.13.2), whereas for visualization we used matplotlib.

To investigate the evolution of mutational processes over time, we subset the initial cohort of 3,800 breast cancers from MSK-IMPACT identifying patients with HR+/HER2− subtype and several tumor samples collected over time and various treatments (patients with two samples, n = 449; patients with three or more samples, n = 43). Tumor sample pairs with complete somatic mismatches on the levels of SNVs, indels and/or CNAs were excluded.

To assess whether a somatic mutation was truly acquired over time and exposure to therapy, somatic mutations identified in samples collected afterward were interrogated in the matched respective primary tumor/first metastatic biopsy in a matched tumor-informed manner (genotyping) using Waltz (https://github.com/mskcc/Waltz), which required at least two duplex consensus reads, comprising both strands of DNA, to call a somatic SNV at a site known to be altered in the matched tumor sample from a given patient, as described previously85.

Immunohistochemical analyses were conducted on a Leica Bond III automated stainer platform. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE; 4 μm thick) tissue sections were subjected to heat-based antigen retrieval for 30 min using a high pH buffer solution (Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 2; Leica, cat. no. AR9640). Subsequently, they were incubated with the A3A-13 (LQR-2-13 (UMN-13)) or the A3B (5210-87-13) primary antibodies at a 1:2,500 and 1:200 dilution, respectively for 30 min. A polymer detection system (Bond Polymer Refine Detection; Leica, cat. no. DS9800) was used as secondary reagent. Extent (percentage of tumor cells) and intensity (weak, moderate, strong) of A3A and A3B expression was evaluated was evaluated by two pathologists (F.P. and J.S.R.-F.).

The following cell lines were used: T47D (ATCC HTB-133), MCF7 (ATCC HTB-22), BT-474 WT and A3A KO, and MDA-MB-453 WT and A3A KO (a gift from J. Maciejowski) and HEK293T (ATCC CRL-3216, a gift from P. Chi). T47D cells were cultured in RPMI medium; MCF7, BT-474 and MDA-MB-453 were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium; HEK293T were cultured in DMEM medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Corning, cat. no. 35-010-CV), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin (Gemini Bio 400-109). Tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum (Takara Bio, cat. no. 631367) was used for experiments using the doxycycline-system. All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All cell lines were routinely tested and were negative for mycoplasma contamination.

The A3AWT, A3AE72Q, A3BWT and A3BE255Q sequences (cDNA plasmids were a gift from J. Maciejowski) were cloned into pDONR221 (Invitrogen, cat. no. 12536017) using the Gateway BP Clonase II Enzyme mix (Invitrogen, cat. no. 11789020). Expression vectors were generated by cloning into pInducer20 (a gift from S. Elledge, Addgene plasmid 4401; ref. 86) using the Gateway LR Clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen, cat. no. 11791020). Lentiviral particles were prepared by transfecting 293T cells with expression clones along with the lentiviral envelope and packaging plasmids using X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 6366546001). The medium was refreshed after 24 h. After 48 h, the supernatant was collected and filtered through 0.45 µm filters. T47D and MCF7 cells were transduced with the lentiviral particles and stably expressing cells were generated after selection using G418 (InvivoGen, cat. no. ant-gn-1) for 2 weeks. Cells were treated with 0.1 µg ml−1 doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. D9891) to induce overexpression.

T47D dA3AWT-5 and dA3AE72Q-5 cells were treated with DMSO or 500 nM abemaciclib for 14 days, after which the drug concentration was increased to 1 µM. Surviving dA3AWT-5 cells were tested for resistance after 2 months of continuous culture in 1 µM abemaciclib. dA3AE72Q-5 cells did not grow out even after 5 months under selection. Additionally, resistant cells were expanded after selection from the long-term growth assays.

The following primary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology and used for immunoblotting at a dilution of 1:1,000: anti-HA (C29F4), anti-p-Rb S780 (D59B7), anti-p-Rb S807/811 (D20B12), anti-Rb (4H1), anti-E2F1 (3742), anti-Cyclin E2 (4132S), anti-Cyclin A2 (BF683), anti-YAP1 (D8H1X), anti-β-tubulin (D3U1W) and anti-Vinculin (E1E9V). Anti-Vinculin (V9131) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used at a dilution of 1:1,000. The secondary antibodies used were anti-Rabbit IgG, HRP-linked (1:3,000, Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 7074), anti-Rabbit IgG IRDye 680 RD (1:10,000, LI-COR Biosciences, cat no. 926-68071), and anti-Mouse IgG IRDye 800 RD (1:10,000, LI-COR Biosciences, cat. no. 926-32210). The following primary antibodies were obtained from R. Harris and used for IHC: anti-A3A-13 (1:2,500, cat no. LQR-2-13 (UMN-13)) and anti-A3A/B/G (1:200, cat. no. 5210-87-13). The following drugs were purchased from Selleck Chemicals: fulvestrant (S1191), abemaciclib (S5716), palbociclib (S1579), lapatinib (S2111), neratinib (S2150) and MK2206 (S1078), and dissolved in DMSO. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (Daiichi Sankyo, cat. no. DS-8201a) was dissolved in saline.

Cells were lysed on ice using RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 89901) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 78444). Lysates were cleared using centrifugation and total protein concentration was measured with BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 23225). Total protein 30–50 µg was separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gels (Invitrogen NuPAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride or nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked with Intercept (TBS) Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, cat. no. 927-60001) or 5% milk, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with secondary antibodies, the blots were scanned by Odyssey CLx Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences) or developed using the Western Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer, cat. no. NEL104001EA) and processed using Fiji v.2.0.0.

In vitro deamination assay was performed as described previously87. Briefly, 50 µg total cell lysates were incubated with RNase A (1.75 U), ssDNA substrate (4 pmol), UDG buffer and UDG (1.25 U) in HED buffer (25 mM Hepes pH 7.8, 5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol freshly supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor) for 2 h at 37 °C; 100 mM NaOH was then added and heated at 95 °C for 10 min to cleave the DNA at abasic sites. The sample was then heated with Novex Hi-Density TBE sample buffer (Invitrogen, cat. no. LC6678) at 95 °C for 5 min, cooled down on ice and run on a 15% TBE-urea PAGE gel. Separated DNA fragments were imaged on an ImageQuant 800 (Amersham). The ssDNA oligo substrates were 5′-(6-FAM)-GCAAGCTGTTCAGCTTGCTGA for A3A88 and 5′-ATTATTATTATTCAAATGGAT-TTATTTATTTATTTATTTATTT-fluorescein for A3B.

For cell viability measurement, 500–2,000 cells per well were plated in triplicates in 96-well plates in complete medium with 10% FBS or tetracycline-approved serum for doxycycline-inducible models. After overnight incubation for attachment, cells were treated with drugs (day 0). Medium was replaced once every week and doxycycline was topped up twice every week for overexpression cells. Viability was measured using the redox-sensitive dye Resazurin (R&D Systems, cat. no. AR002; 25 µl per well incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and read at 544 nm excitation and 590 nm emission using SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices)) or brightfield imaging of attached cells using Incucyte S3 (Sartorius). IC50 values were calculated by nonlinear regression of inhibitor concentrations with response in GraphPad Prism v.9.4.1. For colony forming assays, 2 × 105 MDA-MB-453 cells were plated in triplicates in six-well plates. The cells were treated with drugs after 24 h, and their media replaced with fresh drugs twice every week. The cells were fixed with 100% methanol when confluent, washed with water, stained with 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. C0775) in 25% methanol, washed with water, dried and scanned using the AxioObserver 7 inverted microscope (Zeiss).

Statistical analyses were conducted using R (v.3.1.2, v.4.1.0 and v.4.3.2) and GraphPad Prism v.9.4.1. Summary statistics were used to describe the study population. Fisher's exact test or Pearson's chi-squared test were used to compare categorical variables, whenever appropriate. Mann–Whitney U or Wilcoxon rank sum, or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to compare continuous variables. A log rank test was used to compare the survival distributions between groups. Comparisons of frequencies of genes altered by somatic SNVs and CNAs as well as for site-specific gene alterations were performed using the Fisher's exact test and logistic regression. Multiple testing correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg method was applied to control for the FDR whenever appropriate. Pearson's coefficient R was computed using the python package scipy.stats (v.1.10.0). All P values were two-tailed, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adopted for all analyses.

OpenAI is launching a cloud-based software engineering agent called Codex as the hype surrounding building software using AI continues gathering pace. This tool, aimed more at professional coders rather than amateur vibe coders, will let developers automate more of their work in a way that should be both safer and less opaque than existing tools.

OpenAI's Codex is available through the web for ChatGPT Pro users from today. It can generate lines of code but also move through directories and run commands inside a virtual computer, automating more of the work that developers go through when writing code.

“We're about to undergo a pretty seismic shift in terms of how developers can be most accelerated by agents,” says Alexander Embiricos, a member of the product team at OpenAI working on agents.

The latest models from rivals Anthropic and Google are already both highly skilled at coding. This OpenAI launch has preempted Google's expected release of a more capable coding tool at its I/O event next week, according to a report in The Information. According to numerous reports, OpenAI is in talks to acquire Windsurf (formerly Codeium), a startup that makes a popular AI coding tool, for $3 billion.

A key challenge with vibe coding is that delegating to AI can result in software that is opaque and more difficult for a person to understand and fix when bugs creep in. OpenAI says the model behind Codex has been trained to explain what it is doing more clearly and help developers fix what they are building and that the use of a virtual computer makes the system safer by design.

It is already possible to write and analyze code using ChatGPT and similar chatbots. OpenAI already offers a Codex command-line tool that can generate code.

The new web-based Codex, which OpenAI calls “research previous,” runs its own mini computer within a browser. This allows it to run commands, explore folders and files, and test the code it has written autonomously.

“That's really the way that we think most development is going to happen in the future,” Embiricos says. “The agent will work on its own computer and will delegate to it.”

OpenAI says that Codex is being used by outside companies including Cisco, Temporal, Superhuman, and Kodiak.

Vibe coding has become a phenomenon thanks to a generation of AI models that are remarkably good at writing and fixing code. The same models allow more skilled developers to speed up their work, too.

OpenAI has launched two other agentic AI tools over the past year: Operator, which controls a web browser and can automate online chores, and Deep Research, which carries out detailed web search and analysis in order to compile reports.

Josh Tobin, who leads the agents research team at OpenAI, says Codex reflects a bigger vision for ChatGPT to evolve from a chatbot into a teammate. “We think that ChatGPT will become almost like a virtual coworker,” Tobin says. “Where you can go to it not just for answers to quick questions [but also to] collaborate with it on larger chunks of work across a wide range of different tasks.”

Update 5/16/24 11:40 am EST: This story has been updated to clarify that Codex is not designed  for vibe coding.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","No, Graduates: AI Hasn't Ended Your Career Before It Starts","https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-commencement-speech-artificial-intelligence/","Fri, 16 May 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Imagine graduating with a liberal arts degree as the age of AI dawns. That's the mindset I faced when addressing the Temple University College of Liberal Arts (where I'm an alum) earlier this month. Truth be told, no one knows what will happen with AI, including those who are building it. I took an optimistic view based on one core truth: As amazing as AI might become, by definition it cannot be human, and therefore the human connection we homo sapiens forge with each other is unique—and gives us an edge.

Here's the speech:

I am thrilled to address the Temple College of Liberal Arts Class of 2025. You have prevailed under the curse of living in interesting times. You coped with Covid in high school and your early years here, navigated your way through the noise of social media, and now face a troubling political climate. The last part of that resonates with me. I attended Temple University at a time of national unrest. Richard Nixon was our president, the war was raging in Vietnam, and the future seemed uncertain.

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter.

SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.

But there is one concern that you have that I or my classmates could not have conceived of when we graduated over 50 years ago: the fear that artificial intelligence would perform our future jobs and render our career dreams useless.

I didn't touch a computer keyboard during my four years at Temple. It wasn't until almost 10 years after my graduation that I finally interacted directly with a computer. I was assigned a story for Rolling Stone about computer hackers. I was energized and fascinated by their world, and decided to keep writing about it.

Not long after my article was published I ventured to MIT and met Marvin Minsky, one of the scientists who came up with the idea of artificial intelligence at a summer conference at Dartmouth in 1956. Minsky and his peers thought it would only be a few years until computers could think like humans. That optimism—or naivety—became a punch line for many decades. High-level AI was always 10 years away, 20 years away. It was a science fiction fantasy.

Until about 20 years ago or so that was still the case. And then in this century, some computer scientists made breakthroughs in what were called neural nets. It led to rapid progress, and in 2017 another big breakthrough led to the terrifyingly capable large language models like ChatGPT. Suddenly AI is here.

My guess is that every single one of you has used a large language model like ChatGPT as a collaborator. Now I hope this isn't the case, but some of you may have used it as a stand-in for your own work. Please don't raise your hand if you've done this—we haven't given out the diplomas yet, and your professors are standing behind me.

Much of my time at WIRED the past few years has been spent talking to and writing about the people leading this field. Some refer to their efforts as creating “the last invention.” They use that term because when AI reaches a certain point, supposedly computers will shove us humans aside and drive progress on their own. They refer to this as reaching artificial general intelligence, or AGI. That's the moment when AI will, in theory, perform any task a human can, but better.

So as you leave this institution for the real world, this moment of joy may well be mixed with anxiety. At the least, you may be worried that for the rest of your work life, you will not only be collaborating with AI but competing with it. Does that make your prospects bleak?

I say … no. In fact my mission today is to tell you that your education was not in vain. You do have a great future ahead of you no matter how smart and capable ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama get. And here is the reason: You have something that no computer can ever have. It's a superpower, and every one of you has it in abundance.

Your humanity.

Liberal arts graduates, you have majored in subjects like Psychology. History. Anthropology. African American, Asian, and Gender Studies. Sociology. Languages. Philosophy. Political Science. Religion. Criminal Justice. Economics. And there's even some English majors, like me.

Every one of those subjects involves examining and interpreting human behavior and human creativity with empathy that only humans can bring to the task. The observations you make in the social sciences, the analyses you produce on art and culture, the lessons you communicate from your research, have a priceless authenticity, based on the simple fact that you are devoting your attention, intelligence, and consciousness to fellow homo sapiens. People, that's why we call them the humanities.

The lords of AI are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to make their models think LIKE accomplished humans. You have just spent four years at Temple University learning to think AS accomplished humans. The difference is immeasurable.

This is something that even Silicon Valley understands, starting from the time Steve Jobs told me four decades ago that he wanted to marry computers and the liberal arts. I once wrote a history of Google. Originally, its cofounder Larry Page resisted hiring anyone who did not have a computer science degree. But the company came to realize that it was losing out on talent it needed for communications, business strategy, management, marketing, and internal culture. Some of those liberal arts grads it then hired became among the company's most valuable employees.

Even inside AI companies. liberal arts grads can and do thrive. Did you know that the president of Anthropic, one of the top creators of generative AI, was an English major? She idolized Joan Didion.

Furthermore, your work does something that AI can never do: it makes a genuine human connection. OpenAI recently boasted that it trained one of its latest models to churn out creative writing. Maybe it can put together cool sentences—but that's not what we really seek from books, visual arts, films and criticism. How would you feel if you read a novel that shifted the way you saw the world, heard a podcast that lifted your spirit, saw a movie that blew your mind, heard a piece of music that moved your soul, and only after you were inspired and transformed by it, learned that it was not created by a person, but a robot? You might feel cheated.

And that's more than a feeling. In 2023, some researchers published a paper confirming just that. In blind experiments human beings valued what they read more when they thought it was from fellow humans and not a sophisticated system that fakes humanity. In another blind experiment, participants were shown abstract art created by both humans and AI. Though they couldn't tell which was which, when subjects were asked which pictures they liked better, the human-created ones came out on top. Other research studies involved brain MRIs. The scans also showed people responded more favorably when they thought humans, not AI, created the artworks. Almost as if that connection was primal.

Everything you have learned in the liberal arts—the humanities—depends on that connection. You bring your superpower to it.

I'm not going to sugarcoat things. AI is going to have a huge impact on the labor market, and some jobs will be diminished or eliminated. History teaches us that with every big technological advance, new jobs replace those lost.

Those jobs will exist, as there are countless roles AI can never fill because the technology can't replicate true human connection. It's the one thing that AI can't offer. Combined with the elite skills you have learned at Temple, that connection will make your work of continuing value. Especially if you perform it with the traits that make you unique: curiosity, compassion, and a sense of humor.

As you go into the workforce, I urge you to lean into your human side. Yes, you can use AI to automate your busy work, explain complicated topics, and summarize dull documents. It might even be an invaluable assistant. But you will thrive by putting your heart into your own work. AI has no such heart to employ. Ultimately, flesh, blood, and squishy neurons are more important than algorithms, bits, and neural nets.

So class of 2025, let me send you out into the world with an expression that I encourage you to repeat during these challenging years to come. And that is the repetition of the simple truth that will guide your career and your life as you leave this campus. Here it is: I. Am. Human. Can you say that with me?

I Am Human.

Congratulations, and go out and seize the world. It is still yours to conquer. And one final note—I did not use AI to write this speech. Thank you.

(You can see me deliver the speech here, in full academic regalia.)

There's chlorine in your drinking water, America. Or maybe there's a different chlorine compound called chloramine. This isn't meant to alarm you, though of course it's alarming to many. An entire industry of faucet and countertop and shower filters has sprung up specifically to remove chlorine compounds from the water you drink and bathe in, whether for reasons of health or flavor or beauty.

After all, chlorine tastes and smells bad; some people are sensitive to its aroma even in tiny amounts. It also potentially messes with your hair dye and dries out your skin. Plus, few people realllllly want to drink chlorine, if you ask them. Hence, water filters like WIRED's best-tested shower filter, the Canopy Filtered Showerhead, designed to remove chlorine before you wash with it.

But note that the chlorine is entirely supposed to be there. The US Centers for Disease Control has hailed water chlorination as one of the greatest public health advances of the 20th century, alongside such obscure triumphs as “penicillin” and “the polio vaccine.”

Extremely low concentrations of chlorine or chlorine compounds, generally around 1 part per million—well below the Environmental Protection Agency's acceptable limits for human consumption—are added to water pipes to kill potential germs like typhoid and cholera and E. coli that might otherwise grow in water and shorten your life or make it briefly awful. Home filters are designed to remove chlorine after it's already done its job in the pipes.

But if you do buy filters for your drinking water or shower water, there's a complicating factor. More than half of big US cities don't use chlorine, in part because free chlorine in water is highly reactive and has a short half-life and can interact with other substances to create harmful compounds thought to be carcinogenic. More than half of the country's largest cities instead use chloramine, a more stable and persistent chlorine compound.

If you're trying to filter out chlorine compounds, it matters which one your city is using. New York, Atlanta, and Chicago use chlorine in their water systems. But Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Boston use chloramine in their water.

Chloramine has some potential advantages over chlorine. The aroma is generally perceived as less pronounced in drinking water. Chloramine's longer half-life and longer persistence in pipes also means health authorities can use lower quantities and still maintain levels needed to disinfect pipes.

But chloramine's relative stability can also make it harder to filter out of water than pure chlorine, especially using shower water filters that rely on chemical reactions to neutralize chlorine. While chloramine will oxidize relatively quickly in open air when exposed to light, brewers in cities that use chloramine often use chemical tablets to neutralize chloramine.

Knowing which substance your city uses will help you determine which filters will work best to get rid of it. The certification arm of the National Science Foundation, which has seen drastic and systematic cutbacks in recent months under DOGE, traditionally offers reliable testing standards for chlorine removal for water filters, certifying chlorine removal over thousands of gallons of water. And so if your city uses chlorine, the most reliable gauge of a water filter's effectiveness has generally been whether it's been tested and certified to NSF standards.

For shower filters, the standard for chlorine filtration is NSF/ANSI standard 177. Most makers of shower water filters in particular have not received certification and don't share independent data. But there's at least one exception in the United States: The Weddell Duo inline shower filter is certified to remove chlorine from water systems treated with free chlorine.

For chloramine systems, the NSF doesn't offer a specific standard, muddying the waters a bit. So I did my own testing using home lab kits designed for pools and aquariums. In general, I found that filters that used activated or catalyzed carbon and multistage filters appeared to fare better at removing chloramine levels.

Specifically, our testing indicated that only a few shower filters on the market removed chloramine down to undetectable levels, in cities with chloraminated systems. These included the Canopy Filtered Showerhead ($170), the Afina A-01 Filtered Showerhead ($129), the Hydroviv Filtered Showerhead ($200), and the Curo Filtered Showerhead ($109).

Which is to say: Knowing which chemical your city uses might help you determine which filter is best able to remove chlorine and chlorine compounds from your system. Here's the list for the top 50 most populous cities in the United States. (But note that some cities that use chlorine sometimes temporarily switch to chlorine to disinfect their systems, and vice versa.)

Last year, the Surface Pro was reinvented in a rather glorious way. For the first time, Microsoft's 2-in-1 tablet had the performance and battery life it needed to be a truly mobile device that could compete with the iPad Pro. Thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon X chips inside, the Surface Pro 11th Edition came into its own.

Now, there's a surprise new model available: the Surface Pro 12. The slightly smaller tablet is a great idea in theory, offering a more compact design and a lower starting price. Unfortunately, some pricing wonkiness makes the Surface Pro 12 a lot less attractive an offer than it should be, even compared to other Surface devices you can buy.

When the Surface Pro 11th Edition launched in 2024, it started at $999 with 16 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage. However, that's not the price today. Microsoft now sells the Surface Pro 11th Edition for $1,199, which also comes with a 10-core Snapdragon X Plus CPU. Microsoft hasn't officially explained the $200 price increase (a year after its release!), but it might be safe to assume it's tariff-related. It may have made more sense for Microsoft to have opted for the lower-powered Snapdragon X chip to drop the price, as we've seen in laptops like the Asus Vivobook 14.

Then the Surface Pro 12 slides in with a retail price of $799, despite coming with many of the same specs, including the same memory and storage. The only performance difference is its 8-core Snapdragon X Plus chip versus the 10-core chip in the 13-inch model. But wait, it gets weirder. You can currently buy the Surface Pro 11th Edition for just $800 at Best Buy (Microsoft also has it “discounted” to the original $999 price). You read that right. You can buy last year's 13-inch model and the new 12-inch model for the same price, despite the older model being more premium.

To make things worse, the Surface Pro 12 might be the first laptop I've ever reviewed that doesn't come with a charger included in the price. Microsoft is charging $70 to add on the tiny 45-watt power cable. While it's true that some people will have a leftover USB-C power cable and adapter they can use, most people may end up paying at least $870 for this machine, and that's not even including the extra $150 for the keyboard you'll want. You could reuse an older Surface Pro keyboard with newer devices in the past, but the Surface Pro 12 isn't compatible with them.

The display is the primary difference between the Surface Pro 12 and its larger sibling. The screen is an inch smaller diagonally, meaning less screen real estate and an overall more compact device. The bezels are a bit larger, though I wouldn't want the footprint to be any smaller. Microsoft made the detachable keyboard as small as I would want it to ensure the keyboard and trackpad are still comfortable to use.

I like the idea of a smaller and lighter Surface Pro. The tablet is only 0.30 inches thick, which is not quite as thin as the iPad Pro 11-inch, but it's close. It's still a half-pound heavier, but compared to other Surface devices, it's far more usable in one hand, something Surface devices have always struggled with.

Unfortunately, the screen is not just smaller. It is also 16 percent less pixel-dense (220 pixels per inch) and has a lower refresh rate of 90 Hz. I measured it at 351 nits, which is bright enough for even a glossy tablet like this. All in all, it's a great IPS screen, every bit as color-accurate and vibrant as the 13-inch model. Of course, it doesn't hold up to the OLED upgrade available on the Surface Pro 11th Edition, but that's to be expected.

Performance isn't anything to write home about. A part of that is because the system comes in the Power Efficiency mode by default, even while plugged in. Changing it to Balanced boosted the multicore performance, but not by much. That's because the system is fanless, a notable change from the larger model. The great part about this, however, is that the Surface Pro 12 stays completely quiet at all times. That part I really like.

I also like the battery life, even if it's a step back from the Surface Pro 11th Edition. Microsoft says it gets seven hours less in local video playback, which lines up with my testing. The results are still better than previous Surface devices on the affordable end of the spectrum. I could get through a full workday away from the charger, making it long-lasting enough for a mobile device.

One of my favorite features of the Surface Pro 11th Edition was the ability to use the keyboard when not physically connected to the device, which was handy in various situations. The Surface Pro 12 loses this feature. The keyboard no longer has a dedicated slot to store the Surface Slim Pen, though it can still magnetize (and wirelessly charge) to the back of the tablet.

A few other downgrades to the Surface Pro 12: It has a 1080p front-facing webcam rather than a 1440p webcam, and slower ports. There are only two USB-C ports, and they're USB-C 3.2 instead of USB4. Perhaps the most disappointing feature, however, is the lack of repairability. The Surface Pro 11th Edition made strides in this area, letting you access the internals easily and upgrade the storage via the microSD card slot, even earning an 8/10 iFixit score. The Surface Pro 12 undoes this trend, instead opting for a sealed-up chassis and soldered components. This is likely because it's fanless, but having a microSD slot would have at least helped.

Maybe it's not fair to only compare the Surface Pro 12 to the larger model. After all, it still compares favorably to the iPad Pro 11-inch, which is significantly more expensive. We should also keep in mind the comparison to the Surface Go 4, which came out in 2023. The cheaper 10.5-inch model seems to be defunct, meaning the Surface Pro 12 takes its place in many ways. While the Surface Go 4 had a much lower starting price, those configurations were quite underpowered, starting with just 8 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage. When you line up the configurations, there's only a $30 difference between the Surface Go 4 and the Surface Pro 12 at launch. Because Microsoft needs to ensure that its Surface devices are Copilot+ PCs, those lower-tier configurations have been cut.

There's a lot to like about the device on its own. You won't find a slicker 2-in-1, outside perhaps the iPad Pro 11-inch. The design is impeccable, and the keyboard and touchpad feel great to use. The palm rests are plastic and no longer Alcantara fabric, though they feel comfortable and rigid. Compared to the iPad, it's still quite affordable, even with the additional $70 power supply.

But here's what it comes down to: As long as the Surface Pro 11th Edition is sold for $799 at Best Buy or another retailer, you should buy that instead. It has faster performance, a higher-refresh-rate screen, more ports, and a better webcam, and it is far more serviceable. And yes, that one comes with the power supply included. The 12-inch does have it beat in portability, but until we see the pricing situation change, the larger sibling is the one to buy.

Microsoft Surface Pro 12

Next week, a coterie of crypto investors will share an extravagant dinner with US president Donald Trump at his golf club in Washington, DC. They won their seats at the dinner by purchasing large amounts of Trump's personal crypto coin. But since their places were confirmed on Monday, almost half have gotten rid of their holdings, whether by selling the coins or transferring them to different wallets, a WIRED analysis shows.

The team behind the TRUMP coin announced the dinner competition on April 23, promising to invite the top 220 holders to dine alongside the president. The top 25, meanwhile, would qualify for a doubly exclusive tour and predinner reception, the website explained.

The organizers selected the attendees based on who had bought the most TRUMP and held their coins the longest between the announcement date and May 12. Although a few of the winners have identified themselves publicly—like Sheldon Xia, founder of crypto exchange BitMart—the identities of most are concealed behind leaderboard usernames and alphanumeric crypto wallet addresses.

To claim a spot at the dinner, investors had to purchase at least 4,196 units of the TRUMP coin, worth about $54,000 at the time of writing. To qualify for the reception, the VIPs held around 325,000 TRUMP coins on average, worth roughly $4.2 million.

At the time of writing, 100 of the 220 attendees have done away with practically their entire TRUMP stash, including 17 of the 25 VIPs. One VIP, going by the username Woo, appears to have made a $2.5 million profit on their TRUMP holdings, which they delivered to crypto exchange Binance on Wednesday, presumably with the intention to sell.

Though the attendees would appear to be eager for an audience with Trump, their trading activities since the competition deadline appear to imply a low conviction in the long-term potential of the president's coin as an investment asset. Representatives for Trump did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

That sentiment appears to be shared broadly among sophisticated crypto investors. As of Friday, only nine smart money traders—meaning those with a strong track record of profitability—are invested in the TRUMP coin, according to analysis by Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at blockchain analytics company Nansen.

After the dinner was first announced, analysts expressed concerns about a potential slump in the price after the spaces at the dinner had been confirmed, caused by a sell-off among investors whose immediate incentive to hold the coin had evaporated.

On May 12, the day of the competition deadline, the organizers tried to encourage the qualifying attendees to hold onto their coins, presumably in a bid to avoid a sell-off. Any attendees who arrived at the dinner with as many units of TRUMP as they held at the end of the competition, the organizers announced on X, would be rewarded with a “very special and rare” NFT. They also teased a “rewards points program,” the details of which have not yet been revealed.

Though many of the qualifying attendees were apparently unmoved by the prospect, choosing to forgo the NFT in favor of offloading their coins, it has not had a material detrimental impact on the TRUMP price. At the time of writing, the TRUMP coin is trading for $12.86 per unit, down from $14.59 on May 12.

The limited decline in price had been predicted in some quarters, attributed to the possibility that holding the coin might yield yet further perks or advantages in the future—potentially including access to Trump.

In establishing an explicit quid pro quo—a large investment in exchange for a dinner with the president—the competition effectively turned TRUMP into a so-called utility coin. That idea is underscored by the rewards program teased by the organizers.

“The market will expect further utility to come from holding that coin,” Nathan van der Heyden, head of business development at crypto company Aragon, told WIRED in April. “Before, you were speculating on a TRUMP coin with no utility. Now you're speculating on future access to Trump. That has to be worth a bit more money.”

OpenAI announced on Friday it's launching a research preview of Codex, the company's most capable AI coding agent yet.

Codex is powered by codex-1, a version of the company's o3 AI reasoning model optimized for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 produces “cleaner” code than o3, adheres more precisely to instructions, and will iteratively run tests on its code until passing results are achieved.

The Codex agent runs in a sandboxed, virtual computer in the cloud. By connecting with GitHub, Codex's environment can come preloaded with your code repositories. OpenAI says the AI coding agent will take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to write simple features, fix bugs, answer questions about your codebase, and run tests, among other tasks. 

Codex can handle multiple software engineering tasks simultaneously, says OpenAI, and it doesn't limit users from accessing their computer and browser while it's running.

Codex is rolling out starting today to subscribers to ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Team. OpenAI says users will have “generous access” to Codex to start, but in the coming weeks, the company will implement rate limits for the tool. Users will then have the option to purchase additional credits to use Codex, an OpenAI spokesperson tells TechCrunch. 

OpenAI plans to expand Codex access to ChatGPT Plus and Edu users soon.

AI tools for software engineers, also known as vibe coders, have surged in popularity in recent months. The CEOs of Google and Microsoft claim that roughly 30% of their companies' code is now written by AI. In February, Anthropic released its own agentic coding tool, Claude Code, and in April, Google updated its AI coding assistant, Gemini Code Assist, with more agentic abilities.

All that vibe coding has made the businesses behind AI coding platforms some of the fastest-growing in tech. Cursor, among the most popular AI coding tools, reached annualized revenue of around $300 million in April and is reportedly raising new funds at a $9 billion valuation.

Now, OpenAI wants a piece of the pie. The ChatGPT maker has reportedly closed on a deal to acquire Windsurf, the developer behind another popular AI coding platform, for $3 billion. The launch of Codex shows very clearly that OpenAI is building out its own AI coding tools, in addition.

Users with access to Codex can find the tool in ChatGPT's sidebar, and assign the agent new coding tasks by typing a prompt and clicking the “Code” button. Users can also ask questions about their codebase and click the “Ask” button. Below the prompting bar, users can see other tasks they've assigned Codex to do, and monitor their progress.

In a briefing ahead of Codex's launch, OpenAI's Agents Research Lead, Josh Tobin, told TechCrunch the company eventually wants its AI coding agents to act as “virtual teammates,” completing tasks autonomously that take human engineers “hours or even days” to accomplish. OpenAI claims it's already using Codex internally to offload repetitive tasks, scaffold new features, and draft documentation. 

OpenAI Product Lead Alexander Embiricos says a lot of the safety work for the company's o3 model applies to Codex as well. In a blog post, OpenAI says Codex will reliably refuse requests to develop “malicious software.” Furthermore, Codex operates in an air-gapped environment, with no access to the broader internet or external APIs. This limits how dangerous Codex could be in the hands of a bad actor — but it may also hamper its usefulness.

It's worth noting that AI coding agents, much like all generative AI systems today, are prone to mistakes. A recent study from Microsoft found that industry-leading AI coding models, such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and o3-mini, struggled to reliably debug software. However, that doesn't seem to be dampening investor excitement in these tools.

OpenAI is also updating Codex CLI, the company's recently launched open source coding agent that runs in your terminal, with a version of its o4-mini model that's optimized for software engineering. That model is now the default in Codex CLI, and will be available in OpenAI's API for $1.50 per 1M input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, more than the entire Lord of the Rings book series) and $6 per 1M output tokens.

Codex's launch marks OpenAI's latest effort to beef up ChatGPT with additional products besides the notorious chatbot. In the past year, OpenAI has added priority access to the company's AI video platform, Sora, its research agent, Deep Research, as well as its web browsing agent, Operator, as benefits for subscribers.

These offerings could entice more users to sign up for a ChatGPT subscription, and, in the case of Codex specifically, convince existing subscribers to pay OpenAI more money for increased rate limits.

Spotify announced last week that it would roll out public play counts on all podcasts as a way of “helping attract new fans.” But podcasters swiftly responded with criticism of the new feature — mainly, that it would further promote podcasts that already have large audiences while making smaller shows less appealing to new listeners.

On Friday, Spotify changed course on its plans, but did not completely eschew the idea. Now, play counts will only appear on shows with at least 50,000 plays each. Instead of showing an exact play count, the designation will only update at specific milestones, like 100,000 or 1 million plays.

“We plan to roll this newly evolved version of play counts over the coming week,” the company wrote in a blog post. “This update reflects our evolving efforts to provide the best insights for creators and a clear experience for their fans.”

For decades, podcast hosting platforms have not shared many public indicators of a show's popularity — Apple Podcasts, for example, has had reviews and charts on its app, but it would be challenging for a listener to know if a show had an audience in the tens or the tens of thousands. 

Though Spotify takes the angle that this ambiguity is a detriment, creators have been drawn to the podcasting medium in part because it's refreshingly different from other forms of online media. When someone clicks play on a YouTube video, for example, they are approaching the media with the existing knowledge of how many views the video has, and how many people have subscribed to that channel. But podcasting can level the playing field for more niche creators.

Podcasters have also expressed frustration with the lack of a clear metric for what counts as a “play” or a “stream” among various different platforms. 

The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) works with podcast platforms to establish a clear metric for what is defined as a “play,” creating more consistency for dealmaking among podcasters and advertisers. But according to Podnews, the definition of what counts as a “play” is different on Spotify and YouTube — two of the most popular podcast listening platforms — than the IAB standard.

Spotify said that play counts will refer to the number of times “people actively tried” the content, whereas streams and downloads only count after 60 seconds of engagement.

The Nuclear Company is taking an old approach to building new nuclear reactors. Rather than gin up a new design or try to mass manufacture smaller reactors, it wants to develop a series of reactors using existing designs.

The two-year-old startup announced a Series A last month that included investments from CIV, Goldcrest Capital, MCJ Collective, True Ventures, and Wonder Ventures, though it did not disclose the amount raised. Now, TechCrunch can confirm that the company has secured $46.3 million in a Series A fundraise out of a targeted $51.3 million total. The details were published in an SEC filing.

The Nuclear Company was founded in 2023 by three serial entrepreneurs: former AppHarvest CEO Jonathan Webb, Arcadia CEO Kiran Bhatraju, and CIV CEO Patrick Maloney. The startup is prioritizing sites that already have permits or licenses to operate. Fewer than a dozen sites fall under that rubric, according to filings for combined operating licenses and early site permits at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 

At the sites that are closer to groundbreaking, each can support reactors with more than 1 gigawatt of generation capacity. The Nuclear Company is aiming to develop 6 gigawatts in its first fleet.

The funding round arrives as tech companies and utilities are struggling to secure power for data centers. Demand for electricity in the U.S. is expected to surge nearly 16% by 2029, according to Grid Strategies, after years of steady consumption. Data centers are a large driver; their electricity use could quadruple by the end of the decade.

In the face of potential power shortages, tech companies have been cozying up to nuclear startups and developers. Google is working with Kairos to build 500 megawatts' worth of small modular reactors (SMR), while Amazon participated in a massive $700 million round to fund X-energy's SMR plans. Meta has solicited proposals from developers to build up to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity, and Microsoft is working with Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island.

But nuclear power is facing headwinds, both expected and unexpected. Competition from solar power is among the former: Tech companies and data center operators have been snapping up capacity from solar farms, signing sizable deals. These farms are frequently paired with massive batteries to provide 24/7 electricity. The technology is inexpensive, and new projects can be developed in around 18 months.

Nuclear may soon face other financial hurdles, too. This week, the House Ways and Means Committee published its draft of a reconciliation bill that would kill subsidies for nuclear power that were granted under the Inflation Reduction Act. Nuclear power plants are currently eligible for tax credits up to $15 per megawatt-hour.

Most new nuclear power plants, including those on The Nuclear Company's timeline, aren't expected to come online until the early 2030s. Given that forecasts for the next five years vary wildly, massive nuclear plants entering service a decade from now could be stuck holding the bag.

Epic Games claims that Apple is blocking its Fortnite app from the U.S. and EU App Stores.

After winning a decisive victory for app developers in a legal battle with Apple, forcing the tech giant to allow external payments in its U.S. App Store without charging commission, Epic Games attempted to resubmit Fortnite to the U.S. App Store on May 9, 2025.

However, Apple failed to accept its submission for a week, leading Epic Games to pull its request and try again. According to Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, the update was pulled because Epic Games needs to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content, and all platforms must be updated simultaneously.

The company then submitted a new version to the U.S. App Store for review on Wednesday, May 14, with the updated content. 

In a Friday morning post on X, Fortnite said that Apple has blocked its latest U.S. submission and has made it so Epic Games can't release its app to the European Union, either. 

“Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it,” the post from Fortnite reads.

TechCrunch reached out to Epic Games and Apple to learn more and will update if further information is provided.

Veteran Chipotle executive Jack Hartung was appointed a member of Tesla's board of directors Thursday, according to a Tesla filing with the SEC. Hartung's addition to the board comes as Tesla quietly works to finish its 1950s-style diner and charging station in Los Angeles. 

Hartung brings over two decades of experience as a Chipotle CFO, president, and chief strategy officer to Tesla's board. He has overseen all finance and accounting at Chipotle, as well as supply chain, strategy, and safety and asset protection as the company has grown to over 3,700 restaurants across the U.S. and globally. 

Prior to Chipotle, Hartung spent almost 20 years at McDonald's, where he served as VP and CFO of the restaurant chain's partner brands group. 

While Hartung's business and financial acumen are likely transferable across industries, his debut on Tesla's board comes as the company gears up to launch the above-mentioned retro-futuristic diner and charging station in LA. Last August, Tesla advertised a role for a Tesla Diner Experience Specialist to work with the charging team to build out great customer service at the up-and-coming diner. 

TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla and Hartung to learn if the Chipotle executive will offer strategic insight and a network of contacts in the food and beverage industry. 

Tesla's regulatory filing announcing Hartung's appointment also discloses a related-party transaction; his son-in-law has worked as a Tesla service technician since December 2016, and last year took home a $124,000 salary. Tesla says this salary is in line with the company's standard compensation practices. 

Hartung will begin his duties on the board, including on the audit committee, effective June 1. He has waived his ability to collect cash compensation, as well as his equity compensation, as the other board members have done.

Roughly a month after Moonvalley, a Los Angeles-based startup developing AI tools for video creation, said it secured $43 million in new funding, the company has raised more, according to a filing with the SEC.

The filing, submitted Thursday, reveals that Moonvalley actually landed (so far) around $53 million total from a group of 14 unnamed investors. 

The filing indicates that this is an additional $10 million in cash, rather than a whole new round. It brings the company's total raised to about $124 million, estimates Pitchbook, following on the heels of Moonvalley's $70 million seed round last November. Moonvalley declined to comment.

The wide availability of tools to build video generators has led to such an explosion of providers that the space is becoming saturated. Startups such as Runway, Lightricks, Genmo, Pika, Higgsfield, Kling, and Luma, as well as tech giants like OpenAI, Alibaba, and Google, are releasing models at a fast clip. In many cases, little distinguishes one model from another.

Moonvalley's Marey model, built in collaboration with a new AI animation studio called Asteria, offers customization options like fine-grained camera and motion controls, and can generate “HD” clips up to 30 seconds long. Moonvalley claims it's also lower risk than some other video generation models from a legal perspective.

But where Moonvalley is attempting to differentiate itself — hence the high VC interest — is on the data it's using to train its models, as well as the safeguards in its video creation tools.

Many generative video startups train models on public data, some of which is invariably copyrighted. These companies argue that fair-use doctrine shields the practice, but that hasn't stopped rights holders from lodging complaints and filing cease and desists.

Moonvalley says it's working with partners to handle licensing arrangements and package videos into datasets that the company then purchases. The approach is similar to Bria's and Adobe's, the latter of which procures content for training from creators through its proprietary Adobe Stock platform.

Moonvalley is also crafting an interface for its model. The company's software, which it hasn't previewed publicly yet, has storyboarding and “granular” clip adjustment tools, Moonvalley's co-founders revealed in recent interviews. Marey can generate videos not only from text prompts but sketches, photos, and other video clips, claims Moonvalley.

Naeem Talukdar, who previously led product growth at Zapier, founded Moonvalley with former DeepMind scientists Mateusz Malinowski and Mik Binkowski. John Thomas joined as Moonvalley's COO — he and Talukdar had founded another startup, Draft, several years ago. Moonvalley also counts Asteria head Bryn Mooser as a co-founder. 

Many artists and creators are understandably wary of video generators, as they threaten to upend the film and television industry. A 2024 study commissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, estimates that more than 100,000 U.S.-based film, television, and animation jobs will be disrupted by AI by 2026.

Moonvalley intends to allow creators to request their content be removed from its models, let customers delete their data at any time, and offer an indemnity policy to protect its users from copyright challenges.

Unlike some “unfiltered” video models that readily insert a person's likeness into clips, Moonvalley is also committing to building guardrails around its tools. Like OpenAI's Sora, Moonvalley's models will block certain content, like NSFW phrases, and won't allow users to prompt them to generate videos of specific people or celebrities.

“We founded Moonvalley to make generative video technology that works for filmmakers and creative professionals,” Moonvalley wrote in a blog post in March. “That means addressing fear and distrust, as well as solving technical problems that keep generative AI from being a realistic tool for professional production.”

Plus: Grok's fixation on white genocide was the result of an unauthorized modification, xAI says

This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.

This baby boy was treated with the first personalized gene-editing drug

Doctors say they constructed a bespoke gene-editing treatment in less than seven months and used it to treat a baby with a deadly metabolic condition. The rapid-fire attempt to rewrite the child's DNA marks the first time gene editing has been tailored to treat a single individual.The baby who was treated, Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr., suffers from a rare metabolic condition caused by a particularly unusual gene misspelling. Researchers say their attempt to correct the error demonstrates the high level of precision new types of gene editors offer.

The project also highlights what some experts are calling a growing crisis in gene-editing technology. That's because even though the technology could cure thousands of genetic conditions, most are so rare that companies could never recoup the costs of developing a treatment for them.

Access to experimental medical treatments is expanding across the US

—Jessica Hamzelou

A couple of weeks ago I was in Washington, DC, for a gathering of scientists, policymakers, and longevity enthusiasts. They had come together to discuss ways to speed along the development of drugs and other treatments that might extend the human lifespan.

One approach that came up was to simply make experimental drugs more easily accessible. Now, the state of Montana has passed a new bill that sets out exactly how clinics can sell experimental, unproven treatments in the state to anyone who wants them.

The passing of the bill could make Montana something of a US hub for experimental treatments. But it represents a wider trend: the creep of Right to Try across the US. And a potentially dangerous departure from evidence-based medicine. Read the full story.

One more thingWe've never understood how hunger works. That might be about to change.

When you're starving, hunger is like a demon. It awakens the most ancient and primitive parts of the brain, then commandeers other neural machinery to do its bidding until it gets what it wants.

Although scientists have had some success in stimulating hunger in mice, we still don't really understand how the impulse to eat works. Now, some experts are following known parts of the neural hunger circuits into uncharted parts of the brain to try and find out.

Their work could shed new light on the factors that have caused the number of overweight adults worldwide to skyrocket in recent years. And it could also help solve the mysteries around how and why a new class of weight-loss drugs seems to work so well. Read the full story.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","‘Doom: The Dark Ages' Is My First Game in the Series—and It Absolutely Rips (and Tears)","https://gizmodo.com/doom-the-dark-ages-review-id-bethesda-2000602758","Fri, 16 May 2025 15:20:41 GMT","

I'd always known Doom was a highly regarded video game franchise. Still, up until now I'd only watched from the sidelines—seeing an amalgamation of wild Let's Plays of its chaotic run-and-gun combat in my poor college days, witnessing folks play it on unconventional computer appliances, and blasting composer Mick Gordon's heavy metal original soundtrack in my leisure without fully grasping the context to why its gnarly songs went so unbelievably hard on Doom (2016).

Now, with id Software and Bethesda Softworks' latest entry in the 32-year-old first-person-shooter series, Doom: The Dark Ages, serving as a prequel to its newly christened trilogy—while wedding two action genres I have a high affinity for and am coming around to, sci-fi and fantasy—I've finally jumped into the deep end on the series with its newly released game on my PlayStation 5.

I went into Doom: The Dark Ages expecting its signature FPS chaos mixed with the demonic, style-switching combat I love in the Devil May Cry—a series I use as my metric for action games. I got something far more wild: a Doom game that somehow also channels other greats like Halo and Gears of War and yet remains purely, unapologetically Doom, packed with relentless action and satanic madness unlike anything I've played before.

After sleeping on the series for too long, I'm wide awake now—Doom absolutely fucking rocks.

As a prequel, Doom: The Dark Ages eases players into its mayhem, setting the stage for an all-out war between alien overlords, medieval warriors, and hell's demons. The game sees Doom Slayer under some mind control, caught in a battle where Tonka-toy-built knights (equipped with high-tech comms like the Avengers) face off against a horde led by a warlord rocking Dracula's muscle armor. Early on, Doom Slayer is treated with the same gravitas as a Final Fantasy summon, given a simple directive: annihilate everything in his path with the same cold efficiency as a walking nuclear weapon.

The Dark Ages‘ story? It's there. Granted, it mainly serves as an epic backdrop, blending dark fantasy with a touch of sci-fi, all while ferrying players from one bonkers WatchMojo “Top 10 Insane Doom Slayer Kills” video moment to the next. Among the standout sequences that had me sit forward in my chair were Doom Slayer piloting a giant mech like a Pacific Rim veteran—and riding the back of a cybernetic dragon armed with a matching gun that looked like it was lifted straight off a metal album cover.

Even beyond Dark Age‘s massive set-piece spectacles, its moment-to-moment gameplay is pure old-school gaming bliss. Throughout the game's 22 levels, frenzied players run and gun through an ambush of demons, grabbing shields, ammo, and health potions littered around the battlefield or offered as an incentive for ripping and tearing through demons with their bare hands.

Despite the sheer chaos of the Dark Ages‘ setting, its combat is where it truly shines, offering a wealth of strategy beneath the madness. As its killer box art suggests, Doom Slayer fights off demons with firearms that drop from the sky like orbital supply capsules, ensuring each battle feels like an escalating arms race where hell is on the back foot. New weapons enter your arsenal at every level, allowing customization and fluid switching via the weapon wheel. After adapting to the speed and ferocity required to survive as the Doomslayer, I found myself favoring the following weapons:

Another pleasantly surprising part of Dark Age‘s combat that felt as rewarding to solve as its combat encounters was platforming its environmental puzzles. I found Dark Ages' emphasis on stopping and smelling the roses by heavily encouraging exploration to be just as much of a brain teaser as its experimental offering of combat combinations. Exploration is heavily promoted, and Dark Ages continuing the series' implementation of a map that smartly separates hard progress from side content with icons and markers for where hidden items like gold and gems to upgrade equipment was a godsend, making it easy to double back and hunt down upgrades, codex entries, or skins without losing momentum. I found it the perfect blend of action and curiosity-driven exploration for a game about killing demons.

And then there's the Shield Saw—a new weapon introduced in Dark Ages that I doubted would fit Doom's FPS combat. But once I mastered it, it became my favorite weapon in its inventory.

While I was initially apprehensive over whether or not the game's implementation of a shield would bog down its lightning-fast combat, it quickly became my favorite weapon in the game. Not just because it saved my ass a ton in sticky situations, but for how much more texture its added to its gameplay. The Shield Saw isn't just for blocking oncoming sword slashes and fireballs; it also doubles as a Mjolnir-like tool, letting you grapple to secret areas to uncover treasure, execute enemies with a shield bash, or ricochet into a line of overheated enemy shields from a hail of the Doom Slayer's gunfire for explosive crowd control. By far, my favorite use case for the shield saw was with its perfect parries.

Like in Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Dark Ages‘ Shield Saw transforms parrying into a high-stakes rhythm game, rewarding players who seek out oncoming green fire balls and sword slashes and send them flying back at enemies. Even if I was underleveled in a brutal boss fight, or fighting uphill in a handicap battle, a perfectly timed parry could turn the tide in my favor and eke out a satisfyingly primal win in an otherwise unwinnable battle. The DMC sicko in me loved the sheer Royal Guard-style power the Shield Saw empowered me with, letting me stunlock enemies in the most disrespectful way possible.

While melee combat in some games takes a backseat, here it's everything, not just for style, but for survival. Landing brutal in-your-face punches (or mace flails) funnels health-regenerating orbs, shields, and ammo into Doom Slayer like a vacuum. The game rewards ruthless aggression, encouraging players to embrace the chaos, chain Glory Kill whenever possible, and dominate the battlefield instead of hiding behind cover and playing it safe.

Oddly enough, my biggest gripe with the game is its soundtrack. It never hit as hard as I wanted it to. While it does an okay job of underscoring the game's bedlam, it never quite amplifies the gunplay, shield throws, and eyebrow-raising boss reveals the way I felt it should. If anything, it went unnoticed the more I played; even to a newbie, that struck me as a sacrilegious takeaway from the game.

A few hours in, I barely noticed the music ramping up before fights, like it was struggling to punch above its weight (more than I was in a boss fight) to match the sheer insanity on screen. Finishing Move (known for Borderlands 3, Halo Wars 2, and The Callisto Protocol) composed the soundtrack, but for a game like Dark Ages, music needed to be a driving force, not just background noise. Eventually, I turned Dark Ages‘ music volume down and blasted Gordon's old tracks instead to make up for what the game lacked sonically.

Overall, Doom: The Dark Ages is an electrifying genre mash-up and an incredible entry point into the franchise that lives up to the hype it's garnered over the past 30 years, and I'm glad I stopped sleeping on it.

Doom: The Dark Ages is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Harvard Paid $26 for ‘Cheap Copy' of Magna Carta—Turns Out It's an Original Worth Millions","https://gizmodo.com/harvard-paid-26-for-cheap-copy-of-magna-carta-turns-out-its-an-original-worth-millions-2000602988","Fri, 16 May 2025 11:00:07 GMT","

In 1946, Harvard purchased what they believed to be a cheap copy of Magna Carta for $25.70. It turned out to be a screaming deal, because the document is actually a rare early 14th-century edition estimated to be worth millions.

The document was buried in the Harvard Law School Library's archives until 2023, when David Carpenter, professor of medieval history at King's College London, identified it while perusing the library's website.

In a statement from Harvard Law School, Carpenter described the document as “a remarkable testament to a fundamental stage in England's political development” and as “one of the world's most valuable documents.”

Carpenter was studying unofficial copies of Magna Carta when he made a surprising discovery. Labeled as HLS MS 172 in Harvard Law School Library's digital archives, the document was described as a copy of the 1327 Magna Carta “somewhat rubbed and damp-stained.”

Carpenter immediately realized that the alleged copy might actually be an official copy. He enlisted the help of Nicholas Vincent, a professor of medieval studies at the University of East Anglia, to verify the document's authenticity. The researchers used images taken by Harvard librarians with ultraviolet light and spectral imaging to compare the text of HLS MS 172 with other original copies of Magna Carta from 1300.

Carpenter and Vincent's research revealed that HLS MS 172's dimensions were consistent with those found in the original copies. The handwriting was also similar, with the large capital ‘E' at the start in ‘Edwardus' and the elongated letters in the first line.

Magna Carta, originally penned by King John in 1215, was the first document to put into writing the principle that monarchs were not above the law. It is widely considered to be a foundational symbol of liberty and one of the earliest declarations of human rights. The document has influenced many constitutions, including that of the United States.

And as far as official copies of Magna Carta go, the rediscovered document is particularly special. Five other editions were written after the original in 1215. HLS MS 172 is a copy of the last edition to be authorized with the king's seal by King Edward I, in 1300. There are only six other official copies of the 1300 version known to still be in existence.

Its discovery is especially poignant as Harvard faces funding cuts and intense political pressure. “The provenance of this document is just fantastic. Given where it is, given present problems over liberties, over the sense of constitutional tradition in America, you couldn't invent a provenance that was more wonderful than this,” Carpenter said in a statement.

David Dastmalchian wants in on Clayface. Margaret Qualley has had to drop out of Victorian Psycho. Plus, get new looks at Bring Her Back and the return of Rick & Morty. To me, my spoilers!



Deadline reports Josh Lobo (I Trapped the Devil) is attached to direct Night After Night, a “sci-fi thriller” starring Johnny Sibilly, Alexis Louder, Trace Lysette, AJ Bowen, Scott Poythress, Horace Gold, Melissa Macedo, Michelle Macedo, and Jennifer Blair. The story concerns “two overnight security guards at a private university whose grip on reality begins to unravel after the appearance of a mute figure who returns each night without explanation.”

Meanwhile, Screen Daily reports Karin Viard, Mara Taquin, Kim Higelin, Sami Outalbali, Stefan Crepon and Sonia Faidi are attached to star in Species a French body horror film baring no relation to the 1995 film of the same title. Directed by Marion Le Corroller and eaturing special effects from Pierre-Olivier Persin (The Substance), the story concerns “a young medical student working at an ER [who] witnesses a new virus spreading among young patients, a mysterious mutation among the new generation that starts affecting her.”

According to Deadline, Maika Monroe has replaced Margaret Qualley in the lead role of Victorian Psycho.

David Dastmalchian revealed to /Film he's actively campaigning to play Clayface in the new DCU project.

The thing that made me want to add it to my roster was honestly, first and foremost, the people involved. That's the most important thing to me. You're going to spend precious hours of your life, which is so short, with people making something? It's the people. And Paul and Chris [Weitz] are very special human beings. I am always looking for something that scares me, looking for something that's outside of the realm of what I've normally gotten the opportunity to do. Something that's going to take me to a new place where I can push myself.

I grew up obsessed with the work of artists like Lon Chaney, who transformed in both visual and energetic ways. And I love the idea of running into somebody and them saying, ‘You remind me of the guy that kind of was like the person in The Thing, but that couldn't be you.' I dream of that. I dream of being truly transformative, and I'll just keep working at it for the rest of my life so I can be like Clayface. I want to be Clayface.

The AI industry has promised to “disrupt” large parts of society, and you need look no further than the U.S. educational system to see how effectively it's done that. Education has been “disrupted,” all right. In fact, the disruption is so broad and so shattering that it's not clear we're ever going to have a functional society again.

Probably the most unfortunate and pathetic snapshot of the current chaos being unfurled on higher education is a recent story by New York magazine that revealed the depths to which AI has already intellectually addled an entire generation of college students. The story, which involves interviews with a host of current undergraduates, is full of anecdotes like the one that involves Chungin “Roy” Lee, a transfer to Columbia University who used ChatGPT to write the personal essay that got him through the door:

When he started at Columbia as a sophomore this past September, he didn't worry much about academics or his GPA. “Most assignments in college are not relevant,” he told me. “They're hackable by AI, and I just had no interest in doing them.” While other new students fretted over the university's rigorous core curriculum, described by the school as “intellectually expansive” and “personally transformative,” Lee used AI to breeze through with minimal effort. When I asked him why he had gone through so much trouble to get to an Ivy League university only to off-load all of the learning to a robot, he said, “It's the best place to meet your co-founder and your wife.”

The cynical view of America's educational system—that it is merely a means by which privileged co-eds can make the right connections, build “social capital,” and get laid—is obviously on full display here. If education isn't actually about learning anything, and is merely a game for the well-to-do, why not rig that game as quickly, efficiently, and cynically as possible? AI capitalizes on this cynical worldview, exploiting the view-holder and making them stupider while also profiting from them.

When you think about the current assault on the educational system, it's easy to forget how quickly this has all happened. A more recent story from 404 Media shows that the American educational system was largely caught unawares by the deluge of cheating that the AI industry would inspire. After accumulating thousands of pages of school district documents via FOIA requests from around the country, 404's Jason Koebler found that ChatGPT has “become one of the biggest struggles in American education.” Koebler's reporting notes that, in the early days of the AI deluge, school districts were courted by “pro-AI consultants” who were known to give presentations that “largely encouraged teachers to use generative AI in their classrooms.” For instance, Koebler writes that the Louisiana Department of Education sent him…

…a presentation it said it consulted called “ChatGPT and AI in Education,” made by Holly Clark, the author of The AI Infused Classroom, Ken Shelton, the author of The Promises and Perils of AI in Education, and Matt Miller, the author of AI for Educators. The presentation includes slides that say AI “is like giving a computer a brain so it can learn and make decisions on its own,” note that “it's time to rethink ‘plagiarism' and ‘cheating,'” alongside a graph of how students can use AI to help them write essays, “20 ways to use ChatGPT in the classroom,” and “Warning: Going back to writing essays—only in class—can hurt struggling learners and doesn't get our kids ready for their future.”

In other words, AI acolytes seemed to anticipate that the technology would effectively ruin essay-writing and test-taking, and wanted to spin it to present the ruination as mere “transformation”—a new way of doing things—instead of a destructive force that would devastate education.

This new way of doing things appears to be corrosive not just to students but also to teachers. Koebler's investigation shows that the AI lobbyists courted schools by making appeals to instructors, showing them that the likes of ChatGPT would make curriculum-building and assignment-giving that much easier. Now, teachers, too, seem to be taking the easy way out, as a recent New York Times story shows that college professors have been using chatbots to create their lesson plans, just as their students are using them to complete said lesson.

The result of all of this is so obvious that it doesn't really bear repeating, but I guess will anyways: Everybody who uses AI is going to get exponentially stupider, and the stupider they get, the more they'll need to use AI to be able to do stuff that they were previously able to do with their minds. The tech industry's subscriber-based, “as-a-service” model is obviously on full display here, except that the subscription will be to intellectual capacity. The more you subscribe, the less “organic” capacity you'll have. Eventually, companies will be able to pipe AI directly into your brain with the kind of neuro-implants being hawked by Neuralink and Apple. By then, of course, there will be no need for school, as we'll all just be part of the Borg collective.

Nothing is teasing new products again. Most of the time, given Nothing's frequent product cadence, that phenomenon could just be referred to as any day of the week, but this time things feel different. Earlier this week, Nothing announced a partnership with KEF—a well-established hi-fi audio brand—to bring us… something. That something, as it turns out, could very well be an AirPods Max or Sony WH-1000XM6 competitor.

In a YouTube video on Friday, Nothing confirmed that it's expanding its audio lineup outside of wireless earbuds and into over-ear headphones. The company says they're launching “this summer,” and more info will be available in “the coming months.” While Nothing didn't give much detail on what to expect from its first-ever over-ear entrant, one thing you can count on—especially if KEF is involved—is that it will almost for sure be the company's most expensive audio product to date.

And that steeper price looks like it might not just be for audio gear. What I'm trying to say is: buckle up, transparent gadget lovers, cause things might be careening toward a big premium pothole.

First off, let's talk about the KEF collab. While we don't have a ton of details, we can make some semi-safe assumptions off the bat. The safest, arguably, is that this will be a hi-fi audio product.

In a statement announcing the partnership, KEF says, “Our six decades of high-fidelity audio expertise will support Nothing's expansion into new audio categories—bringing acoustic precision to products shaped by Nothing's distinct approach to design and user experience.”

That suggests/confirms that hi-fi is still the name of the game and that this collab will be an “expansion” of some kind. It's that second part that really gets my gears turning. Though, again, we can't say for sure what the collab will produce, my money is on one of two things: the aforementioned pair of over-ear headphones or, more tantalizingly—a full-on speaker.

And as I mentioned before, if there's one thing that hi-fi audio connotes, it's an even higher price tag. While KEF does make a spectrum of products across different price points, speakers tend to start at dollar amounts that are inching toward $1,000+.

And headphones are a similar story. KEF's Mu7 over-ear headphones cost $400, which isn't unattainable compared to the broad field of premium over-ear competitors, but they're certainly pricier than any audio gear that Nothing has dabbled in to date. Whatever this collaboration produces, you can expect to pay handsomely to own it. And that's just the start.

In a showcase on the Android Show, Nothing CEO Carl Pei teased—you guessed it—another upcoming product in arguably the company's most competitive category: phones.

The Phone 3, which Pei says is coming this summer, will be a step up for Nothing in the phone space and mark its first real flagship-level device. According to Pei, the Phone 3 will have “premium materials, major performance upgrades, and software that really levels things up.”

As someone who's tested pretty much every Nothing phone to date, I'm excited to see what that means in practice, but also maybe not as excited to see what that means for my wallet. Pei also adds in his teaser that the Phone 3 will cost about £800, which is about $1,060 USD, compared to the company's recently released mid-range $380 Phone (3a) and $460 Phone (3a) Pro.

Am I shocked that Nothing seems to be inching toward the premium sector? Not particularly. Pei's goal from the start was to challenge Apple with eye-catching transparent designs and fast and smooth bespoke software, and to do that, it will have to compete on the iPhone's hallowed ground, which is to say, in the flagship arena.

Whether Nothing has actually summoned the acumen, resources, and clout to do that is another question entirely, but I look forward to seeing its best effort. My wallet on the other hand… TBD.

Silicon Motion has introduced its new single-chip controller for external solid-state drives that is designed to enable relatively inexpensive SSDs with a 40 Gb/s USB4 interface. The SM2324 controller can be used to build compact, low-power drives with up to 32TB capacity that offer a read throughput up to 4,000 MB/s.

Silicon Motion's SM2324 is a single-chip SSD controller based on two Arm Cortex-R5 cores that has four NAND channels with 32 CE targets that support 3D TLC and 3D QLC NAND devices with an up to 1,600 MT/s interface speed as well as a USB4 Gen3x2 (40 Gbps) host interface with Power Delivery 3.1. SMI claims that drives based on the SM2324 controller can achieve a sequential read performance of up to 4,000 MB/s and a sequential write performance of up to 3,809 MB/s (provided that there is enough cooling). The controller can address up to 32 TB of memory, which enables it to be used both for consumer and professional-grade external storage devices.

The SM2324 controller fully supports the company's latest NANDXtend LDPC ECC technology with a codeword size of 4 kilobytes (4096 bytes) to ensure compatibility with existing and upcoming 3D TLC and 3D QLC NAND memory.

On the security side, the controller also supports real-time full-drive encryption using AES 128/256-bit, complies with TCG Opal 2.0, and includes hardware SHA-384/256 and True Random Number Generator (TRNG). For high-assurance applications, the chip can also work with a fingerprint reader, though it is unclear which interface it uses to communicate with such a device.



The SM2324 chip itself is made on TSMC's 12 nm-class low-power process technology to ensure both power efficiency and cost efficiency.

In terms of host compatibility, the SM2324 works with a broad range of platforms, including Windows XP and later, macOS 10.x and later, and Linux kernel 2.4 and above. It is also compatible with Apple ProRes recording and certified under Apple's MFi program, making it suitable for use in professional media environments with iPhone Pro Max smartphones (considering the fact that some movies are now shot on Pro-level iPhones, it is legitimate to call iPhone-based flows 'professional').

Silicon Motion's SM2324 comes in a 9mm × 9mm FCCSP-C package with a built-in aluminum heat spreader and therefore can be integrated into storage devices of various form factors, including very compact drives.

According to those familiar with the matter, it includes subsidiaries of SMIC

The U.S. Government is reportedly planning to add ""a number of Chinese chipmaking companies"" to its ever-expanding export blacklist, a move that could only be prevented by the prospect of a long-trade agreement with China. As reported by the Financial Times, the commerce department has compiled a list of companies to add to its list, notably including China memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory (CXMT).

The Financial Times claims the information comes from five people familiar with the matter, all of whom say the commerce department is proposing the addition of CXMT and others to the dreaded entity list.

The list, drafted by the Bureau of Industry and Security, reportedly includes subsidiaries of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), and Yangtze Memory Technologies Co, China's biggest chipmaker and memory chipmaker respectively, both of which are already listed.

The only reprieve for the company's could come from the recently-announced China and US trade deal. Announced in Geneva, the two have reached an agreement to rescind reciprocal tariffs for 90 days in the hopes of striking a more permanent and broader deal.

According to the report, officials have argued that adding more Chinese companies to the list could upset negotiations.

In March, the U.S. expanded the trade blacklist and closed subsidiary loopholes, adding some 80 entities to the list. 12 organizations including 11 in China are involved in AI and supercomputing, specifically tied to China's military. Seven of those were involved in quantum tech development for military application, while two had supplied restricted components to Huawei and HiSilicon, both of which are blacklisted.

It comes as the U.S. government also issued a global crackdown on the use of Huawei's Ascend AI chips, which it says violates export controls.

CXMT began producing DDR5 memory in December 2024, the first China-made DDR5 aimed at consumer PCs. CXMT was also one of a number of companies added to a list of Chinese companies allegedly linked to the People's Liberation Army by the U.S. Defense Department in January.

As the report notes, American companies are prohibited from selling to Chinese companies on the entity list without a license, due to concerns China is using American technology to support military development of hypersonic missiles and the modelling of nuclear weapons.

Acer is kicking off its Computex announcements with a pair of 14-inch gaming laptops. The company's two new gaming laptops, the Predator Triton 14 AI and Helios Neo 14 AI, are both being targeted at both gamers and creative professionals.The Triton 14 AI is extremely sleek (0.68 inches at its thickest point), but to get there, Acer is using a productivity-class processor. The Intel Core Ultra 9 288V is one of Intel's ""Lunar Lake"" processors with integrated RAM. This chip runs between 30W at base power, which isn't as powerful as most gaming laptop processors. We saw a similar case in the Razer Blade 16, which opted for a 28W AMD Ryzen chip to enable a thinner design.

Acer is using graphene on the CPU to serve as the thermal interface material, which the company says outperforms regular thermal paste by 14.5%.

Acer is pairing Lunar Lake with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPU using Nvidia's Studio drivers, which are optimized for creative applications. The system goes up to 32GB of RAM (on the CPU) and 2TB of storage.The Triton also features a 14.5-inch, 2880 x 1800 OLED touchscreen that runs up to 120 Hz and is Calman verified.There's also a haptic touchpad built into the wrist rest, similar to the MSI Titan and Dell XPS 13, that supports a stylus, which seems limited in terms of writing.

The system looks sleek, with a sparse design and a silver hinge with diamond cut edge designed to reflect different colors from different angles. Despite the slim design, you still get some gaming accouterments, like a per-key RGB keyboard.



If you want a more traditional gaming laptop, the Helios Neo 14 AI is a bit more conventional in its components. Here, Acer is using Intel's H-series ""Arrow Lake"" chips, going up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, though still using up to 32GB of RAM, up to 2 TB of storage, and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPU. It's also thicker than the Triton at 0.82 inches.

The Helios Neo will have two screen options. You get a 14.5-inch panel either way, but one is 2880 x 1800 at 120 Hz with a MUX switch (that typically requires rebooting the system), while a lower-res 2560 x 1600 option is faster at 165 Hz and uses Nvidia's Advanced Optimus to switch between the integrated GPU and the discrete one.The Predator Helios Neo has a metal lid with an RGB logo that you can customize, as well as a three-zone RGB keyboard.

Of the two laptops, only the Triton is certified as a Copilot+ PC. The Lunar Lake NPU, at 48 TOPS, is far more powerful than the Arrow Lake's 13 TOPS. Microsoft's Copilot+ PC requirements demand a minimum of 40 TOPS.Acer is also using Computex to update its Predator Orion 3000 to the latest chips from Intel and Nvidia, including up to an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070.The company hasn't announced North American pricing or release dates for any of these machines. Acer said it will release that information for the U.S. and Canada ""closer to market availability."" In Europe, the systems will launch in July, which might give us a rough window of when to expect them elsewhere.

All leaks point towards an MCM design for the high-end variants. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD is reportedly going big on core-counts with Zen 6 mobile next-generation, as suggested by a new rumor from HXL, backed by several other leakers. Codenamed ""Medusa Point"", these APUs will reportedly carry up to 22 hybrid cores, based on Zen 6, with classic, dense, and low-power options. Since Zen 6 is at least a year off, and mobile versions might not arrive until early 2027, we need to be careful about putting too much faith in this leak.

Medusa Point is slated to be the follow-up to AMD's current Zen 5-based Strix Point APU series. We probably won't see a direct shift to Medusa Point as AMD is reportedly working on the Gorgon Point (Strix Point refresh) family, planned as an intermediate step.

That being said, architecturally, Medusa Point will switch to the Zen 6 architecture, which should be detailed by AMD sometime around Computex next year. The graphics engine will allegedly adopt the updated RDNA 3.5+ design, though RDNA 4 would've been the ideal choice for many. It's probable RDNA 4 won't make its way to the APU landscape, since AMD's next-generation graphics architecture, UDNA 1 / RDNA 5, is projected for release during the same timeframe.

The mainstream Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 offerings from Medusa Point have been purported to feature up to 10 hybrid cores, divided across four classic Zen 6 cores, four dense Zen 6c cores, and two new LP (Low Power) cores. These LP cores are very likely smaller than their Zen 6c siblings, with their Voltage/Frequency operation tweaked for maximum efficiency. This is complemented by an eight Compute Unit equipped RDNA 3.5+ based graphics engine, similar to the Radeon 860M. The iGPU is a downgrade from the current 16-CU design on the Radeon 890M, but this was likely done to free up space on the chip for other components.

Medusa Point 1R5/R7=4C+4D+2LP+8CU RDNA 3.5+R9=12C CCD+4C+4D+2LP+8CU RDNA 3.5+APU=IOD👀May 16, 2025

RDNA 3.5+ is essentially the second refresh in the RDNA 3 line, and will likely bring various improvements on the machine-learning side, which could very well unlock FSR 4 functionality. These mainstream Ryzen 5/Ryzen 7 configurations are likely based on a monolithic design, expected to use a 3nm class node from TSMC.

Following that, next-generation APUs are shaping up to be thrilling for enthusiasts, as Ryzen 9 Medusa Point options have been rumored with a massive (up to) 22-core layout: a 12-core Zen 6 CCD (likely the same as Venice), four classic Zen 6 cores, four dense Zen 6c cores, and two LP cores. This strongly points to an MCM (Multi Chip Module) layout, where the 10-core chiplet with I/O and the iGPU from the mainstream (Ryzen 5/7) Medusa Point line would be connected alongside a beefier desktop/server-grade CCD with 12 cores, expected to be based on TSMC's N2 process.

Other details, such as the memory controllers, NPU, and cache configurations, have not been mentioned. We'll have to wait and see what RDNA 3.5+ offers, especially with Intel's new Celestial architecture arriving soon in Panther Lake. Based on preliminary specifications, AMD will likely take the lead on the CPU side versus Panther Lake. However, depending on when Medusa Point hits the market, its main competitor in the mobile space might end up being Nova Lake.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Alzheimer's: Real-world data shows lecanemab side effects are rare","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/lecanemab-drug-slows-alzheimers-safe-effective-side-effects-real-world-data","Fri, 16 May 2025 09:57:10 GMT","

While there is currently no cure for a type of dementia called Alzheimer's disease, over the last few years, new medications have been introduced to help manage disease symptoms and slow its progression.

One such medication is lecanemab, distributed under the brand name Leqembi, which was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2023. 

Like all medications, lecanemab has the potential for side effects, including headaches, dizziness, muscle aches, and blurred vision, as well as a very serious side effect known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), such as the presence of swelling or bleeding in the brain.

In November 2022, scientists published the results of the Clarity AD phase 3 clinical trial aimed at determining the safety and efficacy of lecanemab in people with early Alzheimer's disease. In that study, researchers found 0.8% of participants experienced ARIA-E (edema/effusion) and 0.7% showed signs of ARIA-H (hemorrhage/hemosiderin deposition).

Now, a new study recently published in JAMA Neurology reconfirms the Clarity AD findings by reporting that significant adverse events — such as ARIA — were rare and manageable in “real-world” use of lecanemab for people with very mild or mild Alzheimer's disease.

For this study, researchers recruited 234 people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, with an average age of about 74, who received lecanemab at the outpatient specialty memory clinic, Washington University Memory Diagnostic Center.

“Lecanemab is an antibody, a kind of protein normally made in your body by your immune system,” Barbara Joy Snider, MD, PhD, a professor of neurology at WashU Medicine and affiliated with the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, and co-senior author of this study, explained to Medical News Today. “Antibodies like lecanemab are designed to have specific targets and are manufactured, then administered to patients. Antibodies are used for many different conditions.” 

“Lecanemab was designed to recognize certain types of amyloid protein. This is a protein that is made in your body and can become misfolded. When this happens, it can interfere with brain activity and can form clumps called amyloid plaques. This is what happens in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid misfolding is not the only thing that happens in the brain in Alzheimer's disease, but it may be one of the first steps in the disease process that leads to memory loss and dementia.”— Barbara Joy Snider, MD, PhD

“In a large clinical trial, people who were treated with lecanemab for 18 months had about 25-30% less decline in their memory and thinking than did people who did not get the medication,” Snider said. 

“It is important to note that the people treated with lecanemab did have a loss in their memory and thinking, so the drug did not reverse or completely stop the memory loss, but it did significantly slow it down. Imaging studies showed that the lecanemab also reduced and sometimes cleared the amyloid plaques in the brain,” she added.

At the study's conclusion, researchers found that 1.8% of participants at the earliest stage of Alzheimer's disease showed symptoms of ARIA, compared to 27% of participants with mild Alzheimer's disease. 

“This finding emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis. The clinical trial results showed that people with very mild symptoms likely benefit more from medications like lecanemab (40-50% slowing of decline instead of 25-30%), so people with very mild symptoms have more benefit and fewer side effects. This is also when it is hardest to be sure someone has Alzheimer's disease, so it is very important that we continue to work to improve access to diagnosis for people with very mild symptoms.”— Barbara Joy Snider, MD, PhD

Snider and her team also discovered that of the 11 participants who experienced ARIA symptoms, the effects mostly disappeared within a few months, and no patients died. 

“This is very similar to what was seen in the clinical trial,” Snider commented. “This is very reassuring and tells us that these drugs can be used safely in a ‘real world' clinic population.”

“We will continue to follow our patients and hope to learn more about side effects of these medications and about how much they slow down memory loss,” she continued. “We look forward to sharing this information with other providers and to seeing larger studies through groups like Alz-Net. We are encouraged by our experience of providing amyloid-targeting treatments to appropriate patients and we look forward to the next generation of treatments for Alzheimer's disease.”

MNT spoke with John Dickson, MD, PhD, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, about this study. Dickson commented that the study's findings are generally in line with what he has observed at his center. 

“While ARIA does occur in patients treated with lecanemab, it has been manageable in our sub-specialty treatment program,” he explained. “The risk of ARIA is often the most significant consideration in eligible patients' decisions about whether to pursue treatment with anti-amyloid therapy or not.”

“Further research to identify patients at increased risk for ARIA, especially serious ARIA with concerning symptoms or radiographic features, could help clinicians advise patients with more personalized recommendations regarding treatment based on individual patients' risk profiles. This may help patients make more informed decisions regarding their treatment options. These treatment decisions include whether or not to pursue treatment with anti-amyloid therapy, and if so, whether lecanemab or donanemab would be a better option.”— John Dickson, MD, PhD

Dickson said that for future research, these findings should be examined in a larger patient sample and that the observation time should be extended. 

“In general, the risk of ARIA is highest in the first six months of treatment,” he explained. “While some of the patients included in this study had more than six months of treatment, some patients were observed for a shorter period of time. Thus, the results of this study may underestimate the number of patients who will develop ARIA from the study population.”

MNT also spoke with Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD, director of the Division of Geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this research. 

“While the approval of lecanemab offers a glimmer of hope for Alzheimer's patients, the potential for serious side effects makes it a complex decision for prescribing physicians,” Parulekar said. “Careful patient selection, monitoring, and open communication about the benefits and risks are essential.” 

“The benefit offered by lecanemab is a modest slowing of decline, not a cure or a dramatic reversal. It is important to weigh its benefit against the potential for serious side effects for each individual patient. This requires careful consideration of the patient's disease stage, overall health, and other risk factors.” — Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD

“Identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from lecanemab and least likely to experience serious side effects is crucial,” Parulekar added. “Additional safety data and ‘real world' experience [are] helpful for this process.”

MRI at 7 tesla (T) and 3 T field strengths showed similar accuracy in detecting triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and scapholunate ligament (SLL) injuries, according to a new study. Although some injuries were missed, MRI identified additional pathologies not seen on arthroscopy, supporting its complementary role in diagnosis.

""Neither MRI at 7 T nor 3 T can replace wrist arthroscopy, but MRI is an important complementary tool in the diagnostic workup of suspected wrist ligament injuries, with the ability to diagnose additional types of pathologies not accessible with arthroscopy,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Simon Götestrand, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. It was published online on May 08, 2025, in European Radiology.

This study was limited by a likely selection bias as all patients were scheduled for arthroscopy, increasing the probability of injury. The small sample size also limited the statistical power.

Open access funding was provided by Lund University. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Caring for complex patients — those experiencing a laundry list of conditions simultaneously — can be challenging for any physician. From incorporating multiple specialists to working with social workers, primary care physicians and more, figuring out the right calculus to help these particularly ill patients is often difficult. For hospitalists, that math can be even tougher.

Unlike certain specialists and primary care physicians, hospitalists don't know the majority of their patients well. They are unfamiliar with their backgrounds, familial and social situations, and often must bridge the gap between multiple practitioners and their opinions. But that doesn't mean hospitalists can't bring their own valuable perspective to the table.

“We own all the problems, but we do so willingly,” said Joseph Sweigart, MD, a hospitalist at Georgetown Community Hospital in Georgetown, Kentucky and associate professor at the University of Kentucky School of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky. “I often joke that I love taking care of the people rather than their organ systems. We get to consider all the issues and then present them to the patients holistically.”

The position has its pros and cons, but more than anything, it means a hospitalist must develop effective strategies for managing these complex patient cases.

The layers of complexity involved in each patient can range from physical to mental, and may also involve logistics, a lack of social support, and more. While physical ailments are often at the top of the list, psycho-social issues are taking an increasingly larger role in the treatment of complex patients, according to Adjoa Boateng Evans, MD, a critical care anesthesiologist at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. “A patient may have a severe psychiatric disease and a concurrent addiction, making placement outside the hospital a challenge,” she said. “Or if a patient has survived a critical illness, but is too ill to go home, we have to make decisions about long-term care.” 

Those decisions may be further complicated by issues like lack of insurance or little-to-no support system, which can present additional obstacles for hospitalists. “They are the primary in-patient doctor for many patients in the hospital,” said Evans. “If they've got multiple patients and psycho-social issues, too, patient management can be difficult.”

Additionally, hospitalists are in the unique position of managing admissions and discharges, all while keeping abreast of new data and results throughout a shift. “We are seeing these patients often at the sickest points of their lives,” said Maninder (Dolly) Abraham, MD, chief of hospitalist medicine at RWJBarnabas Health, West Orange, New Jersey. “A big challenge is that we don't know them or their families.” 

This means there is a learning curve when hospitalists take over a complex patient, and due to the severity of the patient's illnesses, they must overcome this curve swiftly. If patients are bouncing back and forth between the floor and the intensive care unit (ICU), that task can be even more convoluted.

Another issue hospitalists may face is bridging gaps between specialists. “You might have a patient with a fresh stent who comes in with GI bleeding,” said Sweigart. “The cardiologist would say the patient needs blood thinners, and the GI [gastrointestinal] doctor might say to stop those meds to help the gut. Both are right for those systems, but as hospitalists, we get all that information and must make decisions.”

While that can feel intimidating, with good communication and a willingness to collaborate, hospitalists can deliver the quality of care necessary to adequately support complex patients throughout their stay.

When managing a complex patient, at the top of a hospitalist's list is a comprehensive evaluation upon admission. From there, collaborating with a multi-disciplinary team becomes essential. “You should review records, reach out to the primary care physician, and reconcile the poly-pharmacy issue so that there are no side effects or adverse reactions,” said Anila Faizan, MD, medical director of the hospitalist program at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey. “You must communicate with everyone involved in the patient's care.”

You must also establish trust with the patient and their family and hold goals-of-care conversations with them. This requires a holistic approach that addresses social detriments along with the physical condition. Your patient will eventually move on to the next site of care — or their home, ideally — and you must begin addressing this on day 1.

“We're in-house for 10-12 hours and not running off to offices,” said Abraham. “We see the patients in the morning, look at their labs, and perform interdisciplinary rounds for plan of care and case management. Then, we follow up on rounds a second time, which often gives us a chance to have a conversation with the family. That gives us an advantage in the care of complex patients.”

It's essential that hospitalists take the initiative to establish collaboration with the entire care team, said Evans. “You might be hesitant to reach out to the ICU group, for instance,” she said. “But our breadth of knowledge on these patients is vast, and we're always happy to help collaborate.”

These conversations can lead to comanagement decision-making, often improving patient outcomes. When hospitalists add their two cents on patient care — and ask for the same in return — it can unearth the best route of care.

Evans said that much of this involves the art of storytelling, even more so than the science of medicine. “We give you a story about the patient, and you do the same in reverse,” she said. “We need to give each other the elevator pitch of what happened with a patient for a good hand off.”

Sweigart is a big fan of communication, too. “You can't overcommunicate,” he said. “You must be openly and transparently explaining all that's going on with a patient's care. We own the transitions process and act as the final decider, and the person who is working with the patients and their families.” 

This may involve levels of uncertainty, but that's ok, said Sweigart. “Embrace it, often,” he said. “Think about where a path is leading, and when a specialist thinks differently, work together.”

Ultimately, hospitalists are the coordinators of care, said Abraham. “We ensure that everyone is talking to each other — we are the common thread,” she said. “We relay that one message of plan of care to everyone because we see patients as a whole, not just an organ system or specialty.”

With this unique view of a patient, hospitalists should learn to defer as little as possible, advises Sweigart. “It's ok to double check or read more about the patient's conditions,” he said, “but do it tactfully so that you're maintaining ownership. This lets the patient see that we're in charge of their care and we'll work with them for the best outcome.”

Managing complex patients can be challenging — and even a bit scary — but it can also be highly rewarding, according to Sweigart. “Our job is to shepherd through these very vulnerable patients,” he said. “When all goes well, it's engaging, and even fun.”

 May 16, 2025  

The massive budget bill now being debated in Congress includes a proposal for raising Medicare pay for clinicians starting in 2026.

That could be good news for physicians who in 2025 saw a nearly 3% effective pay cut in Medicare reimbursement.

However, clinicians and advocates remain concerned about potentially large cuts to Medicaid, which covers about 71 million Americans.

The modest increase for 2026 Medicare pay is “welcome, but this is a large and complicated bill,” Anders Gilberg, senior vice president of government affairs for the Medical Group Management Association, told Medscape Medical News.

The House and Senate have yet to agree on the budget reconciliation bill.

Substantial Medicaid cuts also would likely have “negative repercussions for physician reimbursement,” Gilberg told Medscape Medical News.

“It remains to be seen how this will all net out in the end, but we appreciate our physician champions in the House working to address Medicare reimbursement shortfalls in an otherwise austere legislative package as it relates to healthcare,” Gilberg said.

Congress allowed a 2.83% cut in 2025 to the Medicare conversion factor, which is key to setting Medicare payment rates for services provided by about 1.3 million clinicians, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.

The Republican-controlled House Committee on Energy and Commerce has proposed raising the Medicare conversion factor equal to 75% of the estimated percentage increase in inflation, as determined by the Medicare Economic Index (MEI). In 2027 and following years, the increase would be 10% of that index.

Still, the committee's Democrats called this week for more than just a stopgap Medicare pay hike.

“This is woefully underfunding the need to address inflation,” said committee member Rep. Raul Ruiz, MD (D-CA), who worked as an emergency physician before joining Congress. “The Medicare physician fee schedule needs a permanent fix, not this temporary, short-changed fix.”

The Medicare pay proposal is part of House Committee on Energy and Commerce's section of a wide-ranging draft GOP legislative package, known as a reconciliation bill. The committee on Wednesday passed its section of the reconciliation text in a 30-24 vote along party lines.

Reconciliation is a special process in Congress that allows lawmakers to bypass some Senate procedural hurdles. It's a rare chance for the majority party to move significant legislation without getting the bipartisan support usually required for Senate passage of bills.

Reconciliation requires House and Senate lawmakers to concur on a budget blueprint, which has proven challenging.

There's strong bipartisan support in Congress for revising the Medicare physician fee schedule.

A bill introduced in 2023, which would have provided for an update equal to the annual MEI percentage increase, had 126 Democratic and 47 Republican co-sponsors.

Mark Miller, PhD, executive vice president of healthcare at the philanthropy Arnold Ventures, said Congress should try to shift Medicare away from its current reliance on the fee-for-service model.

Physicians earn revenue through both the volume of services provided and the price, as reflected in the payment rate, said Miller, a former executive director of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.

“Keeping in mind that Medicare physicians are financed by taxpayers and beneficiary premiums, payment rates should be deemed adequate when they assure beneficiaries have access to high-quality care — rather than blindly defaulting to the full Medicare Economic Index,” Miller wrote.

“That said, the long run updates…may be inadequate, and the Congress likely will need to revisit the updates — which will result in higher costs to taxpayers and beneficiaries,” Miller said.

He suggested offsetting these new costs with cuts to payments to Medicare Advantage plans for “upcoding,” or making patients appear more ill than they are.

Miller said savings could also be achieved by a shift to site-neutral policies, which would end higher pay for some services depending on the ownership of the facility.

 May 16, 2025  

More than 16,600 excess deaths in England last year were linked to accident and emergency (A&E) department waits of 12 hours or more, according to an analysis by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM).

This equates to around 320 additional deaths each week and marks a 20% increase from 2023 figures.

“To give it some context, it is the equivalent of two aeroplanes crashing every week,” said RCEM President Adrian Boyle, MD.

The findings were presented at Westminster on Thursday during the launch of an all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on emergency care, supported by the RCEM.

The figures are based on the standardised mortality ratio, which compares actual deaths in a particular cohort with those expected in a reference, age-standardised population.

According to the RCEM, one additional death occurs for every 72 patients waiting between 8 and 12 hours in the A&E department before admission.

In total, 16,644 excess deaths in 2024 were estimated to be linked to department waits of 12 hours or longer.

Boyle warned that the analysis captures only portion of the problem because the methodology applied only to patients waiting in the A&E department. Other patients likely to be affected include those left waiting in the community due to ambulance handover delays or those too anxious to seek help because of widespread access issues.

“The issue also affects A&E staff who are trying their best to deliver care in areas that are designed to be thoroughfares, not treatment spaces,” Boyle said.

Nick Murch, MBBCh, president of the Society for Acute Medicine (SAM), described the findings as “shocking.”

He said the scale of 12-hour department waits reflects a systemic failure and highlighted a 2024 paper published in Acute Medicine, co-authored by SAM President Elect Vicky Price, MBChB. It warned that so-called “corridor care” in emergency departments “is being normalised in many hospitals across the United Kingdom.” The situation caused both harm to patients and “morale injury” to staff.

Murch told Medscape News UK: “As we have said continuously about the dire state of monthly 12-hour waiting figures, it signifies a profound failure within our healthcare system.” Fixing the issue would require urgent action on workforce and capacity challenges, he added.

Boyle said that emergency care is solvable if flow through the system is improved. It required “getting patients into a ward bed when they need one and home again as soon as they are well enough to leave.”

The new APPG on emergency care will explore how to improve flow and reduce waits.

In 2024, over 1.7 million patients waited more than 12 hours in the A&E department to be admitted, discharged, or transferred. That's a 14% rise on the previous year. Of those, 69.2% were waiting to be admitted.

Almost half a million patients (478,901) waited more than 24 hours — 1 in every 35 attendances and over 100,410 more than the comparable figure for 2023.

The Office for National Statistics reported earlier this year that patients who stay in the A&E department for 12 hours or more are twice as likely to die within 30 days as those treated, admitted, or discharged within 2 hours.

NHS England figures showed A&E department attendances in 2024 reached a record high of 27.42 million, up 7.1% on the 25.61 million the previous year.

Julian Redhead, MBBS, national clinical director for Urgent and Emergency Care, NHS England, told Medscape News UK that the RCEM data highlighted the “unacceptable long waits” that too many patients face in the A&E department.

“Action to stop this happening will be at the heart of the upcoming 10 Year Health Plan,” he said.

He added that the NHS is reducing the number of national targets, “giving space to local clinical leaders to improve patients' care.”

Sheena Meredith, MBBS, MPhil, is an established medical writer, editor, and consultant in healthcare communications, with extensive experience writing for medical professionals and the general public. She is qualified in medicine and in law and medical ethics.

 May 16, 2025  

Medical school graduate Eshani Kishore never received any formal education in how to treat patients with disabilities, considered one of the largest minority groups in the nation.

“If we were more broadly prepared through formal disability education to interact with these patients, then the patients would almost certainly experience better health outcomes,” said Kishore, who is graduating from Paul L. Foster School of Medicine in El Paso, Texas.

More than 1 in 4 adults in the country, about 29%, have some type of disability, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define as a condition of the body or mind that limits their interactions and makes it more difficult to perform certain activities.

The same ratio of adults with disabilities, 1 in 4, do not have a regular healthcare clinician, and 1 in 6 did not have a routine checkup in the past year, according to the CDC. As a result of such barriers, people with disabilities are more likely to have poorer overall health with an increased risk for preventable health conditions, the CDC reported.

Depending on the source Medscape Medical News consulted, medical schools are either providing appropriate disability care education or not providing enough in the best way to improve the health of people with disabilities.

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, the Medscape Medical School Experience Report 2024 found that

However, complaints ranged from

Joshua Marquez, who recently graduated from The University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque, New Mexico, considers the training he received in a single half-day session on disability care 2 years ago a helpful introduction to the subject.

“I was satisfied with what I learned because the rest is within actual practice,” said Marquez, who will begin his neurosurgery residency at the school. “Having a lot of didactic lectures would not be the most useful.”

The goal of the training session involved required reading that “emphasized the structural factors that lead to healthcare inequities for disabled patients,” he said. “We also covered inclusive communication strategies for patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities [IDD], which I found the most practical in terms of learning for clinical practice.”

The latest in a series of studies by Northwestern Medicine found that medical students haven't been taught adequately to care for people with disabilities because there's a lack of standardized disability education in medical schools.

Students may have learned about disability in individual lectures, seminars, or electives led by peers or faculty who personally experience disability or were interested in the subject, as per the study published earlier this year in Journal of General Internal Medicine.

Some of those same students and faculty teaching others about caring for people with disabilities are leading efforts to convince medical education leaders to add more disability training to the curricula. But change has been slow, the study concluded.

“Without improvements to disability-related curricular content, physicians will remain ill-equipped to care for the nation's largest minority group,” the research concluded.

The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) acknowledges that medical education on disability care is not standardized “but is intentionally designed, delivered, and governed by the local faculty to support the needs of their local community,” said Lisa Howley, senior director of AAMC's Transforming Medical Education.

She cited AAMC's most recent report showing that the vast majority (95%) of medical schools surveyed include disability as a required curriculum and 73% as required curriculum and elective courses. Only 2% of schools, a total of three, indicated the topic wasn't covered, and 87% participated in the 2022-2023 survey.

Disability education, Howley said, may include:

However, the lead author of the Northwestern Medicine study isn't convinced medical schools are providing enough disability education.

“How they teach about disability is what matters,” said Carol Haywood, assistant professor of medical social sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago. “Programs saying that they have required disability curriculum doesn't change that students feel underprepared to care for people with disabilities and that faculty feel unsupported to teach about disability.”

She believes having a medical workforce trained to treat people with disabilities will be increasingly important to keep up with a growing population of aging Americans, especially those who have disabilities. “It's problematic that doctors are not prepared to care for a higher proportion of people with disabilities,” said Haywood.

For many decades, disabilities have been referred to as conditions to be prevented, treated, or cured, the American Medical Association (AMA) stated in an educational primer on disabilities, part of its 2024-2025 strategic plan to advance health equity.

Terms such as “normal” and “abnormal” are still common in International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems diagnostic codes and medical assessments required for people to access services, benefits, or accommodations, the primer stated.

Medical students usually learn about disabilities as a problem or weakness to diagnose, treat, and eliminate as if they are an illness or disease, Haywood said. If a disability is considered bad by the patient, family, or society, students may also harbor negative bias against the person with the disability, she explained.

The findings of the Northwestern Medicine study resulted from focus groups with faculty and students from medical schools across the country between September 2021 and February 2022. The research team, which included clinicians and professors from Northwestern, Brown University, and Harvard Medical School, chose study participants based on their knowledge of disability-related training and involvement in efforts to advance disability-related medical education.

Participants represented a range of clinical interests and specialties, genders, faculty rank, and, in the case of students, varied points of training. It wasn't criteria for enrollment, but participants either had a disability or were supportive of people with disabilities through personal experiences with family or friends.

The new study was built on previous research by some of the same authors. In a national survey of 714 physicians published by Health Affairs in 2021, only about 40% of doctors reported feeling very confident providing equitable care to people with disabilities.

Another study published a year later in the same journal revealed doctors' strategies for discharging patients with disabilities from their practices with such comments as “I am not the doctor for you.”

Haywood said, “We wanted to understand why physicians were unprepared to care for this population.”

A similar study published last year in the AMA Journal of Ethics also discusses the lack of disability training in medical education, the biases of healthcare professionals against people with disabilities, and how it contributes to inequitable care.

It states that, “Future clinicians must recognize disability as an aspect of diversity, express respect for disabled patients, and demonstrate flexibility about how to care for disabled patients' needs. These skills are currently undervalued in medical training.”

The study urges healthcare educators to better prepare the future medical workforce, such as adopting the core disability competencies for healthcare education proposed in 2019 by the Alliance for Disability in Health Care Education. The core competencies provide broad disability standards for healthcare education.

In addition, the AMA has a health policy on medical care for people with disabilities, last updated in 2022, which calls for medical schools and graduate medical education programs to train doctors to properly care for patients with disabilities and improve their health. The policy also seeks legislation to increase funding to train doctors in such care and raise insurance and government reimbursements to accurately reflect the cost of that care.

The National Inclusive Curriculum for Health Education offers grants to medical schools and student scholarships to expand curriculum in IDD and encourage clinical away rotations in IDD.

Haywood believes expansion of disability education should be tied to accreditation. “Even faculty that try to build it into the curricula are told it's not a priority to meet accreditation. They receive pushback from medical schools who say the curriculum is already too full. There's no external motivation to make sure there is disability training.”

The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), which accredits medical education programs, said it does not prescribe specific curricular topics. It expects the faculty of its accredited schools to make those decisions, according to LCME co-secretary Ronnie Catanese.

Disability training also is hampered by the lack of faculty able to teach it, Haywood said. “They can't teach what they don't know so there are gaps in knowledge and skills within clinical practice and in academic settings.”

Howley cited the AAMC's ongoing efforts to improve “how we educate physicians and other healthcare professionals to care for those persons with disabilities.” AAMC was a founding member of a coalition formed in 2021 to build national strategies for better preparing clinicians to care for people with disabilities.

The organization representing medical schools also supported the planning of a recent summit by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education on disability-inclusive resident education that will help “how we educate physicians, especially medical students, and residents in caring for persons with disabilities.”

Though she is graduating med school, Kishore believes medical students would benefit from a formal class during the preclinical years to prepare them to care for patients with disabilities. She is starting her internal medicine residency at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas.

Marquez believes medical trainees would benefit from more direct engagement with patients who have disabilities, and disability care that's integrated into lessons throughout their training, reinforced through practical experiences in a variety of medical settings.

“Disability care is something we engage with throughout our entire careers. Whether or not it's explicitly labeled as ‘disability training,' it's inherently ingrained in how we practice and learn as physicians since we all encounter patients with disabilities,” said Marquez.

Haywood agreed that disability training shouldn't be limited to one class, panel discussion, or workshop but should be taught throughout medical training.

In recent years, she said she's become optimistic about educational leaders prioritizing disability training in medical school. Still, such education has traditionally been included in diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, threatened lately by federal budget cuts, so it remains to be seen if disability training will gain the attention she believes it deserves.

 May 16, 2025  

The largest study to date of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy for essential tremor identified a target area within the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) that could significantly differentiate patients with optimal vs suboptimal outcomes at 1 year.

“We now have a very clear map of where to sonicate for optimal outcomes and where not to sonicate to avoid side effects,” senior author Andreas Horn, MD, PhD, director of Deep Brain Stimulation Research, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, told Medscape Medical News. “We also have a better understanding of the structural connection in both tremor control and the occurrence of side effects.”

Studies show unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy can result in about a 40% improvement in the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor at 3 months, but transient or permanent adverse sensory, motor, speech, and gait effects can occur in up to 40% of patients.

Several novel imaging studies have investigated optimal targets, or sweet spots, but to date, there is no optimal or standardized protocol. Recent work using probabilistic mapping of ablative effects, or sweet spot mapping, supports the VIM proper or its ventral border as the optimal target, but little quantitative evidence exists on sites associated with side effects, and large cohort studies are lacking, the authors noted.

The findings were published online on May 14 in Science Advances.

For the study, the researchers calculated sweet spots and side effects, or sour spots, using prospective data from 200 patients (mean age, 75 years; 68% men) who underwent unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy for medically refractory essential tremor at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Their total Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) Tremor Rating Scale score was 7.1, and the average disease duration was 27.6 years.

The main tremor sweet spot result was then validated in an additional 102 patients from the center in Boston and 49 patients who underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Tremor was reduced by 94.9% at postoperative day 1 and by 91.6% at 3 months. At 1 year, the average overall FTM improvement was 86% and remained significant (P < .001).

The area of optimal tremor control at 1 year was identified at the center towards the anterior portion of the VIM and intersected with the cerebellothalamic tract (CTT) as defined by the Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Tractography Atlas and the Basal Ganglia Pathway Atlas.

Fiber filtering analysis revealed that 70% of tracts in the DBS atlas and 100% in the Basal atlas associated with optimal tumor control corresponded to the CTT and remained significant after Bonferroni correction (P < .05).

The team then tested whether the sweet spot could be used as a model to predict outcomes in the two validation cohorts and found that weighted average lesion overlaps significantly correlated with the percentage of tremor improvements at 3 months and 1 year.

“Indeed, the more this optimal site was lesioned, the better the tumor response was in these independent cohorts,” Horn said. “This has so far never been done in the field of MRgFUS.”

The findings were further validated in a cohort of six cases that underwent a second treatment, which adds unique insights into cases that had unsuccessful and successful treatment sessions, he added.

Side effects occurred in 75.88% of patients on day 1 post-thalamotomy, 52.44% at 3 months, and 37.5% at 1 year. The most common side effect on postoperative day 1 was gait imbalance (63.3%), followed by sensory deficits (24.6%), dysarthria (16.6%), and weakness (10.6%). Gait imbalance remained the most common side effect at 3 months (26.7%) and 1 year (17.1%). All side effects were mild.

Lesions extending ventrolaterally toward the inferior region of the VIM were associated with an increased risk for gait imbalance. Dysarthria was associated with lesions extending superomedially.

Sensory side effects and dysgeusia were associated with lesions extending posteriorly and medially into the ventral posterolateral and ventral posteromedial nuclei. Lesions extending laterally into the internal capsule were associated with weakness.

All sour spots and tracts were significant after Bonferroni correction (P < .05), except dysarthria and dysgeusia, which were significant at the uncorrected level.

Quantitative analysis of tracts revealed 100% correspondence to the medial lemniscus for sensory deficits, 52% to the corticospinal tract (CST) for weakness, 44% to the CTT and 16% to the CST for imbalance, and 55% correspondence to the trigeminothalamic tract and medial lemniscus for dysgeusia.

Larger lesion sizes were associated with stronger tremor improvement but also with side effects, “suggesting a cost-benefit trade-off,” Horn and colleagues noted.

“The present work identifies a target site that may be critical to sonicate for optimal response and can be transferred into individual patient anatomy using the methods developed in the present article,” Horn said.

“A next step will be to prospectively test results in future cohorts. If successful, this could help streamline and somewhat standardize the process of FUS [focused ultrasound] surgeries for thalamotomies,” he added.

He noted that it remains unclear whether the identified sweet spot is the total volume needed to sonicate, in which case lesions could be rather small, or whether, more likely, it is the differentiating portion of the tissue that needs to be lesioned in addition to adjacent regions.

Reached for comment, Bhavya R. Shah, MD, director of the Transcranial-FUS Lab, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, told Medscape Medical News that the retrospective analysis “supports the premise that targeting discrete and specific brain regions while avoiding others can improve tremor response and reduce adverse effects.”

The challenge with the paper, he said, is that it uses indirect or landmark-based targeting to treat patients and a combination of postoperative imaging, an atlas of population-based white matter tracts, and image registration approaches to determine where the final lesion was, what tracts were in the target zone, and clinical outcomes associated with the affected tracts.

“Indirect targeting methods suffer from inaccuracies based on human anatomic variation, subjectivity, experience, as well as underlying pathological derangement of the thalamus and surrounding structures,” Shah said.

“This work and others like it support the premise of prospectively using this anatomic knowledge to perform targeting instead of indirect targeting,” he added.

In 2022, his team reported initial results in 18 patients with essential tremor using four-tract tractography, which uses advanced imaging techniques to map discrete patient-specific anatomy to prospectively identify brain regions for treatment. This overcomes some of the concerns with indirect targeting and has shown benefit in a recent case study and independent retrospective analysis of 43 patients, Shah noted.

Asked about the technique, Horn said, “we see value in novel approaches such as four-tract tractography but see issues in the diffusion MRI sequences used in such approaches, which are typically prone to distortion artifacts and of poor resolution, ie, are not perfectly suited for stereotactic surgery, in which millimeters matter.”

“The use of specialized sequences such as the white-matter-nulled or FGATIR (fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery) sequences, as used here, have less of these limitations and still beautifully visualizes the key tracts such as the cerebellothalamic connections,” he said.

The study was funded by National Institutes of Health grants, a Neuronentics grant, the Kaye Family Research Endowment, the Ellison/Baszucki Family Foundation, the Manley Family, a FUS Foundation grant, and the Schilling Foundation. Horn reported receiving lecture fees from Boston Scientific, consultancy fees for FxNeuromodulation and Abbott, and serving as co-inventor of a patent granted to Charité University Medicine, Berlin, Germany, which covers multisystem DBS fiber filtering and an automated DBS algorithm unrelated to this work. Co-author disclosures are listed in the paper. Shah reported no relevant financial disclosures.

 May 16, 2025  

The teratogenic risk of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) has been a major concern in pharmacovigilance over the past several decades. However, neurodevelopmental and autism-related risks associated with these medications have gradually emerged. Although international registries provide information, they are not sufficiently comprehensive to fully assess the risks posed by many AEDs introduced in the past 20 years.

This dual challenge concerning parents and limited information provided to them by the clinicians was discussed by neurologist Sophie Dupont, MD, PhD, head of the Department of Neurological Rehabilitation at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France, during the French Language Neurology Days Congress held in Clermont-Ferrand, France, from 15-18 April 2025.

“Future parents are worried, and physicians are perplexed about the nature of the information they should provide, given its highly fluctuating nature,” said Dupont. She also reviewed the current robust knowledge and uncertainties.

The teratogenic risks of first- and second-generation AEDs were identified in the 1970s. Since then, the number of new drugs has increased significantly. Registries such as the EURAP, which tracks pregnant women treated with AEDs, have advanced our understanding.

The registry has recently clarified the dose-dependent relationships between teratogenicity and some molecules.

For instance, sodium valproate exhibits progressive dose-dependent teratogenicity, whereas carbamazepine exhibits toxicity above a threshold dose. However, the risks associated with the use of topiramate and pregabalin remain unknown. Levetiracetam and lamotrigine appear to lack teratogenic risks; however, data on newer drugs, such as lacosamide, zonisamide, and cenobamate, are insufficient.

The risks for neurodevelopmental and autism spectrum disorders associated with AEDs are complex.

Concerns about sodium valproate and topiramate emerged in 2009, with in utero exposure linked to a twofold to fourfold increased risk of developing autism. However, recent registry data have challenged the risk for autism associated with topiramate use, suggesting that epilepsy may be an underlying factor. However, data on other AEDs are limited and inconclusive.

“Folate deficiency has been suspected as a factor in the teratogenicity of these drugs, but conflicting data on preconception folate supplementation remains unresolved,” Dupont noted. It is unclear whether folate supplementation prevents neural tube defects, although it may improve cognitive outcomes in fetuses. This issue may be due to dosage such as dose above 0.4 mg/day; however, methodological biases in studies prevent definitive conclusions.

Another uncertainty is the neurodevelopmental risk associated with paternal AED use during conception. Some studies have suggested a higher risk among children born to fathers treated with sodium valproate. “However, this study did not account for the indication of the prescription, which could introduce a bias. Another study that avoided this bias did not find the same risk.”

The European Medicines Agency is still awaiting the results of major studies.

Dupont stated that “the biggest challenge ahead was the complete lack of data on third-generation AEDs, with the exception of lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and oxcarbazepine. We may never have this data because we know that third-generation drugs are free of teratogenicity.”

This could pose challenges for women whose epilepsy is not effectively treated with these medications.

“The best approach would be to understand the mechanisms underlying teratogenicity,” she added. These mechanisms have been extensively studied in sodium valproate, including folate metabolism disorders that reduce embryonic folic acid, disrupt gene expression, increase embryonic oxidative stress, epigenetic modifications, histone acetylation, and hypomethylation, and with topiramate, including GABAergic signaling and DNA methylation. The fact that “the teratogenicity of certain drugs only manifests in some children also suggests a genetic susceptibility in certain mothers,” she noted.

To better understand these risks, it is essential to structure information so that it can be updated in real time and continue enrolling women in registries. “Given the uncertainty surrounding robust data for the most recent drugs, it is imperative to develop reliable and predictive animal models for the potential teratogenicity and neurodevelopmental or autism-related risks of these medications,” concluded Dupont.

 May 16, 2025  

Orlando, Fla. — Fracture risk in people treated for obesity appears significantly lower with semaglutide (Wegovy) vs sleeve gastrectomy, new data suggest.

Previous animal studies have suggested a dose-dependent effect of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists on trabecular bone, including increased osteoblast activity, reduced apoptosis, and suppressed osteoclast activity. However, human data have been limited.

A recent study utilizing a real-world electronic health record (EHR) database found that individuals with obesity who were treated with semaglutide experienced a significantly lower fracture risk — 26% less — compared with those who underwent bariatric surgery. The data were presented at American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) Annual Meeting 2025 by Jairo Noreña, MD, a second-year endocrinology fellow at Stanford University, Stanford, California.

“Considering weight loss per se is a risk factor for bone loss and microarchitecture impairment, we were excited to find a positive association with lower fracture risk favoring GLP-1 agonists. This correlation suggests that there are mechanisms that play a role reducing fracture risk in people using semaglutide. We were surprised by this finding, and it's an exciting correlation that warrants further study,” Noreña told Medscape Medical News.

Clinically, he said, the data imply “that patients…may benefit from a more favorable bone outcome [with semaglutide] compared to those who undergo sleeve gastrectomy for weight loss and should guide clinicians to favor this medication class in patients at higher risk of bone loss. We need further studies to help us understand this correlation, but so far with this data, most subjects with even average bone fracture risk will have a lower fracture risk when they use semaglutide vs undergoing sleeve gastrectomy.” 

Asked to comment, Session Moderator Sara E. Lubitz, MD, associate professor of medicine and endocrine program director at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, New Jersey, told Medscape Medical News, “We've known for a long time that bariatric surgery leads to decreased bone density. Is semaglutide really protective, or is it just a different degree of weight loss or a different patient population that we're using the semaglutide in? There are so many other variables.”

Lubitz noted that the outcomes might differ between individuals with diabetes and those without, as well as among postmenopausal women. But she said that the findings “at least give us more things that we need to look at in general about semaglutide and fractures compared to baseline populations.”

Noreña noted, “Diabetes itself may be a risk factor for osteoporosis, but semaglutide appears to play a protective role on bone health for obese individuals with or without diabetes during their weight loss journey.”

The retrospective cohort analysis used the Eversana Life Sciences EHR dataset, representing more than 130 million patients seen at community hospitals and large practices in the Unites States from January 2016 to December 2023. The authors identified 92,405 adults with obesity and no prior history of fractures who were treated with semaglutide and 16,082 similar adults who had undergone sleeve gastrectomy, both within 1 year of obesity diagnosis.

After high-dimensional propensity scoring, there were 2887 individuals in each treatment group. They had a mean age of 45 years, more than three quarters were women, and about half were White individuals. The semaglutide group had a higher prevalence of diabetes than the sleeve gastrectomy group, 40.2% vs 30.1%.

Over an average 3-year follow-up, there were 86 fractures (3.0%) in the semaglutide group compared with 128 fractures (4.4%) in sleeve gastrectomy group (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI, 0.56-0.98).

Noreña told Medscape Medical News, “Some questions to address include whether these findings are independent of the class and could be observed in terzipatide or other GLP-1 agonists.”

During his presentation, Noreña said that because surgical weight-loss interventions can affect nutrient absorption and reduce the absorption of both micro- and macronutrients, his group recently conducted a new retrospective analysis evaluating fracture outcome of semaglutide compared with oral medications such as phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia) and naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave).

In this study, patients were matched based on their change in body mass index. Semaglutide significantly reduced the risk for any fracture by 25%. “This reinforces the potential protective mechanism that other weight-loss modalities may lack,” Noreña said, adding that more detailed information will be presented at a later date.

Long-term survival analysis reveals comparable outcomes between simple hysterectomy and modified radical hysterectomy (MRH) or radical hysterectomy (RH) in women with low-risk cervical carcinoma.

“In this cohort study, long-term survival was similar following [simple hysterectomy] vs MRH or RH, supporting the use of [simple hysterectomy] in select patients with low-risk early-stage cervical carcinoma,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Christopher M. Tarney, MD, and Kathleen M. Darcy, PhD, from the Gynecologic Cancer Center of Excellence, Department of Gynecologic Surgery and Obstetrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. It was published online on May 15 in JAMA Network Open.

Researchers could not perform central surgicopathologic review of cases or evaluate details regarding treatments or recurrence rates. This study design inherently involved possibilities for selection bias, confounding, and loss to follow-up. Additionally, investigators were unable to explain utilization rates of simple hysterectomy between 2010 and 2017, examine data on late complications (especially bladder complications), time to disease failure and sites of failure, or investigate quality of life.

Use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), but not other medications for HIV, was associated with a significantly reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in an analysis of two national databases. NRTIs are antiretroviral drugs that block the activation of inflammasome.

“These findings support the concept that inflammasome inhibition could benefit AD and provide a rationale for prospective clinical testing of inflammasome inhibitors such as NRTIs in AD,” the investigators wrote.

“Our results suggest that taking these drugs could prevent approximately 1 million new cases of AD every year,” corresponding investigator Jayakrishna Ambati, MD, Center for Advanced Vision Science, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, said in a press release.

This study was led by Joseph Magagnoli, Dorn Research Institute, Columbia VA Health Care System, Columbia, South Carolina. It was published online on May 08 in Alzheimer's and Dementia.

This study was limited by potential residual or unmeasured confounding, lack of genetic data, lack of clinical measures of disease progression, and potential biases from differences among cohorts in terms of healthcare access and diagnostic practices.

Timing of administration did not affect the risks and benefits of antihypertensive medication, and patient preference should guide the choice of morning vs nighttime dosing in adults with hypertension.

“Loosening the rules on time of dosing may facilitate better supervision by caregivers, who may be able to provide assistance or oversight later in the day due to other responsibilities,” wrote Sandra Taler, MD, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, in an accompanying editorial. 

“Regular dosing and use of long-acting medications should be emphasized and may better address concerns related to BP [blood pressure] variability,” she added.

This study was led by Scott R. Garrison, MD, PhD, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It was originally presented at European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2024 and published online on May 12, 2025, in JAMA.

The adherence to the allocated medication timing was self-reported and was lower in the bedtime group than in the morning group. The trial concluded early due to funding issues with fewer primary outcomes than previous trials. 

This trial reported receiving funding from a multiyear grant to Support for Patient Oriented Research Innovative Clinical Trial from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and a Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Health System grant from Alberta Innovates.

Infants born to mothers with disabilities had higher rates of emergency department (ED) visits in their first year of life than those born to mothers without disabilities.

""This cohort study found that infants of women with a disability were more likely than infants of women without disabilities to have an ED visit and repeat ED visits, although the timing, diagnosis, discharge disposition, and rates of follow-up with the primary care physician within 7 days were similar,"" the authors wrote. ""These findings suggest that more could be done for infants of women with a disability to prevent nonurgent ED visits, reduce risk factors for urgent ED visits, and support families when ED visits occur,"" they added.

The study was led by Hilary K. Brown, PhD, University of Toronto Scarborough, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and was published online on May 5, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

Misclassification of disability status was a limitation. Additionally, the study lacked information on the severity of disability, the preventability of ED visits in outpatient settings, and the circumstances surrounding the decision to seek ED care, such as the quality of the relationship with the primary care physician, transportation issues, or distance to care.

Aptamer Group plc, the leading developer of next-generation synthetic binders delivering innovation to the life science industry, presented new data on its Optimer therapeutic delivery vehicle for liver fibrosis at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Annual Meeting in New Orleans, LA (13-17 May 2025).

Developed through an internal research program and in collaboration with AstraZeneca, the Optimer system is based on next-generation synthetic oligonucleotide ligands designed to achieve tissue-specific targeting. The latest findings show that the Optimer construct selectively targets fibrotic tissue across multiple organ systems—including liver, kidney, skin, lung, and heart—and is compatible with both mouse and rat models, for convenient transition to preclinical animal studies.

These results establish the translational potential of the Optimer platform, which has shown compatibility with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and demonstrated effective delivery of three distinct siRNA payloads to fibrotic sites. This modularity supports the platform's adaptability for a broad range of therapeutic applications in the context of fibrosis, where there is high unmet need.

The platform's ability to engage multiple fibrotic tissues suggests a shared pathophysiological targeting mechanism that may be exploited to develop precision anti-fibrotic therapies. These findings position the Optimer platform as a promising candidate for further preclinical validation and potentially clinical development, especially given the high unmet need and limited treatment options in fibrotic disease.

These results broaden the scope of Aptamer's internal development program, indicating our delivery vehicle could address a broad range of disease areas. While fibrotic liver disease remains a major focus due to its large market size and limited treatment options, the potential to expand into pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and dermal fibrosis greatly increases the scope of this delivery system.

With the market for liver fibrosis treatments set to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 24% through 2035, driven by new drugs under development and rising disease prevalence, the Group is well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum. Aptamer's ongoing collaboration with AstraZeneca continues to generate compelling data, and multiple pharmaceutical companies have initiated discussions to explore partnerships over the next few months.”

In this interview, industry expert Blake Webb shares insights on the future of fluidic technology, highlighting trends in automation, microfluidics, and smart systems shaping medical diagnostics and laboratory workflows.

Over the years, fluidics in medical devices and laboratory equipment has evolved from large, centralized systems to highly integrated, compact solutions—especially for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. The demand for faster diagnostics, reduced supply chain dependencies, and cost-effective instrumentation has pushed OEMs toward miniaturized, precise fluidic systems.

At Fluid Metering, our core technology has long supported traditional, high-reliability architectures. Our pumps are engineered as precision instrumentation designed to last the full lifecycle of medical and diagnostic devices, making them a cornerstone of high-accuracy fluid management. However, as the industry shifts towards microfluidics and smaller, more integrated systems, we recognize the need to adapt and innovate.

As the new Head of Product, my focus is on bridging that gap—leveraging our legacy of precision and reliability while evolving toward more compact, high-performance fluidic solutions that meet the growing demands of next-generation medical and lab devices.

One of the most significant advancements in fluidic technology has been the rise of microfluidics, which has transformed medical diagnostics and research—particularly in drug discovery, gene therapies, and high-throughput screening. These systems allow for extremely precise handling of small fluid volumes, reducing reagent costs while increasing sensitivity and automation.

Companies like Tecan and Hamilton have led the way in integrating advanced fluidic handling into fully automated lab workflows. However, as fluidic technology evolves, there's growing demand for next-generation pumps and fluid handling systems that seamlessly integrate into microfluidic architectures while maintaining reliability and cost-efficiency.

At Fluid Metering, we recognize this shift and are actively exploring how to leverage our precision fluidics expertise to support these advancements—ensuring that medical and laboratory workflows remain both high-performance and commercially viable.

Modern fluidic systems enhance precision and efficiency in medical diagnostic devices by ensuring high accuracy, minimal reagent waste, and long-term reliability. For OEMs, this translates into significant cost savings, not just in reduced consumable waste but also in eliminating field service costs and improving end-user satisfaction.

One of the biggest challenges we see is that many OEMs prioritize bottom-line costs over total cost of ownership. This often leads to the selection of lower-precision fluidics, which can result in higher reagent consumption, assay failures, and increased service calls—ultimately frustrating end users. If customers switch to a competitor's instrument due to these issues, OEMs risk losing decades of recurring revenue from consumables.

We've worked with proactive OEMs who recognize this, and ROI calculations have revealed potential savings in the hundreds of millions of dollars—a massive, often overlooked opportunity. At Fluid Metering, our goal is to help OEMs see beyond upfront costs and optimize fluidic performance for long-term success.

Fluidics—the science of precisely controlling liquids and gases—is present at every stage of laboratory workflows, from sample preparation to analysis and data integration. Automation in fluidics has revolutionized research and clinical testing by reducing human error, increasing throughput, and enhancing reproducibility.

As laboratory automation continues to advance, the demand for high-precision, low-maintenance fluidic solutions will grow. At Fluid Metering, we see an opportunity to evolve our technology to better align with automated workflows, ensuring greater efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness for our OEM partners.

Several key trends are shaping the future of fluidics in medical devices and laboratory equipment:

At Fluid Metering, we are focused on advancing fluidic technologies that integrate reliability, precision, and smart automation, ensuring our OEM partners stay ahead of evolving industry demands.

One of my favourite emerging technologies in fluidics is smart & connected fluidics. As laboratory and diagnostic workflows become more automated, there is an increasing need for fluidic systems that are not just precise, but also intelligent—capable of self-monitoring, adjusting flow rates in real time, and integrating with AI-driven diagnostics.

At Fluid Metering, we are actively exploring ways to bring greater intelligence and connectivity to our fluidic solutions. A key part of this effort is our collaboration with our parent company, Roper, to integrate smart fluidic systems directly into Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). This will enable a seamless connection between fluidics and data management, providing OEMs and laboratories with a more comprehensive, automated solution. By leveraging LIMS integration, we can offer real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and advanced analytics, helping laboratories optimize performance, reduce downtime, and improve reproducibility.

Beyond smart fluidics, we are also highly interested in single-use and disposable fluidic systems, as they play an essential role in contamination-free diagnostics and biopharmaceutical applications. As these technologies evolve, we see significant opportunities for Fluid Metering to leverage our precision fluidics expertise in new, cutting-edge applications.

One of the biggest challenges when working with highly sensitive fluids in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics is the wide range of properties these fluids can have. Customers ask us to dispense materials that vary significantly in viscosity, composition, and particle content—including suspended and unsuspended solids like magnetic beads or silica gel beads. These applications require precise, consistent, and contamination-free handling, which can be difficult to achieve without specialized fluidic solutions.

For example, our pumps are used in delicate dispensing applications such as mAb (monoclonal antibody) metering and silica bead suspensions, both of which require extreme precision to maintain fluid integrity. Two of the most common concerns we hear from customers are shear stress and pulsation—both of which can negatively impact sensitive biological or particulate-laden fluids. While our pumps often push the boundaries of feasibility, we've found that working closely with OEMs and our engineering team can help optimize solutions that successfully meet application requirements.

Another major challenge is handling crystallizing fluids. Some reagents and pharmaceutical formulations are prone to precipitation, scaling, or clogging, which can compromise instrument performance and fluidic pathways. To address this, we have developed proprietary technologies, including specialized coatings and custom ceramic components, that prevent crystallization and ensure long-term system reliability.

Ultimately, the key to successfully handling sensitive fluids is understanding the specific interaction between the fluid, the dispensing mechanism, and the application requirements. A one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work—OEMs benefit the most when they engage early in the design phase to ensure the fluidic system is optimized for their unique needs.

Balancing innovation, cost, and practicality in fluidic product development requires close collaboration with OEMs to ensure that new technologies are not only technically advanced but also commercially viable. While we are always pushing the boundaries of precision, integration, and reliability, our success depends on how well our solutions align with our OEM partners' needs, product roadmaps, and cost structures.

Our approach is built on three key pillars:

Our most successful innovations come from strong partnerships with OEMs who understand that fluidic performance is a key differentiator in their instruments. At Fluid Metering, we see ourselves as an extension of our OEM partners' engineering teams, ensuring that innovation translates into real-world benefits—whether through precision, reliability, or cost-effectiveness.

We believe the future of fluidics lies in highly integrated, smart, and scalable solutions that enable OEMs to stay ahead of industry demands while ensuring their products remain commercially competitive and scientifically robust.

We are at a critical inflection point in fluidics, driven by the integration of AI and smart automation. Previously, the adoption of IoT 4.0 and smart factories was seen as too complex, requiring extensive instrumentation and control (I&C), verification and validation (V&V), and regulatory documentation. AI is rapidly simplifying these challenges, unlocking new possibilities in automation.

One of the most exciting opportunities I've heard about lies in AI-driven cancer diagnostics. Studies show that trained AI models can be significantly more accurate than doctors at identifying cancerous cells, as AI can analyze vast datasets that no human could process manually. This is poised to reshape fluidic workflows, particularly in histology and pathology applications.

For example, traditional cell and slide staining—a process that relies on precise fluidic dispensing—may undergo a major transformation with the rise of digital staining. We've had fascinating discussions with OEMs who believe the future may not require physical stains at all. Instead, AI could analyze biopsy images digitally, removing the need for certain fluidic applications.

In one way, this is disruptive, as it could impact existing business models. But in another, it's an opportunity for forced growth. Fluidics will still play a role in upstream processes like sample preparation, cell isolation, and reagent management. The challenge—and the opportunity—is to evolve alongside AI-driven automation, ensuring that fluidics remains an essential part of next-generation diagnostics.

As AI reshapes laboratory automation, Fluid Metering is actively exploring how to adapt and innovate, ensuring that fluidics remains at the core of advanced medical and biotech applications.

One of our largest OEM customers was designing a next-generation immunoassay instrument but struggled to find a fluidic solution that could precisely and accurately dispense their new assays. Their biggest challenge was that the new assays required much smaller dispense volumes than they had previously worked with, and they encountered issues with hanging drops and splashing—both of which compromised accuracy and reproducibility.

Fluid Metering worked hand in hand with their engineering team to integrate the Fenyx pump into their new design. The Fenyx pump provided the flexibility to vary dispense volumes between 4 and 9µL, while also enabling non-contact dispensing without any splashing. This not only eliminated their dispensing inconsistencies but also ensured that their assays remained highly reproducible and efficient.

This collaboration showcased how early partnership and precision-engineered fluidic solutions can help OEMs overcome critical dispensing challenges and bring innovative diagnostics to market.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Even where abortion is still legal, many brick-and-mortar clinics are closing","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250516/Even-where-abortion-is-still-legal-many-brick-and-mortar-clinics-are-closing.aspx","Fri, 16 May 2025 11:19:00 GMT","

On the last day of patient care at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Marquette, Michigan, a port town on the shore of Lake Superior, dozens of people crowded into the parking lot and alley, holding pink homemade signs that read ""Thank You!"" and ""Forever Grateful.""

""Oh my god,"" physician assistant Anna Rink gasped, as she and three other Planned Parenthood employees finally walked outside. The crowd whooped and cheered. Then Rink addressed the gathering.

""Thank you for trusting us with your care,"" Rink called out, her voice quavering. ""And I'm not stopping here. I'm only going to make it better. I promise. I'm going to find a way.""

""We're not done!"" someone called out. ""We're not giving up!""

But Planned Parenthood of Michigan is giving up on four of its health centers in the state, citing financial challenges. That includes Marquette, the only clinic that provided abortion in the vast, sparsely populated Upper Peninsula. For the roughly 1,100 patients who visit the clinic each year for anything from cancer screenings to contraceptive implants, the next-closest Planned Parenthood will now be a nearly five-hour drive south.

It's part of a growing trend: At least 17 clinics closed last year in states where abortion remains legal, and another 17 have closed in just the first five months of this year, according to data gathered by ineedana.com. That includes states that have become abortion destinations, like Illinois, and those where voters have enshrined broad reproductive rights into the state constitution, like Michigan.

Experts say the closures indicate that financial and operational challenges, rather than future legal bans, may be the biggest threats to abortion access in states whose laws still protect it.

""These states that we have touted as being really the best kind of versions of our vision for reproductive justice, they too struggle with problems,"" said Erin Grant, a co-executive director of the Abortion Care Network, a national membership organization for independent clinics.

""It's gotten more expensive to provide care, it's gotten more dangerous to provide care, and it's just gotten, frankly, harder to provide care, when you're expected to be in the clinic and then on the statehouse steps, and also speaking to your representatives and trying to find somebody who will fix your roof or paint your walls who's not going to insert their opinion about health care rights.""

But some abortion rights supporters question whether leaders are prioritizing patient care for the most vulnerable populations. Planned Parenthood of Michigan isn't cutting executive pay, even as it reduces staff by 10% and shuts down brick-and-mortar clinics in areas already facing health care shortages.

""I wish I had been in the room so I could have fought for us, and I could have fought for our community,"" said Viktoria Koskenoja, an emergency medicine physician in the Upper Peninsula, who previously worked for Planned Parenthood in Marquette. ""I just have to hope that they did the math of trying to hurt as few people as possible, and that's how they made their decision. And we just weren't part of the group that was going to be saved.""

If a clinic could survive the fall of Roe v. Wade, ""you would think that resilience could carry you forward,"" said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation.

But clinic operators say they face new financial strain, including rising costs, limited reimbursement rates, and growing demand for telehealth services. They're also bracing for the Trump administration to again exclude them from Title X, the federal funding for low- and no-cost family planning services, as the previous Trump administration did in 2019.

PPMI says the cuts are painful but necessary for the organization's long-term sustainability. The clinics being closed are ""our smallest health centers,"" said Sarah Wallett, PPMI's chief medical operating officer. And while the thousands of patients those clinics served each year are important, she said, the clinics' small size made them ""the most difficult to operate."" The clinics being closed offered medication abortion, which is available in Michigan up until 11 weeks of pregnancy, but not procedural abortion.

Planned Parenthood of Illinois (a state that's become a post-Roe v. Wade abortion destination) shuttered four clinics in March, pointing to a ""financial shortfall."" Planned Parenthood of Greater New York is now selling its only Manhattan clinic, after closing four clinics last summer due to ""compounding financial and political challenges."" And Planned Parenthood Association of Utah, where courts have blocked a near-total abortion ban and abortion is currently legal until 18 weeks of pregnancy, announced it closed two centers as of May 2.

Earlier this spring, the Trump administration began temporarily freezing funds to many clinics, including all Title X providers in California, Hawaii, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, and Utah, according to a KFF analysis.

While the current Title X freeze doesn't yet include Planned Parenthood of Michigan, PPMI's chief advocacy officer, Ashlea Phenicie, said it would amount to a loss of about $5.4 million annually, or 16% of its budget.

But Planned Parenthood of Michigan didn't close clinics the last time the Trump administration froze its Title X funding. Its leader said that's because the funding was stopped for only about two years, from 2019 until 2021, when the Biden administration restored it. ""Now we're faced with a longer period of time that we will be forced out of Title X, as opposed to the first administration,"" said PPMI president and CEO Paula Thornton Greear.

And at the same time, the rise of telehealth abortion has put ""new pressures in the older-school brick-and-mortar facilities,"" said Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor who maps brick-and-mortar clinics across the U.S. that provide abortion.

Until a few years ago, doctors could prescribe abortion pills only in person. Those restrictions were lifted during the covid-19 pandemic, but it was the Dobbs decision in 2022 that really ""accelerated expansions in telehealth,"" Myers said, ""because it drew all this attention to models of providing abortion services.""

Suddenly, new online providers entered the field, advertising virtual consultations and pills shipped directly to your home. And plenty of patients who still have access to a brick-and-mortar clinic prefer that option. ""Put more simply, it's gotta change their business model,"" she said.

Historically, about 28% of PPMI's patients receive Medicaid benefits, according to Phenicie. And, like many states, Michigan's Medicaid program doesn't cover abortion, leaving those patients to either pay out-of-pocket or rely on help from abortion funds, several of which have also been struggling financially.

""When patients can't afford care, that means that they might not be showing up to clinics,"" said Fonteno of the National Abortion Federation, which had to cut its monthly budget nearly in half last year, from covering up to 50% of an eligible patient's costs to 30%. ""So seeing a sort of decline in patient volume, and then associated revenue, is definitely something that we've seen.""

Meanwhile, more clinics and abortion funds say patients have delayed care because of those rising costs. According to a small November-December 2024 survey of providers and funds conducted by ineedana.com, ""85% of clinics reported seeing an increase of clients delaying care due to lack of funding."" One abortion fund said the number of patients who had to delay care until their second trimester had ""grown by over 60%.""

Even when non-abortion services like birth control and cervical cancer screenings are covered by insurance, clinics aren't always reimbursed for the full cost, Thornton Greear said.

""The reality is that insurance reimbursement rates across the board are low,"" she said. ""It's been that way for a while. When you start looking at the costs to run a health care organization, from supply costs, etc., when you layer on these funding impacts, it creates a chasm that's impossible to fill.""

Yet, unlike some independent clinics that have had to close, Planned Parenthood's national federation brings in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, the majority of which is spent on policy and legal efforts rather than state-level medical services. The organization and some of its state affiliates have also battled allegations of mismanagement, as well as complaints about staffing and patient care problems. Planned Parenthood of Michigan staffers in five clinics unionized last year, with some citing management problems and workplace and patient care conditions.

Asked whether Planned Parenthood's national funding structure needs to change, PPMI CEO Thornton Greear said: ""I think that it needs to be looked at, and what they're able to do. And I know that that is actively happening.""

When the Marquette clinic's closure was announced, dozens of patients voiced their concerns in Google reviews, with several saying the clinic had ""saved my life,"" and describing how they'd been helped after an assault, or been able to get low-cost care when they couldn't afford other options.

Planned Parenthood of Michigan responded to most comments with the same statement and pointed patients to telehealth in the clinic's absence:

""Please know that closing health centers wasn't a choice that was made lightly, but one forced upon us by the escalating attacks against sexual and reproductive health providers like Planned Parenthood. We are doing everything we can to protect as much access to care as possible. We know you're sad and angry — we are, too.

""We know that telehealth cannot bridge every gap; however, the majority of the services PPMI provides will remain available via the Virtual Health Center and PP Direct, including medication abortion, birth control, HIV services, UTI treatment, emergency contraception, gender-affirming care, and yeast infection treatment. Learn more at ppmi.org/telehealth.""

PPMI's virtual health center is already its most popular clinic, according to the organization, serving more than 10,000 patients a year. And PPMI plans to expand virtual appointments by 40%, including weekend and evening hours.

""For some rural communities, having access to telehealth has made significant changes in their health,"" said Wallett, PPMI's chief medical operating officer. ""In telehealth, I can have an appointment in my car during lunch. I don't have to take extra time off. I don't have to drive there. I don't have to find child care.""

Yet even as the number of clinics has dropped nationally, about 80% of clinician-provided abortions are still done by brick-and-mortar clinics, according to the most recent #WeCount report, which looked at 2024 data from April to June.

And Hannah Harriman, a Marquette County Health Department nurse who previously spent 12 years working for Planned Parenthood of Marquette, is skeptical of any suggestion that telehealth can replace a rural brick-and-mortar clinic. ""I say that those people have never spent any time in the U.P.,"" she said, referring to the Upper Peninsula.

Some areas are ""dark zones"" for cell coverage, she said. And some residents ""have to drive to McDonald's to use their Wi-Fi. There are places here that don't even have internet coverage. I mean, you can't get it.""

Telehealth has its advantages, said Koskenoja, the emergency medicine physician who previously worked for Planned Parenthood in Marquette, ""but for a lot of health problems, it's just not a safe or realistic way to take care of people.""

She recently had a patient in the emergency room who was having a complication from a gynecological surgery. ""She needed to see a gynecologist, and I called the local OB office,"" Koskenoja said. ""They told me they have 30 or 40 new referrals a month,"" and simply don't have enough clinicians to see all those patients. ""So adding in the burden of all the patients that were being seen at Planned Parenthood is going to be impossible.""

Koskenoja, Harriman, and other local health care providers have been strategizing privately to figure out what to do next to help people access everything from Pap smears to IUDs. The local health department can provide Title X family planning services 1½ days a week, but that won't be enough, Harriman said. And there are a few private ""providers in town that offer medication abortion to their patients only — very, very quietly,"" she said. But that won't help patients who don't have good insurance or are stuck on waitlists.

""It's going to be a patchwork of trying to fill in those gaps,"" Koskenoja said. ""But we lost a very functional system for delivering this care to patients. And now, we're just having to make it up as we go.""

New research reveals takotsubo cardiomyopathy remains a major cause of in-hospital deaths and complications, with men facing more than twice the risk and outcomes worsening during the COVID-19 era.



Study: High Mortality and Complications in Patients Admitted With Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy With More Than Double Mortality in Men Without Improvement in Outcome Over the Years. Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, researchers assessed the incidence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) and related complications in the United States (US). TC is a reversible left ventricular dysfunction triggered by physical stress, mainly in males, or emotional stress, primarily in females. TC shows racial and sex disparities, and it continues to remain a significant cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Despite being traditionally viewed as a transient condition, the study underscores persistent risks of severe complications and mortality.

In the present study, researchers examined the incidence of TC and related complications in the US. They used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, which includes weighted and unweighted data for about 35 million and seven million hospitalizations, respectively. TC cases were identified using the ICD-10 code I51.81. However, the study relied on ICD-10 codes, which may be subject to coding errors and did not differentiate between TC subtypes (e.g., reverse-type TC). TC patients aged at least 18 years between 2016 and 2020 in the NIS database were included.

The primary outcomes were cardiogenic shock, myocardial rupture, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, stroke, and cardiac arrest. Patient and hospital demographic data included age, ethnicity or race, sex, median household income, hospital bed size, hospital region, mean length of hospital stay, hospital teaching status, mean total charges, expected primary payer, and control of hospital.

Proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for categorical variables, and odds ratios and 95% CIs were estimated for continuous variables. Five-year outcome data were evaluated. A chi-squared analysis was performed to assess categorical outcomes. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate the association between length of hospital stay and independent variables.

Between 2016 and 2020, out of over 148.7 million total weighted population in the NIS database, 199,890 patients were hospitalized with TC. The annual incidence of TC did not exhibit a consistent trend, but increased overall from 39,015 cases in 2016 to 41,290 in 2020. The mean age of TC patients was 67 years. Most patients were female (83%) and White (80%). TC incidence increased in all age groups between 2016 and 2020, but was consistently the highest in those aged over 61. A notable surge occurred in the 46–60 age group compared to younger adults (31–45 years), which researchers attributed to accumulated stressors, under-treated cardiovascular risks, and hormonal changes in middle age.

White individuals had the highest TC incidence rate, followed by Native Americans, whereas Black people had the lowest incidence. Socioeconomic factors varied significantly, such as hospital bed size, primary payer, and median household income. TC patients had larger hospital bed sizes and higher household incomes. Most patients were on Medicare; TC rates were the highest in private non-profit and urban teaching hospitals.

TC patients had a high burden of cardiovascular complications, including atrial fibrillation (20%), CHF (36%), cardiogenic shock (6.6%), stroke (5.3%), and myocardial rupture (0.02%) compared to non-TC patients. TC patients also had a higher mortality (6.58%) than non-TC patients (2.4%), with an odds ratio of 2.86 for mortality. Further, TC patients had higher odds of cardiogenic shock, CHF, cardiac arrest, and myocardial rupture. The 1.5% mortality increase from 2019 to 2020 coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, which prior studies associate with heightened stress-induced cardiac events.

TC patients had a slightly higher odds of atrial fibrillation and were also twice as likely to experience a stroke. Notably, the incidence of some complications increased over the years, while others, such as atrial fibrillation and myocardial rupture, remained stable. For instance, mortality rates increased from 5.6% to 8.3%, stroke incidence increased from 4.9% to 5.9%, and CHF incidence grew from 34.7% to 37.6%, among others.

While mortality based on sex was stable over time, it was double in males (11.2%) compared to females (5.5%). Researchers emphasized that hormonal differences, particularly lower estrogen levels in men and postmenopausal women, might explain this disparity, as estrogen has shown protective effects in animal models of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. The multivariable analysis found that TC was associated with all-cause death, adjusted for age, ethnicity or race, sex, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, chronic obstructive lung disease, and chronic kidney disease. The median length of hospital stay for TC patients was four days, consistent throughout the study period.

Multivariable linear regression showed that large hospital bed size, Native American race, Medicaid insurance, Black race, and Asian race were associated with longer hospital stays. Conversely, female sex, older age, private insurance, treatment in the South, West, or Midwest regions, and private non-profit hospital ownership were associated with shorter hospital stays.

Taken together, the data indicate that individuals with TC are at a significantly elevated risk of various cardiovascular complications. Males have higher mortality than females. Notably, no improvements were observed in complications throughout the study years. The study's limitations include reliance on administrative coding (which may overlook TC subtypes) and potential duplicate entries from hospital transfers or readmissions. Further research on improving and managing care is required to augment outcomes for these patients.

Treating migraine before the pain starts: New research shows ubrogepant eases premonitory symptoms, offering hope for millions seeking earlier and more effective relief.

Study: Ubrogepant for the treatment of migraine prodromal symptoms: an exploratory analysis from the randomized phase 3 PRODROME trial. Image Credit: GoodStudio / Shutterstock

The most recent exploratory analysis from the phase 3 PRODROME trial reveals that ubrogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, administered at the initial phase of a migraine attack, may ameliorate common premonitory symptoms, including fatigue, light and sound sensitivity, neck pain, and dizziness. A detailed report is published in the journal Nature Medicine.

Nearly one-third of participants who recognized prodromal symptoms reported moderate-to-severe functional disability due to symptoms like cognitive impairment or fatigue, underscoring the need for early intervention.

Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of moderate-to-severe headache and other symptoms of brain dysfunction. Migraine has four distinct, but often overlapping, phases including premonitory (prodrome), aura, headache, and postdrome phases.

Premonitory phase symptoms are broadly categorized into three groups: cognitive impairment, characterized by difficulty concentrating or thinking and fatigue; homeostatic dysfunction, characterized by food cravings; and headache phase-associated symptoms, including light and sound sensitivity.

Premonitory symptoms are highly predictive of approaching headache and are associated with the activation of the brain's hypothalamus region. These findings, along with others discussed in the paper, lend support to the understanding of migraine attacks potentially originating in the central nervous system. The identification of the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide as a causative neurotransmitter associated with migraine attacks has offered the possibility of exploring migraine pathophysiology. Small-molecule inhibitors of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor have shown promising outcomes in preventing migraine attacks.

The PRODROME phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was designed to explore the efficacy of ubrogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, in preventing the development of headache and resolving premonitory phase symptoms. This article focuses on an exploratory analysis of its effects on premonitory symptoms.

Brain imaging studies cited in the trial suggest prodromal symptom relief by ubrogepant may link to central nervous system effects, with hypothalamic activation patterns observed during migraine premonitory phases.

The trial recruited migraine patients who could reliably identify migraine attacks with premonitory phase symptoms that were reliably followed by headache within 1–6 hours at least 75% of the time. Qualifying prodromal events were defined by the presence of premonitory phase symptoms that the participant was confident would be followed by a headache within 1–6 hours.

The participants were randomly assigned to two groups. In one group, participants received a placebo drug to treat the first qualifying premonitory event and ubrogepant 100 mg to treat the second qualifying event. In another group, participants received ubrogepant 100 mg to treat the first qualifying premonitory event and the placebo drug to treat the second qualifying event. The two treatments were separated by at least a 7-day washout period.

The trial included 480 participants for safety analysis and 477 participants for efficacy analysis. The safety population had a mean age of 42.3 years and was predominantly female (87.7%) and White (88.1%), which may be a consideration for generalizability. The most common premonitory symptoms identified at baseline before treatment were light and sound sensitivity, fatigue, neck pain, and dizziness.

Both drugs (ubrogepant and placebo) were administered at the premonitory phase of migraine, and the outcomes were recorded over a period of 48 hours.

Cognitive symptoms like “brain fog” resolved faster with ubrogepant: difficulty thinking improved within 6 hours, while concentration issues showed improvement as early as 1 hour post-dose.

The exploratory efficacy analysis, for which the paper provides precise percentages, odds ratios, and confidence intervals, revealed an absence of light sensitivity in approximately 19% and 12% of ubrogepant- and placebo-treated events, respectively, at 2-hour post-treatment; an absence of fatigue in approximately 27% and 16% and an absence of neck pain in approximately 28% and 15% of ubrogepant- and placebo-treated events, respectively, at 3-hour post-treatment; an absence of sound sensitivity in approximately 50% and 35% of respective events at 4-hour post-treatment; and an absence of dizziness in approximately 88% and 82% of respective events at 24-hour post-treatment.

Among cognitive impairment symptoms, difficulty concentrating resolved in approximately 8% and 2% of ubrogepant and placebo-treated events, respectively, at 1 hour post-treatment, and difficulty thinking resolved in approximately 56% and 41% of respective events at 6 hours post-treatment. Additionally, the use of rescue medication within 24 hours post-dose was lower for ubrogepant-treated events (21.7%) compared with placebo-treated events (39.4%).

Treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were identified in 9% of placebo-treated events and 13% of ubrogepant-treated events. Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of perceived relation to treatment, were reported for 12% of placebo-treated events and 17% of ubrogepant-treated events. The most common adverse events (≥2%) after placebo and ubrogepant administration were nausea, fatigue, dizziness, and somnolence (drowsiness). None of these events were serious or led to study discontinuation.

The trial suggests that ubrogepant may be a therapeutic drug that can help resolve disabling symptoms that appear in the premonitory phase of migraine. When administered in this phase, ubrogepant may improve common premonitory symptoms, with improvements possibly starting as early as one hour after treatment.

Premonitory phase symptoms are highly predictive of impending headache. Existing evidence indicates that a considerable proportion of migraine patients can recognize these symptoms on the day before their headache. Therefore, treatments aiming at resolving these symptoms have high potential to prevent the onset of headache.

The study censored data from participants who used rescue medication, ensuring results weren't skewed by pain-relief drugs—a rigor that reinforced the validity of symptom resolution findings.

As mentioned by researchers, greater awareness of the clinical symptomatology of the premonitory phase, as well as the availability of effective treatment, offers a major opportunity to improve the treatment of acute migraine. The paper also emphasizes that reversing these symptoms with a CGRP receptor antagonist like ubrogepant underscores the importance of the brain in migraine pathophysiology and suggests that targeting central nervous system mechanisms could be a fruitful avenue for new therapeutics.

The primary objective of the PRODROME trial was to evaluate the efficacy of ubrogepant in preventing the onset of headache following administration during the premonitory phase of a migraine attack. The evaluation of the efficacy of ubrogepant in resolving premonitory symptoms was an exploratory analysis of additional endpoints, as detailed in this Nature Medicine paper. The authors note these analyses were not controlled for multiple comparisons, highlighting the need for additional studies specifically designed to evaluate the effect of acute treatment on premonitory symptoms.

Furthermore, the trial participants were instructed to consume ubrogepant when they recognized premonitory symptoms and felt confident that a headache would follow within 1–6 hours. However, the trial did not analyze the differences in symptom resolution between participants who developed and did not develop headaches. These parameters should be considered in future studies.

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have upended decades-old dogma of how connections between brain cells are rearranged during states of heightened vigilance or attention. The team found that a brain chemical associated with alertness, attention and learning alters brain connectivity and function not by acting directly on neurons, the cells known for their quick transmission of information, but through the work of astrocytes, another, slower-acting type of brain cell that is often overlooked in the field of neuroscience. 

The discovery, published in Science May 15, fundamentally changes current understanding about the determinants of brain network communication and activity. It also calls for greater focus on astrocytes as therapeutic targets in the treatment of attention, memory and emotional disorders. 

Textbooks tell us that neuromodulators like norepinephrine fine-tune neurons directly - in fact, textbooks tell us that everything in the brain is about neurons. It seems that a lot of brain wiring and activity is probably orchestrated by astrocytes, on slower timescales. This is the type of discovery that profoundly reshapes our understanding of how the brain works."" 

Thomas Papouin, PhD, assistant professor of neuroscience at WashU Medicine and senior author of the study

For the brain to dedicate itself to tasks that need attention, or to respond to unexpected stimuli like a fire alarm, it needs to be able to rewire itself by changing how brain cells communicate. This process is driven by the release of chemicals known as neuromodulators, including norepinephrine, in the brain. How these neuromodulators reorganize communication in the brain is poorly understood. The assumption for the past 80 years has been that neuromodulator chemicals act on neurons. 

Meanwhile, for at least 30 years astrocytes have been shown to contact and interact with synapses, which are the specialized structures where neurons communicate with one another. Researchers have long suspected that astrocytes had the potential to rearrange communication between neurons and, therefore, the flow of information in the brain. 

Because of their very fine and sprawling shape, these cells are ideally positioned to monitor and detect neuromodulators like norepinephrine. ""We wanted to test the idea that perhaps neuromodulation of synapses by norepinephrine is an astrocyte business,"" Papouin said.

To do so, Papouin and his team stimulated norepinephrine secretion from mouse brain cells or exposed mouse brain slices to norepinephrine and found that norepinephrine weakened connections between neurons, as known for decades. However, researchers found that norepinephrine also triggered activity among surrounding astrocytes. Once triggered by norepinephrine, astrocytes produced a second chemical that they released onto synapses, which caused the dampening of synapse activity. Even when neurons' ability to directly sense norepinephrine was removed, norepinephrine was still able to rearrange neuronal connections. When astrocytes' ability to sense or respond to norepinephrine were taken offline, on the other hand, norepinephrine was unable to reorganize neuronal connectivity. 

Their findings indicate that neuromodulators such as norepinephrine rearrange neuronal connections in the brain by signaling through astrocytes rather than directly onto neurons.

The results also suggest that targeting astrocytes could be an effective way to reshape brain activity to potentially treat brain disorders. Papouin's team has started looking at existing drugs that are believed to act on neurons, to see if they require astrocytes to be effective. If so, perhaps astrocytes could be targeted directly for therapeutic purposes.

""There are so many drugs out there that interfere with norepinephrine signaling in the brain, in particular in the treatment of ADHD or depression. I wonder how many of them require astrocytes to modify brain activity,"" said Papouin.

Scientists have identified mutated immune cell clones that could point to improved treatment for refractory celiac disease.

Researchers at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research and UNSW Sydney have discovered why some people with celiac disease continue to suffer debilitating symptoms despite strictly avoiding gluten.

The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, used cutting-edge single-cell sequencing techniques to reveal that certain immune cells in the gut of these patients carry genetic mutations. The team's findings suggest these abnormal immune cells are driving ongoing intestinal inflammation that causes symptoms like diarrhoea, pain and malnutrition – pointing to a new way to diagnose and potentially treat the most severe form of celiac disease.

For decades, doctors have struggled to understand why a small proportion of celiac patients do not improve on a strict gluten-free diet. Our research suggests that, in some cases, the disease may be fuelled by immune cells that have acquired genetic mutations – something we've never been able to see before.""

Professor Chris Goodnow, senior author of the study and Head of the Immunogenomics Lab at Garvan

celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune condition where the body mistakenly attacks the small intestine in response to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. While most people with the condition experience relief when they remove gluten from their diet, around 1% develop refractory celiac disease, which is where symptoms persist despite strict dietary control.

Refractory celiac disease is classified into two types. Type 2 is caused by abnormal immune cells that can rapidly develop into an aggressive lymphoma, but the cause of type 1 has remained a mystery – until now.

""This is the first time we've been able to pinpoint a molecular signature for type 1 refractory celiac disease,"" says Dr Manu Singh, first author of the study and Senior Research Officer at Garvan. ""We discovered that some patients with refractory disease have an accumulation of immune cells with genetic mutations, which may develop during periods of chronic inflammation, such as earlier gluten exposure. What's interesting is that these mutations share similarities with those we see in certain lymphomas – appearing to give the cells a growth and survival advantage. This is a potential explanation for why they persist even after a patient eliminates gluten from their diet.""

The researchers found that these mutated – or 'rogue' – immune cells were present in seven out of 10 patients with type 1 refractory celiac disease. This discovery could lead to new ways to identify at-risk patients earlier and more targeted treatments.

Currently, the only treatment for refractory celiac disease is broad immunosuppression, which dampens the immune system but does not specifically target the mutated cells. The researchers say their findings open the door to more precise therapies.

""If we can confirm that these mutated immune cells are driving the disease, then we may be able to target them with existing drugs,"" says Professor Fabio Luciani, co-senior author of the study, Visiting Scientist at Garvan and Professor in Systems Immunology at UNSW Sydney. ""For example, we found that many of these aberrant cells have mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway, which is already targeted by approved drugs known as JAK inhibitors. With more investigation, this could lead to a personalised medicine approach where we treat patients based on their specific immune cell mutations.""

""Understanding these mutated immune cells gives us a new way to think about why some patients don't recover on a gluten-free diet, and could help us identify which patients might benefit from different treatment approaches,"" adds Associate Professor Jason Tye-Din, a celiac disease specialist at WEHI who collaborated on the study.

""The findings highlight the power of advanced genetic technologies in understanding autoimmune diseases. Until recently, these abnormal immune cells were undetectable using traditional methods, but new single-cell sequencing techniques have made it possible to analyse thousands of individual cells from intestinal biopsies,"" says Dr Singh.

""This research is a great example of how new genomic technologies can uncover hidden disease mechanisms. By applying these state-of-the-art tools to celiac disease, we are beginning to solve long-standing medical puzzles and move towards more precise treatments,"" says Professor Goodnow.

How much do your genes and upbringing determine your success? A landmark Norwegian study untangles the complex interplay between genetics, family, and social policies in shaping who thrives.

Study: The genetic and environmental composition of socioeconomic status in Norway. Image Credit: WinWin artlab / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers examined the environmental and genetic contributions to four key indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) in Norway, namely wealth, income, occupational prestige, and educational attainment. Their findings indicate that genetic variation consistently explained more of the differences in educational attainment and occupational prestige, with education generally showing the highest genetic influence.

Family-shared environmental factors, on the other hand, contributed more to variations in educational attainment and wealth. The study notes that its estimates might be most applicable to a middle-class to upper-middle-class Norwegian population due to sample characteristics. The authors also note that their findings may not be generalizable to more socioeconomically diverse or non-European populations.

SES is closely linked to important life outcomes, including subjective well-being, mortality, and health. Therefore, understanding the genetic and environmental underpinnings of SES is a major research focus. However, SES is a broad and inconsistently measured construct, with one review identifying 149 unique indicators.

Researchers typically focus on a common core of four key SES indicators: wealth, income, occupational prestige, and educational attainment. Despite their frequent use, systematic comparisons of their genetic and environmental foundations remain limited. Heritability, defined as the percentage of trait variation due to genetic factors, can be estimated using family- or genotype-based methods.

However, these methods often produce diverging estimates, with family-based studies generally showing higher heritability. Variability across populations, age groups, and measurement methods further complicates these differences. Many studies also rely on self-reported SES data, which can introduce significant biases. There is also a notable gap in studies focusing on wealth, despite its centrality and unequal distribution, even in egalitarian societies.

This study used registry-based, objective data from a homogeneous Norwegian sample. It utilized multiple heritability methods within a single population to ensure consistency and reduce error, aiming to disentangle and compare the role of environmental and genetic factors in SES indicators.

Data from over 170,000 Norwegian adults between 35 and 45 was drawn from national population registers. The researchers selected this age range to capture stable SES information while ensuring consistency across indicators.

The study minimized measurement error and biases associated with self-reported data by using administrative records for wealth, occupational prestige, income, and educational attainment. For income, wealth, and occupational prestige, indicators were averaged over an 11-year period (from ages 35 to 45), while educational attainment was the highest recorded within this timeframe, allowing for reliable and objective estimates.

To examine the environmental and genetic components of SES, the study applied four heritability estimation methods: two family-based and two genotype-based methods. To ensure comparability, these methods were applied to subsamples drawn from the same underlying population. The researchers also conducted multivariate analyses to evaluate the degree of overlapping environmental and genetic influences across the four SES indicators, using structural equation modeling and dimension-reduction techniques.

Norway was chosen for its extensive welfare systems, which reduce environmental variability and enhance the relative impact of genetic differences. The country's universal education and healthcare access, strong social protections, and high intergenerational mobility create a context where SES differences are less affected by economic barriers.

Key research questions focused on estimating the relative contributions of genetic, non-shared, and shared environmental factors, the variance across methods, and the overlap in influences among the four SES indicators.

This study used four heritability estimation methods to assess the contributions of environment and genetics to education, occupation, wealth, and income. Researchers found statistically significant heritability estimates across all methods and indicators, with education showing the highest genetic influence.

Wealth heritability was similar to income in family-based estimates (25% vs. 30%) but higher than income in genotype-based estimates (12% vs. 6.5%). Estimates varied with assumptions about shared environmental correlations, especially among cousins.

Shared environmental effects were substantial for education and wealth but sensitive to modeling choices. Genetic correlations among the four indicators ranged from moderate to high (0.35–0.96), suggesting both shared and distinct genetic influences.

Principal component analyses revealed a unidimensional structure for genetic and shared environmental components, but a more complex pattern for non-shared environments. Specifically, individual environments linked longer education with lower income.

The findings indicate large family-shared contributions to SES but also highlight the influence of individual-specific environmental factors, with varying degrees of overlap across the four socioeconomic indicators. The authors also note that genotype-based heritability estimates may be inflated by population stratification and indirect genetic effects, which are particularly relevant when interpreting population-level results.

This study provides comprehensive heritability estimates for key SES indicators in Norway using robust registry data and diverse methods. Education showed the highest contributions from genetics, consistent with findings from the United Kingdom.

Shared environments significantly influenced education and wealth, especially when cousin correlations were modeled realistically.

The study's strengths include large sample sizes, rigorous comparisons across methods, and novel wealth estimates. However, limitations include reliance on population-level estimates that may be inflated by indirect genetic effects and assumptions about shared environments. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the common approach of using a single composite SES index may fail to capture a substantial proportion of individual-specific environmental effects and that such an index should be used with informed deliberation.

Researchers stressed ethical considerations in interpreting their findings, namely that genetic influence does not imply determinism; socioeconomic outcomes are shaped by social contexts and policies. Heritability is not fixed; it is a population statistic that cannot be applied to individuals and varies across contexts.

Overall, the results underscore the complexity of SES development, shaped by genetics, shared family environments, and individual-specific factors. Future research should explore finer-grained indicators and refine methods for modeling environmental effects within extended families.

From ancient Ayurvedic remedy to modern scientific spotlight, tulsi (holy basil) is emerging as a promising botanical for stress, metabolic health, immunity, and beyond—yet experts caution that robust clinical trials are still needed.

For over 3,000 years, tulsi, which is also known as holy basil, has been revered in Ayurveda as a sacred plant and remedy for ailments of the body and mind. Modern pharmacological research is now beginning to validate what ancient medical systems have long claimed about tulsi.

Ocimum sanctum, commonly known as tulsi or holy basil, is an important herb in Ayurveda and other Southeast Asian traditional medicine systems. For several centuries, tulsi has been venerated in many cultures for its spiritual symbolism, in addition to its wide-ranging medicinal properties.1

In recent decades, tulsi has garnered increasing scientific interest, particularly in the context of modern health challenges such as chronic inflammation, metabolic disorders, and psychological stress.1-4 This article critically examines the evidence behind tulsi's health benefits through the lens of modern scientific research, including its adaptogenic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic effects.

Tulsi belongs to the family Lamiaceae and genus Ocimum. The most well-known species used medicinally is Ocimum sanctum, which is also known by the synonymous taxonomic name Ocimum gratissimum.5 The bioactive constituents of O. sanctum include eugenol, ursolic acid, rosmarinic acid, apigenin, and linalool, all of which are compounds known for their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects.2,3

Tulsi is commercially available in multiple forms, including fresh leaves, dried powders, teas, essential oils, and encapsulated extracts. The concentration of active compounds in these preparations varies.

In Ayurveda, tulsi is believed to promote longevity, enhance resilience, and foster systemic balance. Traditionally, tulsi has been used as a household remedy to treat a wide range of ailments, including fever, cough, asthma, bronchitis, malaria, diarrhea, and skin diseases. It is often consumed as a tea, infused into oils, or in herbal powders and pastes.4

Tulsi is also considered an adaptogen that supports the body's ability to acclimate to physical, emotional, and environmental stressors.1 In folk medicine, tulsi has been used to relieve headaches, earaches, and indigestion, whereas its leaves are applied topically for insect bites and skin eruptions.

Tulsi seeds and roots have been used traditionally for their diuretic and detoxifying properties.5 Across Southeast Asia, tulsi remains a staple in ethnomedicine, especially in a cultural context, for its perceived ability to purify the air and protect the household from illness and misfortune.6

Adaptogenic and anti-stress effects

The adaptogenic effects of tulsi are among the most extensively studied. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, supplementation with an O. tenuiflorum extract (OciBest) significantly reduced symptoms of stress, including exhaustion, sleep disturbances, and forgetfulness, over six weeks.7 These effects could be attributed to compounds such as eugenol and ursolic acid present in tulsi, which modulate cortisol levels and neurotransmitter activity.1

Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties

Tulsi's antioxidant properties are attributed to its ability to upregulate enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase while scavenging free radicals.2 In fact, a 2014 study reported that tulsi leaf extracts reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) secretion and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) translocation, both of which are key inflammatory processes, in human monocyte leukemia cell lines.8

Rosmarinic acid, eugenol, and other phenolic compounds have also been shown to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thus suggesting the potential utility of these compounds within tulsi to prevent chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress.4

Metabolic health

Several studies have also reported the effectiveness of tulsi in regulating blood glucose and lipid profiles. In clinical trials, tulsi supplementation has improved fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, and cholesterol levels in diabetic patients.3,6

The underlying mechanisms of these effects include enhancement of insulin secretion and improved lipid metabolism through modulation of key enzymes like 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK).4

Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity

Tulsi exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and fungal species like Candida albicans. Eugenol and carvacrol are known to disrupt microbial cell membranes, while polyphenols interfere with biofilm formation and microbial adhesion.4,5

Immunologically, tulsi has been shown to enhance macrophage activity, natural killer (NK) cell function, and antibody production in preclinical studies. Human trials have also reported improved immune markers, including lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine balance, following tulsi supplementation.6

Cognitive and neurological benefits

Preclinical research has highlighted the neuroprotective properties of tulsi, particularly in models of cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation. The use of tulsi extracts has been shown to improve memory retention, decrease the rate of neurodegeneration, and reduce oxidative stress in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, amnesia, and age-related dementia.3,5

Apigenin and rosmarinic acid in tulsi are also associated with anxiolytic and antidepressant properties through modulation of pathways linked to the neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin.1. These findings suggest the potential applications of tulsi extracts in adjunctive care for mood disorders and cognitive decline.

Other potential benefits

The therapeutic properties of tulsi and its extracts are being explored across the fields of dermatology and hepatic health. The antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of tulsi make it a promising candidate for acne, eczema, and wound healing applications.2

Tulsi has also demonstrated hepatoprotective effects in chemically induced liver damage models by attenuating oxidative damage, enhancing antioxidant defenses, reducing lipid peroxidation, as well as improving liver enzyme profiles and histopathological markers.5

Human trials report minimal side effects associated with tulsi ingestion. However, tulsi may interact with anticoagulants, hypoglycemic agents, and sedatives due to the impact of this plant on metabolic and central nervous system (CNS) pathways.6

A recent animal model study reported lower sperm counts, reduced levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), as well as increased levels of testosterone in male rabbits after supplementation with fresh tulsi leaves.9 Comparatively, other studies have reported no adverse effects of tulsi or its extracts on the reproductive health of male or female murine models.4

The use of tulsi during pregnancy and lactation has not been well studied. Thus, caution should be exercised while using this herb during pregnancy.

Most studies examining the health benefits of tulsi are preclinical or involve small sample sizes. Furthermore, few large-scale, randomized controlled trials with clearly defined endpoints and standardized preparations have been conducted to validate the clinical efficacy of tulsi.

Although tulsi is classified as a dietary supplement in the United States, it is not approved as a drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA).

From managing stress and inflammation to enhancing metabolic and immune health, tulsi shows promise as a complementary strategy in preventive and integrative medicine. Current evidence suggests that consumers and practitioners should use tulsi as a supportive, adjunctive herb, preferably under the guidance of qualified health professionals.

NWSL

Alex Morgan announced this week that she is returning to the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) — just not to the pitch. The former U.S. women's national team captain and two-time World Cup winner joined the owner group behind the San Diego Wave, the club she helped put on the map when it launched in 2022.

For Morgan, it is a full-circle moment.

“San Diego is where I've built my home, where I am raising my children, and found a purpose beyond my playing career,” she said in a statement announcing the investment. “I believed in Wave FC before a single match was played, and I still believe this club has the power to change the future of women's sports.”

Morgan is part of a growing wave of former players investing in the league they helped build, and betting big on a future that is still taking shape.

For the first half-decade of NWSL's existence, U.S. Soccer covered the salaries of U.S. players playing in the league. That agreement ended at the end of 2021 amid ongoing work for equal pay and a new collective bargaining agreement for NWSL players. Even though the league has grown strong enough not to need that support, it's still getting backing from former USWNT players. And the relationship is mutually beneficial.

Take Bay FC, the Silicon Valley-backed expansion team, which joined the NWSL in 2024. Its founding investors include a quartet of former USWNT talent: Aly Wagner, Brandi Chastain, Leslie Osborne and Danielle Slaton, called the “Founding Four” by the club. They built the fandom from the ground up and brought the league's 15th franchise to life by securing a $53 million franchise fee backed by the private equity firm Sixth Street. It marked the firm's largest institutional investment in a women's sports team.

“We wanted to have a stake and a position to help build a club the way that we would have loved to have in our professional lives,” Wagner told The Athletic. “We wanted to be able to shape the future landscape of women's football. Our core principal was how can we make this better for the next generation? But also how can we make that commercially viable so that it becomes a generationally successful club and product?”

That vision wasn't unique to the Founding Four.

In 2022, the league awarded an expansion team in Los Angeles to a majority woman-founded group that included 14 former UWSNT players, including Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy and Abby Wambach. The investor group was led by Academy Award-winning actress Natalie Portman, venture capitalist Kara Nortman, media entrepreneur Julie Uhrman and tech entrepreneur and Serena Williams's husband, Alexis Ohanian.

Most recently, Lauren Holiday, who has remained a powerful presence in the business side of sport, joined the North Carolina Courage's owner group. Together with her husband, NBA star Jrue Holiday, the couple joined the Courage's large investment group that includes tennis stars Naomi Osaka and Ons Jabeur. The move came on the heels of Holiday's new job as a board member of Mercury/13, an investment group dedicated exclusively to women's soccer.



While it may look like former players are investing out of loyalty or symbolism, the numbers suggest it's also a smart business move. NWSL has seen exponential growth in the last two years. A record-breaking broadcast deal, rising attendance, and booming franchise valuations have turned what was once a niche league into one of the most talked-about bets in women's sports. Angel City FC and the San Diego Wave joined the league in 2022, paying modest $2 million expansion fees. In September, Angel City was valued at $250 million by Sportico and San Diego has reached $113 million following its recent sale in March 2024.

“We're in a growth phase,” Wagner says. “That's why you're seeing so much interest in our league—because, compared to other U.S. sports franchises and leagues, we're still relatively affordable. Getting in now could deliver major returns over the next five to ten years. Eventually, we expect to see valuations that mirror the 12x multiples currently happening in the NBA.”

As for the motivation, Wagner adds: “Yes, part of it is improving the ecosystem for women's football. But from a purely investment perspective, it just makes sense. When you look at the top places to put your money in sports, the U.S. is at the top of the list. The major leagues are already mature. This league, on the other hand, is at an inflection point — there's still real upside. So yes, it's about ownership and supporting the game, but there's also a very real expectation of return on capital.”

The upside opportunity is what draws more investors to the league. In January, Denver secured the NWSL's 16th franchise. The group, led by Rob Cohen, paid a cool $110 million. However, it was former NWSL player and current commentator Jordan Angeli who led her hometown's bid for an NWSL franchise starting in 2023, helping secure financing and rally public support for the effort.

 

 

A post shared by Denver NWSL (@denvernwsl)



“We've got this hotbed of women's soccer — it was ripe for the picking,” Angeli said. “I just didn't know who I could go to and say, ‘Look, I can't do this financially on my own. I need your help.' The timing was perfect, not just because it's a smart moment to invest in women's sports, but also because this market has been missing something like this.”

Like Angeli, a growing number of former players are stepping into the league, from front office roles of the league's 16 franchises, to coaching and broadcast positions. For many, like Morgan, investing is just one path to stay in the game. And the next generation isn't waiting. Some current players are already exploring the business side while still on the pitch. No matter how big or small the investment, it shows they have skin in the game.

“A lot of the savvy players that understand this is the time to use their brand because it's not going to be there forever,” Wagner said. “The options are much more superfluous than what was around when we were coming up through the game. And so the ease of access and the optionality of it is allowing for really interesting opportunities for this next generation.”

Serie A

“We didn't find the right solutions,” said Christian Pulisic, ashen-faced and frustrated as he addressed the media to a backdrop of opposition euphoria in Rome.

At Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday night, the United States men's national team star tried to drag his team back into a Coppa Italia final they had trailed to Bologna since Dan Ndoye's 53rd-minute strike.

Pulisic scored and assisted in a vital Serie A win against the same opponents five days earlier, but couldn't find the net when tasked with turning in Luka Jovic's saved shot in the first half.

Later, with the clock ticking, he tried to go it alone, beating three defenders and zipping into the area but Bologna goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski foiled him before he could shoot.

Fourteen minutes later, his race was run, and head coach Sergio Conceicao replaced the American, perhaps with an eye on another key game back at the Olimpico against Roma on Sunday. At full time, the Bologna players, staff and supporters celebrated wildly.

So, no solutions for Milan on the night but a result that could leave one of their best players pondering other ways to solve an issue.

If Milan cannot beat Roma in two days, their chances of salvaging Champions League qualification will be over. Even victories in their final two games would leave Milan needing a staggering concoction of other results to go their way.

Even aside from the Champions League, Milan could miss out on European football altogether, with the Coppa Italia's backdoor to reach the Europa League having closed and a current league position of eighth leaving even the Conference League a long shot.

Should they fail, Pulisic and those around him may ask the question: does he need to be playing at the highest level of club competition going into the World Cup year?

The Champions League is the place all top players want to be. Often, they move teams to get there and speak of those big nights competing against the elite of Europe as the peak of their careers.

Pulisic is no stranger to the biggest stage of all. He played the last 24 minutes of the 2021 final, helping Chelsea to beat Manchester City 1-0. That victory was the highlight of his nine separate seasons in the competition. The last two of those have been with Milan, and this year he scored four goals as his team exited in the revamped league phase.

But if Milan fail to qualify for the 2025-26 edition, he will not be honing his tools alongside the best of Europe. Will that affect his levels going into the World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico?

He will still likely remain a pivotal man for Milan, playing in one of Europe's top leagues (the re-energized Italian top flight is arguably stronger than it has been in a long time, with Milan's rivals Inter reaching the Champions League final and with two games to go are in a thrilling race with Napoli for the scudetto).

Sure, his morale may initially be dented by having to sit on the outside and potentially watch as compatriots Weston McKennie and Tim Weah play Champions League with Juventus (although even that is not certain). But Pulisic is professional and focused enough not to let that limit his motivation in a key year.

There is an argument that the 26-year-old might benefit from fewer minutes heading into 2026, something Mauricio Pochettino may ponder as he decides how much to call upon Pulisic this summer across friendly games and the Concacaf Gold Cup.

All this is assuming Pulisic remains a Milan player. There have been constant rumors the attacker has been close to signing a new contract at San Siro, but a deal has not yet been agreed and there may well be Champions League clubs interested in him this summer after his fine personal form during the team's otherwise tumultuous campaign.

Bids may give him pause for thought, but there could be something to be said for staying put. Top players may want to be in the top competitions, but international managers prioritize consistent minutes for their stars.

Often, the USMNT debate while Pulisic was in and out of the Chelsea team centered on whether he needed to be playing every week, and in a side where he had a responsibility that mirrored his pivotal role with the national team.

He has that at Milan, unchanged across three different managers since he arrived, where he is consistently counted on to deliver. It may not have worked against silverware-starved Bologna on Wednesday, but often he is Milan's game-changer, charged with leading the side as he does his country.

Would he be better moving for the sake of the Champions League, to a club where he might have to start afresh in proving he can be a regular, or risk being considered a squad player? Unlikely.

Pulisic would likely back himself, and his talent, to avoid that fate again but even if the San Siro is not the perfect example of stability, it has represented that to the player who burst onto the scene with Borussia Dortmund before feeling he was underused for some of his time at Stamford Bridge.

Whatever happens over the next two fixtures, and Milan are that unpredictable you could not quite fully rule out a dramatic late surge into fourth, Pulisic will have choices to make going into the summer.

Does he suck it up and hope Milan show the type of ambition in the transfer market that proves they will challenge for the Serie A title, or at least top four, next season?

Or does the lure of Champions League football, going into the biggest year of his professional life, mean he may need to search for pastures new?

Settling on the right solution will be essential for the contentment of the USMNT's best player before 2026.

The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) could be set for one of its most high-profile tests in recent memory: a potential friendly against World Cup champions Argentina, with the match tentatively scheduled for November 2025 in Qatar. The tantalizing prospect of Christian Pulisic squaring off against Lionel Messi, in what would be a symbolic showdown of sports eras and continents, is still unconfirmed—but it has already sent ripples through the American soccer community.

According to Argentine journalist Gaston Edul, “Argentina is planning international friendlies in October and November, and the United States is among the possible opponents for the Albiceleste.“ While US Soccer has not yet confirmed the fixture, the game would fit squarely into a strategic final run of high-intensity matchups in the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which the U.S. is set to co-host alongside Canada and Mexico.

Under Mauricio Pochettino, the USMNT has embarked on a rigorous calendar of friendlies to refine squad chemistry and test tactical flexibility. Having already secured qualification as co-host, the United States is leveraging every international window to prepare for what could be a transformative tournament on home soil.

In September, the Stars and Stripes will face two of Asia's top sides: South Korea on September 6 at Sports Illustrated Stadium in New Jersey, and Japan on September 9 at Lower.com Field in Columbus, Ohio.

“We want to play against the best,” a source close to the federation told ESPN, emphasizing the need for “meaningful challenges in high-pressure environments.“

Japan, ranked No. 14 in the FIFA World Rankings, is currently Asia's top team and has not lost in 12 matches. South Korea, ranked No. 23, is also on the verge of World Cup qualification. These matches offer the U.S. a crucial measuring stick before heading into a potentially historic matchup against Argentina.

The 2022 World Cup winner remains one of the game's most dominant forces under head coach Lionel Scaloni. Whether Messi—now playing in MLS with Inter Miami—would feature in the proposed friendly is unclear. But the symbolic weight of the match, especially being played in Qatar, the site of Argentina's most recent glory, adds gravitas to the potential clash.

The proposed match would fall within the final FIFA international window of the year, running from November 10 to 18. While the U.S. is considering hosting matches in October, they are also reportedly looking at an international tour in November—a detail that aligns with the Qatar fixture.

Christian Pulisic looked on in frustration as another chance to salvage Milan's season slipped away in the Coppa Italia final. But what unfolded in Rome may instead mark the beginning of a new era—one without the man currently on the Rossoneri bench.


 As the red and black of Milan prepares to meet the Rossoblu under Rome's glowing lights, a familiar question lingers in the air: which of their stars will rise when it matters most?


Christian Pulisic could lose a key teammate at AC Milan after reportedly drawing interest from Manchester City.


While fans celebrated in Catalonia and beyond, a subtle ripple of emotion was felt globally — especially when a legendary figure from Barcelona's golden era sent a brief, understated message that carried enormous weight.

LAFC will host LIGA MX powerhouse Club América on Saturday, May 31 at BMO Stadium for a spot in this summer's FIFA Club World Cup.

The winner of the single-game playoff will replace Club León – who were disqualified due to FIFA's multi-club ownership rules – in Group D alongside Chelsea (England), Flamengo (Brazil) and ES Tunis (Tunisia).

Should LAFC prevail, they'll join Seattle Sounders FC (2022 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) and Inter Miami CF (host nation spot) as Major League Soccer's three representatives at the expanded, 32-team tournament that runs from June 14 to July 13 across the United States.

Concacaf teams earn a guaranteed $9.55 million for participating in the Club World Cup and could win up to nearly $100 million as part of the unprecedented $1 billion prize pool.

How they got here: 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup runners-up

Arguably the most successful MLS side of the past half-decade, LAFC won the 2022 MLS Cup-Supporters' Shield double and clinched the 2024 US Open Cup title while reaching six finals under head coach Steve Cherundolo, who recently announced he will depart the club at season's end.

The Black & Gold are led by star forward Denis Bouanga, a two-time MLS Best XI selection (2023, '24) who scored 20 league goals in back-to-back years, winning the MLS Golden Boot presented by Audi and the CCC Golden Boot in 2023.

Additional stars include French national team legends Olivier Giroud and Hugo Lloris, as well as rising Venezuelan winger David Martínez, homegrown forward Nathan Ordaz, and center back Aaron Long.

The most decorated club in Mexican history, Las Águilas have won a record 16 league titles, a record six Copa México crowns and a joint-record seven Campeón de Campeones trophies. They are also the most successful team in Concacaf Champions Cup history, with seven titles.

Coached by André Jardine, América's star-studded roster features goalkeeper Luis Malagón, midfielder Álvaro Fidalgo, winger Alejandro Zendejas and forward Víctor Dávila. Zendejas is a former FC Dallas homegrown who represents the US men's national team.

The CWC is coming, 32 teams and some of the world's biggest superstars, for what could be a seminal moment for the U.S. game

The drama over the Club World Cup started in full back in June 2024. Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti made his thoughts on the competition known.

""FIFA forgets that player and teams will not participate in the new Club World Cup. A single Real Madrid match is worth €20 million and FIFA wants to give us that amount for the entire tournament. Negative. Like us, other clubs will refuse the invitation,"" he told Italian media.

That same day, both he and Madrid walked back the comments. Just kidding, the Club World Cup means a lot.

""Our club will compete, as planned, in this official competition that we face with pride and with the utmost enthusiasm to make our millions of fans around the world dream again with a new title,"" Madrid said in a statement.

And so began the debate over FIFA's revised club tournament, played out in the open. In the 12 months since, further questions have been raised - and FIFA has been relatively adamant it has the answers. Prize money? Lots of it. Tickets? Cheap(ish.) Publicity? Not a problem. Will fans care? Of course.

Some of the biggest names in the game will transplant to the United States next month. The event will be played in 12 stadiums in 11 U.S. cities, from the opener on June 14 until the final on July 13. Real Madrid and Man City are the early favorites, according to the oddsmakers, followed by PSG, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Inter Milan - major European clubs competing in America.

Top level men's soccer hasn't been this accessible in the U.S. since the 1994 World Cup.

More broadly, of course, this feels like a warmup for a far bigger event - the 2026 World Cup, in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The Club World Cup has seemed hastily thrown together in some senses, but also well-executed at others. And although some of the messaging around it has been confusing, and its political implications are concerning, there is no doubt that soccer's governing body intends to make it a hallmark event and proof of concept for soccer in America.

The big question currently unanswered is simple: will it all work?","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Inter Milan will add a total of four or five players to their squad ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup this summer.

This according to today's print edition of Rome-based newspaper Corriere dello Sport, via FCInterNews. They anticipate two or three signings plus a couple of youngsters returning.

Inter Milan play in the Club World Cup this summer.

The Nerazzurri are one of two Serie A clubs along with Juventus in the expanded version of the competition.

And Inter will have the chance to bolster their squad with signings during a special transfer window between the first and tenth of next month.

Inter Milan have already completed one deal ahead of the Club World Cup.

Midfielder Petar Sucic signed his deal in February. He will join the Nerazzurri from Dinamo Zagreb at the start of June, and will therefore be available for the Club World Cup.

Meanwhile, the Corriere report, Inter are also pushing to sign Luis Henrique from Marseille before the Club World Cup kicks off.

Furthermore, the newspaper anticipate, Inter will also sign a defender ahead of the competition.

The top target at the back now looks to be Genoa's Edgar De Winter. However, Bologna duo Sam Beukema and Jhon Lucumi are also on Inter's shortlist.

Apart from signings, though, the Corriere also anticipate a couple players returning to Inter's squad.

Attacking midfielder Valentin Carboni should finally be back after suffering a horror knee injury in the autumn while out on loan with Marseille.

Meanwhile, striker Francesco Pio Esposito will be back from loan with Spezia.

Pio Esposito will be participating in the Under-21 Euros with Italy. However, he could return to the Inter squad during the Club World Cup after the end of the international tournament.

MIAMI — Los Angeles FC will host Mexico's América on May 31 in their Club World Cup qualification playoff, FIFA finalized on Friday.

The winner will get group-stage games against Chelsea in Atlanta on June 16, then Esperance from Tunisia in Nashville, and Flamengo of Brazil in Orlando.

The play-in game is needed to complete the 32-team lineup of the tournament that starts on June 14 because another Mexican club, León, was removed. León broke tournament integrity rules being in the same ownership group as another Club World Cup entry, Pachuca.

FIFA announced the date and venue 10 days after León's appeal against expulsion was lost at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.

LAFC's 22,000-seat home BMO Stadium — next to the LA Memorial Coliseum and shared with Angel City — will stage the game at 7:30 p.m. local time.

That is several hours after the Champions League final in Munich between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. Both have qualified for the Club World Cup.

The Club World Cup entry for LAFC or América is worth an initial $9.55 million payment from FIFA for a CONCACAF region team, plus a share of the $1 billion in total prize money based on results at the month-long tournament. It is being played in 11 U.S. cities.

 FIFA planned the LAFC-América game in March after first ruling to expel León, which qualified by winning the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League.

FIFA said LAFC would be in the playoff because it was the beaten finalist against León, while América was the next best ranked team in its Club World Cup confederation ranking.

It was unclear why América — one of Mexico's best-supported teams — is eligible when FIFA rules cap each country at two entries unless it has more than two winners of a continental championship in the four-year qualifying period through 2024. 

Mexico already has Pachuca and Monterrey in the tournament that has been heavily promoted by FIFA President Gianni Infantino with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Trump has said he will attend the July 13 final at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey to present the gold trophy. It has spent much of the past few weeks in the Oval Office at the White House.

						This Is Anfield
					


LFC VS. PALACE 25.05.2025

CHAMPIONS SOUVENIR PROGRAMME

Liverpool are awaiting an opportunity to sign Florian Wirtz after talks with the Bayer Leverkusen attacking midfielder, and a decision could accelerate rapidly.

Wirtz and his parents flew into the UK earlier this week to meet with the Liverpool officials and discuss a potential move to Anfield.

It comes with the Reds among the clubs hoping to sign Leverkusen's No. 10 this summer, with reports in both England and Germany confirming their intentions.

The Times‘ Paul Joyce has explained that Liverpool will “make a strong pitch” to Wirtz should he “show an inclination to move to the Premier League.”

Liverpool's belief is that the 22-year-old would prefer a switch to Bayern Munich, but Bild‘s Christian Falk claims they are at least ahead of Man City in the running.

Progress could be made in talks over a deal for Wirtz upon the conclusion of the Bundesliga campaign on Saturday, when Leverkusen visit Mainz knowing they are already guaranteed to finish second.

And new comments from Bayern sporting director Max Eberl suggest that they could look to bring the playmaker in before the Club World Cup next month.



“There's a lot of speculation in Munich, and everyone has their own opinion. Of course, that doesn't make things easy,” he told reporters on Friday, as reported by the Liverpool Echo.

“With the Club World Cup, this summer is obviously special. I try to ignore it as much as possible.”

Bayern will face Auckland City, Boca Juniors and Benfica in Group C of the Club World Cup and, as with Real Madrid and Trent Alexander-Arnold, would be eager to involve Wirtz if possible.

That comes with up to £97 million in prize money available for each club competing.

While no guarantee that they will therefore sign the player, the opportunity to do so in a pre-tournament transfer window running from June 1 to 10 could force a decision over his future – be it Bayern, Liverpool or elsewhere.



Speaking to SPORT1, Eberl directly responded to Wirtz's trip to the UK, saying: “What can I say? Florian Wirtz is free to visit Liverpool, Manchester, Madrid, or whatever with his family and friends.”

“For now, he's under contract with Bayer Leverkusen,” he continued.

“We can't let all the speculation – ‘agreement reached', ‘contract signed' – get to us. We're doing our job and perhaps know the facts better than all the speculation going on around us.”

Leverkusen are reported to value Wirtz at €150 million (£126.4m), though interested parties would almost certainly look to negotiate that down.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","The only managers that have won the World Cup & Champions League: Ancelotti next?","https://www.planetfootball.com/lists-and-rankings/managers-won-world-cup-champions-league-carlo-ancelotti-next","Fri, 16 May 2025 10:56:12 GMT","

Carlo Ancelotti can strengthen his claim to be the greatest manager in football history by leading Brazil to World Cup glory next summer.

The Italian coach has practically completed the club game, having won a record five Champions League titles with Real Madrid and AC Milan. He's also the only manager in history to have won titles in each of Europe's five major leagues – the Premier League, Serie A, Ligue 1, Bundesliga and La Liga.

Next up, Ancelotti will attempt to reach the zenith of the international game and end Brazil's 24-year wait to get their hands on the most prestigious trophy in football.

Here are the only two managers who have won both the Champions League (or old European Cup) and the World Cup.

In 1996, Lippi watched on from the Stadio Olimpico touchline as his Juventus side beat Louis van Gaal's Ajax in a penalty shootout.

All four of his players converted their spot-kicks, the Old Lady showing their mettle to make it over the line and get it won – something they've failed to do in five successive final appearances since then.

Ten years later he did the same as the Azzurri took on Les Bleus on the biggest stage of all at Berlin's Olympiastadion. Another 1-1 draw after 120 absorbing minutes and another occasion in which his lieutenants successfully tucked away their pens.

“There's no right or wrong way to start out as a coach, but it is important to have the ability to work with players,” wrote Claudio Ranieri of his old pal Lippi in The Observer ahead of the 2006 World Cup final.

“You need to manage them, in all senses of the word, and to motivate them. But above all you need to know your football, how to read the game and change things during a match.

“Lippi does all this. As well as being superb at communicating with his players, he is a great motivator. He knows he can't be a friend to them, can't be too close, but also that he must not be too distant. He needs to give the right sort of understanding and feeling to his team.”

Remind you of anyone else? Ranieri could just as easily be talking about another of his compatriots, Ancelotti.

Being a brilliant man-manager as well as an adept in-game tactician is a perfect recipe for tournament football.

A defensive midfielder in his playing days, Del Bosque won five league titles and four Copa del Rey with Real Madrid in the 1970s and early 1980s.

He later served as a youth coach, interim and caretaker before finally landing the big gig on a permanent basis in 1999.

The year before, Jupp Heynckes had led the club to their sixth European Cup – and first in 32 years – but left only a few days later after domestic underperformance and a spectacular falling out with the board.

Inheriting a squad of winners, the mild-mannered Del Bosque kept that spirit going by delivering the Champions League trophy in 2000 and 2002, making it three in five years for Los Blancos around the turn of the century.

That pedigree made him the perfect candidate to take on Spain's Euro 2008 champions following the departure of Luis Aragones.

Sure enough, just as he'd done at the highest level of the club game, Del Bosque guided La Roja to World Cup glory in South Africa.

“I told them that this was the game of our lives,” Del Bosque reminisced in an interview with FourFourTwo.

“We were football romantics, and I knew we were going to have the opportunity to experience a beautiful night, unique for many people. I told them that it was not a war, but a sport, and that we could win or lose.”

“We didn't find the right solutions,” said Christian Pulisic, ashen-faced and frustrated as he addressed the media to a backdrop of opposition euphoria in Rome.

At Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday night, the United States men's national team star tried to drag his team back into a Coppa Italia final they had trailed to Bologna since Dan Ndoye's 53rd-minute strike.

Pulisic scored and assisted in a vital Serie A win against the same opponents five days earlier, but couldn't find the net when tasked with turning in Luka Jovic's saved shot in the first half.

Later, with the clock ticking, he tried to go it alone, beating three defenders and zipping into the area but Bologna goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski foiled him before he could shoot.

Fourteen minutes later, his race was run, and head coach Sergio Conceicao replaced the American, perhaps with an eye on another key game back at the Olimpico against Roma on Sunday. At full time, the Bologna players, staff and supporters celebrated wildly.

So, no solutions for Milan on the night but a result that could leave one of their best players pondering other ways to solve an issue.

If Milan cannot beat Roma in two days, their chances of salvaging Champions League qualification will be over. Even victories in their final two games would leave Milan needing a staggering concoction of other results to go their way.

Even aside from the Champions League, Milan could miss out on European football altogether, with the Coppa Italia's backdoor to reach the Europa League having closed and a current league position of eighth leaving even the Conference League a long shot.

Should they fail, Pulisic and those around him may ask the question: does he need to be playing at the highest level of club competition going into the World Cup year?

The Champions League is the place all top players want to be. Often, they move teams to get there and speak of those big nights competing against the elite of Europe as the peak of their careers.

Pulisic is no stranger to the biggest stage of all. He played the last 24 minutes of the 2021 final, helping Chelsea to beat Manchester City 1-0. That victory was the highlight of his nine separate seasons in the competition. The last two of those have been with Milan, and this year he scored four goals as his team exited in the revamped league phase.

But if Milan fail to qualify for the 2025-26 edition, he will not be honing his tools alongside the best of Europe. Will that affect his levels going into the World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico?

He will still likely remain a pivotal man for Milan, playing in one of Europe's top leagues (the re-energized Italian top flight is arguably stronger than it has been in a long time, with Milan's rivals Inter reaching the Champions League final and with two games to go are in a thrilling race with Napoli for the scudetto).

Sure, his morale may initially be dented by having to sit on the outside and potentially watch as compatriots Weston McKennie and Tim Weah play Champions League with Juventus (although even that is not certain). But Pulisic is professional and focused enough not to let that limit his motivation in a key year.

There is an argument that the 26-year-old might benefit from fewer minutes heading into 2026, something Mauricio Pochettino may ponder as he decides how much to call upon Pulisic this summer across friendly games and the Concacaf Gold Cup.

All this is assuming Pulisic remains a Milan player. There have been constant rumors the attacker has been close to signing a new contract at San Siro, but a deal has not yet been agreed and there may well be Champions League clubs interested in him this summer after his fine personal form during the team's otherwise tumultuous campaign.

Bids may give him pause for thought, but there could be something to be said for staying put. Top players may want to be in the top competitions, but international managers prioritize consistent minutes for their stars.

Often, the USMNT debate while Pulisic was in and out of the Chelsea team centered on whether he needed to be playing every week, and in a side where he had a responsibility that mirrored his pivotal role with the national team.

He has that at Milan, unchanged across three different managers since he arrived, where he is consistently counted on to deliver. It may not have worked against silverware-starved Bologna on Wednesday, but often he is Milan's game-changer, charged with leading the side as he does his country.

Would he be better moving for the sake of the Champions League, to a club where he might have to start afresh in proving he can be a regular, or risk being considered a squad player? Unlikely.

Pulisic would likely back himself, and his talent, to avoid that fate again but even if the San Siro is not the perfect example of stability, it has represented that to the player who burst onto the scene with Borussia Dortmund before feeling he was underused for some of his time at Stamford Bridge.

Whatever happens over the next two fixtures, and Milan are that unpredictable you could not quite fully rule out a dramatic late surge into fourth, Pulisic will have choices to make going into the summer.

Does he suck it up and hope Milan show the type of ambition in the transfer market that proves they will challenge for the Serie A title, or at least top four, next season?

Or does the lure of Champions League football, going into the biggest year of his professional life, mean he may need to search for pastures new?

Settling on the right solution will be essential for the contentment of the USMNT's best player before 2026.

Next year, the FIFA World Cup will be held in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, the first time the North American continent will host the world's premier soccer tournament since 1994.

It will also be the first time the tournament is hosted in a nation known for human rights abuses.

In 2018, the tournament was hosted in Russia in the aftermath of a massive scandal that exposed soccer's global governing body as a cesspool of corruption. Russia, of course, is famously known for its lack of corruption, and there is absolutely no history whatsoever of drug cheating in any sport, especially not in sporting events hosted on its soil.

Four years later, the World Cup made its way to Qatar, a beacon of freedom and hope in the Middle East that definitely did not use slave labor or other disturbing and morally horrific practices to build the opulent and glitzy stadiums that welcomed the world's soccer stars in 2022. 

This time, there is an unparalleled moral emergency that calls out for justice as the tournament prepares to come to the shores of the most oppressive nation on Earth: the U.S., led by a maniacal tyrant who hates foreigners, says men cannot be women, and imprisons anyone who dares speak out against him.

Of course, none of this is true. FIFA was ridiculed the world over for holding its 2018 tournament in Russia, a cesspool of corruption on par with the organization that is led by a regime that has a long history of cheating in sports, not to mention imprisoning and disappearing political opponents. Qatar did, in fact, use slave labor imported from poor countries to build the extravagant metropolises that hosted the event that year.

In contrast, the U.S. is led by a democratically elected government that was given a mandate from the people to solve a host of matters plaguing them, including addressing an inhumane immigration policy that has seen millions of people overwhelm cities and infrastructure to the detriment of the citizens who rely on these services.

But, of course, this didn't stop Human Rights Watch, which ostensibly exists as a watchdog to expose human rights abuses, from writing a strongly worded letter to FIFA President Gianni Infantino equating the human rights abuses of Russia and Qatar to the Trump administration's efforts to define biological sex, impose visa restrictions on foreign visitors, slow refugee admission, root out illegal immigration, and deport foreigners who espouse sympathies with terrorist groups such as Hamas.

HOW NIL KILLED MARCH MADNESS

“Since its return to office, the administration of President Donald Trump has implemented or is planning policies that fundamentally undermine the inclusive spirit of the World Cup and the nondiscrimination policies under FIFA's Statutes,” the organization said in its letter, fretting that the administration would block fans, officials, and competitors from certain countries from attending — a farcical proposition.

There is good news and bad news for Human Rights Watch. The good news is that anyone who wants to be a part of the World Cup in 2026 will have the opportunity to do so. The bad news is that it exposed itself as a posse of partisan hacks who carry water for the global leftist elite and will use any excuse to bash the U.S.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","soccer"

The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) could be set for one of its most high-profile tests in recent memory: a potential friendly against World Cup champions Argentina, with the match tentatively scheduled for November 2025 in Qatar. The tantalizing prospect of Christian Pulisic squaring off against Lionel Messi, in what would be a symbolic showdown of sports eras and continents, is still unconfirmed—but it has already sent ripples through the American soccer community.

According to Argentine journalist Gaston Edul, “Argentina is planning international friendlies in October and November, and the United States is among the possible opponents for the Albiceleste.“ While US Soccer has not yet confirmed the fixture, the game would fit squarely into a strategic final run of high-intensity matchups in the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which the U.S. is set to co-host alongside Canada and Mexico.

Under Mauricio Pochettino, the USMNT has embarked on a rigorous calendar of friendlies to refine squad chemistry and test tactical flexibility. Having already secured qualification as co-host, the United States is leveraging every international window to prepare for what could be a transformative tournament on home soil.

In September, the Stars and Stripes will face two of Asia's top sides: South Korea on September 6 at Sports Illustrated Stadium in New Jersey, and Japan on September 9 at Lower.com Field in Columbus, Ohio.

“We want to play against the best,” a source close to the federation told ESPN, emphasizing the need for “meaningful challenges in high-pressure environments.“

Japan, ranked No. 14 in the FIFA World Rankings, is currently Asia's top team and has not lost in 12 matches. South Korea, ranked No. 23, is also on the verge of World Cup qualification. These matches offer the U.S. a crucial measuring stick before heading into a potentially historic matchup against Argentina.

The 2022 World Cup winner remains one of the game's most dominant forces under head coach Lionel Scaloni. Whether Messi—now playing in MLS with Inter Miami—would feature in the proposed friendly is unclear. But the symbolic weight of the match, especially being played in Qatar, the site of Argentina's most recent glory, adds gravitas to the potential clash.

The proposed match would fall within the final FIFA international window of the year, running from November 10 to 18. While the U.S. is considering hosting matches in October, they are also reportedly looking at an international tour in November—a detail that aligns with the Qatar fixture.

The talent acquisition strategies of big and small nations alike has changed markedly in a chaotically deglobalizing world

Consider a World Cup qualifier that took place in late March in Sydney. An Australian team coached by the son of Croatian immigrants, with an attack led by a Scottish-born naturalized Australian and a second generation Sri Lankan Tamil-Australian, faced an Indonesian team in which all but one of the starting XI were born and raised in the Netherlands. Nurtured by the Dutch academy system and performing, in many cases, at a high level in club football throughout Europe and the US, these players qualified for Tim Garuda thanks to ancestral links to Indonesia, a former Dutch colony.

Indonesian footballing authorities have, for the past year or so, pursued an aggressive naturalization policy in a bid to qualify for the 2026 World Cup – a curious reversal of the extraction that the Dutch inflicted on Indonesia, a major source of agricultural and mineral wealth, through the 19th and 20th centuries. This policy of strength through Dutchification wasn't much help on that night against Australia: Indonesia eventually lost 5-1. But the heavy defeat did nothing to dim the spirits of a boisterous majority-Indonesian crowd.

The real fascination of the contest, arguably, was in its contrast of talent acquisition strategies – Australia's driven by immigration and multiculturalism, Indonesia's following the boomerang of colonization. Football's rush into a more globalized future – right when the international direction of geo-economic travel is in the other direction – is creating both opportunities and incongruities. In a chaotically deglobalizing world, soccer might now be globalization's most persuasive argument.

International football has always involved a war for talent at some level; from Giuseppe Rossi to Declan Rice, the agonies of dual nationals choosing one path over another have stirred debate for decades. The old colonial connection works to the advantage of both colonizers and colonized. Portugal, for example, has for many years benefited from its domestic league's status as a draw for Brazilians to naturalize players like Deco and Pepe, while African countries such as Algeria, Morocco, and Senegal have long drawn on the strength of French football, with its significant African diaspora, to make their national teams more competitive. (If the suburbs of Paris competed as a single nation, they'd comfortably be among the best teams in the world.) This two-way traffic extends to the exploitation of multiculturalism as a recruitment lever, in which receiving countries become senders and sending countries re-receive: the Turkish community in Germany delivered Turkey its current national team captain, Hakan Çalhanoğlu, but it's also the cradle from which Die Mannschaft's most enigmatic player this century, Mesut Özil, emerged.

The share of foreign-born players at the World Cup, to take the most obvious index of globalization, has consistently grown over the past three decades. In 1990, just 6.2% of the players at the World Cup were born in a country other than the one they represented, according to an analysis by Vox; by 2022, that share had risen to 16.5%.

Rule changes, perhaps unsurprisingly, have also helped the foreign-born national team player emerge as a central character in world football. After introducing a “clear connection” requirement in 2004 after Qatar tried to fill its national team with uncapped mercenaries who had no connection to the Gulf state, Fifa adjusted the scheme in 2021 so that players with three or fewer caps for a national team before the age of 21 can switch allegiances. This has boosted the mobility of players across borders who might otherwise be “cap-tied” by their appearance in only one or two representative matches while still developing as a player and person.

Though buying a national team outright is still (quite rightly) prohibited, countries are growing more skilled at discovering seams of eligible talent. Agents, whose own financial interests are naturally geared towards giving their clients as much exposure as possible, are becoming more aggressive in their “advertisement” of players to the federations for which they qualify.

The Indonesian strategy is perhaps the most extreme example of what's possible under the current rules. No doubt, there's a real advantage to be gained (in the short-term at least) from being a country in the footballing periphery with a viable connection to a place with a deep pool of talent. Still, the move to go all-in on naturalization has provoked predictable debate in Indonesia and among regional rivals about fairness, the dilution of national identity, and a potential weakening of the domestic league.

For Indonesia, there are at least precedents to guide this great experiment in mass naturalization. Building on the historic migratory links between the two countries, Japan had a measure of success with naturalizing Brazilians like Marcus Tulio Tanaka and Alessandro “Alex” Santos in the 1990s and 2000s, before the J-League and domestic player development became strong enough to reduce the dependence on naturalizations to make the national team competitive. Interestingly, “haafu” or half-Japanese players like Zion Suzuki are now an increasingly important part of the national setup, which perhaps demonstrates the different stages the quest for talent can cycle through.

At the other end of the spectrum is China, which attempted to follow the Japanese model by naturalizing foreign-born players like Elkeson, Fernando, and Nico Yennaris in a failed quest to qualify for the 2022 World Cup; the policy has now largely been abandoned, with China reverting to domestic development. The key to Japan's successful transition from a naturalization-focused national team to one anchored in more “conventional”, homegrown playing strength – a corollary to its emergence into a genuine global power on the field – has been the popularity and growth of the J-League. How far China can progress with a domestic league that has had its ambition and financial power clipped in recent years remains to be seen. The promise of naturalization is just as often false as it is firm.

Being a country that people want to visit can also offer advantages, even if their distribution is unpredictable: US star Yunus Musah, for instance, was brought up and nurtured as a soccer talent largely in the UK but qualifies for the US thanks to him being born in New York while his mother was on vacation. Having all of these advantages at once, of course, gives a country unique recruiting strength, and owing to the growing heft of MLS this is the category to which the US, along with the UK, France, Spain and Portugal, now unequivocally belongs.

Canny exploitation of the eligibility rules might help smaller footballing nations be competitive but in the long run it's the richest and most powerful countries that will probably reap the biggest rewards. The current USMNT is unmistakably a team born of this moment's global tussle for talent: Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun, Cameron Carter-Vickers, and Sergiño Dest are all foreign-born and -raised, while other regular fixtures in the team like Gio Reyna, Tim Weah, and Ricardo Pepi have experienced, to differing degrees, the difficulties involved in choosing a single sporting nationality as a player eligible for multiple teams.

Reyna is, of course, the son of US legend Claudio Reyna, and despite being born in England and nurtured by the German academy structure, the way he tells it there was never any doubt that he would play for the USMNT.

Debates over naturalization and the pitch to dual nationals have waxed and waned over the years, but in the US they were perhaps never stronger than during the reign of Jürgen Klinsmann, a staunch Europeanist famous for his disrespect of MLS. Klinsmann's selections were notable for drawing extensively on the dividend of America's projection of military power – and people – across the globe. US military bases became an unlikely recruiting ground for the US: Jermaine Jones, John Brooks, and Timothy Chandler were all born to US service personnel stationed in Germany and rose through domestic German football but each went on to represent, to varying degrees of distinction, Klinsmann's USMNT.

Though “military brats” have featured less frequently under Gregg Berhalter and Mauricio Pochettino, the unmatched global projection of US military power – especially in Europe – does offer an additional potential selection advantage that no other national team can boast. Birthright citizenship, the constitutional guarantee that gave Musah a US passport, needs no justification, but improved national team depth is perhaps the only good argument for militarism, in any context.

How much longer some of these advantages will exist for is another question. With Donald Trump threatening to pull back the US security umbrella over Europe, his administration actively pursuing an end to birthright citizenship, and federal immigration authorities viciously targeting the Latino community, a traditional source of playing strength for American soccer, the USMNT is facing a future in which the next generation's Musahs and Joneses – and perhaps even Reynas and Pepis and Weahs – simply won't exist. Meanwhile all three branches of the federal government have united in an effort to make this country as xenophobic and inhospitable to foreigners as possible in the runup to next year's World Cup.

A nation that's been a great beneficiary of football's booming cosmopolitanism is now doing its best to strip itself of its own unique advantages, withdrawing into a form of sporting autarky. The US, given all its natural strengths and the sheer variety of unusual recruitment options available to it, should be at the head of the global scramble for soccer talent in the years ahead. Under the country's current misdirection, that seems less and less likely.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Everything you need to know about the gifted, 17-year-old forward who recently signed his first professional contract in the French capital

Whether or not Paris Saint-Germain finally realise their Champions League dream in Munich at the end of the month, it's already clear that coach Luis Enrique is in possession of a squad stacked with talent - particularly in attack.

Indeed, it's hard to think of another team blessed with so many wonderful wingers. With his rolled-down socks and devastating dribbling skills, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is a glorious throwback to a bygone age, Ballon d'Or contender Ousmane Dembele is finally realising his full potential at Parc des Princes after his abysmal spell with Barcelona, while Bradley Barcola and Desire Doue have shown this season why they've long been regarded as potential superstars within French footballing circles.

Ben Shelton has had an up-and-down season on the ATP Tour, as the American continues his pursuit of a third career title. 

The American has struggled to find consistency this year, with several early-round exits, despite making it to the final of the Munich Open recently, where Shelton lost to Zverev.

Shelton made the semi-final of the Australian Open, marking a strong start to the season, but since then hasn't been able to get it going, with a record of ten wins and nine losses since the first major of 2025.

The 22-year-old still has his entire career ahead of him, and former world number one Andre Agassi recently discussed how he can best utilise those future years. 

Speaking on the Tennis Channel Live Podcast, Agassi said: “I love Ben. I have known his Dad for many years and had the chance to meet his Mom, such a wonderful lady, they have done such a wonderful job with him.”

“I love his spirit, I love his athleticism. The guy is a force to be reckoned with. He has one of the liveliest arms you have ever seen.”

“There are a number of ways he can be better, I do believe. He is still really raw. So powerful, he can take the racket out of a lot of people's hands, nobody wants to see him next to their name in the draw.”

“I think he can make life even a little easier for himself, but he is one of those guys who for two weeks can go to heaven and make some great stuff happen in the biggest moments in tennis, I really believe that.”

“I have never seen him in a situation where he feels outmatched. Every time he is out there in the biggest of moments, he looks like he wants that ball on his racket, and that is a great sign too, especially at such a young age.”

Following his Australian Open final-four appearance, Shelton went out in the Round of 16 at both the Dallas Open and the Mexican Open. 

He showed promising signs in the first half of the ‘sunshine double', overcoming Mariano Navone, Karen Khachanov, and Brandon Nakashima to reach the quarter-finals in Indian Wells, but ultimately fell to eventual champion Jack Draper. 

Shelton then lost in the opening round of the Miami Open, as well as the Monte-Carlo Masters before enjoying his best run of the season in Munich.

The last two tournaments of the clay swing haven't gone to plan for the world number 13, having crashed out of the Madrid Open and the Italian Open in the third and second round, respectively. 

Shelton's last title came in April 2024, when he emerged victorious at an ATP 250 event in Houston. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Carlos Alcaraz and Lorenzo Musetti were handed boosts in the ATP Rankings thanks to their performances at the Italian Open while Alexander Zverev's failure to defend his title will have a big impact on his French Open hopes.

Alcaraz's run to the semi-final in Rome helped him to nail down second place in the rankings behind Jannik Sinner and with it he also secured the No 2 seeding for Roland Garros.

The four-time Grand Slam winner will battle Musetti for a place in the final at Foro Italico and a title run could see him close the points deficit to Sinner to just over 1,000 points after it was more than 4,000 at one stage.

But Sinner – playing in his first tournament since his serving his three-month doping ban – could also extend the lead as he will face Tommy Paul in the semi-final.

1. Jannik Sinner – 9,730 points
2. Alexander Zverev – 8,085
3. Carlos Alcaraz – 7,850
4. Taylor Fritz – 4,815
5. Jack Draper – 4,440
6. Novak Djokovic – 4,130
7. Casper Ruud – 3,715
8. Alex de Minaur – 3,635
9. Lorenzo Musetti – 3,550
10. Holger Rune – 3,440

Sinner has once again broken through the 10,000-point barrier in the rankings after demolishing Casper Ruud 6-1, 6-0 in the quarter-final.

With Alcaraz secured of the No 2 seeding for his Roland Garros title defence, it means Zverev will be seeded third and he will meet either Sinner or Zverev in the semi-final in Paris should they all get that far.

Jack Draper had a chance to move to a career-high No 4, but his defeat to Alcaraz in the quarter-final put paid to that quest as he remains at No 5 with Novak Djokovic at No 6 and Casper Ruud at No 7.

Musetti's excellent clay-court season continues with his run to the semi-final of his home event and he is up to No 8 while he could move as high as sixth if he wins the title.

Impressive, considering the Italian started the clay-court season at No 16 in the rankings.

1. Jannik Sinner – 10,130/10,380/10,730
2. Carlos Alcaraz – 8,240/8,500/8,850
3. Alexander Zverev – 7,285
4. Taylor Fritz – 4,625
5. Jack Draper – 4,610
6. Novak Djokovic – 4,080
7. Casper Ruud – 3,905
8. Lorenzo Musetti – 3,860/4,110/4,460
9. Alex de Minaur – 3,635
10. Holger Rune – 3,440

There will be a newcomer to the top 20 when the rankings are updated on Monday as Jakub Mensik will climb two places to a new career-high of No 19. The Czech teenager reached the fourth round in Italy, but his rise was set up by his Miami Open title run.

It does mean Stefanos Tsitsipas is down to No 20 – his lowest position since 2018.

There were no +20 surges in the top 100, but Camilo Ugo Carabelli is up eight spots to a new career-high of No 52 and one spot behind him is Jacob Fearnley after the Brit climbed four spots.

Jaume Munar enjoyed a fine run in Rome as he reached the last 16 as his reward is a 10-place jump to No 56.

Zhizhen Zhang reached the quarter-final of the 2024 Italian Open, but didn't compete this year and he will be hit with a 25-place drop to No 30.

But that is not as bad as Nicolas Jarry as the Chilean finished runner-up to Zverev last year, but lost in the second round this time around. The former world No 16 is projected to fall 96 places to No 149.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Alcaraz fights past Musetti, secures Rome final spot","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-musetti-rome-2025-sf","Fri, 16 May 2025 15:50:19 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz proved his composure and grit once more on Friday at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, where he sealed his spot in the championship match.

The 22-year-old Spaniard earned a statement 6-3, 7-6(4) semi-final triumph over home favourite Lorenzo Musetti amid testing conditions at the ATP Masters 1000. Alcaraz tamed a mid-match rise in form from Musetti, as well as windy conditions and a boisterous Italian crowd to surge into his 25th tour-level final.

“Today was a really difficult day with the conditions, the wind was tough to play with,” said Alcaraz, who is now 26-2 on clay since last May. “It wasn't about playing brilliant, spectacular tennis. It was about playing smart tennis, playing solid, going to the point when you can, and waiting for the chance to play aggressively. I think I did that pretty well, I stayed strong mentally when things didn't go to my side.”

Alcaraz was forced to withdraw from the Masters 1000 in Madrid due to an adductor injury, and he appears to be back near his blistering best in Rome. After recording a Tour-leading 19th win of the season, the 22-year-old will go into Sunday's final having won 14 of his past 15 matches, including a run to the title in Monte-Carlo and the final in Barcelona last month.

With his two-hour, four-minute victory, Alcaraz tied Stefan Edberg for the second-most wins in their first 100 matches at ATP Masters 1000 level (since the series' introduction in 1990). The Spaniard now boasts a 77-23 record at this level, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, including six titles. At just 22 years of age, Alcaraz has now already reached finals at six of the nine ATP Masters 1000 events.

Musetti, competing as the ninth man to reach the last four at all three clay-court Masters 1000 events in one season, was unable to channel the raucous crowd to a memorable comeback. The 23-year-old can, however, reflect on a milestone week in Rome: With wins over former champions Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev, Musetti rose one spot to No. 8 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, securing a new career high on Monday.

“Today was a tough day for me,” said Musetti. “I entered the court with such a great mentality. But then afterwards, after the first point, I started to struggle with keeping that attitude that I showed in the past months, in the past week, that helped me to come back from various situations and from various difficult moments of the last matches.”

After also defeating Musetti in the Monte-Carlo final, Alcaraz now leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 5-1. The Spaniard awaits a championship-match clash with World No. 1 Jannik Sinner or American Tommy Paul.

As it has throughout his campaign in Rome, Alcaraz's level fluctuated during his semi-final clash with Musetti. The third seed, who lost two consecutive games at 4-1 in the opening set, was forced to rally from 2-4 in the second after Musetti rode the backing of the Campo Centrale crowd to lift his level.

Yet Alcaraz responded in a dramatic finish: After rallying to a 6-5 lead, he let slip a match point on return but held firm in a nervy tie-break to advance to the final on his second appearance in the Italian capital.

Despite the up-and-down nature of Friday's encounter, Alcaraz remained composed and used the windy conditions to his advantage. While Musetti struggled to dictate from the baseline, Alcaraz used his forehand to great effect, firing 14 winners from that wing to Musetti's three.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Jamaica's junior tennis sensation makes mark in Europe; set for Roland Garros","https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/2025/05/16/jamaicas-junior-tennis-sensation-makes-mark-europe-set-roland-garros/","Fri, 16 May 2025 05:08:01 GMT","

Jamaica's Alyssa James, 17, the number one ranked junior player in the Caribbean and Central America, is showcasing her talent on the European circuit after being awarded a spot in the International Tennis Federation Grand Slam Player Development Team. She will now face some of the world's best in Europe at the French Open.

Ranked 112 in the world, she has already registered wins this month at tournaments in Italy and just missed out on a quarter-final spot in Santa Croce where she lost a three set thriller to world number 61 Nauhany Vitoria Leme Da Silva 3-6, 6-3, 6-7.

However, her journey will continue as she moves on to Milan next week before competing in Belgium on May 26 and Roland Garros in France on June 1, which she says is a dream come true.

“It's a huge honour as only a handful of junior players from around the world are chosen. To be one of them is truly humbling and satisfying as it shows that my hard work is paying off,” she told the Jamaica Observer.

“Roland Garros is a dream — just setting foot on those courts will be unforgettable and I want to compete, challenge the best, and prove I belong on that stage.”

Clay courts are regarded by many to be the most difficult playing surface in tennis but James says she's well prepared to take on the challenge.

“(It) presents a unique challenge as the court is slower and rallies and matches are longer,” she said. “The clay courts also require a different type of movement when compared to hard courts as you have to slide into many shots. It also requires strategic shot selection as points are won primarily by forcing errors by keeping your opponent off balance.

“My preparation has been intense, and I spent a lot of time playing on the Hartru clay courts in Florida and working on my leg strength and endurance during my fitness sessions.”

James has also invested in mental preparation, which she says is necessary to be successful.

“You can be in top shape, but without mental clarity, it's tough to perform — especially on clay, where matches can last over two or three hours,” she said. “You're constantly analysing your opponent, adjusting your strategy, and staying composed even when things aren't going your way. It's like a mental chess match. I rely on visualisation, breathing exercises, and mental routines to stay focused and grounded. Blocking out distractions and staying present is essential, especially in high-pressure environments.”

Jamaica's number one-ranked James, who moved to an academy based in Florida after attending Hillel Preparatory School, has proven to be one of the brighter prospects in the sport, winning several local and regional titles with her most recent coming in the Dominican Republic last May.

Since then, she's made a number of deep tournament runs including quarter-final appearances at Indian Wells and in Brazil as well as a semi-final loss in Zapopan, Mexico.

With three tournaments to come in Europe to come, James is hoping to make a breakthrough into two of the world's biggest grand slams.

“I'm focused on growth, testing myself against the best junior players in the world, and breaking new ground to improve my level of play,” James said. “I also want to absorb and enjoy the experience. My goal is to break into the top 50 as this will put me in a good position to gain entry into Wimbledon and the US Open. It's an ambitious goal but I believe that it's within reach.”

As she waves the Jamaican flag high all over the world, James says she hopes to inspire other young players from the island.

“Representing Jamaica has always given me great joy and is one of the greatest honours of my life,” she said. “Every time I step on a court and see the Jamaican flag next to my name or flying high in the stadium, it fills me with pride. It's a reminder that I'm playing for something bigger than myself.

“Jamaica is known internationally for our music and track and field. I would like to put Jamaica on the map for tennis. I'm excited about the chance to represent Jamaica at the Billie Jean King and Fed Cup tournaments later this year. I hope my journey inspires young athletes back home — to believe that with hard work and commitment, anything is possible.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","French Open women's singles projected seeds: Sabalenka and Gauff top two, Swiatek could be as low as No 5","https://www.tennis365.com/french-open/french-open-womens-singles-projected-seeds-sabalenka-gauff-top-two-swiatek-no-5","Fri, 16 May 2025 09:52:28 GMT","

Only one Italian Open match remains and it could have a big impact on defending champion Iga Swiatek's seeding at the French Open.

Four-time Roland Garros winner Swiatek has already had a setback in her seeding as she is guaranteed to slip from No 2 to No 4 in the WTA Rankings after the WTA 1000 event in Rome.

But she could drop to fifth in the standings if Jasmine Paolini goes on to beat Coco Gauff and win the trophy at Foro Italico.

The seedings for the French Open are based on the WTA Rankings on May 19, 2025, and Aryna Sabalenka is assured of being the top seed with Gauff second and Jessica Pegula third, but the fourth and fifth positions will only be decided after the Italian Open final.

Despite her quarter-final exit in Rome, Sabalenka sits comfortably at the top on 10,683 points in the Live Rankings and she is followed by Gauff (6,863/7,213) and Pegula (6,308).

It is the second major in a row where Sabalenka is the top seed as she was also at No 1 at the Australian Open after Swiatek dominated the top spot the previous few years.

Swiatek is currently in fourth place after she failed to defend her WTA 1000 trophy and she has 5,838 points while Paolini is fifth on 5,515, but the Italian will move to 5,865 points if she wins the final.

The other players who will be seeded in the top eight are Mirra Andreeva, Madison Keys and Zheng Qinwen with Emma Navarro and Paula Badosa completing the top 10.

1. Aryna Sabalenka
2. Coco Gauff
3. Jessica Pegula
4. Iga Swiatek
5. Jasmine Paolini
6. Mirra Andreeva
7. Madison Keys
8. Zheng Qinwen
9. Emma Navarro
10. Paula Badosa
11. Diana Shnaider
12. Elena Rybakina
13. Karolina Muchova
14. Elina Svitolina
15. Barbora Krejcikova
16. Amanda Anisimova
17. Daria Kasatkina
18. Donna Vekic
19. Ludmilla Samsonova
20. Jelena Ostapenko
21. Clara Tauson
22. Ekaterina Alexandrova
23. Beatriz Haddad Maia
24. Elise Mertens
25. Magdalena Frech
26. Marta Kostyuk
27. Peyton Stearns
28. Leylah Fernandez
29. Linda Noskova
30. Anna Kalinskaya
31. Sofia Kenin
32. Yulia Putintseva

The top eight players can't face each other before the quarter-finals as they will each be placed in their own section of the main draw for the clay-court major while Sabalenka will headline the top half of the draw and Gauff will go into the bottom half.

The next two (Pegula and one of Swiatek and Paolini) will also be split.

If Swiatek ends up as the fifth seed, she could face one of the top two as early as the last eight.

Fourth or fifth will be the five-time Grand Slam winner's lowest seeding at Roland Garros since 2021 when she was seeded eighth as she has been the top seed the past three editions.

Unlike at WTA 1000 events, the seeded players do not enjoy byes in the Grand Slams and they all have to win seven matches to secure the title.

Reigning Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova is set to be seeded 15th, but there are doubts over whether or not she will play as she has not featured so far this year. The Czech is set to play in Strasbourg next week, but it remains to be seen if she will be fit enough.

Just outside the cut

Should any of the players in the top 32 withdraw from the French Open, then the following players are next in line to be seeded:
33. Magda Linette
34. Olga Danilović
35. Ons Jabeur

Meanwhile, Krejcikova is one of eight Grand Slam winners who are set to be seeded with the others being Sabalenka, Gauff, Swiatek, Keys, Rybakina, Ostapenko and Kenin.

Every major sportswear brand brings its best apparel and footwear to the Grand Slams. Clay court season is in full swing, and the tennis world is preparing to descend upon Paris for Roland Garros later this month.

Parisian culture dictates a high quality of fashion, and no company wants an unforced error on the clay courts of Philippe Chatrier. Over the past month, various brands have already begun rolling out their on-court kits for the French Open. 

Earlier today, fans got their first look at On's ""Summer"" and ""Mid-Summer"" court collections designed for Roland Garros and the start of grass court season.

It looks like On is sticking with its gradient designs for Grand Slams, this time using a rainbow mix of green, yellow, blue, and purple. The collections do not appear on the On website (yet); instead, they leaked early at TennisWarehouse.com.

The On Men's Summer Court collection includes just three pieces available for purchase at this time: the Court Sleeveless Top ($70), Court Top ($80), and Court Short ($80).

Tennis fans can expect to see Ben Shelton and Joao Fonseca debut the rainbow-inspired kits on court in Paris later this month.

Meanwhile, the On Women's Summer and Mid-Summer Court collection has more to offer at this time. It sticks with the rainbow gradient for Summer while using a familiar black and purple color scheme for Mid-Summer.

The Summer and Mid-Summer Court collections include the Courtside Pleat Skirt ($100), Court Skirt ($100), Court Crop Top ($80), Court Top ($80), and Court Tank ($70). Fans can expect to see Iga Swiatek wear pieces from the collection as she defends her French Open title.

Some tennis fans on social media have expressed a desire to see On move away from the gradient patterns, but the Swiss brand always stands out on the court compared to rival companies that try to blend in with neutral designs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Anyone for eTennis? An interview with Roland-Garros' Aymeric Labaste","https://www.pocketgamer.biz/the-future-of-tennis-may-be-mobile/","Fri, 16 May 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

Aymeric Labaste, Director of International Development at Roland-Garros, speaks to PocketGamer.biz about the evolution and impact of the Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault.

In this exclusive interview. The conversation delves into the strategic motivations behind the event, its partnership with Tennis Clash, and the future plans for the eTennis competition. Labaste shares insights on reaching new audiences, measuring success, and the growing intersection of physical and digital sports for Roland-Garros - and tennis in general.

PocketGamer.biz: How does the eSeries fit into the overall strategy of Roland-Garros to expand its global brand and reach new audiences?

Aymeric Labaste: As one of the four tennis Grand Slam tournaments, Roland-Garros enjoys strong visibility among traditional tennis fans thanks to its nearly 100-year legacy. 

With Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault, our ambition has been to inject innovation into our brand's DNA and to expand its reach on a global scale, especially among digital-native audiences. This year, over 515 thousand participants joined our three Open Qualifiers, playing more than 9.5 million matches on the virtual Central Court. For the first time, we also integrated official Roland-Garros music and French voice-over for the umpire, small details that add up to a truly immersive experience. 

Since the first edition in 2018, we've positioned Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault as the world's biggest eTennis event. In 2022, we moved our competition onto the mobile game Tennis Clash, which is the perfect vehicle to connect with a broader audience through its arcade-style gameplay. As 50 percent of Tennis Clash users don't play tennis in real life, it's crucial for us that every player can experience the spirit of Roland-Garros from their smartphone/tablet in a fun & accessible way!

“As 50 percent of Tennis Clash users don't play tennis in real life, it's crucial for us that every player can experience the spirit of Roland-Garros from their smartphone/tablet in a fun & accessible way!”Aymeric Labaste

What were the key motivations behind partnering with Tennis Clash for the eSeries, and how does this collaboration align with the traditional values of Roland-Garros?

When we began our collaboration with Tennis Clash in 2022, we were already convinced that mobile was both the present and future of esports, with over 2.8 billion mobile gamers worldwide. Major publishers like Riot Games, Epic Games and PUBG had already launched mobile versions of their games to align with evolving consumer habits, a clear signal of the platform's growing dominance.

Asia, in particular, has been leading the way, with mobile gaming deeply embedded in its gaming & esports culture. Tennis Clash, as the tennis video game with the largest community (i.e. over 170 million downloads), turned out to be the ideal partner to make our Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault truly accessible and inclusive on a global scale. In 2025, we had over 515 thousand participants from 221 different territories, proof of its worldwide appeal. Lastly, knowing that 52 percent of mobile gamers are women, it has also allowed us to connect with a more gender-balanced audience. The partnership with Tennis Clash reflects our ambition to stay true to Roland-Garros' core values - international, accessibility, inclusivity and excellence - while embracing new formats that bring the spirit of our tournament to life for a new generation of tennis fans.

Can you describe the evolution of the Roland-Garros eSeries since its inception? What have been some of the biggest successes and challenges?

When we launched the very first edition of Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault in 2018, one of our initial challenges was internal: convincing the top management of the French Tennis Federation that esports could be a powerful platform to promote the Roland-Garros brand globally.

Then, the biggest turning point came in 2022, when we partnered with Tennis Clash. Finding the right publisher sharing our ambitious vision to build a true eTennis ecosystem was essential, and that move proved to be a game changer for our tournament's popularity (238 thousans participants in 2022). From there, bringing the right sponsors on board was essential to elevate the project and establish a strong marketing platform. Renault has supported the tournament since 2022, and Mastercard joined us in 2024. Their commitment has played a key role in helping us grow the competition into what it is today. 

Among our proudest achievements: surpassing half a million participants since 2024 and opening the Final Stage's livestream to the public at Roland-Garros for the first time last year, creating an exciting new way for fans to engage with the event.

“Another major milestone in 2025 is the participation of former tennis champions Gilles Simon & Marion Bartoli as ambassadors, a perfect symbol of how the worlds of tennis and eTennis can come together.”Aymeric Labaste

Another major milestone in 2025 is the participation of former tennis champions Gilles Simon & Marion Bartoli as ambassadors, a perfect symbol of how the worlds of tennis and eTennis can come together. This year, Gilles & Marion will each lead their own teams, as we introduce a team format for the first time. It's great for the show, but also enriches the players' experience, giving all finalists the chance to play as a team before the competition becomes individual again in the playoffs. 

What specific initiatives or features within the eSeries have been most effective in engaging new demographics, particularly younger or disengaged audiences in different regions/territories?

One of the most effective ways we've engaged new demographics, especially younger or previously disengaged audiences, has been through mobile-first accessibility. By partnering with Tennis Clash, we eliminated many traditional barriers to entry: no expensive hardware, no steep learning curve, just instant access from a smartphone or tablet. The format itself also helps: arcade-style gameplay, short matches, fast progression and an open & global qualifying system. In addition, livestreaming the Final Stage at Roland-Garros, on platforms consumed by Gen Z like Twitch or YouTube, was another key decision. The climax of our competition requires having the right lineup to deliver the best content to both core & casual tennis fans. For 2025, we're going even further by broadcasting the event on the Roland-Garros YouTube channel for the first time. This allows us to reach a truly global audience, beyond the community of a single host streamer. It's about making the competition accessible wherever fans are as well as delivering premium and immersive content, bridging the worlds of sport and esports.

How do you measure the success of the eSeries, and what metrics are most important to Roland-Garros in evaluating its impact?

We measure the success of Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault through a combination of participation, reach and media value. On the participation side, we track the number of players, matches played, and the diversity of territories represented. These metrics give us a strong sense of global engagement & accessibility. The livestream viewership of the Final Stage at Roland-Garros, both on Twitch & YouTube, is critical in evaluating how the competition resonates with fans, especially younger, digitally-native audiences. From a partner perspective, we closely monitor their visibility on Tennis Clash and across social media, as these platforms drive visibility and brand exposure for our sponsors like Renault and Mastercard. Ultimately, the media value generated for them is a crucial indicator of success. All together, these metrics help us assess how Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault is growing not only as a competition, but as a powerful storytelling and brand engagement platform for Roland-Garros.

How do you see the relationship between the physical and digital aspects of Roland-Garros evolving in the future?

Our competition is a powerful platform to promote our brand in a way that stands apart from traditional media. By immersing new audiences in the Roland-Garros universe through esports & live streaming, we're not only growing brand affinity but we're also inspiring more people to follow Roland-Garros and even give tennis a try. 

Both physical and digital aspects are essential to making Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault a true success. The Qualifying stage, with over half a million participants, builds momentum, but it's the climax at Roland-Garros that gives the competition its prestige and emotional payoff. Our 8 finalists are invited to Paris for a full three-day experience, we feel proud to be the only eTennis competition offering such an immersive on-site experience. It starts with an exclusive esports training at GameWard, a professional French esports club, to ensure they're all gaining skills and feeling like professional players for the Final Stage. Especially because it takes place in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers worldwide and a live audience at Roland-Garros.

All this adds pressure and excitement for these amateur players, more used to playing on their phones at home than under the spotlight. To round out the experience, the 8 finalists also receive tickets to the real Roland-Garros tournament on Central court, making their Parisian visit truly memorable. It's also interesting to observe that many of the best Tennis Clash players are actually real-life tennis players, which gives them an edge since they already understand tennis strategies. While that knowledge certainly offers an advantage, it's their ability to manage the nerves and leverage their mental game that often separates the winner from the rest!

What are your future plans for the eSeries, and how do you envision it growing and adapting in the coming years?

Our main objective is to maintain our leadership in the eTennis space while establishing ourselves as a true reference for esports within the global sports industry. To achieve this, we're focused on reinforcing the Roland-Garros experience within the competition itself, while also creating a truly immersive journey for all stakeholders - participants, fans, streamers and ambassadors. Today, Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault stands as the world's largest eTennis event, offering exclusive opportunities that set us apart. We provide the best Tennis Clash players with a unique 3-day, all-expenses-paid experience at Roland-Garros, along with prize money (€5,000 prize pool). These features not only elevate the prestige of the competition but also make it a truly compelling moment in the esports calendar. The event continues to grow, and we're proud to see it becoming a must-attend for fans eager to experience the excitement of the Final Stage live at Roland-Garros. As the livestreaming world never stops evolving, we're pushed to be even more creative in delivering, with our streamers, top-tier content and making sure our audience stays engaged. Looking ahead, I'm expecting to see even stronger connections between the worlds of tennis and eTennis. Many active and former professional tennis players already play video games while travelling on the Tour, and I'm convinced we'll see more of them participating in esports competitions like ours - either as players or team captains - just like former top 10 stars Gilles Simon and Marion Bartoli this year. 

Could you share some insights into the global reach and participation in the eSeries, and how it compares to traditional tennis viewership or participation?

The logics of engagement behind eTennis and traditional tennis are fundamentally different, making direct comparisons somewhat irrelevant. Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault serves primarily as a marketing platform designed to promote the Roland-Garros brand in the months leading up to the real tournament in Paris. The Final Stage of our competition takes place the day before the Roland-Garros main draw begins, helping to build momentum and excitement around Roland-Garros. Our eTennis event is also enhancing the brand equity of Roland-Garros in terms of awareness and perception across different targeted markets. This is why we kick off the competition in early March, with 3 open qualifiers in March & April that engage participants long before Roland-Garros in Paris. By doing so, we create meaningful connections with our brand early on. Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault also allows us to reach a broader and more diverse audience, including those who may not traditionally be tennis fans but are drawn into the Roland-Garros universe through gaming. A key indicator of the global success of Roland-Garros eSeries by Renault is the number of matches played on our virtual Central Court within Tennis Clash: from 1.6 million in 2022 to 9.5 million in 2025, across 221 territories. It's a strong signal of the rising popularity of our competition on a worldwide scale.","{'href': 'https://www.pocketgamer.biz', 'title': 'PocketGamer.biz'}","tennis"

Often characterised by unpredictable bounces and quick kicks, grass tennis courts have long been considered one of the sport's most challenging surfaces to master.

They're a key reason Wimbledon is widely seen as the most iconic tournament in tennis.

Known for rewarding aggressive styles of play, the surface was once dominated by serve-and-volley specialists like Boris Becker and Pete Sampras.

When discussing changing tactics in grass court tennis, Jeff Sackmann, founder of statistical website Tennis Abstract, said: “It's been a huge move towards baseline play, definitely. 

“If you go back to the 90s, you have Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker, Greg Rusedski and Tim Henman who would serve and volley.

“Now, it's basically gone.”

One factor which may have contributed to this shift is the fact that tour-level grass tennis courts have now become more durable – a precedent thought to be set by Wimbledon's change to using 100% ryegrass courts in 2001.

Previously, the All England Club used only 70% ryegrass. 

Speaking on the famous switch, Co-Head Coach of Wigmore Lawn Tennis Club in London, Scott Davies, said: “Although before this change, the grass courts were faster, their durability was worse.

“So they'd start off really fast, and then they'd wear down and become way more unpredictable. They'd have slow patches and fast patches, bad bounces.”

The modern grass tennis court, thanks to ryegrass and improved maintenance, plays flatter and more reliably, somewhat resembling hard courts in pace and bounce.

This has caused some players and fans to believe that grass courts have slowed down in recent years, according to Tennis View Magazine.

Therefore, the assumption that grass courts are the fastest on tour may have become somewhat outdated. 

But how could these speed changes be measured?

When discussing strong indicators of surface speed, statistician Sackmann said: “Aces are great and basically, it just tells you how well the returner is able to respond. And that's going to be something influenced by the surface speed.”

While rally length is also considered to be a valuable tool for measuring surface speed, Sackmann believes both produce similar results.

Tennis Abstract's surface-speed metric uses ace rates to compare court speeds across ATP events, not just the Slams, indirectly factoring in external elements, such as temperature, humidity, wind, the balls used, and of course the physical surface.

A score of 1.25, for example, indicates players would hit 25% more aces on a certain tournament's surface than the tour average for that year, therefore suggesting a significantly faster court.

According to this measure, the gap between court speeds has narrowed since 1991, compared to 2023, particularly between grass and hard courts – perhaps a result of the use of ryegrass. 

However, clay courts, with their naturally higher friction, remain the slowest by a wide margin.

Still, recent statistics from Grand Slam tournaments show that grass courts continue to offer an advantage to powerful servers.

In 2024, Wimbledon, which is currently the only major to be played on grass, produced the highest number of combined aces across both the men's and women's draws.

Their ace leaders, Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard (115) and Elena Rybakina (39), accumulated 154 aces between them, a fraction of the 6455 struck across the tournament.

By contrast, at the 2024 US Open, which boasted the second-highest tally for male and female ace leaders at the last four slams, only 3139 aces were tallied – less than half of Wimbledon's count.

While Perricard, standing at 6ft 8in with a huge serve, could be considered something of an outlier, his run to the fourth round at Wimbledon, which was his best Slam showing to date, illustrates how players with a similar toolset can excel on grass. 

These numbers challenge the growing belief that grass courts have slowed in recent years.

In fact, ace rates on grass, as well as across all surfaces, have significantly increased since 1991.

Data collected from the ATP Tour's top 40 serve leaders shows the average number of aces per match on grass has risen by approximately 76%, from 7.6 to 13.4, between 1991 and 2024 (when the last grass court ATP-level tournaments were held).

While these numbers demonstrate a potential rise in grass surface speed, further blunting arguments that the courts are in fact slowing, these numbers may reflect broader developments in the sport.

Factors such as improved equipment and more intense training regimes have enabled players' to improve their athleticism  – possibly resulting in increased ace numbers.

Discussing advancements in the game, tennis coach, Davies, said: “Players have sports scientists, sport nutritionists controlling pretty much every aspect of their lives.”

Stats connoisseur Sackmann also acknowledged the growing role of fitness in the modern game.

He said: “Now, if you're if you're playing almost anybody on tour, even somebody who's not a great returner, they're going to make you fight for it.”

Overall, while grass courts can still be regarded as the fastest on tour, the perception that the three main tennis surfaces have become homogenised in recent years could be explained by improvements in player conditioning and court quality – causing tennis to enter an era dominated by baseline play.

Tommy Paul has faced some off-court distractions during his Italian Open campaign. (Getty Images: Ion Alcoba Beitia, File)

Tommy Paul has reached the Italian Open semifinals after defeating Hubert Hurkacz.

He revealed his truck was repossessed at his home in the US after he missed ""a couple of payments"".

Paul will play world number one Jannik Sinner in the Italian Open semifinals.

Tommy Paul has been forced to put off-court distractions in his rear-view mirror at the Italian Open this week after the American's beloved truck was repossessed at his home in Florida.

Paul beat Hubert Hurkacz 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to set up a semifinal against world number one Jannik Sinner in Rome.

But it was clear the fate of his Ford F-150 was a worry for world number 12 Paul, who has made more than $US10 million ($15.5 million) in career prize money.

""It's been a great week on court so far. I feel like I've been getting a little bit better with every match. Off court, a little bit of a stressful week,"" Paul said.

Jannik Sinner admits he thought about walking away from tennis prior to accepting a three-month doping ban earlier this year.

""I got my truck repossessed. I missed a couple payments and they took my truck from my house this week.

""I've been grinding to get my truck back. If you know me, that's my baby.""

Paul added his truck was on the way back home after he paid a $US1,000 fine to the authorities.

""I'm excited to get it back. I had to win a couple matches so I could pay that off,"" said Paul after pocketing $US325,964 for reaching the semifinals in Rome.

Paul is the first American man to reach consecutive Italian Open semifinals since Pete Sampras in 1993-94 and he could return to the top 10 with a win over Sinner.

He is also seeking his first title of the season after capturing three tournament victories in 2024.

Sinner is playing his first tournament since serving a three-month doping suspension.

It all added up for Tommy Paul earlier this year when he cracked the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time. Will he next achieve one of his biggest goals: claiming ATP Masters 1000 glory?

The American is trying to do just that this week at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, where he is into the semi-finals with a run that has included a victory against longtime foe Alex de Minaur, who had led their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 5-0.

ATPTour.com caught up with Paul at Indian Wells to discuss why playing De Minaur is difficult, his greatest success, why he doesn't feel he has dealt with too many difficulties and plenty more.



What is your favourite tennis rivalry?
Rafa and Roger, it's my favourite rivalry in tennis.

Who is your greatest rival?
I don't know if it's a rivalry, because he's got me so many times, but me and Demon [Alex de Minaur] have had some serious wars, and he's got me in some big matches, so I'm out for revenge on Demon.

What makes him so tough to play?
Consistency. Doesn't miss a ball. He's a dog on court.

What has been your greatest success?
I would say my greatest success so far is last year in Queen's [Club], winning the 500 title. That was a special thing at a special place. 

What's the greatest difficulty you've had to overcome?
I don't like to feel like I've had too many huge difficulties in my life. I play tennis for my job and for a living, and I think life's been pretty good.

What's been the most unique moment in your career?
Transitioning from juniors to pros is unique. I think for a lot of people it's easier than others and for me it was a difficult time, but definitely a big change in lifestyle.

What is the biggest number or the biggest accomplishment that you're chasing?
I guess the biggest thing that I'm chasing is a tournament, a Masters 1000 title or Top 5 in the world.

How long have you been pursuing that?

I guess my whole life. I feel like every time I go to a tournament, the goal is to win the tournament. And I played quite a few of these, and I've wanted to win every single one that I've played.

What's your favourite tournament to play?
My favourite tournament to play in is either Indian Wells, Wimbledon, or the US Open. US Open because it's the home slam for us. Wimbledon, it's the mecca. And Indian Wells, because [it is] tennis paradise.

 

What's been the coolest off-court experience you've been able to enjoy being a professional tennis player?
I've gone to a lot of really cool sporting events, whether it's on the Tour or at home. I guess earlier this year, the Eagles won the Super Bowl, and I went to the NFC Championship game. That was a pretty awesome event to go to.

Has being a professional tennis player given you some better fishing opportunities?
Before the [US] Open, a couple years ago, we went fishing in the Hamptons, and that was quite an experience.

Another day, another comeback to delight her home fans. No. 6 seed Jasmine Paolini became the third Italian woman in the Open Era to reach the Internazionali BNL d'Italia final after coming from 4-1 down in the first set, saving two set points, to defeat Peyton Stearns 7-5, 6-1 in 1 hour and 39 minutes.

Rome: Draws | Scores | Order of play

Paolini advances to her eighth career final, and fourth at WTA 1000 level or above following Dubai, Roland Garros and Wimbledon last year. She is the first Italian woman to reach the final in Rome since doubles partner Sara Errani in 2014, and will bid to become the first home champion since 1985, when Raffaella Reggi defeated Vicki Nelson-Dunbar for the trophy.

The 29-year-old will seek her third career Hologic WTA Tour title when she faces No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in Saturday's final. Gauff needed 3 hours and 32 minutes to battle past No. 8 seed Zheng Qinwen in Thursday's late-night semifinal thriller.

Gauff leads Paolini 2-1 in their head-to-head -- but Paolini won their only clay-court meeting last month in Stuttgart.

First-set turnaround: Paolini's comeback wasn't as spectacular as in the quarterfinals, where she trailed Diana Shnaider by a set and 4-0 -- and then 2-0 in the decider -- before turning the match around. But she still required all her grit to slowly reel Stearns in.

The American leapt out to a 3-0 lead, and held two points for a 4-0 double break. A remarkable stretch volley from Paolini paved the way for the Italian to get on the board, and she took the next three games to get back on serve.

But the Stearns forehand kept finding its mark as she broke again for 5-3. But a bold drop shot from Paolini saved the first set point, and an even bolder return winner -- struck from out wide, having run around her forehand -- enabled Paolini to break back. Stearns netted a forehand on her second set point in the next game, and a blazing forehand winner from Paolini on the next point signalled that the crowd favorite was ready to seize control of the match.

Stearns, who had become the first woman in the Open Era to win three consecutive matches in third-set tiebreaks this week, began to leak errors towards the end of the first set, and they kept coming in the second as Paolini motored to the finishing line. From 5-3 down, Paolini won 10 of the last 11 games of the match.

Backing up 2024 breakthrough: Despite the big-stage consistency of Paolini's breakthrough 2024, reaching the second week of every major, she came into this season underestimated once again in terms of her ability to sustain her form.

But she now owns a 21-8 record this year, including semifinal finishes in Miami and Stuttgart. After Rome, she is guaranteed to move into the Top 10 of the PIF Race to the WTA Finals Leaderboard, and she will stay in the Top 5 of the PIF WTA Rankings -- moving back to her career high of No. 4 with the title.

Paolini herself has put 2024 into sensible perspective.

""I'm trying to be in the mindset that last year was a great year, but it give me a lot of confidence,"" she said. ""I have to remember that, a lot of experience that I have in my belt, under my belt. At the same time, this year is another year. It's different, completely different story.""","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

No. 4 seed Coco Gauff will face No. 6 Jasmine Paolini for the WTA 1000 Internazionali BNL d'Italia title on Saturday at 5 p.m. local (11 a.m. ET). Here's everything you need to know.

It will be a buona festa on Saturday at the Foro Italico, as two Top 10 players square off in the women's singles final at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome.

The sixth WTA 1000 title of the season -- and the second on clay -- will be decided in Rome on May 17. For just the third time in the Open Era, an Italian woman will play for the trophy.

Rome: Draws | Scores | Order of play

No. 6 seed Jasmine Paolini will be the crowd favorite, as she has become the first home finalist on the women's side in more than a decade. Paolini will be going for her third WTA title, her second at WTA 1000 level and her first on clay.

To capture the title and thrill the home crowd, Paolini will have to get past No. 4 seed Coco Gauff of the United States. Gauff battled into her second straight WTA 1000 final of this year's clay-court swing, and she is seeking her 10th WTA title.

Here's what you need to know about Saturday's showdown on Campo Centrale:

The Internazionali BNL d'Italia women's singles final will be played on Saturday, May 17 at 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET).

The doubles final will take place the following day, Sunday, May 18 at 12 p.m. local time (6 a.m. ET).

By making the Rome final, both Paolini and Gauff have assured themselves 650 PIF WTA ranking points and €456,735 in prize money.

The singles champion will increase those numbers. Whoever wins the final will pocket 1,000 ranking points and take home €877,390.

By reaching the final, Paolini has already guaranteed she will maintain her spot in the Top 5. A runner-up showing will keep her at No. 5, but if she wins the title, she will return to her career-high ranking of No. 4.

As for Gauff, she will return to her career-high of No. 2 in Monday's rankings, win or lose. 

Gauff's season picked up a head of steam once she got onto the European clay. After a quarterfinal finish in Stuttgart, Gauff has now reached back-to-back WTA 1000 finals at Madrid and Rome. She is 11-2 on clay so far this year.

Her path to the Rome final, though, had a couple of bumps along the way. Gauff dropped her first set of the tournament to teenage qualifier Victoria Mboko. Then in the semifinals, she needed to grind through the longest main-draw match of the year -- a 3-hour and 32-minute late-night thriller over Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen.

Gauff's run to the final:1R: bye2R: d. [Q] Victoria Mboko (#156) 3-6, 6-2, 6-13R: d. [32] Magda Linette (#32) 7-5, 6-34R: d. Emma Raducanu (#49) 6-1, 6-2QF: d. [7] Mirra Andreeva (#7) 6-4, 7-6(5)SF: d. [8] Zheng Qinwen (#8) 7-6(3), 4-6, 7-6(4)

Meanwhile, Paolini thrilled her partisan crowds all fortnight, dropping only one set in the process (to Diana Shnaider in the quarterfinals).

Coming into Rome, Paolini had not reached a final all season, but she was rejuvenated on her home soil. Paolini defeated three seeded players en route to the semifinals before ending the run of Peyton Stearns, who became the first player in the Open Era to win three consecutive third-set tiebreaks this fortnight.

Paolini's run to the final:1R: bye2R: d. Lulu Sun (#46) 6-4, 6-33R: d. [27] Ons Jabeur (#36) 6-4, 6-34R: d. [17] Jelena Ostapenko (#18) 7-5, 6-2QF: d. [13] Diana Shnaider (#11) 6-7(1), 6-4, 6-2SF: d. Peyton Stearns (#42), 7-5, 6-1

Gauff leads their head-to-head 2–1, but that edge comes with an asterisk: Paolini won their only meeting on clay -- and it wasn't long ago.

Gauff took their first two encounters, both on hard courts, at Adelaide in 2021 and Cincinnati in 2023, where she went on to win her first WTA 1000 title.

But just last month in Stuttgart, Paolini earned her first win over Gauff with a 6–4, 6–3 victory on indoor clay at the WTA 500 event.

This is a huge moment for Italy at their biggest tournament. Paolini is the first Italian women's singles finalist at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia since her doubles partner Sara Errani in 2014 (who finished runner-up to Serena Williams).

One more win would make Paolini the first Italian women's singles champion at this event since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, 40 years ago. Paolini, Errani and Reggi are the only Italian women to make this final in the Open Era.

Meanwhile, Gauff is the first American woman in nine years to reach the Rome final, and she is trying to claim the title for the United States once again. In 2016, Serena Williams defeated Madison Keys in an all-American Rome final.

And despite her clay-court proficiency (including a Roland Garros final in 2022), a victory on Saturday would be Gauff's first title on this surface since she won WTA 250 Parma in 2021.

The 29-year-old Paolini became the third oldest woman to reach her first Rome final, younger only than Helga Masthoff (1971) and Li Na (2012).

And Paolini is the first Italian to reach multiple WTA 1000 finals since this tournament tier was introduced in 2009. Paolini was the champion at WTA 1000 Dubai last year.

Paolini now holds the best winning percentage of any Italian at WTA 1000 events (56.9%, 41-31), surpassing former US Open champion Flavia Pennetta.

As for 21-year-old Gauff, she has now become the youngest player to reach the singles finals at both Rome and Madrid in the same season.

A Rome semifinalist in 2021 and 2024, Gauff has won 17 matches at the tournament. In the Open Era, only Gabriela Sabatini won more main-draw matches at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia before turning 22 (Sabatini won 27 matches).

For the first time in her career, Gauff has registered four Top 10 wins on clay in a single season. She beat Mirra Andreeva and Iga Swiatek at Madrid, then added wins over Andreeva and Zheng Qinwen this fortnight in Rome.

Gauff and Paolini both spoke after their semifinal wins:

Gauff: ""[The Stuttgart quarterfinal vs. Paolini] was a tough match. She played well. She's a tough opponent. I think especially here with the home crowd behind her, she's going to be playing some great tennis. I have to expect that.

""Hopefully I can bring a better level and hopefully win the title. If not, I'm proud just really of this [semifinal] match, too.""

Paolini: ""I think [2014 finalist Errani is] part of my team. She watched many, many matches. Last match she was a key part because she helped me a lot. ... It's amazing to be in the final as she did.

""[The 2024 season] gave me a lot of confidence that I have to remember, a lot of experience that I have under my belt. At the same time this year is another year. It's different, completely different story. ... [I'm] trying to repeat [to] myself, 'Look, remember that last year, we did an amazing year.'""

After a grueling three hours and 33 minutes on Thursday evening, Coco Gauff finally let out a roar of celebration and then pointed toward her head.

On Friday, two of the world's most spectacular shot makers will battle for a spot in the Internazionali BNL d'Italia final, as world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz is set to face Lorenzo Musetti at the Foro Italico. This is a rematch of the final in Monte-Carlo a month ago, when Alcaraz earned a 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 victory over a banged-up Musetti. But the Italian is healthier heading into this semifinal showdown, and he's going to be playing with the full crowd on his side.That should be enough for Musetti to at least push Alcaraz to a decider, and you can get the Italian to win a set at -125 odds.If you listen to Tennis Bets Live, hopefully you took Alcaraz to win the third quarter and Musetti to win the fourth, along with the plays on both of them to win a title in Rome. If you did, there's no reason to play anything here. Just sit back and hope that the winner can do a better job of making Jannik Sinner look human than Casper Ruud did.

While Alcaraz is 4-1 in this head-to-head series, it wasn't a fluke that the Italian won a set in that Monte-Carlo final. Musetti is a different player in 2025 than he was in 2024, and he and Alcaraz hadn't clashed since last year's Miami Open. This season, Musetti has career-highs in winning percentage (80.9%), hold percentage (80.9%) and break percentage (26.2%). And after never having made the semifinals of a Masters 1000 prior to 2025, Musetti is already into his third of the year.Musetti has always been a world-class player when it comes to finding angles, hitting scorchers and making his way onto highlight reels. But he has improved as a server, gotten better with point construction and has found ways to stay a little more solid within matches. Combining that with the way his elite athleticism helps him defend the baseline, along with his fighting mentality, makes him a very difficult player to beat.

Alcaraz has dialed things in and played some good tennis on clay this season, but he still runs hot and cold. He's always capable of playing a mistake-prone set of tennis, and his serve still gets him into trouble. Alcaraz's first serve in percentage (65.1%) is lower than it has been since 2021, and his hold percentage is down at 83.9%. That's also the lowest mark he has had since 2021.If Alcaraz doesn't have a fantastic service day, Musetti is going to get on the board with some breaks in this match. That alone should help the Italian win a set. But Musetti can also find a way in by just making a lot of balls, playing with shape and waiting out Alcaraz errors. Those can come at any moment, but they might come at a higher clip with Alcaraz playing in a hostile environment. He's used to being the fan favorite.It'd just be stunning to see Musetti go down without a fight in front of his home fans. And I actually think he's live to win the match. Alcaraz's 6-4, 6-4 win over Jack Draper last match wasn't as straightforward as the score would suggest. Draper had his chances to win, but inner mental struggles got the better of him. Let's see Alcaraz play that same way against an in-form Musetti. I suspect it won't go very well.Pick: Musetti +1.5 Sets (-125)

Oscar Piastri finished fastest from McLaren team mate Lando Norris once again in the second free practice session ahead of the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, as the session was disrupted by a late red flag after Isack Hadjar span off.

In dry and sunny conditions at 1700 local time, all drivers took to the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit in the opening minutes during a one-hour session which offered the best representation of conditions ahead of Qualifying on Saturday.

FP1: Piastri sets the pace from Norris and Sainz during first practice in Imola

Norris moved to the top of the times on the medium tyre after the first set of runs, his 1m 16.074s already nearly half a second faster than team mate Piastri's best from the opening session on the soft compound.

Traffic proved to be a tricky affair for teams and drivers to manage around the narrow circuit from the outset, Fernando Alonso claiming ""I nearly crashed"" after slamming on the brakes into the opening turn as Franco Colapinto's Alpine emerged from the pits.

Practice 2 results

Carlos Sainz became the first driver to dip below the 1m 16s barrier after 10 minutes, which moved him just ahead of Williams team mate Alex Albon, before both drivers were shuffled back a spot by Norris, who lowered the benchmark to a 1m 15.952s.

George Russell became the first driver to bolt on a set of soft tyres, the C6 rubber the softest in Pirelli's range and making its debut this weekend for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, with the Mercedes driver launching to the top of the times on a 1m 15.693s approaching the 20-minute mark.

The majority of the field soon followed his lead and bolted on the red-walled tyre, Max Verstappen falling short of the Briton's best by just 0.042s and complaining of ""bottoming quite hard through Turns 11 and 12"", as the second Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda slotted into third briefly.

It was short-lived as Norris asserted himself back at the top of the times with a 1m 15.318s before Piastri lowered the benchmark to a 1m 15.293s inside the first half an hour. A second attempt for Norris to usurp his team mate was thwarted as he suffered a snap of oversteer at the final corner having set a personal best in sector one and session best in sector two.

Thereafter, the second half of the session consisted of race runs using the medium tyre before a red flag was deployed with six minutes remaining. Hadjar found the gravel on the exit of the Tamburello Chicane and, despite hitting the barrier, moved his Racing Bulls machine back to the edge of the circuit before becoming beached.

The session resumed with less than two minutes remaining, leaving Piastri to head Norris as McLaren completed a perfect Friday of running.

Hadjar found the barrier in FP2 and brought out the red flags

Pierre Gasly's Alpine impressed again by finishing third from Russell, Verstappen and Charles Leclerc, the Ferrari driver complaining of braking problems with his SF-25 along with team mate Lewis Hamilton throughout the session.

The Briton, who eventually finished 11th, struggled to tame his Ferrari which included a huge oversteer moment at the first chicane on his opening flying lap, while the seven-time World Champion also found traffic numerous times.

His replacement at Mercedes, Kimi Antonelli, also had a close call with Tsunoda on the run down the hill to Rivazza 1, claiming over the radio ""that was super dangerous from the Red Bull"".

The young Italian was left in 18th, as Hadjar finished the session as top rookie in seventh despite his off ahead of Tsunoda as Albon and Sainz completed the top 10.

Ollie Bearman's Haas finished 12th from the returning Colapinto, who also went wheel-to-wheel with Verstappen during the session on the exit of Tosa.

Alonso was the leading Aston Martin in 14th from Liam Lawson and Gabriel Bortoleto, the Kick Sauber driver having brought out the red flag in FP1, with Lance Stroll 17th. Nico Hulkenberg finished ahead of Esteban Ocon, with the Haas driver last and 1.127s off Piastri's session best.

Teams will regroup overnight ahead of the third and final practice session on Saturday, which takes place from 1230 local time before Qualifying later in the day.

TEAM REPRESENTATIVES Tim GOSS (Racing Bulls), Frédéric VASSEUR (Ferrari), Andrea STELLA (McLaren)

Q: Andrea, why don't we start with you? It's not a home race for McLaren, but it is a home race for you. You must have great memories of Emilia, and I'm thinking of battles when you were at Ferrari between Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso. Just tell us how special this one is for you.

Andrea STELLA: Oh yeah, definitely a special venue. I work in Formula 1, but I also have quite a lot of passion for Formula 1, and Imola resonates with this passion. Let me say, first of all, from a circuit point of view – the layout, the fast, flowing and narrow track – you don't find many like it. Suzuka is another one. Quite unforgiving; as soon as you make a mistake, it can be quite penalising. The going up and downhill. I think it's great for the drivers, it's great for the fans, and we do hope that this venue will stay as part of the calendar for the future because this would be fantastic for Formula 1. You talked about memories, and you mentioned the battles with Fernando Alonso. Yes, they were very interesting and, interestingly, they were opposite sides in 2005 and 2006. So, it goes back in the years, but I would like to take this opportunity – especially for the younger fans – to go and take a look at those two races, 2005 and 2006, because that was, I think in both cases, one of the closest races we have had in dry conditions. For me, a couple of additional memories – 2003, this Imola, I'm particularly attached to that race, because it was the season changer in the championship with Michael Schumacher. After a difficult start, we won here in Imola. I do remember that weekend very well, like it was yesterday, and then the season changed after that success. The final one is the winter testing of 2004. At the time, you could still take two cars of different seasons, and we had the 2003 and 2004 cars here in Imola, and they were going around at the same time – one driven by Michael and one driven by Rubens – and we realised that we had a super car in hand for 2004 because the lap time and the consistency of that car was great. So, a lot attached to this circuit, definitely from me. I would like to take advantage, if you allow me – and hopefully I'm not abusing all my time – as we talked about memories, to pay tribute to Fabrizio Borra. Fabrizio, I got to know him as Fernando Alonso's physio in 2010. Since then, we have shared a journey in Formula 1. He has always been, since then, a great friend to me. Fabrizio was a person of dedication and generosity – a person that applied this dedication and generosity to the people, but also to the subject that he was the expert on. For me, I remember all the chats with Fabrizio – I learned a lot from him. He has been not only the physio and the reference for Fernando Alonso but also Gianmarco Tamberi, a gold medallist in high jump, and Marco Pantani in cycling – just to say the versatility of this individual. So, it's a big, big loss. We are all very sad. All our thoughts are with the family, and definitely I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to pay tribute to Fabrizio.

Q: Thank you for those kind words. Quick performance question now. You talked about a supercar in the 2004 Ferrari. Clearly the 2025 McLaren can be talked about in a similar vein. Talk to us about Miami and the dominance you had there. Do you understand why you were so far ahead?

AS: Talking about Miami, I think we are understanding the strengths of the MCL39, which overall is a competitive car, but in some conditions it seems to have a certain advantage over the rest of the field. These conditions materialised very well in Miami with the track layout, the speed range, the ambient temperatures. But we know very well that in some other kinds of circuits like Saudi or Japan, it's a different story. Everything gets quite a lot tighter. So, hopefully we will be able to retain this characteristic and this advantage over the course of the season. But I think this will require the car to be developed, to be upgraded, because we see that no one is waiting, no one is standing still. We see upgrades being brought trackside by our competitors. We do plan to upgrade the MCL39 and try and, if anything, possibly make the car even more suitable for a wider range of conditions and cornering speed.

Q: Final one from me: Oscar Piastri was sitting where you are yesterday. He talked about marginal gains and the improvements he's made since last year. He said he's looked in every column of performance but gave no more specifics than that. Where have you seen Oscar improve?

AS: Well, I think the most important improvement, if anything, is that Oscar has become a faster driver. I think when you are a faster driver then you have more opportunity, more time to process, more bandwidth to process things. And this is true when you are in the car, and this is also true when you are outside the car. Because the speed is there – let's process all the other marginal gains that will then then, at the end of the weekend, constitute the performance that you need to have the kind of results that he's having at the moment. In addition to that, over the winter, there's been a very specific amount of work that has gone – has paid attention to different areas. It's been quite holistic. While Oscar is definitely the main one to praise for these developments, I would like to mention the team around Oscar – his engineers and all the support from the factory with all the analysis – and even the team, Mark Webber, that works with Oscar. He's definitely a great source of thoughts, insight and identification of opportunities. So, there's quite a lot of work behind this progress. But ultimately, hats off to Oscar who has been able to capitalise.

Q: Fred, let's come to you next. Definitely a home race for Ferrari. Can we start with that? How much of a shot in the arm is it for the team just to see the tifosi in their thousands?

Frédéric VASSEUR: Yeah, but it's always a special one. A bit like Monza. This one is different because it's even closer to the factory. A lot of people of the team live in Bologna or even closer to the track, and this is a special place for sure. But at the end of the day, we have to approach the race in the same way as the others and try to do the best job that we can. It's perhaps an extra pressure, but we have to take this as a positive – as a push more than something else. And to see all the fans and the tifosi in the grandstands is, for sure, an extra motivation.

Q: Has Lewis commented about it? Is he feeding off the support?

FV: Yeah. Even this week, you know, from the factory – from Monday onwards – we had people outside the factory in front of the gate. This is a huge push for the drivers also. They were there in the morning when the drivers arrived, and they were there waiting until the evening. That means... I want to take it – and I think the driver is doing the same – to take it as extra motivation and a good push.

Q: Let's talk performance now. You said yesterday that there have been occasions this year where you've left the Grand Prix feeling you haven't extracted the maximum from the car. Just how much potential does it have and why is it proving so difficult to get that performance?

FV: I think except McLaren, who are flying, we are all in the same situation – sometimes we are in a more or less good shape, and sometimes not. If you have a look at our performance, I think in Jeddah in the race we were in a very strong position – we did a very strong race – and in Miami, it was not the case at all. It means we have to understand this and make better usage of the car and the tyres if we want to be more consistent and try to catch up a little bit with McLaren.

Q: You mentioned Miami. It was a frustrating race for the team on many levels. You've had a bit of distance from it now. Let's start with the radio traffic. What lessons were learned about that?

FV: We don't have to learn something. I took a decision – I think it was a good one – and then we explained the decision to the drivers. We checked the end and the chapter was closed. The chapter is still open for you, but not for me.

Q: Alright, well, let's throw it forward to Monaco. Charles dominated that race last year. How much confidence do you go to the principality with next week?

FV: It's not a matter of being confident when you go somewhere, it's a matter of doing a good job and to prepare very well the event. We know that Monaco is a one-off, a special one. But the situation is a bit different compared to last year. We have to do the best for Monaco, but exactly the same way we're trying to do the best in Imola. Everybody will push for Monaco – not because it's a special one that we have to do more or better. We are all trying to push at every single event of the season. For Charles, it's a bit different because he's at home. But I think now 85% of the drivers are at home in Monaco. It's not anymore the case of the past. But for Charles, it's a special one – for sure it is – but we don't have to pay too much attention to this. We just have to prepare the event in the best way.

Q: Tim, let's come to you now. Welcome to the FIA press conference. Nice to be back at a team having done a stint at the FIA?

Tim GOSS: Thank you very much. Yeah... No, no, don't laugh, Fred! My time at the FIA was fantastic, to be honest. You know, it was a real pleasure and an honour actually to be helping, with the teams, to run the sport, as well as shaping the future of the sport. And it's a fantastic place to be. You get to learn a lot of what's going on. You feel that you're giving a lot back in terms of the direction of the sport. But you miss the passion and the competitiveness, and ultimately that draws you back into a team. There's nothing that beats being there – designing, developing a car, competing, building a team and an organisation that can work across disciplines, across locations in our case. So, no – ultimately, it's the excitement and the passion. When the red lights go out, there's something that you're invested in, as opposed to just watching.

Q: You use the word competitiveness. This year's car is clearly a very good one. How much potential do you think it has?

TG: Certainly, we learned a lot from last year's upgrades – what worked and what didn't – learned a lot about how we worked together, how we made those choices, what characteristics were important, and we went about the 2025 car in a slightly different way. We also recognised during 2024 that our race pace wasn't good enough. We were qualifying well but spent our races defending rather than consolidating our position. We built on those learnings over the winter and concentrated on providing a car that not only had load improvement but had a platform the race engineers could access more effectively – in terms of set-up and controllability from the car – and that allowed the drivers to get more out of the operating envelope. That in itself is not news to any Formula 1 team, but you have to try to get the balance of getting those characteristics right against ultimate load. I think we learned a lot out of 2024 and early 2025 and reaped the rewards with this car.

Q: Quick one on Isack Hadjar. You've worked with many drivers in your career. How impressed are you by what he's done so far this year?

TG: Yeah, very impressed. We've got two very young drivers – two rookies. Clearly, they're very capable coming out of Formula 2, but they have a lot to learn – both in terms of the practicalities of going racing and how to get the most out of these cars. You don't just go and drive them. You have to manage out-laps in terms of preparing the car, the tyres. You have to manage tyres during a race.
I'd like to say we're experts at training rookies, but essentially that's one of our roles here in the Red Bull family. We take a lot of care in trying to get it right and put a lot of effort into it. Isaac has really impressed us. Right from the start, he's picked up things quickly. He's been on the case from the start. And he's been quick. Put him up against Yuki, who at the beginning of the season was really on it – had a really good winter, was focused, driving particularly well, which is obviously why he got the call-up, and Isack was there with him right from the start. So, very impressed.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Ian Parkes – Racing News 365) Question for you, Andrea. Since McLaren pushed its way to the front, started winning races, won the Constructors' Championship last year, various rivals have made claims against the team as to why the performance is so strong – wing flexing, water cooling of the tyres, for example. But you've always been cleared. Do you draw any satisfaction from the fact that those rivals have yet to unlock the secrets of this year's McLaren?

AS: Let's say I would like to adapt the angle of your question in trying to answer on this topic, which can be answered in different ways. For us, it's good news when our rivals get their focus – rather than on themselves – onto some of the aspects that allegedly are present in our car, and that effectively are not even present. And certainly, even if they were – let's say, flexi-wings like a front wing deflection, like everyone else – it has nothing to do with the reason why McLaren is very competitive. So, I hope that in the future there will be more of these kinds of sagas because it means that our rivals keep focusing on the wrong things, and this is, for us, just good news. It's just helping our quest.

Q: (Diletta Colobo – Automoto.it) A question for the three of you. What do you think of Carlos Sainz Senior's potential bid for the FIA presidency?

FV: I have huge respect for Carlos Senior – and Carlos Junior also – but Carlos Senior, I worked with him a couple of times in my life. But then I don't want to enter into any position – it's not my job to take a position on the election. I have due respect for him, but it's another matter.

AS: To be honest, I don't have much to comment. I think it's a matter that has a lot of subtleties. What's important for me is that we have a good process, and that this will lead to the best interests of the FIA and F1. It's very, very important that we have proper governance and great leadership from the institution that leads this sport.

TG: Yeah, from my side – I mean obviously I've got recent experience at the FIA. Everything I was involved with was mainly outside of the presidential activities and the Senate. What I can say is that from my experience there, the governance side of it under Nicolas and Tim Malyon in Sporting, and François Sicard and now Yann [Monchaux] replacing me… that's a great team. And it is a very difficult job, but they do a really fantastic job of it. Not just going on their own – sometimes you actually have to force things through – but most of the time we tried to work very collaboratively with the teams. But on Carlos Sainz, I'm afraid I don't know him particularly well, so I can't really comment.

Q: (Umberto Zapelloni – Gazetta dello Sport) Question for Andrea Stella. Andrea, is there a moment in which you will give a team order to Oscar and Lando, or will they always be free to fight each other?

AS: The matter of the internal competition between our two drivers is a matter that we face using our racing principles and approach. These principles have been put together not only by the team itself, but also with the contribution of the drivers. It's very much based on several good conversations we've had as we've been going through this journey together. These principles and this approach – which I'm not going to disclose, just for a matter of protecting our IP – so far have worked very well. They would not be working so well if we didn't have two drivers like Oscar and Lando who, not only are they very fast on track, but they're also two great individuals. I've seen this several times. I see it in the way they race. There may be situations in which we are challenged as a team, in which the internal competition gets very tight. We might have to give some direction from the pit wall. And actually, internally we don't even say “if,” we say “when,” because the business is so complex – Formula 1 is so difficult – that you will have this situation. But for me, what's important is that we stick with these principles and this approach, and that we react as a team in the most constructive way – something that, having Lando and Oscar on board, makes me quite confident will be the case.

Q: (Leovid Kliuev – GrandePrêmio.com.br) Question for Andrea. McLaren has a good chance of winning both championships this year, but how do you plan to manage the performance as others – probably yourself too – will switch more and more to the 2026 car?

AS: I think the way we are managing this – to be honest, I don't expect it to be very different from what's happening in the other nine teams. We are still definitely keeping interest and momentum on this year's car because, like I said before, we are not giving anything for granted. We need to improve the car, especially in some conditions, and we are planning to do so with some upgrades.
At the same time, there's so much to do on the 2026 car that, pretty much from the second of January, we were working on the 2026 car. At the moment, we've been trying to use the resources we have in the most logical and efficient way. At some stage, we will shift our focus entirely to 2026. But definitely, even if the championships are in a good position, we have not given up attention on this year's car.

Q: (Carlo Platella – FormulaPassion.it) Andrea, you remembered the 2004 test when you realised how big the step forward was compared to the previous year. Did you have a similar feeling this year in any particular situation?

AS: You know, we need to go back to 2004. That car won 12 of the first 13 races with Michael, and the only one we lost was because Michael crashed with Montoya under the tunnel in Monaco, while Montoya was actually one lap down during a safety car. Otherwise, likely we would have won 13 out of 13. That's a reference that I actually often use even to motivate myself – like, that's where we want to be. But I don't think this will happen this year. So, there is hard work ahead of us to make sure this happens in the years to come. I think we are a few steps behind compared to those kinds of references.

Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Andrea, another one for you – Tim or Fred if you want to chip in by all means. Monaco is going to mandatory two stops from next week. How much extra effort has had to go into preparations for that? How much of a change do you think it's actually going to make on the race, and how many curveballs do you think it could provide for the field?

AS: In fairness, you approach it in the same way, with the same tools, with the same kind of thought process compared to how you would approach an event. Let's say simply, you just have more constraints, so you have to make some adaptations in terms of how you approach this. But in itself, I think it's interesting. After the race we had last year, a little bit of change is an interesting aspect. So, I welcome these kinds of changes. Actually, I think it will be trickier in wet conditions. So, for dry conditions, I think it's just interesting. For wet, it could create some situations that may be a little awkward. But we look forward to it and, like I say, I welcome the change.

TG: Yeah, I'd probably echo that. It's going to change things, but we just work through it with our normal strategy tools. For us, it's just another constraint. Hopefully, the main purpose of it is to make the race more exciting. What we don't want is one-stops and processions. And I welcome the effort that went into it. There were lots and lots of things that were suggested. We've been talking about it for many, many years, and I think really, if it does work out as a success, then congratulations to the teams, the FIA and Formula 1 that worked together to come up with the package and the idea.

Q: (Jon Noble – The Race) To Andrea – on the advantage your team's got in terms of managing tyre temperatures. There seems to be a kind of obsession with people finding a magic bullet solution, but would it be fair to say there are lots of elements that combine on this – downforce, suspension kinematics, all that sort of thing? And if that is the case, does that mean it will take your rivals quite a while to catch up because they've got to deal with many, many aspects?

AS: I would like to give the wrong answer here so that I put all our rivals down the wrong route. The only thing I can say is that for me, over the years in Formula 1, I've learned that you have to focus on yourself and focus on the fundamentals. I think when you get too distracted by what the others are doing, it's normally an alarm bell that you ring in your factory and should remind you to go back to the basics. So, I'm afraid I've given the right answer, so I've helped now my competitors. But you know, I'm intellectually honest, so I can't really give the wrong answer tactically.

Q: (Adam Cooper – Adamcooperf1.com) For all three of you – on the Monaco tyre rule again. If it works, would you like to see it introduced at other circuits in the future? Maybe a bit like a ‘joker', maybe six times a year, like we have six sprint races? Or is it purely a one-off for that track?

FV: So far, it's a one-off. On the other hand, I didn't feel that last year the race was not exciting. For me, it was a good one. Let's see after Monaco, because strategy in Monaco is very difficult – it's also driven by the Safety Car. So, it will be two times more difficult for this. The downside could be also that if you have an early Safety Car, I think everybody will jump into the pit lane, and the pit lane is very narrow – it can be an issue. But let's do Monaco like this. I think we were clever enough to do the experimentation, and we'll see after Monaco what we can do and where we can improve the situation.

TG: I think the important thing here is to keep it on the cusp of a two-stop. What we want is varied strategies. As soon as you force it and everyone's doing a two-stop, then it's going to take away a lot of excitement. Some of the best races we've had are where someone is hanging out on a one-stop, someone else goes for the two-stop and is reeling them in over the final 15 laps – at a second a lap or more – and then their tyre deg goes, and you get to the final 2-3 laps with two cars going head-to-head for the win. So, I think if you force it on the two-stop, it's not going to work.

Q: (Giles Richards – The Guardian) This question is for Fred. Fred, I've just been out in the fan zone talking to Ferrari fans, all of whom are terribly excited about seeing Lewis for the first time in a Ferrari. You mentioned the pressure. I'm just wondering – there's the enthusiasm and a huge amount of expectation for the first time seeing him in a home race. Is this something he's thriving on? Is he aware of it? Is it something that he's enjoying? I mean, you say you treat it like any other race, but it's quite hard to do that I would have thought.

FV: For sure, we want to have the same approach this weekend as any other one because the motivation is always the same. But we can also see – even from the garage or from the factory – the tifosi in front of us, and the fact that they are all mega motivated, committed on Formula 1 and the project. And they can be sure that we will push until the end to get the best, to do the best. We are all convinced of this. It's not absolutely an issue. I think Andrea was in the same position in the past. You can feel it from – I told you before – from the factory the week before, you already have a lot of people around the factory. It was like this all week. It was like this yesterday in the fan forum, as you said. Let's take it as extra motivation and the positive side of this. And my personal feeling on Lewis' position today is that he's taking it as a huge opportunity – I don't want to say a dream – but it's a huge opportunity if you think about this: to race in front of this enthusiasm and honesty. We are all taking it like this.

Max Verstappen has described his first time driving on the Nurburgring Nordschleife as ""fantastic"", with the four-time Formula 1 World Champion confirming rumours that he broke the GT3 lap record during sessions last week.

Verstappen competed in an official Nurburgring Endurance Series test at the wheel of Emil Frey Racing's Ferrari 296 GT3 machine while using the pseudonym of 'Franz Hermann' in order to go under the radar.

The Dutchman was there in support of his protégé, 22-year-old racer Thierry Vermeulen, as reports circulated that Verstappen had broken the circuit's 7m 49.578s GT3 lap record, set by Norwegian Christian Krognes.

Verstappen told the press of his Nordschleife outing during media day at Imola

""It was, yeah,"" confirmed Verstappen, when asked whether his lap was faster than that record ahead of the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix this weekend. ""But for me I'm not there to show that I can break a lap record or whatever record, I was just having fun and learning the track.""

The Nordschleife, also known as the 'Green Hell', hosted Formula 1 events throughout the 1950s and 1960s, with the last edition taking place in 1976 following Niki Lauda's fiery crash, which nearly claimed the three-time World Champion's life, before a shorter layout was constructed and used for the first time in 1984.

While Verstappen, who sits third in this year's F1 Drivers' standings after six races, had never driven around the notorious 14-mile circuit, he was no stranger to the venue, having sampled it numerous times courtesy of his sim racing hobby.

""I've never driven there in real life, not even with a road car,"" he said. ""Of course, I did spend a lot of time on the simulator doing thousands of laps, so that helped.

""When I got out there a few barriers were different, maybe a few kerbs were a little bit different, but I know the track layout well. It's just getting used to the grip level of the car, the conditions, the new tarmac in places.

""At the same time I was there with my sim driver that now turned into a real driver. Even for him also to get up to speed there, because eventually we all want to do that race as a team. It was a very good day, we got lucky with the weather as well – it was nice and sunny. It was fantastic!""

While falling short of committing to racing at the track in the future, Verstappen would in any case need to secure a DMSB (Deutscher Motor Sport Bund) Permit, which either requires him to compete in several categories to reach the GT3 level or be given special dispensation.

Oscar Piastri has topped the timesheets during the first practice hour ahead of the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, the championship leader setting the pace ahead of McLaren team mate Lando Norris and the Williams of Carlos Sainz.

Several cars started to peel out onto the track as the session got underway in dry and sunny conditions at 1330 local time, with a returning name amongst these as Franco Colapinto headed out in the Alpine, the Argentinian having been brought in to replace Jack Doohan for the next five races.

PADDOCK INSIDER: Colapinto's back in F1 action with Alpine – and the Argentinian racer means business

While Colapinto had bolted on the medium C5 tyres for his initial runs, the majority of the field opted for the softs on a weekend that marks the debut appearance in 2025 of the C6 compound. Amongst those running the soft rubber was Charles Leclerc, the Monegasque back in action after missing Thursday's media activities due to feeling unwell.

There was an early incident for Leclerc when the Ferrari driver found himself in the way of Fernando Alonso, leading to the Aston Martin man – who took victory at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari 20 years ago – reporting that he “nearly crashed” with the SF-25.

Practice 1 results

The drama wasn't over there for Leclerc, who soon found himself dipping a wheel in the gravel at Turn 15 after a bit of a moment through Turn 14. Norris, meanwhile, had set the early pace during the first quarter of the session, the McLaren man leading the way on a 1m 17.125s.

As the track continued to evolve and the times quickly tumbled, George Russell had gone quickest by the halfway point with his effort of 1m 16.599s, the Mercedes driver heading the timesheets from Sainz and home favourite Kimi Antonelli.

Meanwhile there was an unusual problem for Leclerc, who stated that “helmet lift is horrible” as he struggled with his lid, while team mate Lewis Hamilton looked to be fighting with the Ferrari, the Briton reporting that the car did not want to slow down.

With most of the field completing soft-shod runs as the session progressed, the McLaren pair of Piastri and Norris had moved themselves to the top of the order in a 1-2 formation ahead of Russell on an increasingly busy track.

Many looked to be pushing hard in the closing stages, with Alex Albon having some dramatic moments as his Williams bounced over the kerbs and took a brief trip through the gravel on a weekend where the squad will be hoping to continue their recent good run of form. There was also a slide for Max Verstappen, the Dutchman appearing frustrated at the wheel of the Red Bull.

More drama was to come in the dying minutes of FP1 as Gabriel Bortoleto crashed out of the session, the Kick Sauber driver running over the kerbs before hitting the barriers at Turn 18 to bring out the red flags.

The incident brought an early finish to everybody's running, with Piastri remaining on top thanks to his effort of 1m 16.545s to go just 0.032s clear of Norris in second. Sainz and Russell were close behind in third and fourth respectively, the top four separated by less than six-hundredths of a second.

Hamilton took fifth after a seemingly tricky session for Ferrari, while Alpine's Pierre Gasly, Verstappen, Albon, Bortoleto and the other Kick Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg rounded out the top 10.

Lance Stroll claimed P11 for Aston Martin, ahead of Leclerc, Antonelli, Alonso and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson. Tsunoda, meanwhile, slotted into P16, with Colapinto in P17 while the Haas pair of Ollie Bearman and Esteban Ocon were 18th and 20th respectively, the duo separated by Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar.

The drivers and teams will now regroup in the paddock to examine their data and prepare for Friday's second Free Practice session, which is due to get underway at 1700 local time.

The opening practice session for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix came to an abrupt halt with just over two minutes remaining following a crash for Gabriel Bortoleto.

The Kick Sauber driver suffered a snap of oversteer through the final corner, which sent the young Brazilian into the gravel before colliding with the barrier.

	OK maybe it's not so bad; showrunner Sascha Penn says this was “always” his “intention.”

	











	“It was always my intention that Raising Kanan would run for five seasons, and thanks to my friends and partners at Starz and Lionsgate, as well as the incredible cast, crew and writing staff, I've been able to tell the entirety of the story I set out to tell way back in 2019,” Penn said. “Having said that, with the table we've set in this season finale and the inevitable introduction of Breeze, there is still an exceptionally intense and action-packed season left for the viewers to experience, and I assure you that the stakes for Kanan and the entire Thomas family have never been higher.”


	“I'm very proud of this series,” he continued, “and grateful that we've been able to see it through to what is an incredibly explosive and satisfying conclusion for the unbelievably loyal fans of the Power Universe.”


	Moore is pretty excited for it too.


	“The Power Universe fans have been patiently anticipating this moment and I'm honored to step into the iconic role of Breeze,” he said in a statement. “I jumped into a story that is already alive with such strong characters, but it was a fun challenge to find Breeze's unique identity, and I can't wait for fans to see how Breeze will shift dynamics in the story. It's gonna be a wild ride.”


	The name of Moore's character, a drug kingpin from Jamaica, Queens, has been out there in said Power universe since the very first season of the OG Power back in 2014. We learned back then that a young Kanan Stark worked for the mysterious Breeze, as did James “Ghost” St. Patrick (Omari Hardwick) and Tommy Egan (Joseph Sikora). Well, in the season four finale of prequel series Raising Kanan, our young Kanan (MeKai Curtis) finally meets Breeze through street legends (and Kanan's aunt and uncle) Snaps (Wendell Pierce) and Pop (Erika Woods).

	











	Season four of Raising Kanan found Kanan reluctantly entering into a truce with his mother, drug queenpin Raquel “Raq” Thomas (Patina Miller). (Miller and Penn spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the shocking season four ending and what it means for season five.)


	“With Unique (Joey Bada$$) back from the dead and pulling strings from the shadows, the hesitant trust between mother and son didn't last long, and their volatile relationship was tested once again, leading to another dramatic showdown in the season finale,” in Starz's words.


	In addition to Miller, Curtis, Bada$$, Pierce and Woods, Power Book III: Raising Kanan stars London Brown, Malcolm Mays, Hailey Kilgore and Tony Danza. 


Power Book III: Raising Kanan is the second Power spinoff, behind only Power Book II: Ghost. Courtney A. Kemp created the original Power with Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson and Mark Canton. Along with those three, Chris Selak and Kevin Fox also serve as executive producers on the franchise. Lionsgate Television produces Power Book III: Raising Kanan for Starz.

The controversial singer was ordered to be held until his next hearing on June 13, the same day he's set to take the stage in Frankfurt, Germany, on the third date of his world tour.


							By 

	The Associated Press



	Grammy-winning singer Chris Brown ‘s upcoming tour was thrown into question Friday as a British judge ordered him held in custody while facing allegations that he beat a music producer with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023.


	Brown, 36, appeared in Manchester Magistrates' Court to face one count of causing grievous bodily harm and was ordered held until his next hearing June 13 in London — the same day he's due to take the stage in Frankfurt, Germany, on the third date of his world tour.




	Judge Joanne Hirst rejected Brown's bail request after prosecutor Hannah Nicholls said that the crime was “extremely serious.”

	Brown was on tour in the U.K. in February 2023 when he launched an unprovoked attack on producer Abe Diaw, striking him several times with a bottle at the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in London, Nicholls said. Brown then chased Diaw and punched and kicked him in an attack caught on surveillance camera in front of a club full of people, she said.

	Defense attorney Grace Forbes argued that the American performer wasn't a flight risk and should be released.


	Brown was flanked by court officers in the dock. His hair was bleached blonde and he wore sweatpants and a black T-shirt. He confirmed his name and birth date, and said that his address was the local Lowry Hotel, where he was arrested early Thursday and taken into custody.


	His case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court in London, where he is expected to enter a plea to the charge.


	Brown's representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.


	Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as “Run It,” “Kiss Kiss” and “Without You.”


	He won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for “F.A.M.E.” and then earned his second gold trophy in the same category for “11:11 (Deluxe)” earlier this year.


	The singer is due to launch an international tour next month with artists Jhene Aiko, Summer Walker and Bryson Tiller, opening with a European leg on June 8 in Amsterdam before starting North America shows in July.

Charlie Polinger's directorial debut, also featuring Everett Blunck and newcomer Kayo Martin, observes a young boy trying to fit in at a summer water polo camp. 


							By 

	Lovia Gyarkye


Arts & Culture Critic


Charlie Polinger opens his thrilling and uneasy directorial debut feature The Plague with an arresting sequence that quickly establishes the haunting undertones of this adolescent psychological thriller. The ambient, muffled sound of sloshing water is set against a shot of the bottom of a pool. One by one, swimmers drop into the massive indoor basin. Their spindly legs move awkwardly as they try to get in sync. It's 2003, and these are the middle-school-aged attendees of the Tom Lerner Water Polo camp. From this angle, Polinger and his cinematographer Steven Breckon make these kids look like phantasmic figures.

	An eerie sense of unreality runs through The Plague, which premiered at Cannes in the Un Certain Regard sidebar. Working from a screenplay he also wrote, Polinger uses horror conventions to tease out the psychic terror and intimidation of pre-teen social codes. In the age of renewed questions about and considerations of the manosphere, The Plague is a prescient title. Polinger's film is not as dark as Netflix's popular miniseries Adolescence, but it does circle similarly unsettling themes — like the way the terms and tenets of masculinity are dictated by arbitrary rules, or the cost of nonconformity among young men.

The Bottom Line

	
	A haunting story of boyhood as nightmare.
	



Venue: Cannes Film Festival (Un Certain Regard)Cast: Joel Edgerton, Everett Blunck, Kayo Martin, Kenny RasmussenDirector-screenwriter: Charlie Polinger

								1 hour 38 minutes			






	Key performances carry The Plague and alleviate the occasional strain of overwrought direction. Relative newcomers Everett Blunck (stellar in Griffin in the Summer) and Kayo Martin portray opposite ends of youthful angst with an engaging sincerity and terrifying accuracy. Martin, with the subtlety of his judging expressions, seems especially made for his role as Jake, the resident cool kid who weaponizes his sharp attention to detail. The actor plays well against Blunck, who portrays Ben, a new camper trying to figure out where he fits among the various cliques. An anxiety-inducing sound design (by Damian Volpe) and score (by Johan Lenox), coupled with an appropriately icy visual palette built on grays and blue, help tell Polinger's nail-biting story. 


	When Ben (Blunck) arrives at the water polo camp, he quickly notices the hold that Jake (Martin) has on the other boys. The teen with the mess of blonde hair functions as a ring leader and, with his approval, Ben becomes part of the crew. The other boys call Ben, who just moved from Boston, “Soppy” on account of the fact that he garbles the “t” in the word “stop.” One thing Polinger makes clear early on is how closely Jake scrutinizes the other boys — noticing minor characteristics that differentiate them from one another — and uses those observations to mock them. This skill keeps Jake in power, making him an intimidating person to everyone, including the boys' coach Daddy Wags (Joel Edgerton, in a brief but effective turn).

	











	Ben watches the others too, and he quickly picks up that no one hangs out with Eli (Kenny Rasmussen, also excellent). The quiet child keeps mostly to himself, eating lunch in the locker room and occasionally sleeping there too. According to the other kids, Eli has the plague, a vague disease that allegedly begins with a rash and renders the infected unable to socially function. Jake warns Ben to stay away from Eli and to wash his body should he accidentally get too close. In a clever move, Polinger never establishes if the plague is real because even if it isn't, the fear it sows is. 


	The remainder of The Plague follows Ben as he tries to reconcile social acceptance with his own moral code. He understands that people shouldn't be exiled for their differences and yet the idea of losing his place within the hierarchy keeps him up at night. Blunck deftly portrays Ben's inner turmoil and the anxiety his journey produces. 


	Polinger deploys jump scares, intimate close-ups (especially of Jake and Ben staring at one another) and elements of body horror to recast these coming-of-age dilemmas as high-stakes, nightmarish challenges. When the director widens his scope, to survey the broader social behaviors on display, The Plague adopts a primal urgency and the film possesses the feverish energy of William Golding's Lord of the Flies or Claire Denis' Beau Travail. In one of those scenes Polinger observes the boys during lunch, excitedly speaking over each other and laughing. The camera ominously cuts (editing is by Henry Hayes) between views of the group and the faces of individual campers. For the most part, they are children having a good time, but if you look closely you can see a flash of panic beneath the cheerful visages.

After reuniting with his K-pop boy band GOT7 earlier this year, the LA singer-songwriter-model returns to his solo music career with the Far East Movement–founded company.

	Jeff Benjamin



With a new single already announced for the end of the month, Mark Tuan embarks on a fresh chapter by signing a new management deal ahead of a new, “raw and intimate” era.


Billboard can exclusively reveal that the Los Angeles singer-songwriter-model is teaming up with with Transparent Arts for his music career and other projects. Mark will release his new single “High as You” on May 30, to start the joint venture with the Asian American entertainment powerhouse. According to a press release, the new, alt-rock track “captures the essence of an unforgettable love — the only high he ever knew. With seductive melodies and striking choreography, Mark is ready to showcase a raw and intimate side of himself like never before.”

	After reuniting with his K-pop boy band GOT7 for a new EP earlier this year, “High as You” is Tuan's first solo release of 2025 and previews more music on the way.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I'm thrilled to partner with Transparent Arts and to step into a new phase of my journey as an artist,” Mark says in a statement. “‘High As You' is just the beginning, and I'm looking forward to sharing more of this side of me with my fans.”


James Roh, COO of Transparent Arts, adds, “We're thrilled to welcome Mark to our roster. As a fellow LA native, we felt an instant connection with him. He brings a rare blend of professionalism, talent, and authentic kindness. Working with Mark has been creatively fulfilling, and we can't wait for the world to hear what we've been working on.”


	After GOT7 opted not to renew its contract with JYP Entertainment in 2021, Tuan returned to LA to launch his solo career via the independent label Dreamers N Achievers (DNA), which he acts as CEO. The 31-year-old has balanced his indie projects like 2022 full-length, The Other Side, and his Fallin' EP, from 2023, with GOT7 activities and fashion collaborations including an ambassadorship with Saint Laurent and partnership with Calvin Klein.


	Founded by Billboard Hot 100 chart-toppers Far East Movement, Transparent Arts is a 360-degree entertainment company dedicated to amplifying Asian culture and talent worldwide through management, production, branding, and live events. Tuan joins a roster that currently includes Korean indie breakthrough band The Rose, Filipino superstar singer-actor James Reid, LA-based DJ and producer Yultron and more. Through over 15 years in the business, TA collaborators include artists like Bruno Mars, Marshmello, and Awkwafina, with Universal Music, YouTube, McDonald's, and SM Entertainment listed as brand partners.


	Earlier this year, Mark teamed up with his GOT7 band mates to drop its first project in nearly three years, Winter Heptagon, through a new partnership with Kakao Entertainment. The EP peaked at No. 16 on Billboard's World Albums chart, becoming the group's 20th entry. Meanwhile, lead single “Python” climbed to No. 4 on the World Digital Song Sales chart — GOT7's strongest showing since 2021. The group celebrated with concerts in Seoul's SK Olympic Handball Gymnasium arena and Bangkok's Rajamangala Stadium, reportedly selling out the 85,000 seats for the latter within a day.

The president has been mocking the superstar since she started sharing her political views in 2018.


													By
												

	Anna Chan



	Bad blood is still brewing. Donald Trump made yet another jab at superstar Taylor Swift in a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday (May 16).


	Eight months after he shared on the same social media platform that he hates the 14-time Grammy winner, the twice-impeached president posted, “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,' she's no longer ‘HOT?'”


Billboard has reached out to Swift's rep for comment.


	The insult seemingly came out of thin air, as Swift has not spoken about Trump since endorsing Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for president in September. Her support of President Joe Biden's vice president came after the business mogul shared an AI image of the “Anti-Hero” singer falsely endorsing him for a second term in office.


	“It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth,” the star wrote of the fake image at the time. “I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.” 

	











	Swift concluded that message — which was accompanied by a photo of her with her beloved cat Benjamin Button — by signing off as “Childless Cat Lady,” a dig at Vice President JD Vance's comments about Democrats who don't have kids.


	Five days after the superstar backed his opponent, Trump posted on Truth Social in all caps, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!”


	While they never had mad love for each other, Trump — who in May 2024 was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money case — did previously appreciate the singer-songwriter. In August 2012, he wrote on X (then Twitter) to thank the star for a photo, closing his message with “you are fantastic!” Months later in October, he congratulated her on landing the co-hosting gig announcing the Grammy nominations special, ending his tweet with “Taylor is terrific!”


	But once Swift began sharing her political leanings in 2018, when she urged the voters of Tennessee to vote against Republican Marsha Blackburn in the midterms, Trump's opinion of the star shifted. “Let's just say I like Taylor's music about 25% less now, OK?” he told reporters at the White House.

The Weeknd says Tom Cruise did him a solid with the actor's lip-sync performance of “Can't Feel My Face,” the singer says during his first-ever interview on The Tonight Show Thursday (May 15) in an exclusive Billboard preview clip.


	Host Jimmy Fallon told The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye) one of the first times his late-night talk show used one of his songs was in 2015 during a Lip Sync Battle segment featuring Cruise, who praised the singer as being “enormously talented” before launching into his performance of “Can't Feel My Face.” 

	











	“I definitely saw that. It actually helped the song,” said The Weeknd. “It helped it peak to the record-breaking top, thanks to him obviously.” “Can't Feel My Face,” the third single from his sophomore album Beauty Behind the Madness, became his first No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 a decade ago.

The Weeknd is promoting his upcoming feature film Hurry Up Tomorrow, based on his album of the same name, out in theaters on Friday.

The project follows the K-pop star's 2024 effort Happy.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



JIN of BTS has released his solo EP Echo (echo, echo, echo, echo …).


	On Friday (May 16), the K-pop star unveiled the project featuring seven tracks: “Don't Say You Love Me,” “Nothing Without Your Love,” “Loser” featuring YENA, “Rope It,” “With the Clouds,” “Background” and “To Me, Today.” JIN first announced the mini-album about a month prior to its release, with a statement describing Echo as offering the musician's “perspective on universal life experiences, capturing everyday emotions with warmth and sincerity.” 


	“Built on dynamic band sounds, the album showcases his versatile vocals across a spectrum of moods and styles,” the description continued at the time. “It reflects a deeper layer of vocal maturity and personal storytelling that underscores Jin's evolving artistry.”

	











Echo follows the November release of JIN's debut solo EP Happy, which reached No. 4 on the Billboard 200. The project featured single “Running Wild,” which marked JIN's second Billboard Hot 100 entry separate from his mega-famous boy band, following 2022's “The Astronaut”; the two tracks reached Nos. 53 and 51 on the chart, respectively.

	The new EP arrives about a year after JIN became the first member of BTS to be discharged from the South Korean military. After he completed his obligatory service in June, J-Hope finished in October.


	RM, Suga, V, Jimin and Jung Kook are still finishing out their commitments, but will be discharged in June. After spending the past two years or so focusing on solo projects, the seven members are expected to reunite soon.


	In the meantime, JIN will promote Echo a few days after its release by performing on The Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon! on Wednesday (May 21).

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: The movie business is on a much needed hot streak. How the momentum impacts two plum packages remains to be seen.


	One of them, the feature adaptation of the video game adaptation Split Fiction, has Wicked helmer Jon M. Chu attached to direct what will be another two-hander with female leads. Sydney Sweeney is one of them, and Paul Wernick & Rhett Reese are the writers. They are the scribes behind Deadpool & Wolverine, the Deadpool and Zombieland films. Not surprisingly after the smash results of the screen adaptation of the Minecraft video game, bids are high and a deal is getting close. I've heard bid numbers in the multiple millions from Sony and Amazon MGM Studios, with the latter in strong position to take it off the table, and it will likely be settled by early next week.

	











	More intriguing is Deeper. I've heard that Ana de Armas is poised to join Tom Cruise in this undersea supernatural film that Doug Liman will direct. De Armas is the new wrinkle here; they've been photographed together recently, and I'm told they are doing the diving training required for the project.  




			Watch on Deadline		







Deeper follows an astronaut who encounters a terrifying force while on a deep dive into a never-before-explored trench. Pic has been in development for almost a decade, originally set at MGM in April 2016, which bought a Max Landis spec. I've heard Christopher McQuarrie is involved with the script now. Originally, Bradley Cooper was to star, with Kornél Mundruczó directing; Idris Elba and filmmaker Baltasar Kormákur teamed on a later iteration that likewise failed to move forward.


	This one is expensive, in the $200 million range most likely, and it proved too rich for Warner Bros' blood. But Cruise crushed the Croisette this week with the final installment of Mission: Impossible The Final Reckoning, a film expected to do $70 million or more on its five-day opening weekend, hopefully on a blockbuster path. De Armas also has momentum, as her John Wick spinoff Ballerina is tracking at $40 million-plus.


	While he, Liman and McQuarrie have plans to shoot a narrative film in space with cooperation from NASA and SpaceX, I'm told Cruise would like to make Deeper next and it's not a question of if, but where he decides to make it. No comment from his camp.

EXCLUSIVE: Oscar winner and Captain Marvel actress Brie Larson (Room) is set to star in creature horror film Fail-Safe, with J.J. Abrams producing and FilmNation, WME and CAA launching the hot project at the Cannes market.


	JT Mollner (Strange Darling) is set to direct the movie, which is described as “a modern take on the creature horror film told from the perspective of a young boy who slowly begins to discover that his beloved parents are hiding a disturbing secret about his mother's true nature.”


	Brian Duffield (No One Will Save You), who is currently directing Whalefall for 20th Century and Imagine, wrote the screenplay based on a short story by Philip Fracassi.

Lost creator and Star Wars and Star Trek director Abrams said: “With Fail-Safe, Brian Duffield has written an absolute powerhouse of a script. It's a horror film that is as sweet and moving as it is terrifying. To have JT Mollner in the director's chair — his Strange Darling blew me away — is a dream come true. Finally, having the limitlessly talented Brie Larson as our star sets up Fail-Safe to be that rare horror film that makes you laugh, feel, and care, before taking you on an absolutely wild ride.”

	The movie heralds from FilmNation Entertainment's production label Infrared, J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions, and Assemble Media. Drew Simon, J.J. Abrams and Jon Cohen, and Jack Heller are producers. Assemble's Caitlin de Lisser-Ellen and Brian Duffield are executive-producing, as is Larson.


	Infrared is financing. Arrival, Conclave and Anora outfit FilmNation is handling international sales and will co-rep domestic rights with CAA Media Finance and WME Independent.


	“I'm beyond excited to see Brie take on this role – it's frightening, emotionally charged, and so different from anything she's done before,” said producer Drew Simon, Infrared President of Production. 


	“The depth and intensity this character demands is immense, and I know Brie's going to bring something unforgettable to the screen.” 


	Larson won the Oscar for 2016 movie Room. Past credits include the titular role in Captain Marvel which broke box office records, and its sequel, The Marvels, in addition to Fast X, Kong: Skull Island, and Short Term 12. In 2023, she executive-produced and starred in Apple TV+'s Lessons in Chemistry, earning Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice, and Golden Globe nominations. 

	











	Infrared's first feature Novocaine, a thriller directed by Robert Olsen and Dan Berk and starring Jack Quaid and Amber Midthunder, was released by Paramount in March. Mollner's 2023 horror-thriller Strange Darling amassed a cult following and some strong critical notices.


	Larson is repped by WME and Sloan Offer. Mollner is repped by UTA, World Builder Entertainment, and Jackoway Austen. Duffield is repped by UTA, Circle Management, and Behr Abramson.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Here's a very cool project bubbling at this year's Cannes market.


	We can reveal that Jacob Elordi and Lily-Rose Depp, two of the industry's buzziest young names, are set to star in Outer Dark, a film based on iconic author Cormac McCarthy's (No Country For Old Men) dark 1968 novel. 


	The “dark fairytale”, which is being lined up to shoot in 2026, will mark the English-language debut of Oscar-winning Son Of Saul filmmaker Laszlo Nemes.


Outer Dark is set in Appalachia during the Great Depression and tells of a young woman who bears her brother's baby. The brother leaves the nameless infant in the woods to die, but tells his sister that the newborn died of natural causes and had to be buried. The sister discovers this lie and sets out to find the baby for herself. But as both brother and sister separately move through the countryside, three terrifying strangers are on their tails, wreaking death and destruction wherever they appear.

	Nemes wrote the screenplay with Clara Royer, while Mike Goodridge of London-based Good Chaos is producing alongside Nemes; executive producers are Ilene Feldman, Ori Eisen of Original Films and Nicolas Gonda. Good Chaos and Nemes have the book-to-screen rights.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Goodridge, the Triangle Of Sadness co-producer who has Left-Handed Girl playing at this year's festival, is among the team on the ground in Cannes in early talks with potential partners for the project. It's not formally on sale here but there are likely to be plenty of suitors to finance or get behind it. 


	We understand the actors really sparked to the material and both are coming off big successes. It's fitting stuff for both: Depp is coming off Oscar-nominated box office hit Nosferatu, another dark fairytale, while Euphoria and Priscilla star Elordi is coming off excellent notices for The Narrow Road To The Deep North and will next be seen as the creature in Guillermo Del Toro's Frankenstein, as Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell's Wuthering Heights and in Ridley Scott's Dog Stars, which is in production.


	Laszlo Nemes said: “Since reading Outer Dark the first time, it has been my dream to make it into a film, and to find the appropriate cinematic language that would do justice to Cormac McCarthy's evocative and cosmological work. Joined by two magnetic actors, I now feel it's possible. The extraordinary source material is a profound inspiration to build a unique world that vibrates with life and death at the same time. An exciting road-movie, a terrible and beautiful journey into the labyrinth of the human soul – this is the ambition I have for Outer Dark.”

	











	Nemes recently completed his third film Orphan (also produced by Goodridge) which is scheduled to premiere at a festival later this year before its October 23 release in Hungary. He will next shoot Moulin, a French-language feature about WWII resistance fighter Jean Moulin which is being sold at the Cannes market by 193. Gilles Lellouche and Lars Eidinger are starring for producer Alain Goldman.


	Alongside Orphan, Goodridge is also in post-production on Edward Berger's next film, The Ballad Of A Small Player, starring Colin Farrell and Tilda Swinton.


	Cormac McCarthy's lauded novels adapted for the screen include Oscar winner No Country For Old Men and Viggo Mortensen starrer The Road.


	Elordi is repped by Gersh and Goodman, Genow. Depp is repped by CAA, Markham, Froggatt & Irwin, Agence Adequat, and Lichter, Grossman. Nemes is represented by CAA and Ilene Feldman Management.

EXCLUSIVE: As Bono premieres his Andrew Dominik-directed Apple docu Bono: Stories of Surrender on Friday, Deadline can reveal he's not the only rock icon making noise at the Cannes Film Festival. Also present on the Croisette in an underground capacity is the Red Hot Chili Peppers. A documentary on the band's formative years is being quietly shopped, with secret screenings by Submarine Entertainment.


	The fact that the surviving members of the band participated on camera in this documentary is surprising, since they've turned down many offers in the past. That might be because of the shrapnel and deaths from drug use. That dark side of the music business is part of their overall tapestry to go along with 120 million albums sold and membership in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

	More refreshing is the moment they transformed from L.A. misfits to genre defying music pioneers, first under the name Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. They had only one song they played at their very first show that they had written that same day called “Out in LA.” The crowd went crazy and the club promoter ran over afterwards and asked if they could come back the next week with two songs. They did just that and the band was officially launched. They demolished in their first appearances and quickly signed a seven-album deal.  




			Watch on Deadline		







	There are two invite-only rough-cut screenings for buyers and festival organizers, and the first was Wednesday. The second one is Sunday at 4:15 local time at the Olympia.


	The film centers on the deep childhood bond between Anthony Kiedis, Flea and original guitarist Hillel Slovak — charting their early experimentation, the band's unruly formation, and the sonic chaos that defined their first three albums. The film features exclusive new interviews with Kiedis, Flea, John Frusciante, Jack Irons and George Clinton, and others. It was that approach by director Ben Feldman that provoked the band to lean into this. The comp is Becoming Led Zeppelin.


	Submarine is screening the cut for select buyers in both New York and Los Angeles following the secret Cannes screenings. A festival premiere for the film will be planned for either fall 2025 or early 2026. Visions of the band in that outdoor street venue at Toronto makes one possible landing place for the pic.

	











	Submarine has scored deals in the past with Cannes sneaks of the docus Todd Miller's Apollo 11 and Todd Haynes' Velvet Underground. Pic is produced by Marc D'Agostino and Asta Entertainment in association with Polygram Entertainment. James Slovak is co-producer and Polygram's David Blackman is an executive producer along with Dan Braun and Josh Braun of Submarine, and the latter are representing world sales.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


(UPDATED with more details) On Cassie Ventura‘s likely last day as a witness in Sean “Diddy” Combs' sex-trafficking trial, the very pregnant singer was in a credibility vs. coercion standoff Friday with her ex-boyfriend's defense lawyers.


	“You always want to show me that you have the power and you knock me around”, the jury this morning heard Ventura read aloud a 2016 text she sent then boyfriend Combs after the Bad Boy Records founder brutally attacked her in an L.A. hotel hallway as the singer tried to escape one of the couple's now infamous drug-fueled “freak-offs.” The message continued: “I'm not a ragdoll I'm someone's child.”

	











	Captured in March 2016 on the InterContinental's security cameras and investigated by one of the hotel's guards at the time, the beating of Ventura by the half-naked Diddy has been widely seen in and out of court since it was obtained and broadcast by CNN last spring. Sitting with his defense team in Judge Arun Subramanian's lower Manhattan courtroom, a steely-eyed and fidgeting Combs Friday morning listened as the ‘Me & U' singer resumed her testimony under questioning from attorney Anna Estevao.


	On the stand answering questions about her own 2023 time at a rehab and trauma program in Arizona and receiving PTSD treatment, Ventura was also asked today by Estevao if she knew Diddy entered a rehab facility soon after the L.A. hotel incident nine years ago. The witness admitted she had a hard time recalling that step by Combs in any detail.


	The defense lawyer also wanted to know, as Ventura had said previously, she believed her now-ex had “blacked out” from substance abuse at the time of the hotel melee. “I believe he was intoxicated,” Ventura replied. She added “everybody's definition of blackout is different.”


	What was not different in anyone's definition was Ventura's declaration that Combs took or promised to take her passport, other ID and phone(s) when he was angry with her or thought she was cheating on him. To that, the court heard Combs reacted harshly when he suspected something was going on between Ventura and singer (and no stranger to controversary himself) Chris Brown and an unnamed NFL player. 


RELATED: Sean ‘Diddy' Combs Trial Testimony Gets Carnal & Violent As Paid Sex Partner Of Cassie Ventura Unveils What Went On Behind Closed Doors












	In the undeniably complicated and unorthodox relationship Ventura and Combs had from 2007-2018, such actions could prove a significant factor in proving the charges against the defendant and the lack of agency Ventura a.k.a. Victim-1 actually had.


	Emphasizing their client's drug abuse (which was spotlighted by revelations of a 2012 OD on Thursday) and Combs' short temper when under the influence, the defense team have tried to paint the couple's years together as two broken people out of control and feeding into each other's worst, most raw and most depraved wants. It is a portrait that the defense concedes is sad and perhaps pathetic but not a crime under the charges Combs in facing.


	However, a crying Ventura's vivid recollection in testimony on May 14 of being raped in 2018 by Diddy in her L.A. apartment after they broke up could prove a hard blow to the defense's narrative. Today,  Estevao probed Ventura for missteps and conflicting statements in her retelling of the alleged rape both in court and to law enforcement. 


	While that effort didn't really go much of anywhere, the defense lawyer herself introduced a new element when Estevao brought up Combs having bi-polar disorder. Seemingly never mentioned before, information was raised in the context of Combs acting “strangely” at the “closure” dinner he and Ventura were having in Malibu on the day the producer is said to have raped his then ex-girlfriend seven years ago.


Arrested on September 16 at an upscale NYC hotel lobby, the 55-year-old Combs is charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. The allegations in the initial and since amended indictment could see the Grammy-winning performer in prison for the rest of his life if he's found guilty. Up against dozens of civil suits claiming assault and abuse as well, Combs has denied all accusations, entered not guilty pleas, and exclaimed he is being persecuted for his unconventional but fully consensual sexual obsessions by a prudish government and gold diggers.


	With statements like the 2009 text “I'm always ready to freak-off,” from Ventura to Combs that was read out yesterday, the prosecution knows that on re-direct Friday it will have to make sure the Step-Up 2 actress puts the most glaring of the litany of correspondence in some context. Under a discussion with the judge before the jury was brought in, the prosecution pledged to have a speedy re-direct and conclude Ventura's testimony if the defense can get its cross-examination done by 4:30 p.m. ET at the latest.


	Irritated Friday by the defense's sometimes almost dithering approach to pulling up texts and other evidence, Judge Subramanian has made it crystal clear that he sees it as essential the about-to-give-birth-any-day Ventura is out of the witness box ASAP. The original desire was to have her testimony wrapped up before the 12:30 p.m. ET lunch break, but that plan has evidently been revised. The change of plan is in part due to protests by the defense. The lawyers say they have a lot to ask the star witness before they lose her permanently once she goes into the hospital for the birth of her and husband Alex Fine's third child.


	To punctuate how serious that timetable is, earlier today the feds sent a letter to the judge floating that Combs and his defense actually wanted Ventura to go into labor on the stand so they could use the flurry as pretext for a new mistrial motion. “The inefficiency of cross-examination yesterday raises the inference that the defendant hopes to accomplish precisely that outcome,” the document starkly declared. (Read the letter here).

	











	The importance of Ventura to the government's case cannot be overstated, which is one reason the jurors have been shown explicit and shocking otherwise sealed photographs of the baby oil and drug-drenched “freak-offs.”


	One can, as the Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey-led prosecution certainly does, draw a straight line between the currently incarcerated Combs in court now and the abuse and assault suit Ventura filed against him in November 2023. Still, while sticking to his line that he did nothing wrong, Combs did settle with Ventura within 24 hours of the filing of her suit. Sources told Deadline at the time that Combs paid Ventura “around $30 million,” but on May 14 the singer revealed officially for the first time it was actually $20 million.


	On May 15, Ventura was asked by defense lawyer Estevao if she recognized that Combs' “career was ruined at that point,” after her short-lived and much-covered suit was filed. Without much of a pause, Ventura answered: “I could understand that, yeah.”


	As the suits piled up and the status conscious Combs became a pariah in the music industry and almost everywhere else, the innocence proclaiming mini-mogul did apologize for the severity of his abuse in his relationship with Ventura after the security camera footage emerged in May of him hitting and kicking her in 2016. At the time, as it also was revealed that Combs bought the footage for $50,000 the day after the incident, Ventura's lawyers slammed his apology as “disingenuous.”


	Whether or not that is true, it is a fact that the apology has since been deleted form Combs' social feeds. Now, after dispute the accuracy of the video for several months, the defense concedes that the footage is disturbing as an example of domestic violence. Centering the incident as a fight over a phone, as attorney Teny Geragos did in the defense's opening statement, Combs' team asserted what everybody can see doesn't rise to the charges the feds have hit the “All About the Benjamins” performer with.  


	After the U.S. Attorney's office intent earlier this week to strongly show that self-admitted domestic violence predator Combs was guilty of the charges in his constant coercive efforts to force a fundamentally unwilling Ventura into filmed sex with male escorts and more with threats of battering, career disaster and public humiliation, the defense sought to flip the script Thursday. To that, with gentle nudging and a distinct reading of evidence like the text message, Estevao tried Thursday and today to reiterate the defense's opening statement of May 12 that while Combs can be a violent drug-using ass, Ventura was an active and consenting agent in everything the couple did – not matter how sordid.


	Correspondingly, on the stand for nearly 15 hours so far this week, a sometimes tearful, triggered and voice-cracking Ventura has more than held her own against defense lawyer Estevao since yesterday. In fact, as most of the day was spent examining the copious texts and emails Combs and Ventura sent each other over their 11-year on-and-off “toxic relationship,” elements of the defense's tactics seemed to almost be doing the job of the prosecution. An agitated Combs could be seen repeatedly passing notes to lawyers and speaking directly to Estevao at one point during a break.


	Today Diddy seemed more composed, though how long that will last is TBD. During a short break Friday, Combs was alone at the defense table as his lawyers left the room to prepare for the rest of the morning session. Looking bored, the now white haired and once entourage leading defendant had a staffer help him with the position of the  monitor in front of him.

	











	With the schedule in flux, it is unknown right now when the prosecution's next witness, Dawn Richard, will begin her testimony. Once one of the singers from the Combs'-fronted MTV series Making the Band and other Diddy projects, Richard in September last year sued her past producer for rape and more. Filed right around the time Combs was arrested in this criminal case, that civil case is ongoing.


	This criminal case is expected to last eight to 10 weeks. Judge Subramanian told the jury when they were seated on May 12, promising to free them up by the July 4th holiday. At the stop and start pace the proceedings are currently going, that deadline could prove elusive.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


The Green Knight‘s David Lowery has set his next feature with Oscar winner Tilda Swinton, the anarchic whodunnit and otherworldly psychological thriller, Death in Her Hands based on American author Ottessa Moshfegh's 2020 novel. 


	Swinton plays a woman striving to take control of her own story in the new project from Oscar winning See-Saw Films. In the Lowery scripted title recent widow Vesta Gul (Tilda Swinton) comes across a chilling handwritten note in the woods near her home: “Her name was Magda. Nobody will ever know who killed her. It wasn't me. Here is her dead body.” Except there is no body. No blood. Unmoored by the death of her husband and armed only with a camera, her dog Charlie, and her vivid imagination, Vesta becomes obsessed with uncovering Magda's identity and fate. As her inner world begins to eclipse reality, the mystery of Magda threatens Vesta's grip on her own life – until, in a spellbinding operatic climax, we realize that Magda's death may finally allow Vesta to live.

Death in Her Hands is produced by Iain Canning, Emile Sherman and Jeanie Igoe; EPs are Simon Gillis and Ann Phillips. 


	Lowery exclaimed, “I am a devoted fan of Ottessa Moshfegh, and the opportunity to translate Death In Her Hands to the big screen has been, in some ways, a subterfuge for getting to spend a great deal of time obsessing over her prose. But now the ruse is up! The script begot by the novel will soon become a film, and I am suddenly aware more than ever that adapting this particular work represents a devious challenge (anyone who's read the novel will understand why)! But I'm ready for it, and am emboldened to have such wonderful collaborators at my side: the whole team at See-Saw, Jeanie, and of course, the incredible Tilda Swinton, who I know will illuminate Ottessa's story in ways I could only dream of.”


	Producers Canning and Sherman said “David Lowery is a master of crafting striking, atmospheric stories, and there's no one better to bring Ottessa Moshfegh's haunting and brilliant novel to the screen. We can't wait for audiences to step into the world he creates and be swept away by Vesta's story, played by the incomparable, magnetic, and endlessly compelling Tilda Swinton.”

	











	Lowery's directing credits include Ain't Them Bodies Saints, Pete's Dragon, The Old Man & The Gun, Peter Pan & Wendy, and Green Knight. Swinton won a 2008 Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Michael Clayton. She next stars in Edward Berger's The Ballad of a Small Player opposite Colin Farrell. 


	Swinton is repped by Hamilton Hodell, CAA and Peikoff Mahan. Lowery is repped by WME and Victoria Cook at Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz.

Lauren Sanchez is living it up ahead of her big day. The future wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos kicked off the festivities with a star-studded bachelorette party in Paris on Thursday, May 15.

According to PEOPLE, Sanchez and her A-list friends had a blast at the historic Lafayette's restaurant. A source told the outlet that the “atmosphere was very relaxed and very Parisian.”

Celebrity guests at the all-girl pre-wedding bash include Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Eva Longoria, and Katy Perry.

A post shared by Lauren Sanchez (@laurenwsanchez)

For the occasion, Sanchez wore a white coat with gold buttons over an off-shoulder white mini-dress. She completed the look with white heels and sparkling diamond earrings.

Meanwhile, Kardashian, who was photographed with the bride-to-be leaving the restaurant, donned a strapless bandeau-style top with a brown fur stole draped over her shoulders. She matched it with a high-waisted, dark pinstriped leggings with a chunky gold chain.

Jenner also dressed in style for the event, wearing a black velvet turtleneck and patterned bottoms. Perry, on the other hand, looked elegant in a blush ankle-length strapless corset dress.

At Lafayette's, Sanchez and her guests enjoyed “espresso martinis and everybody got up and danced when Lauren asked for ‘Earth, Wind and Fire,'” the outlet added.

Guests dined on fried chicken, Caesar salad, and Norwegian smoked salmon, with a main course of mushroom rigatoni and roasted chicken. The meal concluded with a surprise cake for Sanchez.

Sanchez took to Instagram shortly after the event and shared more photos from the star-studded bachelorette party in Paris. The children's book author also gushed about her friends, who made the celebration extra special.

Forever starts with friendship, surrounded by the women who've lifted me up, illuminated my path in dark times, and shaped my heart along the way.

A post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos)

In May 2023, PEOPLE reported that Bezos popped the question to Sanchez while vacationing in the South of France. Sanchez was photographed with a stunning diamond ring as she spent a romantic time with the billionaire.

Meanwhile, journalist Dylan Byers reported that the couple has already “sent out formal invitations for a wedding this summer in Venice.” 

Bezos shares three sons and a daughter with his ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott. Sanchez, on the other hand, shares her son Nikko with former NFL star Tony Gonzalez, and her two younger children, Evan and Ella, with ex-husband Patrick Whitesell.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jason Kelce Makes a Major Announcement About Taylor Swift and New Baby Finn","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jason-kelce-taylor-swift-baby-finn/","Fri, 16 May 2025 15:49:57 GMT","

Jason Kelce welcomed his fourth daughter, Finnley Anne, with his wife Kylie in March. The couple, who wed in 2018, already had Wyatt, 5, Elliotte, 4, and Bennett, 2. The arrival of the new baby has been a special event in the Kelce family, which includes Jason's brother, Travis, and his girlfriend, Taylor Swift.

A post shared by Entertainment Tonight (@entertainmenttonight)

Jason and Travis both recently appeared at the Amazon Upfront 2025 presentation, since their “New Heights” podcast is attached to the tech giant. While speaking with Entertainment Tonight, Jason shared some details about family life in the newborn bubble since Finnley's birth.

“Finnley's doing great. She is six weeks old, so she is a baby. We are not sleeping much, but it's been good,” the former Philadelphia Eagle shared.

A post shared by Kylie (McDevitt) Kelce (@kykelce)

Of course, the next question was whether his brother's girlfriend had met his new baby. Jason confirmed that Swift has met baby Finn, and then he shared a bit more information about the family dynamic in recent weeks. 

“She has, yep, she's met her. We were fortunate to have them all in … it doesn't happen often,” Jason Kelce explained. “Everybody is busy, but it was really special. Thankfully we have a tight-knit family that makes time for each other, and it's been awesome.”

Jason retired from the NFL in 2024 as one of the most-decorated offensive lineman in league history. In addition to being the mom of four, Kylie Kelce has also been keeping busy with her own podcast, “Not Gonna Lie.”

In early 2025, Swift wrapped up her Eras Tour and Travis Kelce finished out the season with the Kansas City Chiefs at Super Bowl LIX. 

A post shared by 𝒮𝓊𝓈𝒶𝓃𝓃𝒶𝒽⸆⸉ (@tayvis.socials)

Both Swift and Travis Kelce have stayed out of the public eye since the Chiefs' loss in February and the end of her tour. But, they were recently spotted in Philadelphia spending Mother's Day with the Kelce clan.

The couple joined Jason, Kylie, and mom Donna for a meal at Talula's Garden. Swift wore a black Christy Dawn dress with a daisy print. Some fans saw the outfit as a nod to lyrics from a song on her 2017 album “Reputation.” 

In “Don't Blame Me,” Swift sang “I once was poison ivy but now I'm your daisy.”

The dress sells for $298 on the Christy Dawn website, but is currently sold out. The Grammy winner accessorized with a $6,000 Chanel purse. Travis Kelce kept things casual for the outing, wearing a short-sleeved button up shirt.

Tell us! Do you think Jason Kelce's daughters call Taylor Swift auntie? Let us know in the comments below.

A former contestant from “The Bachelor” and “Bachelor in Paradise” is reaching out for support from fans as her family navigates difficult news. Serene Russell took to her Instagram Stories to share her heartbreak with fans and provide ways they can help.

On May 15, Russell shared the news via an Instagram Story. She wrote, “On Sunday, Mother's Day, I saw my mom and immediately became concerned with her condition during brunch.” 

Russell noted she took her mom to the emergency room, but “everything came back clear.” They returned home, but Russell's mom continued to feel unwell. 

After her mom went to get checked out again, while Russell was at work, “she was diagnosed with a golf ball sized brain tumor.” 

Upon finding the tumor, Russell explained, her mom was “diagnosed with stage 3-4 brain cancer.” 

“I am still in shock, as this has all happened in 3 days and she had been hiding her pain/has been experiencing disorientation.” Russell noted that her mom's symptoms only began a week ago. 

A post shared by serene russell (@serenebrookrussell)

The “Bachelor in Paradise” alum asked for prayers to be sent her mom's way. She also shared a link to a GoFundMe created to raise funds for her mother's medical costs. 

She noted her mom would be getting surgery in a few days, but wrote, “her insurance does not cover it.” 

Russell wrote, “We are facing many obstacles but this is my mom and I know she is strong enough to beat it.”

In addition, Russell shared, “My little brother and sister are 15 and still depend on her. We all do.” A second Instagram Story included the GoFundMe link a second time, as well as a photo of Russell with her mom, younger brother, and younger sister. 

On the GoFundMe page, Russell's mom is described as “a very strong, independent woman” who is “not one to ask for handouts.” 

“Sherri is the mother to 5 wonderful children and she has been recently diagnosed with brain cancer. This is very unexpected to her, her children, and other family members,” the page for the fundraiser noted. 

After her upcoming surgery, the medical team will determine the next steps, likely chemotherapy or radiation, the update added. The GoFundMe organizer explained that the surgeon does not take the insurance that Russell's mother has, thus the family's decision to try to crowdfund the costs. 

Fans took to “The Bachelor” subreddit to share their sadness and post supportive messages about Russell's news. 

“Some of Serene's siblings are still in their teens… it's really just an awful situation all around. It comes out of nowhere and is just such a shock and absolutely devastating,” one person wrote. 

“That's so awful… I didn't know she had younger siblings. Poor things,” another fan wrote.

A post shared by serene russell (@serenebrookrussell)

As Us Weekly noted, Russell first appeared on Clayton Echard's season of “The Bachelor.” She went to “Bachelor in Paradise” the following summer and immediately clicked with “The Bachelorette” alum Brandon Jones.

Jones and Russell got engaged during the “Bachelor in Paradise” finale, and talked about setting a 2024 wedding date. In May 2023, however, the pair split.

Russell recently went public with her new romance. She is now dating Brendan Morais, who did season 7 of “Bachelor in Paradise.” 

Morais left paradise with Pieper James, and the two quietly split after two years together.

Trisha Yearwood is taking time out of promoting her upcoming new album to honor a living legend.

The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum announced that Yearwood will headline a tribute to Linda Ronstadt this summer.

The concert is titled “Trisha Yearwood and Friends Celebrate Linda Ronstadt and Los Angeles Country-Rock.” And it comes with a lot of star power in addition to Trisha.  It will also feature performances by Rodney Crowell, Emmylou Harris, Patti Scialfa, and James Taylor. 

In a press release by CMHOF, Trisha says Ronstadt played a key role in her career. “Linda Ronstadt is a big reason I wanted to be a singer,” said Yearwood. “I'm honored to be a part of celebrating Linda and this incredible era of music that is such an important part of the history of country music.”

Yearwood and the rest of the performers will be singing songs from Ronstadt's legendary catalog, along with other country-rock classics.

A post shared by Linda Ronstadt (@lindaronstadtmusic)

The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum says the concert will highlight the connections between Ronstadt and Grammy-winning artist and songwriter Rodney Crowell, Country Music Hall of Fame member EmmyLou Harris, and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame member James Taylor, who each contributed to the musical movement of LA Country-Rock.  

Proceeds from the concert will support the museum's exhibition “Western Edge: The Roots and Reverberations of Los Angeles Country-Rock.”

The museum says the exhibit “traces communities of visionary singers, songwriters, and musicians who set about reinvigorating the sounds of pop and rock by infusing elements of country, bluegrass, and folk music. Fostered in local nightclubs and late-night jam sessions, the resulting musical fusion, “country-rock,” made a lasting impact on popular music.

The exhibit surveys the rise of the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Poco, Eagles, Emmylou Harris, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Linda Ronstadt and many others who, in the 1960s and '70s, found commercial success with new sounds that merged rock & roll rhythms and attitude with country and bluegrass instrumentation and harmonies. As they flourished, so did the Los Angeles-based recording industry.”

A post shared by Trisha Yearwood (@trishayearwood)

The tribute concert comes just four days after Trisha Yearwood drops her first studio album in six years.

When she releases her album “The Mirror” on July 18, it will be her first where she co-wrote and co-produced every single track.

During an appearance on “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” Yearwood said, “I've always kind of hidden behind music like ‘this song's really personal, but I didn't write it.' Well, I don't have, I can't say that about these songs. So performing some of them made me just really emotional.”

While the album doesn't drop until July 18, Yearwood has already released two singles from it- “Bringing the Angels” and “The Wall or the Way Over.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Shark Tank' Star Announces Exit From ABC's Hit Show","https://entertainmentnow.com/reality-tv/mark-cuban-leaving-sharktank/","Fri, 16 May 2025 02:52:00 GMT","

After 14 years, Mark Cuban is calling it quits. 

The “Shark Tank” investor, who joined the reality show in 2011, revealed that he will be leaving the show after the season 16 finale on May 16. 

“My last @ABCSharkTank is this Friday. Gonna miss it. But it was time to move on,” Cuban wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on May 15. “Make sure to watch !”

While he first joined as a guest panelist, Cuban became a full-time “shark” the following season and has been a staple of the show since. Throughout his tenure on the show, Cuban has invested in over 80 deals, for a total of around $20 million, per The Dallas Morning News. 

A post shared by Barry Poznick (@barrypoznick)

Cuban knew that Season 16 was going to be his last, and he revealed exactly why that was when speaking with People in an October 2024 interview. 

“My kids are teenagers and I want to spend more time with them,” he told the outlet, specifically noting that he plans to take vacations with them now that he has more time. 

“We always shoot in June and September, and in June, right when they're finishing school, I have to come here,” he added. “When they were young it was like, ‘Okay, we're going to wait for Dad.' Now that they're teenagers, they aren't waiting for Dad at all, and in September they've just gotten back to school. I want to be there for that.”

Cuban has three children – Alexis, 22, Alyssa, 19, and Jake, 15 – with his wife, Tiffany Stewart. 

A post shared by Shark Tank (@sharktankabc)

When speaking with People, Cuban also reflected on what it was like during his last day on set, filming the season 16 finale. 

“[It's] going to be more about the crew and the staff because most of them have been here for 15 years and it's family,” he said. “We all look forward to getting together twice a year for a long time and seeing each other for 12 hours a day.”

However, while leaving this is the “hardest part,” Cuban made one thing clear. 

“I won't miss the deals,” he stated. 

“The deals are always out there, but I'll miss the people and I'll miss having an impact just from the show itself because we send a message every day that the American dream is alive and well,” Cuban continued.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Michael J. Fox's Surprise Return to TV","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/michael-j-fox-returns-to-acting/","Fri, 16 May 2025 00:19:46 GMT","

One of Apple TV's fan favorite shows,  “Shrinking”, where therapists wrestle with grief and ethics, a familiar face is about to steal the show. On May 15, 2025, fans were stunned by the news that Michael J. Fox, the beloved “Back to the Future” icon, is returning to acting with a major guest-starring role in the comedy drama's third season, Deadline reported. After retiring in 2020 due to Parkinson's-related speech challenges, Fox's comeback, his first on-camera role in five years, reunites him with “Shrinking” co-creator Bill Lawrence, his “Spin City” collaborator. With production underway, Fox's return promises emotional depth, humor, and a nod to the show's heartfelt Parkinson's storyline.

Fox's role, shrouded in secrecy, is rumored to tie to Dr. Paul Rhoades (Harrison Ford), the gruff therapist diagnosed with Parkinson's in Season 1, Variety noted. Fox, who has lived with the disease since 1991 and raised over $2 billion for research through his foundation, brings unmatched authenticity. His history with Lawrence, who called Fox his “first mentor” at a December 2024 PaleyLive event, adds poignancy. Lawrence, inspired by Fox's resilience, crafted “Shrinking's” Parkinson's arc to be “inspiring, not tragic,” People reported. Their “Spin City” days, where Fox's Emmy-winning charm as Mike Flaherty shone, set the stage for this reunion. Fox's past roles in Lawrence's “Scrubs” and shows like “The Good Wife” hint at a character blending wit and dignity.

“Shrinking”, co-created by Lawrence, Jason Segel, and Brett Goldstein, follows therapist Jimmy Laird (Segel) as he breaks rules to shake up his clients' lives. Season 3, which is currently in filming, builds on Season 2's finale, where Paul stopped his Parkinson's meds, Hollywood Reporter confirmed. Fox joins new guest stars Jeff Daniels (as Jimmy's father), Sherry Cola, and Isabella Gomez, alongside regulars Jessica Williams, Christa Miller, and Ted McGinley. Speculation swirls, could Fox play a patient, a friend, or even himself? Lawrence told TVLine that Season 3 will explore Jimmy's crew moving forward, with Fox's role likely amplifying the show's blend of humor and heart.

Fox's return isn't just a casting coup, it's a cultural moment. After his 2023 documentary “Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie” and a 2024 honorary Oscar, his decision to step back into acting reflects his enduring passion, People highlighted. “If I could figure out a role that fits my realities, I'd do it,” Fox told Deadline in 2024, that “Shrinking” with its empathetic lens on Parkinson's, feels tailor-made.  As Season 3 is  potentially the last, Fox's presence alongside Ford and Segel promises a mix of laughter, tears, and inspiration. Stay tuned to Apple TV+ for a comeback that's already rewriting the script on resilience.

The first truly modern American Western, or at least the first one that has the nowness required to mention Pop Crave by name, Ari Aster's “Eddington” is also the first major Hollywood movie that's been willing to see the COVID pandemic for the hellacious paradigm shift that it was — as the moment when years of technologically engineered polarization tore a forever hole in the social fabric of a country that was already coming apart at the seams. 

Few other filmmakers would have the chutzpah required to make a “No Country for Old Men” riff that hinges on mask mandates and the murder of George Floyd, and we should probably all be grateful that none of them have tried. But Aster, who's exclusively interested in making the kind of films that should be reviewed straight onto a prescription pad, is too beholden to his neuroses for his latest movie to play like a cheap provocation. This time, however, there's a good chance those are your neuroses, too. 

 








Related Stories You're a Lifelong U2 Fan and Only Have Eight Minutes to Interview Bono — What Do You Ask? ‘Hurry Up Tomorrow': Why Abel Tesfaye Created a Dark Fictional Backstory for His Music and The Weeknd Persona 

Stemming from a collective sickness to the same degree that “Beau Is Afraid” was born from some very personal trauma, “Eddington” — the tagline for which reads: “Hindsight is 2020” — only wields its what's the opposite of nostalgia? specificity as a means to an end. It might set the scene with a little “remember how it felt to wait in line outside the pharmacy?” fun, but Aster's bleakly funny and brilliantly plotted assessment of how fucked we've become since then soon leverages those fun memories into a far more probing story about the difficulties of sharing a town between people who live in separate realities. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






If “Eddington” is still a discourse generation machine powerful enough to make “Civil War” seem like a wind-up toy by comparison, that isn't because it picks sides — or risks the navel-gazing tedium of Alex Garland's epic by explicitly refusing to. Virtually everyone in Aster's COVID Western is a victim to one extent or another, even if some of them have a lot more blood on their hands by the end of it than others; there's no need for false equivalencies in a film whose characters are all powerless to disentangle the internet from the fabric of their personal lives.

That includes Sheriff Joe Cross (a sublimely pathetic Joaquin Phoenix), who only goes online under extreme duress, and always seems to unholster his phone as if he's begging someone not to make him use it. The impotent face of law enforcement in a small New Mexico town that's home to about 5,000 people, Joe is a “common sense” conservative who just wants to make babies and mess around with his government-appropriated AR-15. 

 










He's trying to make peace with the fact that his QAnon-susceptible wife Louise (Emma Stone) would rather watch numerology videos on YouTube than acknowledge her husband's existence, but Eddington's mask-happy mayor Ted — a handsome tech entrepreneur (Pedro Pascal) who secretly intends to host a massive artificial intelligence datacenter on the outskirts of Eddington after he wins re-election — is in thrall to the state's liberal governor, and his political career hinges on enforcing their various COVID mandates. 

That doesn't sit well with the asthmatic Joe, who doesn't consider the coronavirus to be a “here” problem, in much the same way as he later tries to wave off the idea that Eddington is a microcosm of the structural racism and class inequalities that people begin to protest on Main St. after police execute a man in St. Louis. Everyone in his jurisdiction is getting their news from a different source, and tensions are spilling into the supermarket aisles as people struggle to find a common harmony amid the noise of their competing echo chambers. 

Hell, even the people in Joe's house are getting their news from different sources, especially since his live-in mother-in-law (Deirdre O'Connell as Dawn) has started force-feeding Louise videos by a far, far right-wing YouTuber who tells his subscribers that “your pain isn't a coincidence.” He's played by a smooth and shaggy Austin Butler, and you'd probably want to believe him too. 

 










What's a sheriff to do? In Joe's case, he decides to run against Ted for mayor, and that decision will ultimately have a massive ripple effect on everyone in town, from the deputies he enlists to run his harebrained campaign (Luke Grimes and Michael Tooley, whose competing ambitions assume a racial dynamic in the wake of Black Lives Matter), to a horny white teenager who transforms himself into the wokest kid alive to impress his politically active crush. Alas, Googling Angela Davis may not be enough to seal the deal in a society where the internet — that great connector — has made it impossible for people to communicate with each other, and the reality of that situation only grows increasingly unmanageable as national headaches begin to impose themselves on a town where everyone sees their neighbors as a problem to be solved. 

Aster has described “Eddington” as a Western with cell phones instead of guns, but the guns do eventually come out; no one familiar with the director's previous work will be shocked to learn that this movie doesn't end with a raucous but rousing civil assembly. The more that Aster's latest freakout begins to resemble an apocalyptic kumbaya about the need for non-partisan communication, the more gleefully he obliterates any hope of restoring a shared reality between his characters (case in point: The story's first act of profound violence immediately follows a showdown that's soundtracked by Katy Perry's “Firework”). 

 










The stakes escalate with a mordant velocity reminiscent of Park Chan-wook's revenge sagas, a point of reference that continues through the darkly funny — and patently absurd — coda that Aster tacks on to the end of his film's pulse-pounding final shootout. Like so many aspects of “Eddington,” the way that shootout resolves might easily be mistaken for cynicism if not for the script's increasingly fever-brained insistence that its characters are at the mercy of a power beyond their control (not to double back to “Civil War,” but I hope everyone's ready for another take on “The Antifa Massacre”). 

Technology isn't always at the forefront of this story, but Aster is unsparing about the ambient role it continues to play in our lives, and the further that our dear Sheriff Joe falls off the rails, the more that “Eddington” revels in the constructed nature of his reality (an opportunity that Daniel Pemberton's Tōru Takemitsu-like score takes full advantage of). For a movie so giddy about grabbing hold of the third rail, Aster's fourth feature is less effective as a shock to the system than it is for how vividly — and how uncomfortably — it captures the day-to-day extent to which our digital future has stripped people of their ability to self-identify their own truths. 

 










John Ford's “Young Mr. Lincoln” makes a cameo appearance towards the end, but “Eddington,” for all the inspiration it takes from the masters of its genre, feels equally indebted to the likes of Miranda July's “Me and You and Everyone We Know” in how it takes stock of our divided online world, and pleads with everyone to “free each other's hearts.” That film ended by reforging the human connection between people. This one ends with target practice. 

“Eddington” premiered in Competition at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. A24 will release it in theaters on Friday, July 18.

Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou solidified A24's signature horror reign with 2022's twisted and evil-spirits-summoning “Talk to Me,” about a party game gone horrifyingly awry for a group of teen friends. They've upped the stakes with a more gruesomely disturbing but seriously, conceptually half-baked new thriller, “Bring Her Back,” in which Sally Hawkins is psychotically good and in an unhinged, manically grieving form we've never seen her in.

The British “Happy-Go-Lucky” and “Shape of Water” actress ever brings a touch of whimsy or furtive sadness to her roles, often as a woman with a secret. In “Bring Her Back,” her secrets are overwhelming every cell in her being as a foster mom, Laura, who is seriously unwell and taking desperate measures to resurrect the spirit of her own biological dead daughter — and in the flesh of one of the two foster children she's inherited. Despite Hawkins' commitment to the bit, however, Laura is a cartoonish villain that makes identifying with or even understanding her grievous plight — there is no word in the English language for a person who's lost a child, after all — a steep challenge.

In that sense, call A24's latest scary offering another entry in the genre of grief-house horror, movies that use genre tropes into a quote-unquote deeper exploration of trauma and pain. But that in itself is becoming a tired trope, one that the Philippou brothers, despite considerable skill behind the camera and especially in directing young children, mined already with “Talk to Me.”

Piper (Sora Wong) and Andy (Billy Barratt) are a codependent sister and brother — she's also blind and mocked for her amblyopia by classmates, and in need of his constant physical and emotional support. They've just lost their father, who drops dead in the shower for reasons that may or may not eventually have to do with both the kids' no-longer-with-us mother and the burdens that come with raising them. “Bring Her Back,” with some memorably harrowing images courtesy of cinematographer Aaron McLisky, reminds a shadow or so of another A24 horror movie, Ari Aster's “Midsommar,” in its chilling sequences of familial bodily maiming that become a motif that terrorizes the protagonists in the present.

 










They're shoved into the foster care system, and into the woods-ensconced home of care worker Laura, who already lives with a seriously disturbed child in the form of Oliver (Jonah Wren Phillips), a mute with the vacant cough-drop-eye stare of someone who's seen something very awful but has been deprived of the words or ability to speak of it.

Things get seriously creepy when Laura is dressed, uh, very casually (and honestly rather chicly in oversized sunglasses) at Piper and Andy's father's funeral and she forces Andy to kiss the corpse. “It's a tradition,” but it's also obviously the start of a witchy spell that is also somehow related to the snuff movies lying around Laura's house on VHS in which an obese or pregnant naked man is seen encircling a naked young woman who is terrified out of her mind. As if the taxidermized pet dog weren't weird enough, or the fact that Laura gets absolutely shitfaced with the kids to pry more secrets out of them to harness her power, or something.

The mythology of “Bring Her Back” is dizzyingly unclear and patched-together from what feel like studio notes commissioning both over-explication and also less of it, as if ambiguity alone can pass for scares. But the emotions and the performances in the present day are there, especially from Barratt, who thinks he's experiencing his own sort of post-grief psychosis when he wakes up in bed every morning covered in his own piss.

 










What starts to come into view is that Laura had a daughter who looks suspiciously like Piper, and that perhaps Laura has tried this trick before on Oliver, who can't leave the premises without having a grand mal seizure. It has something to do with the chalk outline surrounding the house, the familiar iconography of the occult even though the movie begins literally with the words “this is not a cult.”

Eventually, Billy tries to warn the foster care headquarters, managed by a kindly woman named Wendy (Sally-Anne Upton), that Laura is trying to sabotage Billy. There's a grimly hilarious moment when Wendy shows up for a wellness check and Laura claims that Piper didn't want to change a thing about her dead daughter's original bedroom decorations. 

“You're lucky the child is blind,” Wendy says, which in a sense also applies to the filmmakers, who've contrived Piper's blindness merely as a device to advance certain set pieces at the film's end. That's no knock against the turn from Wong, who eventually gets the best audience-cheer-eliciting moment in a film that otherwise induces eyerolls with regards to how Laura keeps getting away with her cartoon-villain behavior.

You want to throttle this woman, which is the point, but it makes “Bring Her Back” into a taxing experience. Except not taxing emotionally, where it should count, as despite the Philippous' flair for craft, they here don't quite connect the dots from horror movie that features grief to a horror movie that's truly about grief. And grief is becoming as shopworn an old horror yarn as trauma once was; I think we finally put that one to rest.

Filmmaker Oliver Laxe brings a kind of humbling brilliance to “Sirât,” his inaugural Cannes competition entry, after catching attention in sidebars for his previous films. It's the kind of film that Cannes attendees from far and wide come to the festival for: sui generis and evading any classification, emanating from a wholly personal vision of cinema while not resisting galvanizing, and sometimes crowd-pleasing, pleasures.

Born in France to Galician parents, and shooting the majority of his work to date in Morocco, Laxe's work operates in the interstices of borders and cultures, but wholly bypasses appropriation. It's always visually transportive and grimly sublime, focusing on simple plots and conflicts that provide ample space for philosophical and existential contemplation. And “Sirât” is undoubtedly his most fully realized work in his regard, notable too for folding in the visceral pleasures of contemporary genre and even blockbuster cinema.

The world Laxe creates is finely rendered in both the fore- and background, revealing much greater scope than its initial set-up lets on. Luis (Sergi López, in another powerful performance) is another variety of a recurrent character in cinema and television now: the stricken father, forced to bring his emotions further to the surface than he's typically comfortable with, and responding in disbelief to his offspring's opposing values. 

His teenage daughter Mar left five months ago for the Moroccan Sahara's illegal rave parties — and never returned. With no online communication, and little sense of her ultimate whereabouts or intentions, Luis and his young son Esteban (Brúno Nuñez) travel there themselves. Laxe soon gets in his first of many effective, incongruous fissures, as these remnants of a domestic family amble around a score of pilled and tatted-up partiers, the sub-bass and steady 4/4 house music kick pushing tension into the red.

Pragmatically enough, after showing photos of Mar to a raver couple called Jade and Bigui (Jade Oukid and Richard Bellamy, playing version of themselves, like the majority of the cast beyond López), they mention she could be at a future party located south of where they are. They decide to join forces and navigate there together, and we allow Laxe another common modern auteur strategy: finally dropping the  title card once the first act is well underway.

 










But what quashes that opening rave introduces one of the film's most fascinating elements. A large convoy of military vehicles drive into the vicinity, and while there's little threat of violence or confrontation between the two parties, something catches our attention when a soldier wants to take the “EU citizens” present into custody. As the drive begins, the radio mentions civilians massed at national borders, and statements from the NATO Secretary General. 

It's an alternate present or near-future, and the world is collapsing; suddenly, we understand the rationale of why Mar, and later her family, can disperse from where they permanently lived. Morocco emerges as an “interzone,” like William S. Burroughs famously characterized it in “Naked Lunch,” where European, African, Middle Eastern nationalities, as well as Islamic (the film's title derives from the religion's name for the bridge between hell and paradise), Christian and New Age (to cite the ravers) customs can commingle. 

Upon his film's very tactile and material basis, we can project any intelligent guess for backstory, yet it's one of the best examples of the “anti-psychological” approach that experimental filmmakers such as Laxe (alongside Albert Serra and Yuri Ancarani) have been chasing over the past decade, with reference to their portrayal of bodies and landscapes.

 










With another band of travelers — Stef, Josh and Tonin, the latter of whom has lost part of his right arm — in tow, the screenplay by Laxe and Santiago Fillol seems to lay out a plausible Point B to its a Point A: the potential reuniting of the family at the final rave in a sentimental, but satisfying catharsis. The ensuing first hour almost seems like a problem-solving “adventure” film, with petrol to be bartered for and solutions found to traversing unsteady rocks and bodies of water. 

Laxe, I'm sure, would be flattered by comparisons to “The Searchers” and the Mad Max series. Yet a shattering tragedy at around the film's mid-point upsets that trajectory entirely, as their convoy of cars become stationary, and confrontations with mortality must be sought.

To expand on the very “material” nature of this film, it never concedes to any scenes of now-routine psychedelic disorientation; Laxe and his ace cinematographer Mauro Herce are confident their mere photography of the space will burrow us into the characters' emotions and appreciation for the area's splendor, and also promise transcendence. 

Even if it shows civilization as we once knew it to be now perishing, the film pays tribute to contemporary leftist currents in imagining what a utopia after capitalism might look like. Collectivity could be our ultimate destiny: the community ritual of bodies attached to sublime music (and electronic dance music is more beautiful than many skeptics realize), the dispensability of the nuclear family in a world of greater co-operative labor and nurturing. Such hopes can seem strident or naive in the world where the majority of us live, but Laxe's true achievement in this film is magicking a scenario where their realization isn't just possible, but necessary.

Tilda Swinton is set to lead another literary adaptation: Ottessa Moshfegh‘s psychological thriller “Death in Her Hands,” with auteur David Lowery directing. Swinton, who most recently led Pedro Almodóvar's English feature debut “The Room Next Door,” will star as widow Vesta Gul, who may or may not have stumbled upon a crime scene. The character finds a handwritten note while walking in the woods, with the letter reading, “Her name was Magda. Nobody will ever know who killed her. It wasn't me. Here is her dead body.” Yet without a corpse in sight, recluse Vesta becomes obsessed with solving the would-be murder. 

 










The book's official synopsis reads, “As her inner world begins to eclipse reality, the mystery of Magda threatens Vesta's grip on her own life — until, in a spellbinding operatic climax, we realize that Magda's death may finally allow Vesta to live.” The novel was published in 2000.

Lowery will adapt the novel for the screen, with See-Saw Films producing. Iain Canning, Emile Sherman, and Jeanie Igoe are producing, with the executive producers including Simon Gillis and Ann Phillips. See-Saw's sales division Cross City Films and WME Independent are set to secure financing for the feature at Cannes.

“I am a devoted fan of Ottessa Moshfegh, and the opportunity to translate ‘Death in Her Hands' to the big screen has been, in some ways, a subterfuge for getting to spend a great deal of time obsessing over her prose. But now the ruse is up!,” Lowery said in a press statement. “The script begot by the novel will soon become a film, and I am suddenly aware more than ever that adapting this particular work represents a devious challenge (anyone who's read the novel will understand why)! But I'm ready for it, and am emboldened to have such wonderful collaborators at my side: the whole team at See-Saw, Jeanie, and of course, the incredible Tilda Swinton, who I know will illuminate Ottessa's story in ways I could only dream of.”

Producers Canning and Sherman added, “David Lowery is a master of crafting striking, atmospheric stories, and there's no one better to bring Ottessa Moshfegh's haunting and brilliant novel to the screen. We can't wait for audiences to step into the world he creates and be swept away by Vesta's story, played by the incomparable, magnetic, and endlessly compelling Tilda Swinton.”

 










Lowery next has “Mother Mary” in the works starring Anne Hathaway, which is currently in post-production. “Death in Her Hands” isn't the only Moshfegh adaptation in the works: Author Moshfegh, who also collaborated with Hathaway for her adaptation of “Eileen,” told IndieWire that she hand-selects who will adapt her work for the screen.

“I wouldn't just sign the rights over to a novel to anyone,” she said. “There are people who have some doings around other IPs. I trust them, but that isn't to say I'm not good at detachment. I don't actually want to control other people's work. An adaptation is just an adaptation. It's not supposed to be a carbon copy. That's impossible. It's a reinterpretation, it's a translation, and it's a really creative process.”

Moshfegh added at the time that the adaptation of “My Year of Rest and Relaxation,” to which LuckyChap optioned the rights to in 2018 and Yorgos Lanthimos was rumored to be attached to direct, is still  “underway.” No director has been announced yet. “I have no idea about the timeline on that, but hopefully sometime,” “Causeway” screenwriter Moshfegh said in 2023.

The experience of engaging with a film can give you a reference for expressing a personal idea that you didn't previously have the words for. This transference makes a moot point of all criticisms that could reasonably be leveled at the film. What do flaws matter, when you walk out of the cinema knowing how to finally say something you've been yearning to say? “The Plague” is full of ideas executed with varying degrees of resonance. It is not for everyone. But it could mean a lot to people like me.

In his debut feature, filmmaker Charlie Polinger plays with broad riffs on coming-of-age, body horror, and bullying genres before paring these themes back to reveal that two 12-year-old boys — and their contrasting approaches to being different — are really the heartfelt preoccupation of the film.

Set in the sealed world of a water polo training camp for boys during the summer of 2003, “The Plague” is both stylized and ascetic. Big, bold swings in the visual language and sound design department alternate with stillness and silence. This interplay between sensual overwhelm and sudden loneliness reflects the condition that watchful newbie Ben (Everett Blunck) feels as he processes the stressful social rules that may lead to his ostracization.




			Popular on IndieWire		






Shot on 35mm by cinematographer Steve Breckton, the intention to create a striking, mysterious, and uneasy atmosphere is evident from the first frame. We begin underwater, below the surface of a swimming pool. The surface is broken as a body cannonballs down to the bottom, followed by a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth … until there are too many to track. 

This introduction to a group of 12- and 13-year-old boys as faceless forces of nature will prove apt in certain ways, although Polinger is careful not to make any of them one-dimensional. While there are echoes of “Lord of the Flies” in the society these boys make for themselves — especially in terrifying and smart ringleader Jake (Kayo Martin) — shifts in perspectives and comic vignettes mean that “The Plague” never settles into one groove. It flirts with being a more cruel story than it is; indeed, Polinger's control over his core interest creates intrigue as we wonder, to paraphrase Richard Ayoade in “The Souvenir Part II,” if he will resist the temptation to be obvious.

 










We are aligned to the perspective of a new boy at camp, Ben. Their coach (Joel Edgerton in athleisure) is the only adult authority and it quickly becomes clear that he's out of his depth. In the aftermath of a training session, individual boys yell out brash comments and the camera cuts quickly between close-ups of each face, reframing this post-swim conversation as a site of intense pressure. Why is this lawless brood so undersupervised? Departures from realism in service of heightening the dynamics (when you're a kid trying to fit in, it feels like there are no adults around) require the viewer to accept the film on its assured word, rather than interrogating its rules. 

Two boys emerge as the poles that Ben uses to orient himself. There is Jake, the perma-grinning, smart-mouthed group leader. There is Eli (Kenny Rasmussen) an autistic-coded kid who, Ben is told, has “the plague.” “Those are not regular pimples, those are plague pimples,” says Jake, as he gives Ben the lowdown on the game that no one can afford to opt out of entirely. Touching Eli means you have to wash yourself immediately, otherwise you will have the plague too. The spectacle of the boys fleeing every time Eli nears them, or washing furiously after a skin brush, is painful to behold, however, Eli is not defined by his victimhood. He is a full person with interests that range from dancing to Gollum impersonations to creating fake blood and pretending to cut off his own finger to psyche Ben out.

 










While he serves as a cautionary tale to Ben, he also serves as an irresistible source of fascination. Slowly, the film absorbs us in the existential question of who Ben is going to be. Will he side with the dominant tribe and freeze out Eli to fit in? Or will be openly friends with Eli and risk making himself as much of a target? Is anyone mentally strong enough at 12 to weather living with tormentors? 

With a score that includes staccato human voices crying out, Ben moves through the sterile indoor world of a leisure center, often resembling a lonely gunslingers thanks to the Widescreen aspect ratio. Despite his solitude, there's always a chance that he might be being watched, and Jake has a strange way of knowing exactly when he's been spending time with Eli. The claustrophobia of having no privacy while having no company is evoked to create a pressure cooker environment where violence might erupt at any moment.

The plague itself is teased as both a real and metaphorical construct. There are shades of Julia Ducournau's own debut feature “Raw” in a skin-bubbling rash, while several visceral watch-through-the-finger moments blur the line between psychological and physical bloodshed. All creative choices are tailored to center a social-identity crisis and a climactic confrontation lays out what the stakes have been for Ben all along. This is a deeply emotional film in high concept clothing, coded to resonate with those of us well-versed in the instinct to betray ourselves in order to be accepted.

 










One read on the relationship between Ben and Eli is that it's a relationship between a masked neurodivergent boy and an unmasked one. This is a dynamic I have never seen before that speaks to my own inter-tribe struggles as I — diagnosed as an adult — sometimes resent those open and at ease with their differences. The biggest reveal of “The Plague” is that Eli — not in a “magical autistic” way, but in a subtle humanist way — has something to teach Ben. 

This is a film that harnesses its many offbeat and potent powers in service of a unique strain of reassurance. I left feeling lighter and more able to unmask.

“The Plague” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Kali Uchis isn't the first singer to place sensual pleasure at the top of her priorities, but in an era when contemporaries like Kehlani and SZA complement the body talk with self-scrutiny, Uchis' one-track mind feels as fresh and necessary as a cold beer after a walking tour. Using a high raspy flutter to project sex-drunk bliss, the Colombian American singer-songwriter hits a peak on Sincerely, her fifth album of candy-colored reveries and gossamer love-me-downs. At the midpoint between Diana Ross reveling in a love hangover and Aaliyah rocking the boat, Uchis' music offers the equivalent of extended foreplay.

Sincerely is also, I must say, monotonous, like other people's happiness can be. “Yeah, there's angels watching over me,” she sings late in the album, and well, good for her—we all need comfort in dark times. On last year's Orquideas, co-produced by a formidable brigade of Latin talent that included El Guincho alongside Geeneus and longtime Kendrick Lamar collaborator Sounwave, Uchis sang more or less the same kinds of songs in her patented husk-sigh but in Spanish, her second such full-length album; this difference made the difference. Singing in her first language released more nuances of expression than even the excellent Red Moon in Venus and Isolation knew how to spotlight. It had tonal variety to its love songs—call it Songs for Lovers Who Swing. On Sincerely, though, Uchis delivers a 45-minute monologue without so much as a look out the window for distraction.

A glance at the tracklist confirms her mood. She's upbeat! With an exclamation mark! On “Sugar! Honey! Love!,” Uchis pushes her voice to ceiling-scraping heights over strings playing a faintly Indian melody to celebrate the kind of experience that can only happen to people like her: “And I did all my time/For a crime that wasn't mine and made it out alive.” On the Miracles-indebted chug of “Daggers!” this openly bisexual artist nods towards the love that dare not speak its name; she and her angel babe “sweet as cherry pie” will make them turn their heads everywhere they go, like the would-be couple in the Ronettes' queer-coded “Be My Baby.” Josh Crocker, who co-produced 2023's “I Wish You Roses,” is back with “Lose My Cool,” a five-minute refutation of its title, for Uchis' talent is to keep her cool in moments of surrender.

Uchis' producers serve their client without fail. Few instrumental embellishments distract from her vocals, alas, and when they come, like the prominently mixed bass guitar on “It's Just Us,” they're welcome. “ILYSMIH” demonstrates this team's talent for using the studio as instrument—a bit of echo here, a keyboard ripple there—for the sake of a valentine to her baby with partner Don Tolliver last year; nothing can penetrate this gauze-covered cocoon of sound. Otherwise tracks like “Breeze!” don't deserve the punctuation, and “All I Can Say” depends on some acquaintance with girl-group traditions.

Sincerely plays better as a whole rather than as tracks excerpted for a playlist, which is fine, though “Sugar! Honey! Love!” and “Daggers!” rank among Uchis' most lived-in tracks. Besides, albums as guileless and hermetic as Sincerely, recorded by ambitious artists of relative youth, tend to look like a moment's monument to a joy that they have no way of knowing is transient, and if it isn't, well, that's fine too. Kali Uchis will on future albums figure out a way to explain her bliss to the rest of us with the variation it deserves.

	Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service after posting a picture of seashells spelling out “8647” on Instagram — which conservatives claim is a secret call for President Donald Trump's assassination. 


	On Thursday, Comey posted an image to his social media of a “cool shell formation” he found during a walk on the beach. The first half of the shell formation spelled out “86,” ostensibly a reference to common hospitality slang. The second half, “47,” was seemingly a reference to Trump, the 47th president. 


	To “86” something is an extremely common parlance in the restaurant and bar industry. When the manager asks security to “86” the man yelling at the bartender, they don't mean that they should take him out back and kill him, only that the person should be ejected from the bar. Similarly, if a chef tells a server to “86 the special” they mean that the server should let other staff know that the dish is no longer on offer. 

	











	Trump, top officials in his administration, Republican lawmakers, and MAGA commentators on social media took the post as a cold call to murder the president. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In a clip released by Fox News on Friday, Trump told host Bret Baier that Comey knew “exactly what that meant” and that “a child knows what that meant […] that meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear.” 


	“Our country has become respected again and all this, and he's calling for the assassination of the president,” Trump continued, adding that “if he had a clean history, I could, I could understand if there was a leniency,” but in his view Comey was a “dirty cop.”


	Trump's allies quickly seized on Comey's post on Thursday, with Donald Trump Jr. writing that Comey was “casually calling for my dad to be murdered.” 


	“Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of @POTUS Trump,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X.  “DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.”

	Current FBI director Kash Patel wrote that the bureau was “aware of the recent social media post by former FBI Director James Comey, directed at President Trump.” He added: “We are in communication with the Secret Service and Director Curran. Primary jurisdiction is with SS on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.”

	











	Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's Director of National Intelligence, even told Fox News that Comey should be in jail. “James Comey in my view should be held accountable and put behind bars for this,” she said. 


	House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) wrote: “President Trump has already survived TWO assassination attempts. Now, former disgraced FBI director James Comey is either threatening to kill Donald Trump or suggesting someone should. This is as outrageous as it is dangerous.” 


	Comey responded to the backlash by deleting the post, which he said he assumed were a “political message.”


	“I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence,” he continued. “It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.”


	It wasn't enough for his critics. It's also not the first time Trump's allies have claimed the term “86” was a call for his murder. In 2020, prominent lawmakers and influencers accused Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer of calling for the president's murder after she displayed an “8645” pin during a televised interview.

	Several prominent Republican influencers and even former lawmakers have some posts they would theoretically need to explain to law enforcement themselves. Last year, former Rep. Matt Gaetz wrote on X that he and MAGA Republicans had successfully “86'd” Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Former Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, and Former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell from the GOP.”


	Last we checked all three of those individuals were very much alive and un-murdered.

	In a 2020 post, Pizzagate influencer Jack Posobiec wrote “8647” — a reference to President Joe Biden — on social media. In response to Comey's post on Thursday, Posobiec wrote: “The fmr director of the FBI is calling for left-wing assassins to target our president and kill him. Have no idea why he hasn't been arrested yet.” 


	If that's how he really feels, Posobiec is welcome to print out his tweets about Biden and self-surrender at the nearest convenient FBI office.

Donald Trump, who had “Born in the U.S.A.” on his 2016 campaign rally soundtrack, insisted he's “never liked” Bruce Springsteen or his music after the musician called the president “incompetent and treasonous” at his 2025 European tour kick-off.


	Such biting words from such a famous and revered rockstar unsurprisingly got under the skin of the president, even as he's in the middle of a trip through the Middle East and planning to accept $400 million luxury jets from Qatar. He fired off a Truth Social post Friday morning calling Springsteen “Highly Overrated” and “not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK.”


	Trump proceeded to lash out at Springsteen for his support of former president Joe Biden, calling the musician “dumb as a rock,” and a “dried out ‘prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!).” The president also seemed particularly fixated on the fact that Springsteen made his comments abroad, and closed his message with the simultaneously outlandish, but also disconcertingly ominous (in light of well, everything) claim that Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just ‘standard fare.' Then we'll all see how it goes for him!”

	Springsteen has, of course, criticized Trump plenty of times on American soil. In a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, Springsteen called Trump a “moron,” and at a 2024 campaign rally for Kamala Harris, he called Trump an “American tyrant.” At his recent tour opener in England, Springsteen said the U.S. was “in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration.”


	Later in the show, before playing “My City of Ruins,” Springsteen added, “A majority of our elected representatives have failed to protect the American people from the abuses of an unfit president and a rogue government. They have no concern or idea of what it means to be deeply American. The America l've sung to you about for 50 years is real, and, regardless of its faults, is a great country with a great people. So we'll survive this moment. Now, I have hope, because I believe in the truth of what the great American writer James Baldwin said, he said, ‘In this world there isn't as much humanity as one would like, but there's enough.'”

	Stomping black platform boots. Burst of pink, purple, and blue lights. Smoke wraps the front stage inside a packed 3,500-person venue in Istanbul as six figures emerge, dressed in lace, fur, and chains. The singers move in formation; it's not quite K-pop crisp, not quite riot grrrl wild, but something that's unmistakably their own. The crowd mouths the lyrics to their debut single, “Zamansızdık,” while others shout the group's name: Manifest.


	Made up of six members in their early twenties — Sueda Uluca, Hilal Yelekçi, Lidya Pınar, Zeynep Oktay, Mina Solak, and Esin Bahat — Manifest are a Turkish girl group, fluent in choreography, femininity, and unapologetic edge, standing together in a way that hasn't been seen in this country in more than a decade. “In girl groups, people often want to pit you against each other,” Yelekçi says. “But for us, the power comes from being together. We see it as strength, not competition.”


	Since winning Big5, a televised talent show aiming to find Turkey‘s next big music group, in January,  Manifest have been putting out new music and content like there is no tomorrow. The group is just as varied in background as it is unified in purpose. Most are university students or recent grads balancing degrees in fields like psychology, engineering, and design with a lifelong passion for dance and performance. Their influences range from Hepsi (the first official girl band of Turkey, popular in the early 2000s) to Lisa from Blackpink.

	Their debut concert in February, at Istanbul's Jolly Joker Arena, felt like both a soft launch and a reckoning. What does it mean to be a girl band in Turkey now? And how do you build one from scratch in a pop industry that rarely allows women to share a spotlight without unhealthy comparisons? 


	“It's not just about singing or dancing well,” Oktay says. “It's about holding each other up. From day one, we knew: If we were going to do this, it had to be built on women's solidarity.”

	In a country where female artists have almost always been solo acts (Sezen Aksu, Sertab Erener, Ajda Pekkan), Manifest signal something different. Their name suggests an intention to declare, to shape, hope, and take up space. Formed through months of competition and mentorship from Turkish pop icons like Gülçin Ergül, formerly of Hepsi and one of the three judges of Big5, the group isn't just performing pop. They are defining a new blueprint, with Istanbul's texture mixed into their DNA. 

	











	That mentorship came full circle during that February concert, when Gülçin surprised fans by joining Manifest onstage to perform “Bir Tanecik Aşkım,” one of her solo songs. The moment sparked cheers from the sold-out venue's crowd — a symbolic handoff from Turkey's first girl group to its newest. For longtime Hepsi fans, it felt like a passing of the torch. For Manifest, it marked a moment of validation: One of the women who paved the way was cheering them on.


	The numbers back them up. On Spotify, Manifest's debut single “Zamansızdık” has already passed 12 million streams since its February release — not far behind Hepsi's most iconic tracks, like that group's 2005 debut single, “Olmaz Oğlan,” which has more than 16 million streams. (“Yalan,” Hepsi's most played song, is nearing 45 million.) These are numbers that the group collected over 20 years. Manifest's second single, “Arıyo,” reached four million views on YouTube in only four weeks. It's a rare moment in Turkish pop where the past and future collide this clearly, and a sign of how hungry audiences are for Manifest's energy. 


	Uluca credits some of that momentum to Big5. “In the program, we were all just being our natural selves, so people were able to connect with us in that moment,” she says. “And honestly, I relate to that too. When I understand the artist, I become more curious and passionate about the art as well.”

	Their arrival feels like a relief for Turkish pop fans. Not because they promise escape, but because they offer recognition; a sense that girls, especially, can take up space, move together, and be loud about it. “We want girls who see us to know they do not have to be alone,” Yelekçi says. “You can wear what you want, you can cry, and then take the stage. You can build something with your friend, and it can be powerful.” 


	That kind of visibility and closeness speaks to a generation that has been waiting for an act like Manifest. “Maybe Turkey wasn't completely ready,” Oktay reflects. “But people needed this. There's been a gap. And maybe when we arrived, they finally saw something worth holding onto.”


	Manifest's rise is also about something deeper: a hunger for collectivity, visibility, and joy that doesn't ignore hardship. Their fans are building streaming campaigns, designing fan art, and learning choreography for unreleased songs. The group meets that energy with open arms. “We share everything with them,” Yelekçi says. “We're the same generation as most of our fans. That helps. Even a casual selfie in the elevator becomes a moment.” 

	











	Their aesthetic balances high-concept polish with local flavor. They shoot videos in barbershops and markets. They wear miniskirts over pants and drink çay (Turkish tea) in public squares. “We're always crossing a bridge, literally and emotionally,” Oktay says, referring to the way Istanbul is split between Europe and Asia, and the cultural dilemma of being traditional yet unique in a modern setting. “That duality is who we are.” 


	Yelekçi recalls a moment that felt especially grounding: a visit to Istanbul's Eminönü Market, one of the city's oldest and busiest districts, where vendors sell spices, tea, small home goods, and accessories. 


	“The real Turkey isn't what you see on social media,” she says. “It's our uncles, fishermen, and shopkeepers in places like this market. That's where a huge part of our identity comes from.” She adds: “We're not picking one or the other; we're both, and we're proud of that. The traditional, and the modern; side by side. ”


	Their sound is just as layered. Turkish folk influences weave through hip-hop beats. Choreography references both K-pop and Istanbul's underground dance scene. “We're a Turkish girl group, and that's something we're proud of,” Solak explains. “We don't want to sound or look like anyone else. We want to bring our own culture forward and let the world know who we are.”


	Being in a group, Bahat says, makes them more resilient. “When one of us gets tired, there's always someone else to step in or motivate. Even now, talking to you, we feel more confident because we're together. That's our strength.” 


	The momentum hasn't let up. A short film and two more singles are set to release — one dropping today, and another May 31. Their debut album drops on June 13. “We've been living with these songs. We barely listen to anything else,” Pınar says, laughing. “We hope the excitement we feel comes through to everyone.”

	Manifest are also building something no other Turkish group has tried before: Manifestival, a fan-centered music and arts festival that they'll not only headline, but organize and own. “We wanted to create a space for girls to feel free. Workshops, panels, dance. Something bigger than just a show. Something lasting.”


	They're already imagining what comes next. “We want the world to sing in Turkish. If Rosalía can make us fall in love with Spanish, why not us?” They glance at each other. “Everything we've hoped for has happened so far. We manifested it. And we're not done.”

	For 30 years, it seems that there has never been a pitch too wild for Snoop Dogg. He's done a reggae album, a funk album, two gospel albums and even released an album on the blockchain. The Zelig of popular music, no collaborator is off limits: Willie Nelson, Stevie Wonder, Katy Perry, Quincy Jones, Daddy Yankee, the Bee Gees, Limp Bizkit, BTS, Patti LaBelle, Prince Royce, Banda MS, Tiësto, Popcaan, Jelly Roll, Charlie Sheen. He's sold his own app, his own breakfast cereal and recently opened a weed store in L.A., the city where he will likely serve as NBC's ambassador to the 2028 Summer Olympic Games.


	If any of this ever seemed incongruous with being gangsta rap royalty, it has never once affected the Teflon Dogg, America's lovable uncle. He gives a truckloads of money to charity, is generally regarded as one of the nicest people in the business and has been consistently releasing solid if underheralded solo albums since the Clinton administration. Who's going to care if the guy sells an NFT or two?

	











	That all changed in January when Snoop did a short DJ set at David Sacks' Crypto Ball, a Washington D.C. schmoozefest held to celebrate Donald Trump's re-inauguration. Fans on social media rebelled, calling him a sellout, but Snoop stood his ground, telling The Breakfast Club, “I'm not a politician. I don't represent the Republican Party. I don't represent the Democratic Party. I represent the motherfucking Gangsta Party, period point blank.” Snoop promised that his 21st solo album, Iz It a Crime, would break his radio silence, fighting back against haters and doubters and reaffirming his legacy. Luckily, a defensive Snoop is still classically and effortlessly cool: “Me and Dre at the So-Fi the only way I sell out,” he raps on “Unsung Heroes”

	“Unsung Heroes” is also the album highlight with its droning organ that sounds like it's stripped from an Ethiopian jazz record providing a hot slab of asphalt for Snoop to spit venomous invective. Tracks like “Iz It a Crime?” with its breathy Sade sample and the breezy “Sophisticated Crippin'” are less antagonistic as middle fingers go, listing his achievements and brushing off crumbs. The only other song that really seems to be the State of the Snoop address is “ShutYoBitchAssUp,” which most assume is aimed at former Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight, who has been disputing Snoop's ownership of the label: “I can see why you mad/I bought everything you own/Now you in PC snitching on the phone.”

	However, beyond those tracks, Iz It a Crime? isn't really the pugalistic battle record it's being made out to be. Instead it's another dependable Rhythm & Gangsta offering in a career full of them. There's his cadre of producers he's been using for the last 20-30 years (Battlecat, Soopafly, Denaun, Nottz, Rick Rock); there's the always liquid flow (“I'm talking lolos, a couple of cholos, la vida loco/Facts in a chokehold/Hey Siri, we need some more hoes”); and there's the occasional misstep (in this case, the narcotic would-be-club-banger “Spot”). The duet with still-rising raunch-rapper Sexxy Redd (“Me and OG Snoop”) is naturally electric and Wiz Khalifa shows up like an old friend to get a little wistful (“Just the Way It Iz”). It really is just Snoop being the ever-reliable Snoop — and only a true keyboard warrior could be mad at that.

Lisa and Tyla have linked up for the sweltering new music video for “When I'm With You,” their collaboration from the Blackpink singer/rapper's debut solo album, Alter Ego.


	Directed by Olivia de Camps, the “When I'm With You” clip is set during a wildly hot summer day, with Lisa and Tyla doing their best to keep cool before the sun finally goes down. The beat the heat vibes continue with a late-night pool party, plenty of dancing, a throne made of ice, and an unexpected rainstorm. 


	“When I'm With You” marks the first time Lisa and Tyla have collaborated on a song together, though the pair did link up last year for Rolling Stone's “Musicians on Musicians” series. During the conversation, the pair discussed their favorite foods, fame, pre-show routines, acting, and the sometimes long, winding process of making an album. 


	At the time, Lisa was still working on Alter Ego, and she acknowledged the pressure of prepping her first solo record after the massive success of Blackpink. “I try to have fun as much as I can,” she said. “This moment is going to go super fast. I'm trying to have fun, and I'm learning by taking risks. I feel like, with the group, you've got your girls and they're super supportive. When you have something, you ask them, they give you the best advice. But me working alone is like, ‘Oh.' … ‘Is it the right decision or not?' ‘Oh, my God, what should I do?' That's why I'm taking risks. ‘I feel this, I'm going to do this.' I just have to trust my gut.”

	Lisa released Alter Ego in February. Along with “When I'm With You,” the album featured Lisa's collaboration with Rosalía, “New Woman,” as well as hits “Rockstar,” “Fxck Up the World,” “Moonlit Floor (Kiss Me),” and “Born Again” with Doja Cat and Raye. Lisa also just partnered with Maroon 5, guesting on their new single, “Priceless.”


	As for Tyla, she released her celebrated self-titled debut album last March. In April, she performed at Coachella, where she teased her newest single, “Bliss,” which was officially released a few weeks later.

	With Kesha, it's fair to say that love is (still) her drug. On Friday, the pop star released her single “Boy Crazy,” on which she sings from the perspective of a horny and wild-hearted femme fatale.


	The song opens with Kesha's voice filtered through an almost robotic effect, before she shifts into her signature sweet vocals layered over a hyperpop beat for the rest of the track. “I've been a good girl/Now I'm a connoisseur/Many men are on the menu,” she sings on the new single. “Eat 'em up like amuse-bouche/Boys better beware/I'm on a man tear.” The silly, explicit lyrics on the high-energy party anthem see Kesha be unapologetically sexy and committed to finding a man because “boys are my cocaine.”


	“I'm obsessive/I'm fixating/I want all the boys lately,” she sings on the catchy chorus. “Fly me out and entertain me/Oh, oh I'm boy crazy.”


	The single artwork follows the theme of the track, which sees Kesha being choked by someone who holds a cigarette to her mouth, while another arm holds up a silver telephone to her ear. She shared the single with fans on Vault.fm ahead of its wide release. “Be safe and GO CRAZY,” she teased on her Instagram.

	The new music follows Kesha's country-tinged, T-Pain collaboration “Yippe-Ki-Yay,” which dropped at the end of March. (She also joined him for a performance of the track at Stagecoach.) The singer kicked off the Period, stylized as the punctuation mark (.), album era with “Joyride” last summer, followed by November's “Delusional.” Kesha is set to go on her upcoming headlining arena Tits Out tour in celebration of the upcoming LP.

TORONTO — People travel for all different reasons, from romance, relaxation and adventure to the downright weird and wacky (did you know bat tourism is a real thing?). But one particular niche is rising in the ranks among travellers in search of unique travel experiences, and that's UFO tourism.

With reports of UFO (Unidentified Flying Objects) and UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) sightings increasing in mainstream media, so too is interest among travellers in the pursuit of all things extraterrestrial. Popular UFO festivals like the one in Roswell, New Mexico (the largest in the U.S.) and McMinnville, Oregon (the second largest) attract oddity-seekers from around the world, while a growing number of UFO-inspired hotels (you gotta check out Treehotel's treehouse in Sweden) is also fanning the flames of E.T. fever.

But with Canada having a moment in domestic travel right now, UFO chasers are being called to experience other-worldly adventures here in their own backyard. Sightings of unexplainable objects in the sky are regularly reported in major cities across the country (over 1,000 each year!), giving travellers a new reason to visit some of Canada's top destinations.

So where in Canada gives you the best chance at spotting a UFO? According to a new study by Casino Days, Toronto tops the list with 283 UFO sightings to date and an average duration of 9.84 minutes per visit. Calgary trails behind with 161 sightings and an average duration of 13.86 minutes, followed by Vancouver (158 sightings, 12.78 minutes) and Ottawa (139 sightings, 9.90 minutes) rounding out the top five.

Also making it to the list are Montreal in the #6 spot (119 sightings, 15.35 minutes), Winnipeg in seventh (118 sightings, 14.27 minutes), Victoria in eighth (106 sightings, 9.11 minutes), London in ninth (79 sightings, 7.03 minutes) and, finally, Saskatoon coming in at #10 with 74 sightings to date and the longest average duration of per visit at 20.32 minutes!

But that's not all – Casino Days also ranked the Canadian provinces most likely to survive an alien invasion. Without Will Smith or Tom Cruise to save the day, these cities must rely on their military strength, food supply, freshwater access and population density to withstand a War-of-the-Worlds-esque attack. So, if/when the day comes that extraterrestrials scour the earth, Casino Days suggests running for the hills to Quebec, which boasts a survivability score of 7.96 out of 10. Ontario comes in a close second with a sore of 7.51, followed by Manitoba (7.44), Alberta (7.08) and Newfoundland and Labrador (7.06).

This may sound a bit kooky but for many travellers (and potential clients), it's all weirdly wonderful. So, next time a client requests an out-of-this-world vacation, tell them Canada will be hard to beat.

You've probably heard of the ""Bermuda Triangle""

A roughly 500,000 square mile area inside the Atlantic ocean that runs between Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico where many unexplained things have happened involving boats and airplanes disappearing and never being seen or heard from again.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) there are several theories about why these strange disappearances happen.

Some believe that it's an unexplained force possibly from another dimension.

While others believe it can be explained by science.

Most tropical storms and hurricanes that happen in the Atlantic ocean come through the Bermuda triangle.

Back in the day technology wasn't as sophisticated as it is now which might have caused ships and planes to be lost if they ran into those strong storms.

Michigan has a similar Bermuda triangle that has been known to have many shipwrecks, plane crashes, disappearances along with reports of Unidentified flying objects (UFOs.) and unidentified submerged objects (USOs.)

The Lake Michigan triangle goes from Ludington to Manitowoc, down to Benton Harbor, and back to Ludington.

Just like the Bermuda triangle there are some people that believe something strange and unknown is causing these things to happen.

While there are some that try to explain it from a scientific perspective saying that wind waves could be to blame, the shape of Lake Michigan could allow for dangerous currents along with strong wind to take down a ship.

There is also the possibility of the disappearances being due to  magnetic anomalies caused by magnetic declination and magnetic deviation.

This is the difference between true north and magnetic north, which can be different depending on location.

Lake Michigan deviates four to five degrees westward on average, which could possibly cause problems for an inexperienced sailor or pilot.

I hope that with both the Bermuda Triangle and the Lake Michigan triangle the strange things happening have nothing to do with a weird magnet field or UFO's and instead can be blamed on extreme weather that should be visible on radar giving planes and ships a heads up to try and navigate around it.

Steven Spielberg has been filming a movie this year in New Jersey and New York, but photos on social media suggest that the movie could be a close encounter for Kansas City.

Is the movie set in KC?

Last week a software engineer on X tweeted a photo from the set in New Jersey.

“Steven Spielberg just casually transforming my campus into Kansas City,” he wrote.

He included a photo of a building dressed like a TV station with fake call letters, KCXE, on the front. Another picture showed satellite dishes locked behind a fence with this sign, “KCXE 4 Broadcast Operations.”

In reality, that building is on the campus of the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark.

A photo posted on Reddit showed the same building with the words “Kansas City News” emblazoned on the side in tall red letters.

Details about the film, set for a 2026 release, are sparse, though it is described as a UFO movie, familiar territory for the legendary Oscar-winner who directed “E.T.” and “Close Encounters of the Third Kind.”

Some entertainment outlets have tapped this new film as one of the most anticipated sci-fi movies coming down the road.

In late February, photos published by a local New York newspaper provided the strongest evidence that at least some of the action involves Kansas City.

The Journal News, which covers New York's Lower Hudson Valley, published a series of photos of the filmmaking underway in White Plains, New York.

They showed Spielberg and actress Emily Blunt (“Oppenheimer,” “The Devil Wears Prada”) on the set.

A Kansas City Police Department car was on set, too. Spielberg was seen crouching next to one as he worked.

Another photo showed a Kansas City Royals street signed posted high on a lamppost. It was Royals blue, bore the team's crown-shaped icon, its web address and read: “You're in Royals country. Get your season tickets now.”

“We can see Steven Spielberg there standing next to a cop car. It says Kansas City on that by the way. So clearly parts of it are going to take place in Kansas City,” UFO sleuth Patrick Scott Armstrong said on his podcast, “Vetted,” while discussing the film.

“Even though they're filming in Jersey, they make it seem like Kansas City.”

In March, as Spielberg filmed in Westchester County, New York, a Reddit user reported seeing the local library “dolled up” as the “Jackson County Hospital,” noting that Kansas City is in Jackson County, Missouri.

“I saw the ambulances on set all said Jackson County this morning,” another Reddit user responded.

The Star asked the KC Film Office if it knew anything about the movie and whether, indeed, it takes place in a fake KC.

Spielberg has filmed other projects in the Northeast and is so familiar with the area he reportedly told one mayor to never change his town.

With last year's popular Hallmark Christmas movie about the Chiefs and several reality TV shows filmed here in recent months, the KC film industry is in the midst of “an exciting time,” film office director Rachel Kephart told The Star recently.

“We have world-class crews, diverse locations, geographic accessibility and competitive film incentives that make filming in KC a good business decision,” she said.

Asked about the Spielberg film, the office said in a statement that it did “not have any further details to share regarding this project.”

The film is said to be based on an original story by Spielberg with a screenplay by longtime collaborator David Koepp, who worked with him on the first “Jurassic Park” film and two “Indiana Jones” movies.

The title hasn't been revealed, though it appears to be shooting under the name, “Non-View.”

“Disclosure” and “The Dish” have been bandied about, too.

Blunt stars alongside Wyatt Russell, Colin Firth, Colman Domingo, Josh O'Connor and Eve Hewson.

The film is slated for a June 12, 2026, premiere which sets it up to be Spielberg's return to big summer blockbusters like “Jaws” and “Jurassic Park.”

As for that KCPD car Spielberg huddled against, that vehicle could use a little more Hollywood magic.

“This car does not resemble any Kansas City Missouri Police cars,” KCPD spokesman Jacob Becchina told the Star.","{'href': 'https://www.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","other"

Japan's Defense Ministry was urged to set up an office tasked with tackling UFOs at a meeting with a cross-party group of lawmakers on Friday.

The group, chaired by former Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, handed a proposal to the current defense chief, describing such sightings -- formally referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP -- as realistic and serious national security concerns.

""Our country has fallen behind in responding to UAP, while securing safety in territorial airspace and waters is an urgent matter,"" the group said, calling for the establishment of a Japanese version of the U.S. All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.

The Pentagon office was founded in 2022 to lead U.S. efforts to address UAP through a rigorous scientific framework and a data-driven approach.

The lawmakers also proposed that a new office regularly report the progress of UAP investigations to parliament and disclose information to the public, in addition to conducting scientific analysis of collected data and identifying potential threats.

Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said, ""We will make efforts to meet the expectations"" of the group, which was formed last year.

Annabelle doll`s paranormal tour goes viral on TikTok, reigniting fear and fascination.

The Annabelle doll, long considered one of the most terrifying haunted artefacts in existence, is once again causing panic online—this time on TikTok. With viral videos capturing its appearance during a paranormal tour across the United States, the sinister doll has reignited public fascination and left a new generation questioning the boundaries between fiction and the supernatural.

Chilling return on paranormal tour

In May 2025, Annabelle hit the road as part of the “Devils on the Run Tour,” a travelling showcase featuring cursed relics from the Warrens' Occult Museum. Among the most high-profile stops was the now-defunct Moundsville State Penitentiary in West Virginia—widely regarded as one of the most haunted sites in the U.S.

The event, titled “W.V.P. Lockdown with Annabelle,” was held from 8 to 11 May and drew paranormal enthusiasts from across the country. But it wasn't until Ryan Daniel Buell, known for hosting A&E's Paranormal State, shared his TikTok documentation of the doll's arrival that things took a viral turn.

9.8 million views and counting

One particularly eerie video showing Annabelle being moved into the penitentiary, accompanied by ominous lighting and suspenseful music, has amassed over 9.8 million views and 430,000 likes as of 13 May. The footage has stirred widespread unease among TikTok users, especially those in cities like New Orleans and Connecticut.

While some viewers see the posts as entertainment, others are left genuinely disturbed, citing the doll's dark reputation and the Warrens' longstanding warnings. The viral moment has also reignited debates on whether haunted artefacts should be taken lightly in the era of viral content.

Upcoming appearances in haunted hotspots

Following her West Virginia visit, Annabelle is scheduled to appear in New Orleans, San Antonio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky. These locations, many steeped in their own ghostly legends, have only intensified the doll's mystique. However, Connecticut—Annabelle's original home—is not yet confirmed as a stop, disappointing fans in the state where the legend began.

The Seekers of the Supernatural Paracon, typically hosted at Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, has not yet released its 2025 dates. The annual event, which often features items from the Warrens' collection, remains one of the most anticipated gatherings for paranormal investigators and enthusiasts alike.

The sinister origins

Annabelle's terrifying history dates back to 1970, when a nurse in Hartford, Connecticut, received what seemed to be an innocent Raggedy Ann doll as a gift. According to the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), the doll soon began exhibiting disturbing behaviour—moving on its own, shifting positions, and leaving notes that read “Help us” on parchment paper the owners said they never had.

One of the most alarming incidents reportedly involved the fiancé of one of the roommates, who claimed he woke up one night with the doll crawling on top of him in an attempt to strangle him.

When called to investigate, renowned demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren concluded that the doll was not possessed by a child's spirit, as initially suspected, but rather manipulated by a demonic entity seeking a human host.

Behind glass, but never forgotten

After conducting an exorcism, the Warrens took Annabelle into their care, sealing it in a glass case at their Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut. A warning label on the case reads: “Positively do not open.” Though the museum is no longer open to the public, Annabelle's reputation has grown—thanks in part to Hollywood.

The 2014 film Annabelle, along with its sequels, spun the story into the wider Conjuring cinematic universe, raking in over $800 million globally. This on-screen depiction solidified the doll's status as a modern horror icon.

Whether one believes in paranormal forces or not, the cultural impact of Annabelle is undeniable. While skeptics may argue it's all superstition, the doll's devoted believers would disagree. For them, Annabelle is no mere toy, but a vessel of dark energy—one that should remain locked away at all costs.

Neither fiction nor legend - NASA discovers rock on Mars that looks like a human skull and could be evidence of extraterrestrial life

Life on Mars? This statement has been going around many years ago, but NASA has made a mission to study Mars again. A new discovery could shine a light on this issue since there is a part of Mars where it is believed to have had a lake in the past. Following this theory, scientists are drawn to keep looking for clues about its past as they have possible evidence of life existence to hold on to. So, maybe we already had planet neighbours.

Before getting into the investigation led by NASA, let's explain what a rover is because this is probably one of the most important elements of any mission. The Perseverance rover is a robotic vehicle designed to explore the surface of other planets like in this case Mars. It is fully developed to move around complex lands and send information to Earth with scientific tools.

The perseverance rover started its mission in March 2021 and it made a huge discovery while on Mars on a concrete part called Jezero crater. Thanks to the information obtained from the rover scientists, might conclude life existence here. To fully understand this part of Mars, we need to picture a meteorite crashing against the Red planet creating a hole. This event led scientists to think this hole was once full of water similar to a lake, which plays the main role when it comes to understanding and discovering more about Mars and the past of Mars.

Then, in 2025, the rover reached Port Anson in Mars where dark and light rocks were found. Scientists examined them and a specific rock really caught their attention due to its darkness and angular shapes with little holes – this special rock was given the nickname of ‘Skull Hill'.

The Skull Hill rock is a huge source of information for explaining the functioning of Mars. What the rock shows is that it doesn't belong to where it originally was found, so, having in mind the previously mentioned ‘'lake'', scientists thought it could have been moved by water due to the warm temperature of the planet.

The special rock is not yet categorized, but there is the possibility of it being a volcanic rock because of  its darkness. If this were the case, the origin could be in a volcanic part of the planet which doesn't exist anymore due to the meteorite impact; or in the process of the impact since the rock could be thrown to the surface.

This research provides scientists with valuable data to understand the Red Planet in depth. Moreover, it's a paramount addition to the constant doubt of Mars and life here. The fact that the rover is capable of working in a really fast way, helps researchers to obtain new data long before they would have thought.

NASA is willing to bring the samples from Mars to Earth, so they've already thought of a new mission to take the samples provided by the rover – it is called Mars Sample Return mission, a literal mission name as that's what they would do. However, this mission is holded back because there is no funding enough to start the trip.

Science is full of uncertainty, doubts and mysteries, but they always come up with answers or at least clues that could lead to the solution of anything in the future. This is why it's important to invest in science so scientists can study with no limits – this way the Mars Sample Return mission could be more of a project than an idea.

The WB is getting some major throwback love, with fans and stars alike celebrating the unforgettable shows that shaped a generation. Beloved series like Gilmore Girls, Supernatural, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek are back in the spotlight as viewers reminisce about the classic story lines, iconic casts and era-defining onscreen drama.

Stars from hit shows are catching up with fans — whether it's the Gilmore gals sharing their latest projects, former teen heartthrobs revealing what they've been up to, or the Supernatural family reflecting on their long-running monster-hunting adventures and looking ahead to new chapters. Famous faces like Lauren Graham, Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles and plenty more are dishing on life after The WB, giving Us plenty of updates, reunions and even a few new babies along the way. Whether it's nostalgia or catching up on your faves, these classic WB stories and stars are keeping viewers hooked decades later.

On January 11, 1995, a network launched that would become a destination for younger viewers — one that would have them saying “Oh what a night!” five times a week. 

The WB was a teenager's dream network before it became The CW in 2006, giving fans a ton of eye candy to look at on all of its hit series. 

More than 20 years after Gilmore Girls debuted on October 5, 2000 — and was rebooted in 2016 for a four-part update — viewers are still yearning for more from Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. 

Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles not only formed a close bond with each other while playing brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, respectively, on Supernatural, but they also forged an unbreakable connection offscreen.

...

The Detroit Lions' defensive coaches spoke to the media on Thursday, including new defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard.

Sheppard gave the media some insight into the reintegration of superstar defensive end Aidan Hutchinson into the mix. Hutchinson broke his tibia and fibula while on track for a career year early last season.

""There's not a more resilient, mentally tough guy that that type of injury during that type of season that he was on course of having could have happened to,"" Sheppard said.

""He's the most energetic guy on the field.""

Hutchinson, the No. 2 overall pick in 2022, had just been named the NFC Defensive Player of the Month for September before his injury in Week 6 against the Dallas Cowboys. He's already racked up 7.5 sacks on the year and was an early favorite for Defensive Player of the Year.

Sheppard said he checked in with Hutchinson during drills on Thursday after seeing how well he looked.

""I said, 'Hutch, you know how I know you back?' He's like, 'How?'"" Sheppard said.

""'Because you're touching that ground when you run that hoop.' That's that little thing he does like he's some supernatural cat, which he is.""

Sheppard is entering his first season as Lions defensive coordinator after Aaron Glenn's departure to take over as New York Jets head coach.

Being abducted by little green men might seem like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. But specialists have said people with one little-discussed issue may experience something strikingly close to this scenario.

In a social media post, sleep scientist Dr Matt Walker, from the University of California, Berkeley, delved into the terrifying phenomenon of sleep paralysis, which affects only a small number of people. ""Experiencing paralysis upon waking is known as REM sleep paralysis,"" he explained.

""Normally, during REM sleep, the brain induces muscle atonia (temporary paralysis) to prevent dream enactment. Occasionally, consciousness can return slightly before muscle control, affecting roughly 25 per cent of people.

""Fascinatingly, REM sleep paralysis experiences often parallel narratives of alleged alien abductions. Dr Eti Simon theorises that muscle atonia's primary evolutionary function might be restorative, with dreaming subsequently co-opting this physiologic state.""

Sleep paralysis is characterized by the terrifying inability to move or speak during the process of waking up or falling asleep. This bewildering condition typically occurs during deep REM sleep, which is commonly associated with dreaming phases.

People who have encountered sleep paralysis often report feeling a force pressing down on them or even sensing the presence of someone - or something - in the room with them. This puzzling phenomenon is not only tied to explanations for supposed alien abductions, but could also be a plausible explanation for ghost encounters and other supernatural experiences.

Psychologist Dr Louise Goddard-Crawley previously told MailOnline: ""From a scientific perspective, these hallucinations in sleep paralysis are manifestations of our internal mental processes rather than meaningful messages from an external source. Some people may perceive threatening figures or monsters, while others may experience more neutral or even positive hallucinations. The specific form that these hallucinations take can be influenced by cultural depictions, personal beliefs, and individual psychological factors.""

Although it's unclear how sleep paralysis happens, the UK's NHS states that it may be linked to conditions like insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalised anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. It tends to occur more frequently in people with a family history of the condition.

Fortunately, you can do a few things to minimise its effects. One of the most effective is to make sure you go to bed at roughly the same time each day, and regularly get seven to nine hours of sleep.

On the flipside, patients are also encouraged to avoid smoking, eating a big meal, or drinking alcohol or caffeine shortly before bed. Sleeping on your back is discouraged, too.

It's essential to seek medical advice if you feel scared to go to sleep or feel continually exhausted due to sleep paralysis.

Being abducted by aliens may sound like something pulled straight out of a science-fiction movie. Yet, experts say people who suffer one little-known issue may 'experience' an eerily similar ordeal.

Dr Matt Walker, Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, has spent years studying the science of sleep. In a new Instagram post, he shed light on the frightening phenomenon of sleep paralysis, experienced by just a small fraction of people.

""Experiencing paralysis upon waking is known as REM sleep paralysis,"" he explained. ""Normally, during REM sleep, the brain induces muscle atonia (temporary paralysis) to prevent dream enactment. Occasionally, consciousness can return slightly before muscle control, affecting roughly 25 per cent of people.

""Fascinatingly, REM sleep paralysis experiences often parallel narratives of alleged alien abductions. Dr Eti Simon theorises that muscle atonia's primary evolutionary function might be restorative, with dreaming subsequently co-opting this physiologic state.""

As Dr Walker suggests, sleep paralysis describes a state in which a person cannot move or speak while waking up or falling asleep. Although it's unclear how this occurs, it is generally believed to happen when someone reaches deep REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which is usually when we dream. 

People who experience this phenomenon often describe the sensation of something pushing them down, or even feel like there is someone else in the room. Some say this could explain supposed alien abductions, as well as alleged ghost sightings and other forms of paranormal activity. 

Psychologist Dr Louise Goddard-Crawley previously told MailOnline: ""From a scientific perspective, these hallucinations in sleep paralysis are manifestations of our internal mental processes rather than meaningful messages from an external source. Some people may perceive threatening figures or monsters, while others may experience more neutral or even positive hallucinations. The specific form that these hallucinations take can be influenced by cultural depictions, personal beliefs, and individual psychological factors.""

While it's unclear how sleep paralysis happens, the NHS states that it may be linked to conditions like insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalised anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. It's also more common among people with a family history of the issue.

Thankfully, you can do a few things to alleviate its effects. It is especially recommended that you go to bed at roughly the same time each day and regularly get seven to nine hours of sleep. 

Meanwhile, patients are also advised to avoid smoking, and shouldn't eat a big meal or drink alcohol or caffeine shortly before bed. Sleeping on your back is discouraged, too. 

It's crucial to seek GP advice if you feel terrified to go to sleep or feel constantly tired due to sleep paralysis. NHS guidance adds: ""A GP may be able to treat an underlying condition that could be triggering sleep paralysis such as insomnia or post-traumatic stress disorder. If this does not help they might refer you to a doctor who specialises in sleep conditions.""

""Strict Scrutiny"" co-host Leah Litman has the profile of a person who, in previous eras, would seem like a defender of the Supreme Court. She's a law professor at the University of Michigan and once worked as a law clerk for former Justice Anthony Kennedy. In recent years, she's become one of the most outspoken critics of how the current iteration of the nation's highest court has abandoned good faith readings of the law, basic legal reasoning, and even facts in pursuit of a far-right agenda. In her new book, ""Lawless: How the Supreme Court Runs on Conservative Grievance, Fringe Theories, and Bad Vibes,"" Litman chronicles the decline of this once-venerated institution. She spoke with Salon about her book and how recent cases suggest the court is getting even more unhinged in this second Donald Trump administration. 

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

I listened to oral arguments for Mahmoud v. Taylor, and I was struck by how victimized Sam Alito acted during the entire thing. He felt he was being oppressed by this children's book called ""Uncle Bobby's Wedding."" It perfectly illustrated the thesis of your book, which is about how much the jurisprudence of the current Supreme Court is all vibes and grievance. What were you thinking when you listened to those arguments?

I don't know whether to laugh or to cry. The justices keep providing me with so much content and so much material after I finished the manuscript. It perfectly reflects this notion of conservative grievance: the idea that social conservatives, religious conservatives, all the core parts of the Republican constituency, are the real victims. And there's no discrimination except against white evangelical Christians. That worldview was on display.

""The uncomfortable reality is that a conspiracy theory-laden universe is in full swing at the Supreme Court.""

This is a children's book about a young girl being concerned that when her favorite uncle got married, he'd have less time for her. Justice Alito read it as a personal attack and rank discrimination against religious conservatives like him because her favorite uncle happened to be getting married to a man. Apparently, acknowledging that some men marry men whom they love is discrimination against Sam Alito and people who believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. It was stunning in its clarity.

I don't know what's going on in his head, but it's hard to use any word but ""lying"" to describe his claims during arguments. He said that the little girl in the book objected to the marriage cause she was homophobic, when she loved her gay uncle, and just didn't want him to have less time for her.

The projection is very telling. Justice Alito read this book, where Chloe is concerned about her uncle's upcoming wedding, and Justice Alito seemed to read into Chloe his own views. He imagined Chloe saying something like, ""Mommy, I have a sincere religious objection to Uncle Bobby's marriage to a man."" And then he interpreted her mother as saying something like, ""No, Chloe, that's bad. You can't think that. Men get to marry men because that's the future liberals want."" 

Of course, Chloe and her mother said no such thing. He read the mere acknowledgement that a man would marry a man as an expression of hostility to his worldview, which is that same-sex marriages shouldn't exist at all. Acknowledging their existence, acknowledging the existence of LGBT people, he perceives as an attack on him, because the jurisprudence he is fashioning is all about bringing about a world where gays, lesbians, and bisexuals are not allowed to have civil rights and are not allowed to live openly.

There's been this myth for a long time that there might be liberal judges and conservative judges, but they all adhere to the same belief that they should follow the facts and they should follow the law. Brett Kavanaugh talked about it as ""calling balls and strikes."" To reject the obvious reading of a children's picture book suggests that's not the case. How far have they drifted from those basic principles?

Oh, I would say quite far. It wasn't just Sam Alito, although he is the best example and encapsulation of this conservative grievance, bad vibes, fringe theory direction that the Supreme Court is headed in. During the same oral argument, you had Neil Gorsuch insisting that the book ""Pride Puppy"" involved a sex worker who was into bondage. If you read the book, there is a woman wearing a leather jacket, and she's at a Pride parade. Neil Gorsuch took from that and insisted, no, the book actually involves bondage and sex workers.

""The Republican justices are where the Republican Party is.""

Examples are myriad. In the 303 Creative case, which also concerned LGBTQ equality, you have the court insisting the case involved a wedding website designer with sincere religious objections, who was going to be forced to make a wedding website for a same-sex wedding. The person did not specialize in wedding website design. She did not sell her business as a designer of websites from a religious perspective. And the one alleged request she received for a same-sex wedding was submitted by someone who claimed they never submitted such a request, who was a website designer themselves, and was a man married to a woman.

The Supreme Court has been running on these fast and loose characterizations of the facts for a while. We all can have a good laugh at the idea that ""Uncle Bobby's Wedding"" is a personal attack on people who don't believe in marriage equality. But the uncomfortable reality is that a conspiracy theory-laden universe is in full swing at the Supreme Court. It's a court captured by far-right conspiracy theories. That worldview interferes with their assessment of the law, their assessment of the facts, and their ability to engage with reality.

Sam Alito and, to a large extent, Clarence Thomas get the most attention for having their brains poisoned by this stuff. But a lot of people think Chief Justice John Roberts isn't so bad.

Look, there are differences between the Republican appointees, but the reality is, on the big picture level, they are in lockstep in important ways. Chief Justice Roberts, this purported moderate institutionalist, struck down the key provision of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County versus Holder by inserting a misleading ellipsis into a quotation he drew from one of his previous opinions. He inserted this ellipsis, so the sentence meant the literal opposite of what it had actually said.

This is the same Chief Justice who wrote the sweeping immunity ruling that effectively placed the president above the law. And people ask why Donald Trump thinks he's above the law. Some of the president's more expansive, outlandish assertions of executive power draw from this idea of the unitary executive theory, which is the idea that the Constitution gives the president and the president alone all of the executive power. It's that idea that the president relied on to fire inspectors general, to fire the heads of commissions like the National Labor Relations Board or the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission. Guess who wrote that the Constitution puts all of the executive power in the president: John Roberts. He was writing the same for the Reagan administration back when he was a lawyer in the Reagan administration.

People mistake the forest for the trees. It's more interesting to focus on the differences between the Republican appointees. It is closer to reality to acknowledge that on these super high-profile, ideologically salient cases, the Republican justices are where the Republican Party is. 

There's a recent case where reporting suggests that Samuel Alito was trying to slow walk a lawsuit regarding a bus full of Venezuelan immigrants that they were trying to send to that El Salvador in prison. The rest of the court stepped in and stopped Alito from doing that and rushed out a decision that ended up probably saving those men's lives. What is your read on that particular situation?

Some lower courts had blocked the government from relying on the Alien Enemies Act to summarily expel people to this foreign megaprison in El Salvador. The case went up to the United States Supreme Court on a request for emergency relief, blocking the government from carrying out these renditions. The Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration and released its order blocking the deportation before Alito finished his dissent. In doing so, they likely saved these men from being sent to El Salvador because they got the order out before the men could be transported.

What to read from that? It's a little hard to know. I'd imagine that the Supreme Court is responding in part to the administration's blatant disregard, if not outright defiance of their previous order in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, which told the administration to facilitate Mr. Abrego Garcia's return. The administration's response has basically been, ""make me."" Then Stephen Miller characterized the decision in Abrego Garcia as a unanimous win for the administration. That's definitely not true. As to whether they thought they can't wait on Justice Alito, because he is trying to buy the Trump administration time to deport these men, I'm not sure.  

We need your help to stay independent

Trump got this immunity decision, and he seems to recognize that, as you argue in this book, these six Republican judges are going to bend over backwards to misinterpret the law to help him out. There is another case that just got going, where 12 Democratic attorneys general are suing, claiming Trump's tariffs are illegal. Which seems right to me, though I'm not a lawyer. It will be another interesting test of whether or not the Supreme Court has a limit. What are your thoughts on that case? Because it is a situation where Trump's agenda is so different than the standard Republican agenda.

If you look back at the first Trump administration, there was this case challenging the entire Affordable Care Act. The state of Texas sued on this cockamamie theory that the entire Affordable Care Act had become unconstitutional when Congress reduced the penalty for not having health insurance to $0. And the Trump administration joined Texas's lawsuit, to ask the court to strike down the entirety of the Affordable Care Act. That was a Trump thing. It was not the consensus position of the Republican caucus, which had voted down efforts to repeal the entirety of the Affordable Care Act.

In that case, the Supreme Court rejects the Trump administration's request. That's another example where the zeitgeist of the Republican Party is not exactly tracking what Donald Trump is asking for. And in those instances, you have a Republican court majority that is probably closer to the median Republican in Congress or than they are to Donald Trump. Now, that means, of course, they are enabling Trump, left and right and all over the place, you know, and are on board with a lot of his agenda. But it does mean there are some differences.

It seems to me that the Supreme Court often oversteps with regard to this Christian nationalist agenda. Or is it larger than that?

I think it is larger than that. I agree that one of the ideas they are most committed to is that conservative Christians are the victims of a society that doesn't share their views. But they are also very committed to the idea that white conservatives accused of racial discrimination are very put upon. That idea has inflected a lot of their jurisprudence on voting rights. This term, they are hearing another Voting Rights Act case that asks them to say it's actually unconstitutional racial discrimination for states to try to ensure that black voters are represented in districting. It's super transparent in the cases of religion, but it's definitely present in other areas of law as well.

When I'm chatting with people on social media, I find the Supreme Court situation is the source of almost nihilistic pessimism. There are six Republican-appointed justices. As you said, they are in lockstep with this increasingly ridiculous, paranoid agenda. There is no sense that will change any time soon. They sometimes seem to have king-like powers. Should people feel this hopeless? Are there reasons to feel that this can get better?

Related

I understand the feeling of hopelessness. I definitely feel depressed sometimes. But, just like we tell people not to obey in advance for the Trump administration, don't obey in advance for the Supreme Court, either. If you have a great law or policy that you think will meaningfully improve people's lives, and you think it's constitutional, do it. Make them strike it down. Make them pay the price for taking away people's healthcare, voting rights, and whatnot.

Second, if you are that convinced that the Supreme Court is such a destructive force on society, you should try to convince other people of that as well. If we do that, we might be in a situation where the next time progressives, the Democratic Party, the left have political power, they could exercise that political power in ways that reduce the destructive potential and powers of this Supreme Court.

The other thing that gives me hope is the polling on the Trump administration on immigration and other matters, and especially the polling on the Supreme Court. A majority of the country is not on board with their wild grievance-laden, retributive agenda. And so that gives me hope. Just because these weirdos on the Supreme Court are doing this doesn't mean the rest of the country is OK with it.

How much of this is Mitch McConnell's fault?

Mitch McConnell is a key figure in my book for a reason. Even when Republicans aren't on board with what Trump is doing, the Republican Party and people like Mitch McConnell own absolutely everything he is doing. They have enabled him and they continue to do so. It doesn't really matter if Mitch McConnell is occasionally voting against the nominee, voting against tariffs, or whatnot. He held open a Supreme Court seat to give Donald Trump a better chance of being elected president. He refused to impeach Donald Trump when Donald Trump attacked our democracy. He has held open seats to make room for radical extremists on the lower courts who have done absolutely wild things, like order nationwide bans on medication abortion. He owns a lot of this, and he should be remembered as such.

Researchers have discovered an ancient moth-like sea predator in a treasure trove of museum fossils in Canada. The half-a-billion-year-old creature, Mosura fentoni, reveals that Cambrian arthropods were more diverse than previously thought.

Half a billion years ago, a feisty predator flapped around the primordial seas, hooking prey into its mouth while breathing through long gills on its butt.

Researchers recently discovered this 506 million-year-old creature, called Mosura fentoni, in a cache of museum fossils in Canada. The fossils suggest that these early arthropods were more diverse than previously thought. The team thinks the now-extinct arthropod would have looked a bit like a moth — a distant living cousin — so they named it after Mothra, the fictional giant moth from Japanese cinema.

Whereas Mothra is large enough to battle Godzilla on the silver screen, the real-life M. fentoni was only about the size of a human finger. Despite its small size, this tiny creature represents a huge and rare find for scientists.

The M. fentoni fossils, plucked mostly from the Burgess Shale rock formation in the Canadian Rockies, are so well preserved that they include intricate details of the species' biology, including the creature's nervous system, circulatory system and digestive tract. This is extremely rare for fossils, which scarcely preserve soft tissues, and helps shed light on the evolution of ancient arthropods.

""Very few fossil sites in the world offer this level of insight into soft internal anatomy,"" study co-author Jean-Bernard Caron, the Richard M. Ivey curator of invertebrate paleontology at the Royal Ontario Museum, said in a statement. ""We can see traces representing bundles of nerves in the eyes that would have been involved in image processing, just like in living arthropods. The details are astounding.""

The researchers published their findings Wednesday (May 14) in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

Arthropods are a large group of invertebrates with hard exoskeletons, segmented bodies and jointed legs. Today, they make up around three-quarters of all living animals, including insects, arachnids and crustaceans. One of the reasons for their evolutionary success is their specialized body segments. These variable segments have helped arthropods diversify within their groups and ultimately become everything from horseshoe crabs to moths.

M. fentoni belonged to a group of ancestral arthropods called radiodonts, identifiable by shared features like side flaps and head appendages. These invertebrates thrived during the Cambrian period (541 million to 485 million years ago), but their fossils have shown relatively uniform body segments with little variety, until now.

Researchers collected 60 fossils of the newly described species between 1990 and 2022, primarily from the Raymond Quarry, part of Yoho National Park in British Columbia. Many of these specimens had been sitting in the Royal Ontario Museum for years until the authors of the new study took a closer look at them. The team also identified one other specimen in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., according to the study.

""Museum collections, old and new, are a bottomless treasure trove of information about the past,"" study lead author Joe Moysiuk, curator of paleontology and geology at the Manitoba Museum, said in the statement. ""If you think you've seen it all before, you just need to open up a museum drawer.""

—500 million-year-old worm with 'shuriken' spikes named after gigantic 'Dune' sandworms

—Giant 'sea dragon' fossil could be largest mosasaur ever discovered in Mississippi

—'Hell ant' with scythe-like jaws may be oldest ant fossil ever discovered

The researchers photographed and scanned the fossils to build a picture of this ancient creature's biology. They found that, unlike other radiodonts, M. fentoni had lots of body segments on its rear, which were lined with gills. The species also had the longest gills relative to body length of all known radiodonts, despite being among the smallest, according to the study.

The team concluded that the back-end gills were most likely a specialized system for respiration; horseshoe crabs, wood lice and some other living arthropods have subsequently evolved a similar system. Researchers aren't certain why M. fentoni needed the long butt gills, but they speculated it was an adaptation to low-oxygen environments or an active lifestyle — possibly a very active reproductive lifestyle — that required greater oxygen consumption. Either way, the discovery highlights that radiodonts were more diverse than previously thought.

""Radiodonts were the first group of arthropods to branch out in the evolutionary tree, so they provide key insight into ancestral traits for the entire group,"" Caron said. ""The new species emphasizes that these early arthropods were already surprisingly diverse and were adapting in a comparable way to their distant modern relatives.""

For all the worry about tariffs causing pain for American consumers, shoppers have so far been mostly shielded from — or shrugged off — higher prices at the checkout aisle. 

Businesses absorbed much of the costs from new levies as they took effect last month, economic reports this week indicated. Profit margins at retailers and wholesalers shrank in April by the most in almost a year. Manufacturers signaled they are paying higher prices. Yet consumer inflation remained tame, and Walmart Inc. reported solid sales as it kept prices low.  ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

A pair of Amazon.com Inc. package delivery drones were flying through a light rain in mid-December when, within minutes of one another, they both committed robot suicide.

Shortly before 10 a.m. on Dec. 16, the first Prime Air drone dropped its package at a dummy residence at the company's rural Oregon testing range, then flew back to an asphalt pad to begin its landing sequence. Instead, some 217 feet (66 meters) in the air, the aircraft cut power to its six propellers, fell to the ground and was destroyed. Four minutes later and 183 feet over the taxiway, a second Prime Air drone did the same thing. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Do you think taxpayers won't notice?

There is nothing conservative about the budget reconciliation bill emerging from the House. Even by Washington's ever-declining standards of fiscal responsibility, this budget stands out as a dereliction of duty. By subverting rules meant to promote sound management, it takes today's alarming projections of government deficits and makes them much worse, creating a ticking time bomb.

As things stand, federal debt held by the public — which is at its highest point since 1946 — is already slated to rise from about 100% of gross domestic product this year to 117% by 2034. And that's before the new budget pours fuel on the fiscal fire.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

President Donald Trump took aim at the Supreme Court, fellow Republicans and several celebrities Friday in a series of social media screeds that underscore the domestic political challenges he faces and the personal grievances he won't let go.

""I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States,"" Trump wrote about the iconic American rock star.

""Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,"" he added, after Springsteen called Trump's administration ""treasonous.""

Trump accused the U.S. Supreme Court of getting ""played,"" and he admonished Republican ""grandstanders"" threatening to derail his legislative agenda in Congress.

He even took a swipe at pop icon Taylor Swift, claiming ""she's no longer 'HOT'"" and taking credit for her purported decline.

Trump sent all four Truth Social posts within an hour during his flight back to the U.S. from Abu Dhabi, where he had just wrapped a four-day tour through the Middle East.

The posts show the president shifting his focus back to domestic issues, where he faces fresh political headwinds. They include a major setback for his massive tax-cut bill Friday and a contentious bout of Supreme Court oral arguments Thursday related to his controversial birthright citizenship order.

The attacks also showcased Trump's trademark willingness to lash out at his perceived enemies — in politics and culture alike.

""Has anyone noticed that, since I said 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,' she's no longer 'HOT?'"" Trump wrote, referencing a prior social media post he sent after Swift endorsed his 2024 campaign rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris.

The whirlwind trip to the Middle East was marked by a slew of business deals and flattery for the U.S. president from Gulf State leaders.

While he was away, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a high-profile dispute over Trump's executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, the longstanding policy that anyone born in the U.S. is a citizen.

The three liberal justices on the nine-seat court appeared highly skeptical of the arguments presented by U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer. Some of the court's conservatives — including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee — also asked pointed questions of the government.

Trump wrote that the Supreme Court ""IS BEING PLAYED BY THE RADICAL LEFT LOSERS, WHO HAVE NO SUPPORT, THE PUBLIC HATES THEM, AND THEIR ONLY HOPE IS THE INTIMIDATION OF THE COURT, ITSELF.""

""WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY!"" he wrote.

Soon after, he shared another call for congressional Republicans to ""UNITE"" in order to pass a single bill that includes the bevy of tax cuts and other items Trump promised during his presidential campaign.

""Not only does it cut Taxes for ALL Americans, but it will kick millions of Illegal Aliens off of Medicaid to PROTECT it for those who are the ones in real need,"" Trump claimed.

If his ""one, big, beautiful bill"" does not pass, he wrote, it ""will be blamed on the Democrats, but that doesn't help our Voters.""

""We don't need 'GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party,"" he said. ""STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!""

Trump's demands failed to sway enough Republicans on the House Budget Committee to advance the bill, however. The legislation was blocked Friday amid opposition from conservatives.

On Wednesday, Springsteen delivered a searing criticism of Trump and, apparently, DOGE leader Elon Musk.

""In America they are persecuting people for using their right to free speech and voicing their dissent,"" said the 75-year-old rocker, who has been an outspoken supporter of Democratic candidates.

""The richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the world's poorest children to sickness and death. This is happening now,"" Springsteen said.

Trump lambasted Springsteen's looks and accused him of being ""dumb as a rock,"" before declaring that he ""ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country.""

""Then we'll all see how it goes for him!"" Trump wrote.

Earlier this week, Anthropic received a $2.5 billion, five-year revolving credit line to amp up its liquidity in an ever-expanding — and expensive — competition in the artificial intelligence industry.

Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI research executives, launched its Claude chatbot in March 2023.

The company closed its latest funding round in March at a $61.5 billion valuation, and the new credit facility adds to that. The company said it plans to use it to strengthen its balance sheet and invest as it scales rapidly.

Annualized revenue reached $2 billion in the first quarter, the company confirmed, more than doubling from a $1 billion rate in the prior period. Revenue chief Kate Jensen said in a recent interview with CNBC that the number of customers spending more than $100,000 annually with Anthropic jumped eightfold from a year ago.

Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Canada and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group all participated in the credit facility.

Companies are seeking more funding and liquidity than ever before as the AI arms race intensifies. 

The generative AI market is poised to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade. Companies from Google and Amazon to Anthropic and Perplexity are racing to announce new products and features, especially as the race to build ""AI agents"" intensifies.

""This revolving credit facility provides Anthropic significant flexibility to support our continued exponential growth,"" Krishna Rao, Anthropic's finance chief, said in a statement. ""The backing of these global financial institutions is a testament to the strength of our business and the resonance of our mission.""

OpenAI announced similar news in October, when CNBC reported it had received a $4 billion revolving line of credit. The influx brought the company's total liquidity to more than $10 billion and came soon after it closed a funding round at a then-valuation of $157 billion.

JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Santander, Wells Fargo, SMBC, UBS, and HSBC all participated. OpenAI's base credit line is $4 billion, with an option to increase it by an additional $2 billion.

            US President Donald Trump just finished a lavish tour of Gulf Arab states, where every one of the three energy-rich nations he visited had a long wish list from the American leader.

Trump is visiting three of the world's richest nations. Here's what's on their wish list



            While those nations reaped some big rewards from the trip, they fell short of others.
    


            Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates all “wanted to showcase they were open for business, which they were able to do, and they wanted to get the US on side,” Dina Esfandiary, Middle East lead for Bloomberg Economics, told CNN. “They wanted to show that they were back in terms of being in America's graces,” she said, adding that in return, Trump was able to get massive deals with headline figures.
    


            Gulf countries have been looking to revamp their ties with the US, moving away from a transactional oil-for-security understanding to stronger partnerships that are rooted in bilateral investments and shared visions.
    


            It was a “new dawn” in the US' relationship with the Gulf, Jasmine El-Gamal, a Middle East analyst and former adviser to the Pentagon told CNN's Becky Anderson.
    


            Here's what we know about what the Gulf states got, and didn't get, out of Trump's visit.
    


            Saudi Arabia wanted a formalized security deal with the US. While it didn't get that, experts say it came significantly closer to one.
    


            “Saudi may not have gotten their formalized security agreement, but there was a lot of talk around it… So this may have been, rather than the culmination of the process, the continuation of the conversation,” Esfandiary said, adding that Washington  may not be as enthusiastic about the arrangement as Riyadh has been.
    


            Last year, the two nations came close to finalizing a landmark defense and trade pact – but the deal stalled over the Saudi insistence that Israel commit to a path toward Palestinian statehood.
    


            Riyadh did get a handful of arms deals during Trump's trip that may pave the way for a wider agreement, however, experts said.
    


            At a formal signing ceremony in a gilded ballroom at the Saudi capital's Royal Court on Tuesday, Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman signed memoranda of understanding, letters of intent and other executive agreements spanning different government agencies.
    


            Saudi Arabia also committed $600 billion in US investments, including an expansive defense partnership valued at nearly $142 billion, which the White House has touted as the “largest defense sales agreement in history.”
    


            The visit fell short of offering Riyadh US cooperation on a civilian nuclear program, which the kingdom had been eyeing.

The latest on Trump's presidency as he wraps up Middle East trip



            The program has been held up over Saudi Arabia's insistence on enriching uranium domestically – raising concerns in the US and Israel over nuclear weapons proliferation. Uranium, when enriched to high levels, can be used to produce nuclear weapons.
    


            For the Saudis, the détente between the US and Syria was also a major diplomatic win. During his visit, Trump met and had tea with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former jihadist who until recently had a $10 million US bounty on his head. The US president also announced that he plans to lift sanctions that had been placed on former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, possibly breathing life back into the country's crippled finances.
    


            Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, have been keen to invest in Syria and prop up its economy but have been wary of violating US sanctions. Trump's move is likely to remove such barriers, making way for potentially billions of dollars in investments and returns.
    


            Having the rapprochement between the US and Syria take place under Saudi auspices may give Riyadh greater opportunities in Damascus.
    


            Saudi Arabia ultimately got a “real expression of American commitment” to the kingdom, Esfandiary said.
    


            Qatar this week received its first-ever official state visit by a US president. The last time a sitting US leader visited the nation was in 2003, when former President George W. Bush paid a visit to Central Command headquarters, where he addressed US military personnel.
    


            Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, said that talks with Trump on this trip will “give new impetus to the existing strategic cooperation between our two countries in various fields.”
    


            The two nations signed a host of deals during Trump's visit, including a $96 billion agreement for Qatar to acquire up to 210 American-made Boeing planes, according to a White House factsheet.
    


            Trump also accepted a Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qataris, to be used initially as Air Force One. The American president accepted the mammoth jet despite the ethical and legal controversies it raised. Critics have accused Qatar of seeking to gain influence in the Trump administration through the gift.
    


            In an interview with CNN's Becky Anderson, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani dismissed the criticism.
    


            “Why would we buy an influence in the United States?” he said. “If you look just in the last 10 years in the US-Qatar relationship, Qatar has been always there for the US, when it's needed, whether it's on the war against terror, whether it's in the evacuation of Afghanistan, whether it's on releasing hostages from… different countries around the world.”
    

In a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Becky Anderson, Qatar's Prime Minister addresses regional issues, relations with the U.S., and plans to give a luxurious Boeing 747 jet to the Trump administration.

            Doha's biggest win was perhaps the security assurances received from Trump, in which the US vowed to “protect” its longtime security partner in the face of threats.
    


            “We are going to protect this country,” Trump said at a business roundtable, noting how close Qatar is to Iran.
    


            “For this country in particular, because you're right next door, you're a stone's throw away, not even, right? You're a foot away. You can walk right into Iran,” he said.
    


            Qatar is the Gulf Arab nation with the most formalized security ties with Washington. It hosts the biggest US military installation in the Middle East, which the State Department describes as “indispensable” for US military operations in the region.
    


            The UAE's main target from Trump's trip was deeper investments on AI and technology, and while it achieved victories in that regard, the visit fell short of what Abu Dhabi really wanted: unrestricted access to advanced American microchips.
    


            During Trump's visit to the UAE, the two countries announced a partnership to build a massive data center complex in Abu Dhabi to advance AI capabilities with 5-gigawatts of capacity – enough to power a major city.
    


            Lennart Heim, an associate information scientist at the RAND Corporation think tank, said the new complex would require over 2 million chips.
    


            “To put the new 5GW AI campus in Abu Dhabi into perspective. It would support up to 2.5 million NVIDIA B200s. That's bigger than all other major AI infrastructure announcements we've seen so far,” he wrote on X.
    


            “Investing in AI, which has been the focus of President Trump's trip, really cements the UAE as a major player in this space,” Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN's Becky Anderson, adding that on the geopolitical level, the US is asking the UAE to work with Washington on AI, and not with other competitors like China.
    


            The UAE hopes to become a global leader in AI by 2031, but it needs American chips to achieve this goal. Under the Biden administration, the US had tightened curbs on AI exports to keep advanced technology out of the hands of foreign adversaries such as China, which the UAE has been hoping to see eased.
    


            The chips may, however, soon become available to the UAE.
    


            A source familiar with the matter told CNN Friday that “things are moving ahead with a preliminary agreement between the US and Abu Dhabi which could ease the import of cutting-edge AI chips.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            Trump said on Friday that both countries agreed to create a “path” for the Gulf state to buy some of the most advanced AI semiconductors from US.
    


            “Much like the other two countries, it (Trump's visit) was a win,” Esfandiary said. “They signed a lot of deals, they got a lot of headlines,” she added.
    


            “And that's what counted the most – there appears to be a level of confidence in the UAE about this relationship and the state of it right now with the US.”

Lawyers hired by Venezuela have been unable to confirm ‘proof of life' for 252 migrants imprisoned in El Salvador

Lawyers for 252 Venezuelans deported by the Trump administration and imprisoned in El Salvador for two months have alleged that the migrants are victims of physical and emotional “torture”.

A law firm hired by the Venezuelan government said that it had been unable to visit the migrants in the mega-prison where they are locked up.

The lawyers are seeking “proof of life”, but say they have come up against a wall of silence from President Nayib Bukele's administration and the Central American nation's justice system.

Grupo Ortega filed a habeas corpus petition with the supreme court on 24 March seeking an end to what it calls the “illegal detention” of the Venezuelans, but is still waiting for a ruling.

“They are treating them like common criminals,” lawyer Salvador Ríos said, after the migrants were shown dressed in prison clothing, shackled and with shaved heads.

“This is torture,” both physically and psychologically, Rios said in an interview with AFP.

The lawyers delivered a letter in early May to Bukele, a key ally of Donald Trump, requesting authorization to visit the Venezuelans, but so far without success.

AFP sought a comment from the Salvadorian presidency about the case and the lawyers' efforts, but has not received a response.

Félix Ulloa, the Salvadorian vice-president, told the French media outlet Le Grand Continent that his government merely provides a “service that we could call prison accommodation”.

Trump's administration has paid Bukele's government millions of dollars to lock up migrants it says are criminals and gang members.

Trump invoked rarely used wartime legislation in March to fly migrants to El Salvador without any court hearing, alleging they belonged to the Tren de Aragua gang, a charge that their families and lawyers deny.

The Venezuelans, as well as 36 deported Salvadorian migrants, are being held in a maximum-security prison built by Bukele to house thousands of suspects arrested during his sweeping crackdown on street gangs.

Images of the Venezuelans entering the Cecot mega-prison in shackles illustrate the brutality, Ríos said.

“The damage is not only physical, but also psychological,” Ríos said.

In their letter to Bukele, the lawyers sought permission to interview the prisoners, either in person or virtually, which could serve as “proof of life”.

They asked Bukele to release the list of the 252 Venezuelans, something that Washington has not done either.

One Salvadorian migrant who was initially incarcerated in Cecot – but in April was moved to a prison farm – is Kilmar Ábrego García, a US resident deported due to what the United States itself admitted was an administrative error.

A Venezuelan identified in US court documents as “Cristian” was also mistakenly expelled.

In both cases, US judges unsuccessfully ordered the Trump administration to facilitate their return to the United States.

Volker Türk, the UN human rights chief, said this week that the situation “raises serious concerns regarding a wide array of rights that are fundamental to both US and international law”.

“Families we have spoken to have expressed a sense of complete powerlessness in the face of what has happened and their pain at seeing their relatives labelled and handled as violent criminals, even terrorists, without any court judgment as to validity of what is claimed against them,” he said in a statement.

Isael Guerrero, another lawyer with Grupo Ortega, described the detentions as “completely illegal” because the Venezuelans “are not being legally prosecuted in any court” in El Salvador.

The firm's head, Jaime Ortega, said they were “100% migrants”.

“Not a single one of them is being prosecuted” in the United States for their alleged membership of the Tren de Aragua gang, he said.

The fate of the Venezuelans now depends entirely on Bukele, as “the expulsion completely nullifies US jurisdiction”, Ortega said.

In April, Bukele offered to trade the 252 Venezuelans for an equal number of political prisoners held by President Nicolás Maduro's government.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The experiences of Inuit people and scientific data show the impacts of climate change and how it disproportionately affects Canada's Far North. Arctic sea ice is central to Inuit life – Labrador Inuit communities have more than four dozen Inuttitut terms for sea ice. And the weakening of the ice as a result of climate change poses a tangible threat: stifling access for remote fly-in communities, cutting off essential goods and endangering Inuit peoples' traditions, including hunting and fishing. 

Jenn Thornhill Verma, investigative journalist and Pulitzer Ocean Reporting Fellow, takes The Decibel to the northeastern Labrador Inuit community of Nunatsiavut. We hear from Inuk elders on how their communities are innovating and adapting new technology to fight climate change.

			Secret Service investigating after James Comey shared a cryptic Instagram post of seashells on a beach

Donald Trump accused the former FBI director of calling for his assassination as the secret service launched an investigation into James Comey's Instagram post.

Mr Trump claimed Mr Comey issued a death threat against him after taking a picture of seashells on a beach.

Mr Comey, who led the FBI from 2013-2017, shared a photo on Instagram of seashells arranged in the sand to depict the numbers “8647”.

He captioned the post: “Cool shell formation on my beach walk.”

However, the Secret Service is now investigating the matter after Trump allies interpreted the cryptic message as an incitement to violence against the president.

To “86” is a slang term used in the hospitality industry and the military, meaning to ban someone from an establishment or scrap a piece of equipment. However, it can also mean to kill someone.

Meanwhile, “47” is seen as a reference to Mr Trump, who is the 47th US president.

“He knew exactly what that meant. A child knows what that meant … That meant assassination,'” Mr Trump said in an interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier on Friday.

“Now, he wasn't very competent, but he was competent enough to know what that meant.”

The Department of Justice and the Secret Service are now investigating the post after Trump allies interpreted the message as an incitement to violence against the president.

Mr Trump said he did not want to “take a position” on the investigation.

The president has a long-running feud with Mr Comey, whom he sacked as FBI director during his first term after he confirmed that the agency was investigating allegations that his election team colluded with Russia.

Mr Trump renewed his attack on Mr Comey on Friday, saying: “He's a dirty cop. And if he had a clean history, I could understand if there was leniency.”

Tulsi Gabbard, Mr Trump's director of national intelligence, called for Mr Comey to be jailed.

“When we have two assassination attempts on the president's life, when we have people who look to guys like Comey, who have been celebrated by MSNBC and the Democrat elite and CNN as the beacon of integrity, the law and order guy, the guy who would tell the truth no matter what the consequences, this is the guy who's issuing a hit on President Trump,” she said on Fox News.

“So, it's guys like Comey and others who call the president the modern-day Nazi, people who are in positions of influence who are saying that President Trump poses an existential threat to our country.”

White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich also attacked Mr Comey.

“While President Trump is currently on an international trip to the Middle East, the former FBI director puts out what can clearly be interpreted as ‘a hit' on the sitting president of the United States — a message etched in the sand,” White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich wrote on X.

“This is deeply concerning to all of us and is being taken seriously.”

Mr Trump's eldest son Donald Trump Jr also posted: “Just James Comey casually calling for my dad to be murdered.

“This is who the Dem-Media worships. Demented!!!!”

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, said her department was investigating the post.

“Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of @POTUS,” she wrote on X.

“DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.”

Kash Patel, the FBI director, said that the bureau is “in communication with the Secret Service” over the matter and “will provide all necessary support”.

Other senior Republicans labelled the post “despicable” in the wake of previous attempts on Mr Trump's life and called on Mr Comey to explain his actions.

“This is a direct THREAT against President Trump, who has already survived two assassination attempts,” Alabama Senator Tommy Tubberville wrote on X.

“BEYOND despicable. James Comey MUST face consequences.”

Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn added: “James Comey is posting cryptic messages online alluding to getting rid of President Trump.

“Would he like to explain what he means by this given the assassination attempts on President Trump?”

Following the online backlash, Mr Comey removed the post from Instagram and released a statement saying it had “never occurred to me” that the message would be interpreted as a call for violence.

A post shared by James Comey (@comey)

Mr Trump, 78 was shot in the ear last July during a failed assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, that left one person dead and two others seriously injured.

Two months later, Secret Service agents foiled another would-be assassin who hid in the bushes with a rifle at the president's golf course in Palm Beach, Florida.

Mr Comey, who now writes thrillers, was held responsible by many Democrats for helping Mr Trump win the 2016 election after he reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email affairs just 11 days before polling day.
