                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During the Australian Open, ATPTour.com will bring fans insight into the leaders of key statistical categories, showing how performances throughout 2025 all added up to successful seasons and the promise of more good times ahead in 2026. Novak Djokovic's 2025 season offered a masterclass in ruthless efficiency: when he wins the first set, he finishes the job. That consistency is a testament to focus, composure and match intelligence when under pressure, qualities that have been instrumental in Djokovic's storied career. In 2024, Djokovic went an astonishing 35-0 himself when winning the first set and, including his first three victories at the 2026 Australian Open, he has now won his past 87 matches when winning the opener. The last time he dropped a match after winning the first set was his epic five-set Wimbledon final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in 2023. Novak Djokovic's record when winning the first set 2023-2025 In tight moments, when opponents try to claw back, he rarely falters, and his rock-solid baseline game is a huge part of why he has spent a record 428 weeks at No. It's the kind of longevity that is built on consistency, match after match, season after season. One who doesn't merely win sets, but locks in, executes and closes out until the job is done. Visit our Infosys ATP Stats section for more insights.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic continued to move smoothly through this year's Australian Open draw on Saturday night, recording his third consecutive straight-set victory of the tournament with a 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4) triumph over Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp.And with that triumph, he extended one record and broke another.First of all, it was Djokovic's 400th career win at a Grand Slam event, extending his record for most career wins at the majors for a man in tennis history. He's actually held that record since 2024, when he surpassed Roger Federer's previous mark of 369.But second of all, and perhaps more importantly, Djokovic also secured his 70th career appearance in the round of 16 of a major, breaking the record for most career appearances in the round of 16 at a major for a man in tennis history, surpassing Federer's 69.

Going into Saturday night, this was a bit of a danger match—not only had Van de Zandschulp won the pair's last meeting, at Indian Wells last year, but he's no stranger to upsets at Grand Slams, having stunned Carlos Alcaraz at the US Open two years ago.And after Djokovic moved ahead two sets to love, that dangerous streak started showing, as the big-hitting Dutchman broke early in the third set for a 3-1 lead—and, after getting broken back, he later held two set points in that set, in Djokovic's 5-6 service game.But like he's done so many times in the past, Djokovic got going when the going got tough, hanging on in that service game and finally putting Van de Zandschulp away in the tie-break.He improved to 18-0 in his career in third-round matches at the Australian Open with Saturday night's victory, too.Awaiting the 11-time champion in Melbourne in the next round will be the winner of No. 16 seed Jakub Mensik and unseeded American Ethan Quinn, who also played their third round on Saturday night. 16 seed Jakub Mensik and unseeded American Ethan Quinn, who also played their third round on Saturday night. 16 seed Jakub Mensik and unseeded American Ethan Quinn, who also played their third round on Saturday night. 16 seed Jakub Mensik and unseeded American Ethan Quinn, who also played their third round on Saturday night. 16 seed Jakub Mensik and unseeded American Ethan Quinn, who also played their third round on Saturday night.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vera Zvonareva, 41, is making a comeback to the sport. 2 values the competition and joy of the game at this stage of her career. But another veteran in her early 40s is also competing at Melbourne Park and remains alive on the middle Sunday of the main draw. Forty-one-year-old Vera Zvonareva made a low-key comeback at the ITF W100 in Dubai in December, marking her first professional tournament since June 2024. Like Williams and Wawrinka, Zvonareva has played on the sport's biggest stages against its biggest names. Though Zvonareva never won a Grand Slam singles title, she owns plenty of major silverware. But after returning from surgery that forced her to stop competing in 2024, Zvonareva is taking things as they come. "There was always a question if my body can handle it or not," Zvonareva told the wtatennis.com from Melbourne. I still enjoy hitting the ball. I was coaching a little bit and if my body allowed, I wanted to try to play a little bit. I do enjoy playing matches myself and for now, my body does allow me to compete so I'm happy to be back on tour. I had a protected ranking and that obviously helps because I can get into some tournaments and play against a lot of new girls on tour. But at the same time, there's still a lot of girls that I played with before and I'm enjoying the competition." The lack of a defined timetable or long-term plan has kept things simple for the 12-time WTA singles title winner. "I was taking my time and enjoying my time off the tour as well. During her time away from the tour, Zvonareva explored coaching. While she is unsure whether that path will feature in her future once she stops playing, she believes the experience has helped her own game. It's a bit different and obviously I still need to build my experience in that, but I've had a good amount of time to explore coaching and with different levels of players. I think it also helps me to be a better player as well, because you're a bit on the other side and you see things differently. I can kind of tell myself certain things when I'm on the court, not just as a player, but as a coach and that's very interesting." 2 plans to continue mixing it up, though she acknowledges doubles is likely to be her priority at this stage of her career. Young Croatian Petra Marcinko wins the 28th Al Habtoor Tennis Challenge after defeating veteran Russian Vera Zvonareva 6-3, 6-3 in final at the Habtoor Grand Resort in Dubai #Tennis https://t.co/vbqYe5k4ep pic.twitter.com/JBQ96SYFHW "And my doubles ranking is much higher. So that allows me to play bigger tournaments. So I'll try to manage both a little bit. Reaching one singles and two doubles finals in her first three tournaments back has boosted Zvonareva's confidence and reinforced her belief that she can still compete at this level. "Definitely that helped me a lot to get back in the game and to realize that I still have the level," Zvonareva said. The most important thing for me was to be on the court to experience those tough situations and to understand that I'm still enjoying competing. That was the most important thing. And I think I've done really well just taking it one tournament at a time." Melbourne holds happy memories for the 2008 Beijing Olympics bronze medalist. She won the women's doubles title here in 2012 and reached the singles semifinals in 2009 and 2011. The pair defeated 10th seeds Diana Shnaider and Liudmila Samsonova in the first round and local wild cards Taylah Preston and Lizette Cabrera in the second. "I always loved playing in Australia and I've had some great results here in the past," Zvonareva said. It's a bit windy, but it's part of the game, but I'm enjoying my time." Vera Zvonareva, 41, is making a comeback to the sport. 2 values the competition and joy of the game at this stage of her career.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amanda Anisimova battled Peyton Stearns and the heat on Saturday afternoon in Melbourne and conquered both, winning 6-1, 6-4 in 1 hour and 11 minutes to reach her second straight Australian Open fourth round. For the second consecutive year, Amanda Anisimova is through to the Australian Open fourth round, this time after defeating compatriot Peyton Stearns 6-1, 6-4 at Margaret Court Arena. 4 made sure she wouldn't be in the sun for long, wrapping up the win in 1 hour and 11 minutes on Saturday afternoon. "We don't really get super long breaks. It's just important to keep fueling and also staying calm, to not spend my energy on emotions andstuff like that." She has yet to drop a set this week and never appeared in real danger of doing so here, despite a late charge from Stearns. She then added another break to go ahead 5-1 before serving out the set in a little over half an hour. Just when it looked like she would cruise to victory with a 5-2 lead in the second set, Stearns fought off a match point and broke for the second time in three games. After narrowing the gap to 5-4 and saving another match point, the former University of Texas standout finally succumbed to a forehand winner that sent Anisimova to the fourth round. "I was just really trying to stay focused, try and do the things that I wanted to do, focus on my serve," Anisimova said. Hit me with your best shot: While Anisimova's backhand often gets the spotlight, her forehand delivered many of her finer moments on Saturday -- including the match-point winner. But it was to be outdone by one she hit earlier in the match. Already up a break in the second set, she ripped a forehand right down the line and by the outstretched arms of Stearns to set up triple break point. Stat of the match: One could look at Anisimova's serving numbers and find plenty to catch their eye. But it was the heat that dictated much of the play, so much so that across more than 100 points, not a single rally reached nine shots. With temperatures hovering around 95 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the match and expected to climb past 100 later in the day, both players kept points short and took risks. Her 30 unforced errors more than doubled Stearns' 14, but she also produced 14 winners to Stearns' six, including the one that mattered most: the last one. What's next: As a result, Anisimova moves into the fourth round, where she'll face Wang Xinyu, whom she has never faced. Amanda Anisimova battled Peyton Stearns and the heat on Saturday afternoon in Melbourne and conquered both, winning 6-1, 6-4 in 1 hour and 11 minutes to reach her second straight Australian Open fourth round.</p>

I don't think it was even ballpark close to that today. So, yeah, I felt pretty fresh, to be honest, and felt like I could have gone a lot longer.”Spizzirri will need that stamina throughout the season to come; projected to rise around 14 spots in the ATP rankings, the Connecticut native sounds more than ready to embrace more challenges in the coming months: I don't think it was even ballpark close to that today.

Going toe-to-toe with the two-time defending champion, Sinner, for four sets out there, how encouraging is that for you as a sign of what you can be at this level?ELIOT SPIZZIRRI: Yeah, definitely encouraging. To kind of feel out my game and go toe-to-toe with him, yeah, it felt good. It definitely gives me some confidence to keep going. I knew that coming in.He's one of the best players in the world, so he's going to kind of make you feel where your weaknesses are more than other guys and exploit them. Yeah, I definitely felt like I'll hopefully learn a lot from this match but also take some confidence from it.Unseeded in Melbourne, he began he week by stunning No. 28 seed Joao Fonseca in four sets and shook of a lost two-set lead over Wu Yibing to secure a career-best Grand Slam finish.
