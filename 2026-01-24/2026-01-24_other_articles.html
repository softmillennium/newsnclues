                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans have been clamoring for the Midnight Sons to join the MCU for years now, and if it ever does happen, these 10 supernatural Marvel heroes could appear in the dark Avengers replacement team. The Midnight Sons is made up of some of Marvel's creepiest and most powerful supernatural heroes and villains, giving them an incredibly interesting dynamic. Thus, Danny Ketch and Johnny Blaze formed a team consisting of characters like Blade, Morbius, Hannibal King, and other minor characters. After this event, the Midnight Sons kept reuniting to face bigger threats, with more significant characters joining the roster each time. Later, Strange became a major recurring member of the team, appearing in some of the Midnight Sons' most memorable storylines. Another character who needs to appear in the MCU's Midnight Sons is Blade. Although Mahershala Ali's Blade movie still hasn't happened yet, there are traces of the character in the MCU, such as in Marvel Zombies and the post-credits scene of Eternals. If the MCU's Blade movie never happens, Ali could make his proper debut as Blade in a Midnight Sons movie, which would make the film even more exciting than if Blade had already made his debut. It would be hard to imagine a Midnight Sons movie without Blade. If the Blade movie had happened, he would be a shoo-in for team membership. So, hopefully, the film's production problems don't stop him from making an appearance. Although he isn't as well-known for being part of the team, a current MCU hero who could appear in the Midnight Sons is Wong. As Doctor Strange's right-hand man and the MCU's current Sorcerer Supreme, Wong is an immensely powerful character who would make a fantastic addition to the team. He could also act as the team's comedic relief, as many of the other Midnight Sons members are incredibly self-serious. Wong made his debut as a member of the Midnight Sons in 2017, with him being part of the modern team's roster. If Strange isn't on the team, Wong really needs to be there, as without either of them, the Midnight Sons wouldn't have a sorcerer. The status of Oscar Isaac's Moon Knight is a bit mysterious, as he hasn't appeared in any MCU projects since season 1 of his own show. There hasn't been much word on when the character will appear again, and fans are still awaiting Moon Knight season 2 after season 1's cliffhanger ending. However, if the Midnight Sons do make their MCU debut, then Marvel needs to find a way to get Moon Knight back. Moon Knight also became a member of the Midnight Sons in February 2017, although the character was in his Mr. Knight form. It is likely that the MCU would base its Midnight Sons team on this modern incatnation from the comics, so if it does happen, Moon Knight is a major candidate. It wouldn't be hard to not know that Man-Thing currently exists in the MCU. However, this version of Man-Thing was a fantastic adaptation of the character, and this comic-accurate monster needs to appear in the Midnight Sons. In 2009's Marvel Zombies 4, Man-Thing was added to the Midnight Sons line-up, and he has been associated with the team ever since. Outside of the one who appeared in Agents of SHIELD, there isn't currently a Ghost Rider in the MCU, which is a major problem for the Midnight Sons. The lineup doesn't have to be perfectly comic-accurate, but it at least has to have a Ghost Rider in it. Johnny Blaze is the most popular Ghost Rider, so it would make sense for him to be the incarnation that appears in a Midnight Sons movie. However, Danny Ketch was also involved in the team's founding, and any of the Spirits of Vengeance could be involved. Doctor Voodoo is one of the most popular Marvel Comics characters who hasn't been introduced in the MCU at all. Since Marvel seems to have mostly moved away from introducing new heroes in their own solo movies, if Doctor Voodoo ever does make his debut, it will probably be in a Midnight Sons movie. Voodoo was also added to the team in its 2017 incarnation, meaning that he should be in the MCU's team as well. His association with Doctor Strange and Wong in the comics would give them an interesting dynamic in the movie, giving him a reason to be there. Elsa Bloodstone hasn't nearly been used to her full potential in the MCU, and a Midnight Sons movie would help expand on her character. Speaking of, Werewolf by Night himself needs to appear in the MCU's Midnight Sons. Werewolf by Night joined the Midnight Sons in its Marvel Zombies 4 incarnation, although he surprisingly wasn't part of the team in its 2017 incarnation. Alongside Ghost Rider and Blade, Morbius is one of the most commonly seen Midnight Sons members. Get access to exclusive stories on new releases, movies, shows, comics, anime, games and more!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly eight decades after his reported death, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose remains one of modern India's greatest enigmas. Conflicting accounts, missing evidence and official secrecy continue to fuel debates over his final fate. Here's an explainer on his life and key moments: Subhas Chandra Bose was one of India's most charismatic nationalist leaders, born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa. He cleared the Indian Civil Service examination but resigned to join the freedom struggle and later served as Congress president in 1938 and 1939. Bose founded and led the Indian National Army (INA) during World War II. What is the official version of Netaji's death? According to official accounts, Bose died on August 18, 1945, from severe burns after his overloaded aircraft crashed shortly after take-off from Taihoku airfield in Taipei. His ashes were later placed at Tokyo's Renkoji Temple. Skepticism stems from the absence of a conclusively identified body, contradictory eyewitness accounts and long-standing government secrecy around classified files. Together, these gaps have sustained alternative theories for decades. One of the most enduring theories links Netaji to Gumnami Baba, a reclusive ascetic who lived in Faizabad until 1985. Supporters claim documents, photographs and personal items found after his death suggest he was Bose living in disguise. Another theory claims Bose survived and was taken to the Soviet Union, possibly detained by Stalin as a political asset. Russian authorities, however, have consistently denied any records of Bose being in Soviet custody. This hypothesis suggests Bose died in Japanese-controlled territory and that the plane crash narrative was fabricated to avoid diplomatic fallout, with both Tokyo and New Delhi allegedly suppressing the truth. Journalist Anuj Dhar's book India's Biggest Cover-up alleges that Pranab Mukherjee, as External Affairs Minister, opposed declassifying Netaji-related files. Mukherjee did not publicly respond in detail to these allegations. What changed after the declassification of files in 2016? While several Netaji-related files were made public, researchers argue key documents remain classified.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The peculiar object was heard omitting bizarre radio transmissions UFO researchers have been left puzzled after an oddly-shaped UFO was spotted whizzing above the mysterious Area 51 base in the US. Anders Otteson, who describes himself as a backpacker and videographer, was recording his journey through the Nevada desert on January 14 when he observed the unidentified craft passing overhead at around 3am local time.

The craft featured a considerably flatter rear edge and lacked the jagged trailing section and distinct wings characteristic of America's stealth bomber fleet. Its flight trajectory matched patterns typical of military aircraft conducting low passes over the region, though Mr Otteson was unable to ascertain the precise direction it was heading. Alongside the visual sighting, a scanner belonging to fellow UFO researcher Joerg Arnu intercepted peculiar radio communications on the base's unencrypted frequencies.
