                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new expert consensus made available online on 10 October 2025 and published in Volume 5, Issue 4 of the journal Intelligent Medicine on 1 November 2025, sets out a structured framework to assess large language models (LLMs) before they are introduced into clinical workflows. The guidance responds to the rapid uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for diagnostic support, medical documentation, and patient communication, and the corresponding need for consistent evaluation of safety, effectiveness, and fairness. The consensus formalizes retrospective evaluation-testing fully trained models on real or simulated clinical data in specific care contexts, without further modifying the models-to verify performance, ethical compliance, and operational readiness prior to deployment. Developed in line with World Health Organization guideline methods and registered on the Practice Guideline Registration for Transparency (PREPARE) platform (ID: PREPARE-2025CN503), the consensus draws on literature review, Delphi procedures, and multidisciplinary expert deliberation. In the final round, 35 experts achieved agreement on six recommendations. The consensus also defines six key LLM capability domains for assessment: medical knowledge question and answer; complex medical language understanding; diagnosis and treatment recommendation; medical documentation generation; multi-turn dialogue; and multimodal dialogue. 2025 Expert Consensus on Retrospective Evaluation of Large Language Model Applications in Clinical Scenarios.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international research team led by Prof. Dr. Sedat Nizamoğlu from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Koç University has developed a next-generation, safe, and wireless stimulation technology for retinal degenerative diseases that cause vision loss. Retinal degenerative disorders affect millions of people worldwide and currently have no curative treatment. Existing retinal implants, however, face significant clinical limitations due to their bulky structures, complex electronic components, or the need for high-intensity visible light. To overcome these challenges, researchers at Koç University set out to develop an ultra-thin, biocompatible system capable of directly converting light into biological electrical signals. To achieve this, the team designed a photovoltaic nano-assembly combining zinc oxide nanowire arrays with silver-bismuth-sulfide nanocrystals. This structure enables the conversion of near-infrared light, which penetrates tissue more deeply and safely than visible light, into precisely controlled electrical stimulation without causing damage to ocular tissue. Importantly, this process operates at low light intensities that remain well below established ocular safety limits and does so using a fully wireless, ultra-thin architecture. Experiments demonstrated strong, repeatable, and temporally precise responses in retinal neurons. In addition, comprehensive analyses of cell viability, biocompatibility, and long-term stability showed that the structure did not induce cellular stress or toxicity and is suitable for prolonged use. The negligible temperature increase observed during operation further highlights the safety advantages of the approach.What distinguishes this technology from existing retinal implants is its ultra-thin active layer, its use of safer near-infrared light instead of visible light, and its completely wireless design that eliminates the need for external cables or electronic components. These features make the platform a strong candidate not only for visual prostheses but also for broader neuromodulation applications targeting electrically excitable tissues such as the brain, heart, and muscles. Commenting on the study, Prof. Dr. Sedat Nizamoğlu said: "This study demonstrates that a nanotechnological retinal implant approach could potentially restore vision in the future for individuals who have lost visual function due to macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. Inorganic nanocrystals, which received the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, are highly promising for retinal prosthesis technology when implemented using functionally optimized nanoarchitectures. Operating with near-infrared light, this nanoscale system offers a significant alternative to existing approaches in terms of performance. Our findings open new avenues not only for visual prosthetics but also for a wide range of biomedical applications that interact with the nervous system." This work, carried out at Koç University, once again underscores the university's interdisciplinary research environment and its commitment to high-impact scientific innovation, while paving the way for the development of safer and more effective future treatments for individuals living with vision loss.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From a physiological perspective, heartbeats and breathing do not operate independently in the human body. CPC reflects the regulatory state of the autonomic nervous system and serves as an important physiological indicator for evaluating sleep quality, cardiovascular health, and stress levels. For decades, however, cardiopulmonary coupling has been assessed almost exclusively using electrocardiogram electrodes, respiratory belts, or other contact-based sensors. While effective, these devices can compromise comfort and limit their use in home environments, long-term monitoring, and applications involving sensitive populations such as infants or post-operative patients. Our bodies undergo extremely subtle surface changes with every breath and heartbeat, and cameras are capable of capturing this information. This makes it possible to assess cardiopulmonary health under completely non-contact conditions." The researchers developed an intelligent video-analysis framework that first automatically identifies facial and torso regions in video recordings. "From these regions, optical signals associated with blood flow variations-reflecting cardiac activity-and chest and abdominal motion-reflecting respiration-are synchronously extracted," says Song. Through multi-region signal fusion and high-resolution time–frequency analysis, the method further improves signal stability and enhances the characterization of dynamic physiological changes. Experimental results showed that under different physiological conditions, including normal breathing and simulated apnea, the video-based approach produced cardiopulmonary coupling measurements that were highly consistent with those obtained using conventional contact-based devices. "For a long time, cardiopulmonary coupling monitoring has depended mainly on medical equipment or wearable sensors. Our study demonstrates that remote video devices also have the potential to enable CPC assessment," he says. The team highlighted that the approach is particularly well suited to scenarios requiring long-term, comfortable monitoring, such as in-home sleep health screening or remote post-operative rehabilitation. "In the future, such technology may even be integrated into smartphones or smart cameras, making health monitoring as natural as a video call," adds Gao.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here, we aimed to evaluate the global prevalence, temporal changes, and associated mortality risk of BIs in liver cirrhosis. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for eligible studies published without language restrictions until 11 August 2025. A random-effects model was used for meta-analyses, meta-regression by study year, and pooling adjusted hazard ratios. Fifty-nine studies, including 1,191,421 patients with cirrhosis, were analyzed. The pooled prevalence of BIs (33 studies) was 35.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 29.2–41.4). The prevalence of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp. The pooled prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria was 6.8% (95% CI: 4.0–11.3). Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure showed the highest prevalence of BIs (44.2%; 95% CI: 29.7–59.8). A modest increasing trend in BIs prevalence was observed over time. BIs are common in patients with liver cirrhosis and show a modest upward trend over time, with the highest burdens observed in ACLF and notable regional variation. Gastrointestinal infections, SBP and UTI predominate, gram-negative organisms are more frequent than gram-positive organisms, and MDR pathogens are significant. Importantly, infections are associated with a higher mortality, underscoring the need for improved diagnostic approaches and standardized research frameworks to deliver clearer guidance for the clinical management of patients with liver cirrhosis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team led by Professor Yuan Li at Nanjing Medical University published a research paper entitled "A Cigarette Compound-Induced Tumor Microenvironment Promotes Sorafenib Resistance in Hepatocellular Carcinoma via the 14-3-3η-Modified Tumor-Associated Proteome" in the Chinese Medical Journal. This work provides valuable insights into the role of smoking in HCC progression and drug resistance, offering potential therapeutic targets for overcoming sorafenib resistance. The study began with an analysis of clinical follow-up data from HCC patients, revealing that smokers exhibited significantly poorer survival outcomes compared to non-smokers. Building on this finding, a sorafenib-resistant HCC cell model induced by cigarette smoking extract (CSE) was established. Sorafenib plays a pluripotent role mainly by regulating the phosphorylation of multiple-targeted tyrosine kinases and mitigating angiogenesis. By integrating findings from phospho-antibody and angiogenesis antibody arrays, the authors revealed that 14-3-3η activates the B-Raf/ERK signaling pathway and regulates a cascade of downstream factors. This activation enhances anti-apoptotic mechanisms, accelerates drug efflux, and promotes neo-angiogenesis, and these three critical processes synergistically contribute to the development of sorafenib resistance in HCC. Notably, the combination of ATO and sorafenib exhibited a synergistic effect, leading to an even more pronounced suppression of tumor progression. In this study, we systematically elucidated the key molecular mechanisms underlying sorafenib resistance in HCC induced by chronic smoking exposure, as well as the associated regulatory biological processes. Furthermore, we explored the potential therapeutic effects of traditional Chinese medicine components targeting these critical pathways. The findings not only deepen the theoretical understanding of drug resistance mechanisms in HCC but also provide a robust scientific foundation and practical guidance for optimizing strategies to prevent and control malignant tumors. Additionally, this research opens new avenues for the clinical prevention and treatment of HCC, offering promising applications for future therapeutic interventions.
