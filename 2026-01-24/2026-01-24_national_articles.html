Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? ﻿Trump's paramilitary forces just shot and killed another person in Minneapolis. In it, about half a dozen men in military garb, who appear to be federal immigration officers sent to Minnesota by President Donald Trump, wrestle a man to the ground and repeatedly strike him. Any arrests or prosecutions that arise out of this killing will have to await a police investigation. The video does not show what happened before this man's killers started wrestling with him, so it is not yet clear if he was engaged in criminal or even violent activity before the altercation began. But the limited evidence available right now appears incredibly damning. Even if there is some legal argument that could justify the first shot fired, it's hard to imagine one for continuing to fire multiple shots into a man lying on the ground. But it is also exceedingly unlikely that the Trump administration will conduct a real investigation into this killing. After federal officers shot and killed Renee Good earlier this month, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche reportedly did not just shut down an investigation into her killer, he also ordered federal officials to conduct a criminal investigation into Good. The Supreme Court's Republican majority has made it very difficult for private citizens to sue federal law enforcement officers who break the law. Until fairly recently, the law was favorable to federal officials who allegedly violate state criminal laws while they carry out their official duties. The seminal case, known as In re Neagle (1890), held that a deputy US marshal who shot and killed a man could not be charged with murder in state court, because this federal officer did so while acting as a bodyguard for a US Supreme Court justice. Last June, however, the Supreme Court handed down Martin v. United States (2025), which held that Neagle does not always protect federal officials who violate state law. The rule announced in Martin is vague, so it is unclear how it would apply to the shooting in Minneapolis. But the gist of the ruling is that a federal officer is only protected if they can demonstrate that “their actions, though criminal under state law, were ‘necessary and proper' in the discharge of their federal responsibilities.” A federal law provides that state criminal charges against “any officer (or any person acting under that officer) of the United States or any agency thereof” may be removed from state court and heard by a federal judge. But it does ensure that the question of whether Neagle applies to this case would be decided by federal courts that are increasingly dominated by conservative Republicans. Federal cases out of Minnesota appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, a very conservative court where 10 of the 11 active judges were appointed by Republicans. All of which is a long way of saying that, while the law does not absolutely preclude Minnesota prosecutors from filing charges against these officers, it is far from clear that those charges will stick. David Terry was a lawyer and former chief justice of the state of California, who had served with Supreme Court Justice Stephen Field while the two were both state supreme court justices. At the time, federal justices were required to “ride circuit” and hear cases outside of Washington, DC. At the court proceeding, where Field ruled against Terry's wife, Terry punched a US marshal, brandished a Bowie knife, and was jailed for contempt of court. After his release, he and his wife continued to threaten Field's life, and so, the attorney general ordered Deputy Marshal David Neagle to act as Field's bodyguard. Given these facts, it's unsurprising that the Supreme Court ruled that California could not bring charges against Neagle for this killing. And, besides, Neagle acted within the scope of his responsibilities as Field's federally appointed bodyguard. Neagle, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in Martin, arose from concerns that “California could frustrate federal law by prosecuting a federal marshal “for an act which he was authorized to do by the law of the United States.” Protecting Field was something that “it was [Neagle's] duty to do.” And, in shooting Terry, Neagle “did no more than what was necessary and proper.” Thus, Gorsuch extracted a rule from Neagle that federal officials are only protected from state law when their actions “were ‘necessary and proper' in the discharge of their federal responsibilities.” As a general rule, federal law enforcement officers are not authorized by the law of the United States to shoot people without justification. So, if it turns out that this killing was legally unjustified, federal courts may conclude that the officer's actions were not necessary and proper in the discharge of his official duties. And any prosecution against a federal immigration officer would be unavoidably political. So, it is unclear whether the judges who hear this case would approach it as fair and impartial jurists or as partisans. The bottom line, in other words, is that the law governing when federal officers may be charged with state crimes is quite unclear.

Colin Cowherd reacts to the news that the Buffalo Bills are interviewing new Los Angeles Chargers OC Mike McDaniel and former NFL QB Phillip Rivers to be their next head coach. They say no one circles the wagons like the Buffalo Bills, and wide receiver Keon Coleman found himself under the wagon after owner Terry Pegula's press conference on Wednesday. Pegula and general manager Brandon Beane were asked about Coleman after a lackluster second season, and Pegula blamed the fired coaching staff for selecting the wide receiver in the NFL Draft two seasons ago. "I'll address the Keon situation," Pegula said during the press conference after a question about Coleman was directed at Beane. Buffalo Bills wide receiver Keon Coleman (0) looks on from the field during an NFL divisional playoff game against the Denver Broncos at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, Colorado, on Jan. 17, 2026. "The coaching staff pushed to draft Keon. I'm not saying Brandon wouldn't have drafted him, but (Coleman) wasn't his next choice. It was Brandon being a team player and taking advice of his coaching staff, who felt strongly about the player." But I'm here to tell you the true story." Coleman, who was essentially labeled a draft bust by his owner, didn't understand the comments but quickly shook them off, according to The Athletic. The 22-year-old was taken aback, but then went and worked out and prepared for next season, according to the report. New England Patriots cornerback Carlton Davis III (7) is called for a pass interference penalty while breaking up a catch intended for Buffalo Bills wide receiver Keon Coleman (0) during the second half at Gillette Stadium on Dec. 14, 2025. "Terry's point was that we might've had a different order of personnel versus coaching, and I went that way. But ultimately, I'm not turning in a pick for a player that I don't think we can succeed with. Keon Coleman is a young player that has been here two years, has two years left on his deal. 1 wide receiver after not making any significant additions to the wide receiver room in the offseason. Buffalo Bills wide receiver Keon Coleman (0) runs onto the field before the game at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Oct. 26, 2025. As a rookie in 2024, Coleman flashed star potential at times, catching 29 passes for 556 yards and four touchdowns in 13 games. It looked like Coleman had taken the leap in 2025, as he caught eight passes for 112 yards and a touchdown in Week 1. However, that performance ended up being an anomaly for Coleman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This combination of images shows Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump during a group photo at the G7 Summit, June 16, 2025, in Kananaskis, Canada. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada if America's northern neighbor went ahead with its China trade deal, intensifying a feud with Prime Minister Mark Carney, a rising voice in the West's pushback to Trump's new world order. Trump said in a social media post that if Carney “thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.” President Donald Trump arrives on Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, Md., Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026, after returning from the World Economic Forum in Davos. While Trump has waged a trade war over the past year, Canada this month negotiated a deal to lower tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in return for lower import taxes on Canadian farm products. Trump initially had said that agreement was what Carney “should be doing and it's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal.” Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister responsible for trade with the United States, said Canada and China had resolved “several important trade issues” but there was no pursuit of a free-trade agreement. Trump's threat came amid an escalating war of words with Carney as the Republican president's push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance. Trump had commented while in Davos, Switzerland, this week that “Canada lives because of the United States.” Carney shot back that his nation can be an example that the world does not have to bend toward autocratic tendencies. “Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Trump's push to acquire Greenland has come after he has repeatedly needled Canada over its sovereignty and suggested it also be absorbed the United States as a 51st state. He posted an altered image on social media this week showing a map of the United States that included Canada, Venezuela, Greenland and Cuba as part of its territory. In his message Saturday, Trump continued his provocations by calling Canada's leader “Governor Carney.” Trump had used the same nickname for Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and his first use of it toward Carney was the latest mark of their soured relationship. Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said “there was a sense Trump showed more respect for Carney than for Trudeau. Now, after Carney's visit to China and, even more, his widely celebrated Davos speech, which clearly outshined and upset Trump, the gloves are off.” Carney has emerged as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. under Trump. Speaking in Davos before Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu” and he warned about coercion by great powers — without mentioning Trump's name. The prime minister even spoke of a “rupture” between the U.S. under Trump and its Western allies that would never be repaired. Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks at the beginning of a Cabinet Planning Forum at the Citadelle in Quebec City, Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. Trump, in his Truth Social post Saturday, also said that “China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life.” In a later post, the president said: “The last thing the World needs is to have China take over Canada. Carney has not yet reached a deal with Trump to reduce some of the tariffs that he has imposed on key sectors of the Canadian economy. That trade agreement is up for a review this year. Trump pledged to increase tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10%. As for China, Canada had initially mirrored the United States by putting a 100% tariff on electric vehicles from Beijing and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. But as Trump's pursued pressure tactics, Canada's foreign policy has been less aligned with the U.S., creating an opening for an improved relationship with China. Carney made the tariff announcement earlier this month during a visit to Beijing.</p>

Emmalena and Carr Creek elementary schools were competing in the A-Team Championships at Knott County Central High School. That only made matters worse, resulting in one adult on the floor getting tased. "Look here, this ball game's gotta get over," one announcer said.

A brawl ensued at a middle school game in Kentucky, but it was the announcer's call that stole the show. A Barstool Sports personality likened it to Al Michaels call of the "Miracle on Ice." "He said ‘they just tased Ryan' like Ryan has been tased before," another X user wrote. The game was called due to the brawl, with Carr Creek leading 48-30, but no winner was declared.

Tennis star Naomi Osaka withdrew from the Australian Open ahead of her third round match due to a left abdominal injury, ending her pursuit of her third title at the Grand Slam. Osaka, who previously won the Australian Open in 2019 and 2021, took to social media to announce her decision. She did not immediately provide details on the nature of her injury. Naomi Osaka walks onto court for her second-round match against Sorana Cirstea at the Australian Open tennis championship in Melbourne, Australia, on Jan. 22, 2026. "I was so excited to keep going and this run meant the most to me, so having to stop here breaks my heart but I can't risk doing any further damage so I can get back on the court." But I warmed up, and it got a lot worse." Osaka added that her body "changed quite a lot" after giving birth to her daughter, Shai, in 2023. During that time, she took a 15-month break away from competition before returning in 2024. Naomi Osaka walks onto Rod Laver Arena for her first-round match against Antonia Ruzic at the Australian Open tennis championship in Melbourne, Australia, on Jan. 20, 2026. "I'm just grateful to be otherwise very healthy," she said, "and I hope that I'm able to play some good tennis for the rest of the year." Although cut short, Osaka's time at the Australian Open was highlighted by her fashion choices and a tense interaction with opponent Sorana Cirstea in the second round. Cirstea appeared to take issue with Osaka's attempts to motivate herself between points, prompting the four-time Grand Slam champion to make a quip about Cirstea after her 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 victory. Naomi Osaka reacts after defeating Sorana Cirstea in their second-round match at the Australian Open tennis championship in Melbourne, Australia, on Jan. 22, 2026. "Apparently a lot of 'c'mons' that she was angry about, but whatever," Osaka said during an on-court interview. I think this was her last Australian Open, so, OK, sorry she was mad about it." Osaka later apologized, stating she doesn't "like disrespecting people. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The shooting appeared to be captured on video, which shows federal agents wrestling someone to the ground and shooting them multiple times. This story was originally published on January 24 at 8 am.

On his controversial deployment of federal immigration agents. This week, the Justice Department opened criminal investigations into several Minnesota Democrats, issuing subpoenas that allege they have impeded federal immigration priorities. Ellison, a former Congress member and DNC vice chair, has served as attorney general since 2019 — and he's also a rumored candidate for the state's Democratic nomination for governor. In an extended interview, I asked Ellison about his future in state politics, the playbook for pushing back on Trump, whether state Democrats were slow to investigate claims of social services fraud, and whether the solution for ICE is to abolish it. Here's what most struck me in our conversation. Ellison stressed an important point: The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division declined to open an investigation into the ICE officer who shot and killed protester Renee Good. They didn't review evidence and decided not to pursue charges. “Look, what happened that day has been reviewed by millions and millions of Americans because it was recorded on phones,” US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in an interview with Fox News. “The Department of Justice, our civil rights unit, we don't just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody putting his life in danger.” Meanwhile, the FBI has seized critical evidence from the scene — bullet casings, as well as Good's car, which could show the bullet trajectory — and won't share any of it with state and local prosecutors who want to pursue the case. According to Ellison, the federal government is sitting on evidence that could help determine what happened, and they're keeping it from the people trying to get answers for Good's family. One of the Trump administration's core arguments is that Minneapolis is a “sanctuary city” where local officials actively block ICE from doing their jobs. Ellison was adamant: that's just not true, and the distinction matters. Minneapolis has what's called a “separation ordinance.” Ellison says that while state and local law enforcement do not block ICE from accessing jails, as some other cities do, the ordinance means that city workers are under no statutory obligation to do it. For example, ICE can collect people with immigration detainers, Ellison said. What Minnesota won't do is hold someone beyond what a court has ordered based on their criminal charges. This week on Truth Social, Trump argued that Minnesota Democrats need to be asked about documented cases of social services fraud in the Somali American community. Trump further alleged that Minnesota Democrats had not properly investigated those cases under state Democratic leadership, which was one of his pretexts for sending in federal agents. In our interview, Ellison vehemently denied that Democrats slow-walked fraud cases among politically supportive communities. He said Trump and the White House were unjustly targeting an entire community for the criminal actions of a few. When I mentioned the “Feeding Our Future” scandal, where a Minneapolis nonprofit conspired with a Somali restaurant to take in more than $200 million in federal money, the attorney general was indignant. So you gotta get the impression that we're not really talking about fraud.” Ellison said he and other state officials have been war-gaming responses since early 2024, preparing legal challenges to what would be an extraordinary assertion of federal power. Ellison also laid out just exactly what the Insurrection Act would mean in Minneapolis: active-duty federal troops patrolling the streets of an American city, ostensibly to support ICE operations. Ellison argued Trump is living out his campaign promise for retribution against political enemies. And Minnesota, with its large Somali population, its progressive politics, its history of protest after George Floyd, makes the perfect target to send a message about what happens when you resist this administration. And how much has the Trump administration already accomplished from its playbook? ﻿Why the nation's movies, video games, and toys went global in 2025.</p>

Heritage Foundation Family Policy analyst Emma Waters joins ‘Fox News Live' to explain America's declining birth rate and what the Trump administration is doing to address it. A new report by the Congressional Budget Office shows that, absent immigration, America's population will begin to shrink by 2030. As we approach the 250th anniversary of our nation's founding, this projection underscores a hard truth: the collapse of marriage and family life represents the gravest threat to our great nation's future. Our country cannot afford to continue ignoring our declining marriage and falling birthrates, as lawmakers on both the Left and Right have done for decades. The discussion ranges from eliminating all marriage penalties embedded in welfare programs, to new tax credits for married families, to offering public honors to couples for every decade they remain married. These proposals reflect a blend of longstanding conservative priorities and new ideas, all animated by a shared belief: that strong American families were at the heart of the nation in 1776 and remain essential to its future. They are not offered as a final word, but as the beginning of a long-overdue national conversation about how to halt America's demographic and social collapse. Unfortunately, there are those—on both the radical Left and the libertarian Right—who are rigidly and ideologically opposed to our key ideas for supporting married families. Critics on the Left argue that opposition to abortion and support for married parents who prefer to provide home child care (usually through the mother) amount to a patriarchal assault on women's "autonomy" and "reproductive freedom." Meanwhile, critics on the libertarian Right contend that government has no business trying to incentivize decisions related to family structure. America is a nation rooted in its people, culture, laws, and customs, as well as its ideals—and it cannot be sustained if Americans themselves do not marry, form families, and raise children What is striking is how our critics echo each other in saying the government should not be doing anything proactively about it. The problem is that if traditional families continue to disappear, we will eventually lose America itself. America is a nation rooted in its people, culture, laws, and customs, as well as its ideals—and it cannot be sustained if Americans themselves do not marry, form families, and raise children. And yes, we do believe it is legitimate for government to encourage ways of life that allow its people to endure and flourish, and the social science is crystal clear—traditional married families outpace the alternatives in a host of wealth, education, health, and happiness measures. We make no apology for wanting to persuade more young Americans to marry, own homes, raise the next generation, and find deep fulfillment in family life. We also do not believe the solution lies in mass immigration when we can't even assimilate the immigrants that are already here. We want to make sure young Americans can realistically achieve these goals by, at a minimum, removing obstacles that stand in the way, and by assuring our policies actually privilege, prefer, and support married family formation. That is a winning message conservatives would do well to embrace in 2026. More broadly, we will continue to answer those—on the Left and on the libertarian Right—who either see no problem or see no solution. A society that refuses to defend marriage and child-rearing is not neutral; it is choosing between accelerated or managed decline. If our critics have new ideas, they should by all means present them. But we are done watching our kids fall further behind, our families struggle, and our societal pillars crumble, and we are calling for action that meets the moment. Heritage will be proud to work on ushering in a new American Golden Age, centered on the family, and the next phase in reaching that goal begins now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks with reporters aboard Air Force One after leaving the World Economic Forum in Davos for Washington, Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. The new U.S. National Defense Strategy released by President Donald Trump's administration is the first since 2022 and contrasts with its predecessor, issued under former President Joe Biden. “As in all regions, the Department will work collaboratively, seeking to understand our partners' security needs and areas of mutual concern.” 2026: “We will actively and fearlessly defend America's interests throughout the Western Hemisphere. We will provide President Trump with credible military options to use against narco-terrorists wherever they may be. We will engage in good faith with our neighbors, from Canada to our partners in Central and South America, but we will ensure that they respect and do their part to defend our shared interests. And where they do not, we will stand ready to take focused, decisive action that concretely advances U.S. interests.” As we continue contributing to NATO capabilities and readiness — including through improvements to our posture in Europe and our extended nuclear deterrence commitments — the Department will work with Allies bilaterally and through NATO's established processes to better focus NATO capability development and military modernization to address Russia's military threat.” 2026: “Russia will remain a persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members for the foreseeable future.” “European NATO dwarfs Russia in economic scale, population, and, thus, latent military power. At the same time, although Europe remains important, it has a smaller and decreasing share of global economic power. “Fortunately, our NATO allies are substantially more powerful than Russia — it is not even close. Our NATO allies are therefore strongly positioned to take primary responsibility for Europe's conventional defense, with critical but more limited U.S. support. That is why the NSS (National Security Strategy) directs DoW (Department of War) to maintain a favorable balance of military power in the Indo-Pacific. “Not for purposes of dominating, humiliating, or strangling China. To the contrary, our goal is far more scoped and reasonable than that: It is simply to ensure that neither China nor anyone else can dominate us or our allies. This does not require regime change or some other existential struggle. Rather, a decent peace, on terms favorable to Americans but that China can also accept and live under, is possible.” 2022: “The Department will continue to deter attacks through forward posture; integrated air and missile defense; close coordination and interoperability with our ROK (South Korea) Ally; nuclear deterrence; resilience initiatives; and the potential for direct cost imposition approaches that come from globally deployable Joint Forces.” 2026: “With its powerful military, supported by high defense spending, a robust defense industry, and mandatory conscription, South Korea is capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea with critical but more limited U.S. support.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I left Venezuela in 2017 due to political persecution of my family. I was afraid and desperate and thought about leaving before something happened to me,” Bárbara Briceño, who has lived in Mexico City for almost eight years, told CNN. Maduro's nearly 13 years in power were marked by a deep economic, political and social crisis. Venezuela faced turmoil in oil markets, while years of financial mismanagement, corruption and sanctions decimated the economy and led to hyperinflation that sent prices soaring daily. After months of tensions between the US and Venezuela, on January 3, President Donald Trump announced that Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores had been captured in a US military operation. The ousted president was detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and other serious drug-related crimes. Maduro denies all accusations and claims they are politically motivated. It is estimated that 2,000 people left Venezuela every day between 2014 and 2025. Jean Carlo Cruz, originally from Maracay, Aragua state, told CNN that when he left Venezuela in 2011 due to economic and security concerns, the situation had not yet fully deteriorated. ﻿His parents and other relatives still live in Venezuela, but his siblings and many friends now live in other countries. After 15 years of living in Mexico City, Cruz said he can help his parents financially, feels free to express himself, and has access to services like internet, electricity, water and gas. In some conversations with my mom, she tells me: ‘Well, today they cut the power for three, four, six hours.' That happens every day and they're used to it now.” For Bárbara Briceño, born in Puerto Cabello, Carabobo state, being far from her family has been the hardest part of living in another country. More than 140 political prisoners have been released so far, according to the organization Foro Penal, and over 700 detainees remain. Venezuela's population decreased by roughly 13% between 2015 and 2024, going from more than 32.6 million inhabitants to just over 28.4 million, according to figures from the National Institute of Statistics (INE) and the UN. The drop was mainly due to migration, according to the 2024 National Survey of Living Conditions (Encovi) — conducted by Andrés Bello Catholic University in Caracas — although it is also attributed to factors such as increased mortality and a significant drop in the birth rate. Eighty-seven percent of those who left Venezuela between 2014 and 2025 settled in a Latin American or Caribbean country, while only 11% went to the US and Europe, according to R4V, a UN mission that organizes assistance for Venezuelan refugees and migrants. Most Venezuelans settle in other countries in the region due to “reasons of accessibility and family networks,” according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Of the more than 7.9 million counted, about 6.9 million were in Latin America and the Caribbean as of November 2025, according to R4V. Among the more than 2.8 million Venezuelans living in Colombia is Alejandro Méndez, 50. “Freedom of expression started to become complicated, I had a good economic position and lost it, it became hard to get a spot in public schools and private institutions were very expensive. Originally from Caracas, he chose Colombia because there was an opportunity to attain regular migration status, his sister-in-law already lived there, and he considered it a good economic and political option for Venezuelan migrants. After arriving in Bogotá, Méndez and his wife began sharing their stories, and thus the social media community Cedrizuela was born, a platform where they shared their experiences and how they adapted to their new life. “That's how a new virtual community of communication and integration was consolidated, because if there's one thing migrants need, it's to identify with each other,” he explains. “I am grateful to Colombia for the opportunities it has given us. Laima Sanz and her family left Venezuela to start anew in Florida eight years ago as the country was experiencing a “deep political, social, and economic crisis,” she told CNN. “I didn't want my children to live like that, and the US offered good opportunities for life and education for my children,” she said. That didn't happen in Caracas,” she said. Regarding their migration status, two out of three have regular status, either with a temporary residence permit (29%), as residents (21%), or with citizenship in their country of residence (12%). In contrast, 23% have an unknown status and 12% are in irregular status due to lack of documents or expired documents, according to Encovi. Amid the years-long economic crisis that has marked Venezuela, remittances have become a growing source of income for many Venezuelan households, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. The Venezuelan diaspora has become a lifeline for their families back home. A 2022 report cited by the IOM indicates that households receiving remittances have significantly lower poverty levels than those that do not. Meanwhile, Venezuelan migration has also become a key factor in economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean, contributing more than US$10.6 billion annually, mainly through spending on housing, food, education and health, according to an IOM report. “The dictatorship is still in power, whether we like it or not,” said Bárbara Briceño from Mexico City. “Delcy Rodríguez is no saint, she's the country's vice president for a reason. For that reason, Briceño wouldn't feel comfortable returning to Venezuela. “Not while they're still in power,” she said. Venezuela: Four signs that the Trump-Rodríguez relationship is warming up For Alejandro Méndez, Rodríguez's assumption of power adds to his distrust and anxiety about whether there will be real change in the economic, political and social situation. But there are also days when I think they're just buying time while the same people are in power,” he said. For Venezuelans abroad, it's not just about Maduro's departure, but about the conditions in Venezuela and whether there will be real change. When asked about their first impressions upon hearing of Maduro's capture, exiled Venezuelans described an emotional roller coaster between disbelief, happiness, confusion and uncertainty. But some also saw it as a first step toward the change they want to see. “It was a feeling of disbelief, I think that's what overwhelmed me, I thought ‘someone finally helped us' because we've had 26 years of dictatorship and we didn't achieve it with protests, deaths, and all sorts of things,” Briceño told CNN. Because in Venezuela, everything was tried and it's a regime with absolute control.” Now, Venezuelans wonder if it's finally time to see their homeland prosper, without economic problems and with freedom of expression. “The Venezuela I dream of is a Venezuela with super strong institutions, that guarantees access to goods and services,” Méndez said. “Where it doesn't matter who the prosecutor or president is, there's no messiah saving people, but institutions ensuring the country works.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As more than 2,000 federal agents surge in Minneapolis in an immigration crackdown and clash with protesters on the streets, residents are also finding ways to covertly disrupt the operation. One volunteer says she was a Trump voter (AP Video: David R. Martin) A boy sits on the couch of a Minneapolis safe house Friday, Jan. 16, 2026, as his younger siblings and niece play on the floor beside him after they fled their home because they were sought by federal immigration enforcement agents. Two immigrant children play in a safe house in Minneapolis, Friday, Jan. 16, 2026, after volunteers relocated them from their home to protect them from federal agents. When federal immigration agents pounded on the door of his Minneapolis home, the oldest son in a family of 10 knew he had to move his siblings to a safer place. Their mother, a 41-year-old Indigenous Ecuadorian office cleaner without a known criminal record besides minor traffic offenses, had been detained in early January because she entered the country illegally. “The immigration agents were knocking on our door very late at night, and that's when I became afraid,” said the 20-year-old son, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear additional family members could face deportation. “I'm afraid that I'll be taken and my brothers and sisters will be in the hands of the government.” Martinez is one of the countless Twin Cities residents aiding immigrants like Melida Rita Wampash Tuntuam's family, prompted by word-of-mouth appeals for help — mostly ordinary people appalled by the aggressive tactics of federal agents who have broken down doors without warrants and violently clashed with protesters during the Trump administration's crackdown. As more than 2,000 federal agents scour Minneapolis-St. Paul for immigrants to detain and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports more than 3,000 arrests since early December, residents have organized to monitor, disrupt and protest the crackdown in the streets and in less visible ways. These Minnesotans have paid rent for immigrant families whose breadwinners are afraid to go to work, delivered home-cooked meals and arranged for regular check-ins and emergency custody arrangements to make sure children are cared for in case their parents are detained. Christian nonprofit Source MN has expanded its food bank program to provide for hundreds of sheltering immigrant families. “I do receive calls every single day from families and they're terrified, and we're just trying to help them as much as we can,” said Martinez, a mother of five who has been taking time off her job on a factory assembly line to volunteer for Source MN. “I just try to bring hope — like, ‘We're here with you. A stream of visitors brought snacks, baby supplies and coloring books for the children. The younger siblings settled in quickly, nestling on the couch in pajamas to share a bag of Cheetos and opening a coloring book to draw butterflies. But Wampash Tuntuam's older children, fidgeting on the couch, still worried about their future. They told The Associated Press that their mother gave the address of their rental home to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, who said they wanted to send a social worker to check on the younger children. Instead, armed masked immigration officers appeared and surrounded the house twice. “That's when we knew they hadn't sent a social worker but agents to detain us,” recalled Wampash Tuntuam's 22-year-old daughter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she and three other family members have final orders of removal. Her 20-year-old brother and other siblings are working on obtaining legal status. Martinez, a devoted Christian, said she voted for President Donald Trump in the past three elections because of his hard-line stance against abortion and gender-affirming care for youth. The granddaughter of a Mexican immigrant supported deporting violent criminals and had not paid much attention to reports of family separations in the first Trump presidency. But over the past two months, after watching videos of federal agents aggressively detaining her neighbors and working directly with children parted from their parents, she has changed her views. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE does not separate families,” noting that parents are asked whether they want to be removed with their children or place them with a designated person. McLaughlin said Wampash Tuntuam entered the country illegally in 2022 via the Texas border and later received a final order of removal from an immigration judge. According to Wampash Tuntuam's family, their mother had been planning to self-deport but was preparing custody documents for her infant son. The older children expect their mother will be deported at any moment and worry about what will happen to her five youngest. After their mother was detained, the 20-year-old son quit work at a restaurant to watch over his child siblings. The 20-year-old said he once saw Minneapolis as a “beautiful city” offering opportunities for immigrants like him until the surge of federal agents. There are still good people here, he said, referring to the volunteers who sheltered his family. But his younger siblings continue to ask when their mother will return. He comforts them by saying she's at the hospital and will be home soon. “I keep telling them that she is going to come back, that she is already on her way,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  Follow our live coverage of this developing story. Officials are currently working to confirm reports of a shooting involving federal law enforcement, the City of Minneapolis said in a post on X. Tim Walz called on the the Trump administration to end its immigration enforcement operations in the state in a post on X. “I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. “The President must end this operation. Minneapolis residents filled frigid city blocks again Saturday to demand ICE leave their neighborhoods, even as the immigration official orchestrating the crackdown promised detentions would not let up. Protests touched virtually every corner of the city Friday. Storm-weathered Minnesotans endured subzero temperatures at a downtown march, airport protest, arena rally and saw an “economic blackout” in which businesses closed their doors to boycott ICE's presence. But Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino doubled down on the unrelenting detention effort, which has at times swept up legal residents, US citizens and even a preschooler. He vowed earlier Friday to continue the government's search for “criminal aliens.” “We're going to take them off the streets wholesale,” Bovino said at a Friday news conference. Children and families are among those caught up in the mass deportation campaign. A 5-year-old boy was detained alongside his father in their driveway earlier this week, adding to the mounting list of controversial encounters over which federal and state officials are clashing. Fallout continues over the ICE shooting of Minneapolis mother Renee Nicole Good, as two sources tell CNN an FBI agent originally tasked with an investigation into the encounter has resigned. As tensions reach a fever pitch in Minnesota, Maine has found itself to be the latest state in the crackdown crosshairs. The Trump administration, continuing its penchant for meme-ready monikers, has dubbed the effort “Operation Catch of the Day” and announced more than 100 arrests this week. CNN's Evan Perez, Holmes Lybrand, Priscilla Alvarez, Holly Yan, Elise Hammond, Maria Aguilar Prieto, Alaa Elassar, Zoe Sottile, Andy Rose and Karina Tsui contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As President Donald Trump's administration doubles down on its aggressive immigration enforcement agenda, new polling data shows public approval for Immigration and Customs Enforcement has plummeted to new lows. The Democratic Congressional Progressive Caucus has taken advantage of the waning public support, making the “abolish ICE” movement a pillar in its 2026 legislative platform — vowing to block all Department of Homeland Security funding until meaningful reforms are enacted. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has remained a staunch defender of the agency's tactics, stating that federal agents have “been serving [their] country [their] entire life” and describing pushback from local leaders and media as “reckless behavior.” To every officer who puts on the badge each day: thank you. The shift in public sentiment comes amid the massive federal immigration enforcement campaign known as “Operation Metro Surge,” which deployed approximately 2,000 federal officers to cities such as Minneapolis. Tensions reached a boiling point following the fatal shooting of Renee Good by ICE officer Jonathan Ross after Good struck Ross with her SUV, causing internal bleeding. According to mid-January 2026 polling, 46% of respondents support abolishing ICE, a staggering increase from March 2025, when polling showed only 8% of respondents supported eliminating ICE. At a December 2023 rally, he told supporters, “We have no choice (but) the largest deportation operation in American history.” However, once ICE was deployed to metropolitan and sanctuary cities, the visuals of how agencies have conducted immigration operations have turned off viewers. Suro said the administration's shift from militarizing the border to deploying masked agents into metropolitan and sanctuary cities has created a “visual barrage” that is failing to resonate with voters who initially backed a crackdown on illegal immigration. The YouGov poll found that a majority of the public now supports major changes to the agency's tactics, 73% of respondents said ICE should be required to wear uniforms when making arrests and 56% said officers should not be allowed to wear masks. In direct challenges to the Trump administration, several Democratic-led jurisdictions have moved to ban law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing face coverings during operations. In September 2025, California became the first state to pass such a measure, the “No Secret Police Act,” which makes it a misdemeanor for officers to wear masks that conceal their identity. Furthermore, 50% of respondents said the recent fatal ICE shooting in Minnesota was “unjustified.” When officers approached her vehicle and demanded she get out so they could arrest her, she hit the gas and struck an officer, leading to a debate as to whether the shooting was justified regardless of whether she intended to hit the officer. Critics of ICE pointed to the bystander video and said Good was trying to turn away from Ross before he fired the three shots. ICE supporters pointed to the fact that Good's wheels began spinning while they were pointed directly at Ross, before she started to turn and struck him with the SUV. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt recently described Trump as a “strong leader who keeps the American people safe,” asserting that his handling of immigration remains among his “best polling issues.” One year into his second term, the administration continues to emphasize that it will not back down, even as the president's popularity polling has reached new lows. Despite these numbers, Trump has remained defiant about the operations, recently stating at a White House press conference that federal agents are “dealing with rough people” and that mistakes will happen. Suro said Trump's continued support has a lot to do with public image, especially as a president who has continually gone after political enemies. “The president has sort of committed himself publicly, so loudly now that backing down would … be portrayed as giving in to his critics,” Suro said. DHS officials have accused local leaders of refusing to cooperate with federal agents and releasing hundreds of criminal illegal immigrants from local jails back into the community. “It's the nature of American politics now that a view that is not the majority view can produce a nomination,” Suro said. Under former President Barack Obama, internal enforcement relied heavily on “detainers,” which involved cooperation with local jails to seize individuals already in custody. As blue cities withdrew that cooperation, the Trump administration pivoted to Metro Surge, deploying thousands of federal officers directly into residential neighborhoods. Suro said that once Trump shut down the border, his pivot to sending ICE into metropolitan areas led people to turn against immigration enforcement. “He would continue to have great support for his immigration policies, if that was the focus,” Suro said. There is also a possible political upside for the White House if demonstrations turn violent, Suro said. During past unrest in Los Angeles, the administration successfully used images of chaos to frame their opponents as “radicals.” While the administration hopes to frame the opposition as radicals and adjust immigration enforcement approaches, Democratic politicians push forward on their “Abolish ICE” mantra by saying they will not support ICE's upcoming budget approval. Republicans can deploy the same tactic by using images of protests in Minneapolis and previous protests in Los Angeles as a strategic weapon. By highlighting “shock and awe” tactics, such as daily tally arrests and photographs of handcuffed deportees, they aim to paint their opponents as soft on crime or weak on security.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Th﻿e two-day talks, which saw officials from all three countries sit down together for the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wrapped up Saturday evening local time, according to the Ukrainian delegation and Russian state media. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement that “a lot was discussed, and it is important that the conversations were constructive,” adding that further meetings could take place as early as next week. He added that US officials had suggested formalizing these parameters, as well as the security conditions required to achieve them. “All sides agreed to report back in their capitals on each aspect of the negotiations and to coordinate further steps with their leaders,” he added. “Provided there is readiness to move forward – and Ukraine is ready – further meetings will take place, potentially as early as next week.” Meanwhile, a UAE government spokesperson said the talks had a “positive and constructive atmosphere” and saw Ukrainian and Russian representatives engage directly on elements of a US-proposed peace framework. The negotiations were conducted in English and Russian, Russian state news agency TASS reported, citing a source. Going into the talks, it was widely understood that territory was the only remaining key issue to be resolved. The Donbas region is formed of the two coal-rich regions of Donetsk and Luhansk that used to make up Ukraine's industrial heartland. The region has a significant Russian-speaking population living there. Kyiv has spent years fortifying this area and losing it would leave the rest of eastern Ukraine wide open. Russia sent a military team to attend the talks in Abu Dhabi, including a top spy and military intelligence chief; Ukraine sent top negotiators including diplomats and security officials; and the US was represented by President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and White House adviser Josh Gruenbaum. The Trump administration has previously pressured Ukraine to accept a peace deal, despite widespread concerns such an arrangement could favor Moscow. That includes almost all of the Luhansk region, and parts of the Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Hours after negotiators from Kyiv, Moscow and Washington had finished their first day of talks in the UAE on Friday, Russia launched its biggest overnight aerial attack on Ukraine so far this year, local authorities said Saturday. CNN journalists in Kyiv reported hearing explosions. At least one person died and four people were wounded by the strikes, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. He added that falling debris had caused fires and damaged buildings, with nearly 6,000 apartment blocks losing heat and other parts of the city cut off from water supply. Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv in the northeast, also came under attack – with strikes damaging a maternity hospital and a dormitory for displaced people, according to city mayor Ihor Terekhov. At least 19 people were wounded, including one child. In total, Russia launched more than 370 drones and 21 missiles overnight, with other targets including Sumy and Chernihiv, said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday. He added that the attacks had focused on Ukraine's energy sector, which is “critical” during the cold winter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DC Water, which operates the sewer system, is hooking up pumps to divert sewage around the rupture and allow crews to make repairs. It has cautioned people to stay out of the area and to wash their skin if exposed. DC Water spokesperson John Lisle said the utility estimates the overflow at about 40 million gallons each day — enough to fill about 66 Olympic-size swimming pools — but it's not clear exactly how much has spilled into the river since the overflow began. “Oh, my god, the smell is horrific,” said Dean Naujoks, the Potomac Riverkeeper and part of an environmental nonprofit. Naujoks and another man donned protective gloves to take samples of water from the river to test for E. coli and other bacteria. The spill occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland, along Clara Barton Parkway, which hugs the northern edge of the Potomac River near Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historic Park. The pumps have enough capacity to capture all of the sewage flow in dry weather, said Lisle, but they could be overwhelmed by a surge in stormwater. Crews will work through the weekend, when a bad winter storm is expected, Lisle said, and they hope to have the bypass set up by Monday. He went out to look at it Wednesday and was “kind of stunned.” “Sewage is just bubbling up like a small geyser, maybe 2, 3 feet into the air,” he said. “Sewage water is running in every direction.” DC Water knew the pipeline was deteriorating, and rehabilitation work on a section about a quarter-mile from the break began in September and was recently completed, Lisle said. Repair work on additional “high priority” sections of the pipeline is expected to start later this year, according to the DC Water website. There's a huge funding gap for water infrastructure in the US, said Gary Belan, a senior director with American Rivers, an environmental organization that advocates for clean waterways. “I know a lot of the wastewater folks are trying to catch up as best they can, but this is something we see and will continue to see, where these pipes fail and these massive sewage dumps occur,” Belan said. “This is why we can't defer maintenance of our wastewater infrastructure. Too often, we're dependent on these disasters to prod us forward.” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, speaking at a press conference declaring a snow emergency for the impending storm, said authorities there were aware of the sewage spill “but I can't give you an intelligent response right now.” She said DC officials would be more forthcoming as soon as they could. “DC Water has provided daily updates since the overflow was discovered on January 19, 2026, and has been coordinating efforts to contain the overflow, monitor environmental impacts, and communicate with the public,” Offner said in an emailed response to questions. An EPA survey of wastewater infrastructure needs from 2022 estimated that the District of Columbia needs roughly $1.33 billion to replace or rehabilitate structurally deteriorating sanitary or combined sewers within the next 20 years. Nationally, hundreds of billions in infrastructure investment is needed over the next two decades for clean water problems like aging sewer pipes. In other places where sewer breaks are persistent, it can lead to backups into homes and regular flooding.</p>

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon released a priority-shifting National Defense Strategy late Friday that chastised U.S. allies to take control of their own security and reasserted the Trump administration's focus on dominance in the Western Hemisphere above a longtime goal of countering China. The 34-page document, the first since 2022, was highly political for a military blueprint, criticizing partners from Europe to Asia for relying on previous U.S. administrations to subsidize their defense. It called for “a sharp shift — in approach, focus, and tone.” That translated to a blunt assessment that allies would take on more of the burden countering nations from Russia to North Korea. It capped off a week of animosity between President Donald Trump's administration and traditional allies like Europe, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs on some European partners to press a bid to acquire Greenland before announcing a deal that lowered the temperature. As allies confront what some see as a hostile attitude from the U.S., they will almost certainly be unhappy to see that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's department will provide “credible options to guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain,” especially Greenland and the Panama Canal. Following a tiff this week at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the strategy at once urges cooperation with Canada and other neighbors while still issuing a stark warning. “And where they do not, we will stand ready to take focused, decisive action that concretely advances U.S. interests.” Much like the White House's National Security Strategy that preceded it, the defense blueprint reinforces Trump's “America First” philosophy, which favors nonintervention overseas, questions decades of strategic relationships and prioritizes U.S. interests. The National Defense Strategy last was published in 2022 under then-President Joe Biden and focused on China as America's “pacing challenge.” “I don't want to tell you that,” the president responded. It later adds, “This does not require regime change or some other existential struggle.” “President Trump seeks a stable peace, fair trade, and respectful relations with China,” it says, which follows efforts to climb down from a trade war sparked by the administration's sky-high tariffs. The strategy, meanwhile, makes no mention of or guarantee to Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own and says it will take by force if necessary. In another example of offloading regional security to allies, the document says, “South Korea is capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea with critical but more limited U.S. support.” While saying that “Russia will remain a persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members for the foreseeable future,” the defense strategy asserts that NATO allies are much more powerful and so are “strongly positioned to take primary responsibility for Europe's conventional defense.” It says the Pentagon will play a key role in NATO “even as we calibrate U.S. force posture and activities in the European theater” to focus on priorities closer to home. The U.S. already has confirmed that it will reduce its troop presence on NATO's borders with Ukraine, with allies expressing concern that the Trump administration might drastically cut their numbers and leave a security vacuum as European countries confront an increasingly aggressive Russia.</p>
