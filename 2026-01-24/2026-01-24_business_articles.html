                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Walz on Saturday called on President Donald Trump to end sweeping Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the state after what officials and witnesses described as a second fatal shooting this month by federal agents in Minneapolis. "I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning," Walz wrote in a post on X. The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. The governor's comments came after The Minnesota Star Tribune reported that a man was shot and killed by federal agents, citing Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara. Multiple sources with knowledge of the incident said the man was shot several times during an encounter with federal agents in south Minneapolis, according to the Tribune. A video circulating online, captured outside Glam Doll Donuts, shows agents wrestling a man to the ground before gunshots ring out, investigators told the Tribune. Minneapolis officials urged the public to avoid the area and remain calm as local law enforcement and state patrol units arrived to separate protesters from the ICE personnel, the Tribune reported. The latest shooting adds to a tense standoff between Minnesota authorities and federal immigration agents that has persisted for weeks. Earlier this month, an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident, during an enforcement action, which triggered widespread protests and accelerated political backlash against the federal operation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that the U.S. would impose 100% tariff on goods sold in the U.S. if the country strikes a trade deal with China. "If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.," the president wrote in a Truth Social post. "If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken," Trump stated. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada and China reached a preliminary deal to remove trade barriers and lower tariffs. Under the tentative agreement, Beijing cut tariffs on some Canadian agricultural products, while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles, applying the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Just a week ago, Trump had voiced his support for Carney on the China trade deal. "That's what he should be doing. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that," Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 16. In August 2025, Trump raised the tariff on Canadian goods to 35%. Duties aren't imposed on most Canadian exports under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), but some goods, including steel, copper and certain autos and auto parts, are subject to U.S. tariffs. The new tariff threat comes one day after Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his "Board of Peace" after Carney's address at the World Economic Forum in Davos that cautioned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers. In his speech, Carney said the world's "middle powers" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers. Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but the details hadn't been worked out. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the last few years, Emma Kobil, a trauma counselor in Denver, started noticing a new topic coming up with her patients: artificial intelligence. "I've had clients lose their jobs due to AI, and it's something we've processed in our sessions," Kobil said. Often, they express "shock, disbelief and fear about navigating a changing career landscape where their skills are no longer needed," she said. Other therapists said the technology is also vexing their patients. "What I hear most often is a fear of becoming obsolete," said Harvey Lieberman, a clinical psychologist in New York. More than a third — or 38% — of workers said they worry AI will make some or all of their job duties outdated in the future, according to a July 2025 survey by the American Psychological Association. These fears are not unfounded, said Rhiannon Batchelder, a career coach based in Denver. "Some employees are being asked to create pitches for how AI can take over portions of their job," Batchelder said. "Among news of mass layoffs while CEO pay continues to rise, being replaced by technology just feels like another reason to lose hope in the possibility of a stable, fulfilling career." AI was a major factor leading to nearly 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to December data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Overall, around 1.2 million jobs were cut in the year. Meanwhile, a recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology study found that AI can already replace around 11% of the U.S. labor market. Salesforce's CEO, Marc Benioff, said 4,000 customer support workers had been let go because artificial intelligence was already doing 50% of the work at the company. Other companies that pointed to AI in recent restructuring moves were tech consultancy firm Accenture and airline group Lufthansa. "People don't know where they fit into this new society," said Riana Elyse Anderson, a licensed clinical psychologist and associate professor at Columbia University. Losing your job to AI can trigger a host of existential questions, said Ben Yalom, a San Diego-based psychotherapist. "It may feel as if the universe is saying, 'You are no longer needed,' which may feel much more profound and disturbing than 'Our company is downsizing,' or even 'You are not doing a great job,'" Yalom said. "It goes deeply into questions of personal value, which is all very unsettling." Underneath these feelings is usually "a younger part that's terrified of being left behind or not being 'enough,' and that fear gets amplified because the technology itself feels so fast and out of our control," Kobil said. People can suffer even more when it's unclear whether or not a layoff was due to AI, Lieberman said. "They are left in a gray zone that magnifies anxiety and self-doubt," Lieberman said. For decades, studying computer science and learning to code was "your ticket to success," for a "long, thriving career," Anderson said. But the disruptive and uncertain moment can also be a chance for reflection, Anderson said. As an exercise, she recommends pausing any quest to pin down what will lead to a stable, lucrative career, "because that might not be totally known now." "Maybe at this time, take stock of who you are." You are so much more than your work." While the growing role of AI in the workplace can feel overwhelming, "retreating into avoidance or despair tends to narrow options rather than protect them," Lieberman said. "Learning enough about AI to understand where it genuinely alters work, and where it does not, often restores a sense of agency," he said. There are plenty of ways to start learning about the technology, including certificate programs and free opportunities, Batchelder said. "For most workers, understanding the basics of AI will be an asset, especially as we wait to see how the technology advances," she said. "During times of uncertainty, information is always powerful."

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katarina Polonska, a relationship scientist and coach who will be inheriting her childhood home in Slovakia. Vancouver-based Polonska, 36, said the home needs a lot of work, and it may not be worth managing renovations from abroad. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. But I don't have any right to it yet. It's mostly used as a family holiday home, but ultimately when my mother passes, it's going to be given to me. My mother owns it, and there's no plan to sell it — the value of the home isn't very high, in fairness. It's not worth much at all; maybe $80,000 CAD. I don't think the money would go very far in Canada. Also, selling it would require a lot of renovations. It's very old school and needs a lot of TLC, and my mother doesn't live in Slovakia, she lives in England. The reality is, I'm going to own this foreign property when she passes. His mother had to wait to take over the Barbados property, and by the time she took it over, it had declined a little bit and there are always complications with it. I've actually never seen it myself, but I know that there's a lot of work to be done with the house. But he's like, "We don't go to Barbados enough." It's just more hassle having to manage and protect a property when you're not physically in the country. But his argument is that the place isn't in the area of Barbados that I would necessarily want to go to. He doesn't want to be managing the property and he would rather sell it and then distribute the money within his family. So we both know that there's going to be this new responsibility on our heads and, candidly, I think life is difficult enough as it is. While Slovakia is kind of an up-and-coming country from a tourism perspective, I don't think anyone would want to stay in this place as an Airbnb unless it was literally advertised as a historical relic: "Come stay in this ancient old-school apartment!" But when is that going to happen? We both work, and getting to Slovakia is like a 20-hour journey from here. I think, more realistically, we could just keep the place and treat it as a little getaway to escape to. When it comes to inheriting property, I think there needs to be more dialogue between the parent and the child of, "What do you actually want to do?" I think a lot of parents have this assumption that leaving a kid the property is the ultimate goal; we've made it, we've paid off the mortgage, we have this home, and now the kid gets it. We don't live in a world where everyone grows up and lives in the same town or city as their parents. We live in a really global economy. Parents need to recognize that the world we're in is very different, and Millennials are not an anxious generation for no reason. It makes more sense to have a dialogue with your kid around what they want. I wish parents would ask, "What do you want? Where are you at with your life, and what kind of inheritance makes sense?" Is it, in fact, a lump sum of cash, because maybe you're a busy entrepreneur and you don't have time to sell? Thank you for the inheritance — that's very generous. Either enjoy the money, mom and dad, or cash out, downsize, and just give us a down payment or something.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Future meetings were mooted after overnight Russian airstrikes that knocked out power for over a million Ukrainians amid subzero winter cold. Statements following the talks did not indicate that any agreements had been reached, but both Moscow and Kyiv said they were open to further dialogue. "As a result of the meetings held over these days, all sides agreed to report back in their capitals on each aspect of the negotiations and to coordinate further steps with their leaders," he said, adding that further meetings could take place as early as next week. A UAE government spokesperson said there was face-to-face engagement between Ukraine and Russia - rare in the almost four-year-old war triggered by a full-scale Russian invasion — and tackled "outstanding elements" of Washington's peace framework. A spokesperson for Ukraine's lead negotiator, Rustem Umerov, told reporters just before 5 p.m. Abu Dhabi time (1300 GMT) that the discussions had concluded. The bombardment of Ukraine's capital Kyiv and its second largest city Kharkiv by hundreds of Russian drones and missiles prompted Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha — who was not at the talks — to accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of acting "cynically." "This barbaric attack once again proves that Putin's place is not at (U.S. President Donald Trump's) Board of Peace, but in the dock of the special tribunal," Sybiha wrote on X. "His missiles hit not only our people, but also the negotiation table." "(They) included direct engagement between Russian and Ukrainian representatives on outstanding elements of the U.S.-proposed peace framework, as well as confidence-building measures aimed at supporting progress toward a comprehensive agreement," it added. Zelenskyy had said on Friday that it was too early to draw conclusions from the first day of meetings in Abu Dhabi, and he had urged Russia to show it was ready for peace. U.S. peace envoy Steve Witkoff said at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week that a lot of progress had been made in the talks and only one sticking point remained. However, Russian officials have sounded more skeptical. Putin's demand that Ukraine surrender the 20% it still holds of Donetsk — about 5,000 sq km (1,900 sq miles) — has proven a major stumbling block to any deal. Most countries recognise Donetsk as part of Ukraine. Putin says Donetsk is part of Russia's "historical lands." Zelenskyy has ruled out giving up territory that Russia has not been able to capture in four years of grinding, attritional warfare against a much smaller foe. Polls show little appetite among Ukrainians for any territorial concessions. Russia says it wants a diplomatic solution but will keep working to achieve its goals by military means as long as a negotiated solution remains elusive. Meanwhile, Ukraine came under renewed Russian bombardment. Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 375 drones and 21 missiles in the overnight salvo, which once again targeted energy infrastructure, knocking out power and heat for large parts of Kyiv, the capital. At least one person was killed and over 30 were injured. Before Saturday's bombardment, Kyiv had already endured two mass overnight attacks since the New Year that cutelectricity and heating to hundreds of residential buildings. Ukraine's deputy prime minister said on Saturday that 800,000 people in Kyiv - where temperatures were around -10 degrees Celsius - had been left without power after the latest Russian assault. Zelenskyy said on Saturday Russia's heavy overnight strikes showed that agreements on further air defence support made with Trump in Davos this week must be "fully implemented."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.) Just a few weeks after Greg Abel formally became the new CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the company is apparently preparing to sell some or all of the Kraft Heinz shares it acquired in Warren Buffett's 2015 merger deal that has turned out to be a disappointment. An SEC filing after Tuesday's closing bell by Kraft Heinz says Berkshire, by far its largest shareholder with a 27.5% stake currently worth $7.5 billion, may sell "up to" almost all its shares. The filing doesn't necessarily mean Berkshire will sell, and it doesn't mean all the shares would be sold at the same time, but it's a strong indication some significant sales are coming. Berkshire's quarterly 13F portfolio snapshots will probably be how we'll know if the position is shrinking. The report covering Berkshire's current quarter will be released in mid-May. In Wednesday's trading after the filing, KHC fell about 7% to $21.99, near a six-year low, before rebounding. It ended at $23.20 Friday, down 1.4% for the week. In September, it announced a plan to reverse its declines by splitting into two companies, essentially undoing its 2015 merger. At the time, Buffett criticized the move, telling CNBC, "It certainly didn't turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together, but I don't think taking it apart will fix it." Berkshire joined with Brazil's 3G Capital Management to buy H.J. Two years later, in a deal championed by Buffett, Kraft merged with Heinz. Berkshire's 325 million shares in the combined company were worth around $30 billion in 2016 but have been closer to $10 billion over the past six years. In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Buffett wrote the shares cost Berkshire $9.8 billion, so right now it has an overall loss of around $2.3 billion. In a 2019 live CNBC interview (at 17:33 in the clip) with Becky Quick, Buffett had some regrets about Berkshire's role in the Kraft Heinz merger, saying he had "overpaid" for a good company. (A few months later, he elaborated on that point at the shareholders meeting. The clip and transcript are in Highlights from CNBC's Buffett Archive below.) CNBC.com quotes Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren telling clients, "We ... view the timing of this sale as being reflective of Abel's desire to clean up and pare down the investment portfolio early in his tenure." Cutting back on the portfolio will put more cash in the company's already enormous pile of more than $350 billion as of the end of September, potentially putting more pressure on Abel to decide what to do with it amid calls from some shareholders for a dividend. Warren Buffett admits Berkshire Hathaway paid too much for Kraft in its merger with Heinz, citing the growing pricing power of retailers over brands. In his explanation he highlights one of the most important lessons he learned from Charlie Munger: you can make any transaction into a bad deal by paying too much, but you can't guarantee a good deal by paying too little. WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, actually, what I said was, we paid too much for Heinz — I mean Kraft — I'm sorry — the Heinz part of the transaction, when we originally owned about half of Heinz, we paid an appropriate price there. We had some preferred redeemed and so on. To some extent, our own actions had driven up the prices. Now, Kraft Heinz, the profits of that business, 6 billion — we'll say very, very, very roughly — I'm not projecting, I'm not making forecasts — but 6 billion pretax on 7 billion of tangible assets is a wonderful business. But you can pay too much for a wonderful business. And we made a great purchase, as it turned out. But there's some price at which we could've bought even See's Candy, and it wouldn't have worked. So, the business does not know how much you paid for it. I mean, it's going to earn based on its fundamentals. But you're quite correct that Amazon itself has become a brand. And here's somebody like Costco, establishes a brand called Kirkland. And it's doing 39 billion, more than virtually any food company. But to have a brand that can really move — and Kirkland does more business than Coca Cola does. And Coca Cola is through millions of distribution outlets. And it's never gotten anywhere close to that in the United States. Kraft Heinz is still doing very well, operationally. If we paid 50 billion, you know, it would've been a different business. It'd still be earning the same amount. You can turn any investment into a bad deal by paying too much. What you can't do is turn any investment into a good deal by paying little, which is sort of how I started out in this world. But the idea of buying the cigar butts that are declining or poor businesses for a bargain price is not something that we try to do anymore. We try to buy good businesses at a decent price.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company's solutions enable its customers to address various aspects of their critical processes, including financial close, intercompany accounting, invoice-to-cash, and consolidation. Activist Commentary: Engaged Capital was founded by Glenn Welling, a former principal and managing director at Relational Investors. Its style is holding management and boards accountable behind closed doors. Engaged has an average return of 20.56% versus 17.83% for the Russell 2000. On Oct. 30, 2025, Engaged sent a letter calling on the BlackLine's board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP SE. Nearly a month later, Engaged issued a so-called 220 Demand letter requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election to BlackLine's board at the 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former senior vice president at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology-focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious. This is a very prototypical enterprise software business, characterized by high gross margins (80%) and sticky offerings that are essential for large enterprises. Its largest of these clients is SAP SE, with whom BlackLine has a strategic partnership that contributes approximately 30% of the company's revenue. Historically, the business was focused on growth, and rightfully so, as it was compounding revenue at over 20% annually for many years, and the stock price grew along with that success. However, post Covid, growth began to decelerate, margins did not come up meaningfully to compensate, and the stock fell accordingly, trading as low as roughly $61 in December 2022. There was also speculation that this development piqued the interest of SAP. It is hard to know what type of discussions go on in a boardroom, but an acquisition never happened. In March 2023, Huffman was replaced when Tucker returned to the company in a co-CEO structure with former Deloitte consultant Owen Ryan (until October 2025 when he was made sole CEO). Since Tucker's return, growth has continued to decline to high single digits and while margins have improved modestly, the company's stock is down another 24%. Despite all of this, history repeated itself when it was recently reported that SAP made an offer to acquire BlackLine in June, this time for $66 per share, an over 30% premium to the 60-day trading average at the time. This refusal is what prompted Engaged Capital to send a letter calling on the BlackLine board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP. Engaged is not advocating for a sale of the company at any price, nor does the board have a legal duty to engage every acquisition offer. Activist investors like Engaged do not view this as a right but an obligation. So, Engaged is asking the board to evaluate the SAP offer and weigh it against any other offers and on a risk-adjusted basis against a standalone path. This request is reasonable under almost any circumstances, but even more so when the potential acquirer is the company's most important business relationship. Given their existing strategic partnership, BlackLine meets the profile of an ideal fit for private equity. With stable reoccurring revenue and modest growth, the value here is all in the margins, and PE firms have consistently demonstrated their ability to build software businesses with 20% EBITDA margins, like BlackLine, and expand them upwards of 40% once private, such as Vista/Blackstone at Smartsheet and Francisco Partners/TPG at New Relic. Notably, Clearlake Capital continues to own a 9.6% position in BlackLine. A lot has happened since Engaged first presented this thesis last October. Shortly thereafter, BlackLine disclosed that it has maintained an independent strategic committee of the board for more than a year, with members including David Henshall, who is serving as chairperson, Greg Hughes and Tom Unterman. Notably, Henshall has a history of getting companies sold as a director, including New Relic when it was engaged by Engaged. Following this announcement, Engaged issued a 220 Demand letter to the company requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former SVP at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology -focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious. When assessing Engaged's chances of success in a proxy fight, there are several dynamics to consider. First, in late December, Unterman announced that he will not stand for re-election as a member of the board at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting. His impending departure creates both a board vacancy in a seat up for election in 2026, so at worst for Engaged, it will be running its slate of four against three incumbents and a new nominee. Third, there are signs of shareholder discontent, as CEO Ryan received over 20% withhold votes last time he was up for election. Finally, and most significant, one of the four directors up for election is founder Therese Tucker. BlackLine added two new directors in June and July of 2025, which the company will undoubtedly argue is evidence of good corporate governance and board refreshment. However, these directors are in the class up for re-election in 2027, and good corporate governance would dictate that they are voted on in the 2026 election so not to be on the board for two years without shareholder approval. Finally, it is important to note that one of the directors up for election this year is Scott Davidson who was appointed to the board last year as part of the Scalar Gauge settlement. By targeting him, Engaged cannot necessarily rely on Scalar Gauge's support, but that firm only owns a 1.15% stake. Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moving between panels, hotel lobbies, and meetings this week, it often felt like two conferences were happening in the same snowy Swiss village. In one Davos, the mood was strikingly optimistic. Executives and investors spoke about artificial intelligence moving from hype to production, terms like "world models" and "physical AI" were being thrown around, with discussions about the enormous pools of capital ready to back it. In the other, a number of conversations seemed to end up back at tariffs, Greenland, geopolitical tensions, and a growing sense that the global rules investors have relied on for decades are shifting in real time. "Technology is advancing faster than our collective wisdom." That tension between swift innovation and political uncertainty defined much of the week. On Wednesday, thousands queued for more than an hour to hear U.S. President Donald Trump's address at the Congress Hall. Trump's speech swung between humor, provocation, and unpredictability. People who laughed moments before turned quiet. Some shook their heads; others exchanged uneasy glances. In a packed session, Tesla's CEO outlined an ambitious vision for robotaxis, humanoid robots, and AI development. Afterward, conversations moved to data centers, battery storage, computing power, and how cities and grids will cope with the expected surge in demand for energy. One day, Davos was trying to understand the geopolitical implications of Trump's speech. Next, it was back to talking about the technological future at full speed. That whiplash kept showing up in interviews throughout the week. Waleed Al Mokarrab Al Muhairi, deputy CEO of Abu Dhabi-based investment giant Mubadala, told CNBC's Dan Murphy the investment stance into 2026 could be summed up in two words: "conviction driven." "So it's not chaotic, but the world is becoming more fragmented, without a doubt," he said. "That will come with its own opportunity, but pitfalls as well … As long as you can deploy capital in a methodical, strategic, conviction-driven sort of manner, then I think you're going to be ahead of the pack" Meanwhile, Joe Kaeser, chair of Siemens Energy, framed AI as an industrial opportunity rather than a race for consumers. "There is no such continent in the world which has as much data on industrialization, mechanization, and automation as Europe," he told CNBC. Kaeser said leaders were still waiting to see whether policy announcements would translate into action. "The jury is still out on whether things will be executed as announced," he said. "But if one of the very important players is not willing to play, it's bad for everybody." For finance ministers and other policymakers, much of the Davos message this year was about reassurance. Enoch Godongwana, South Africa's finance minister, highlighted recent credit upgrades, his country's removal from the U.S. Financial Action Task Force's gray list, and political stability, before the conversation turned to managing ties with Washington and trade talks. "It is difficult to predict, and we don't know its implications." Saudi Arabia's finance minister, Mohammed Al-Jadaan, returned repeatedly to the need for dialogue. "What businesses need is certainty," he said, adding that disputes should be resolved through dialogue. By week's end, a clear pattern appeared. Panels on AI, the energy transition, and industrial reinvention were packed. Private discussions focused on expansion, deployment, and long-term prospects. But in less busy moments — over coffee, in corridors, on shuttles — the talk returned to Greenland, tariffs, and how swiftly policy could alter the investment calculus. One Davos focused on the tech frontier and what AI could unlock. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Already, Musk is the richest person on the planet with a net worth that tops $660 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk saw his 2018 Tesla pay package -- now valued at over $130 billion -- reinstated in December, and his company SpaceX looks set to for a potential public offering in 2026. Those two events could well put Musk on his way to becoming the world's first trillionaire this year. In addition, his new pay package, valued at up to $1 trillion, could also start paying out over the next decade. While Musk may be an outlier, his stock-fueled gains highlight the booming compensation and wealth gains of CEOs in recent decades that has been driven by rising stock markets and a broader adoption of stock-centric pay packages That compares to a 26% increase in typical worker compensation. Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEO's was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% from 2023, according to Equilar, a corporate analytics firm. CEOs now make 192 times more than the average employee, up from a 186 to 1 ratio in 2023. Driving the acceleration in CEO pay is a shift in the types of stock awards used to incentivize and reward corporate chiefs. Stock awards accounted for 72% of CEO pay packages in 2024, with the median value increasing 15% that year, according to Equilar. Musk's trillion-dollar pay package, for instance, doesn't include any salary. For Musk to get the full payout, Tesla must hit key milestones, including certain market capitalization and operational achievements. He could still earn billions in stock even if Tesla doesn't meet all the targets. "Milestone achievements built into CEO pay packages could be the norm in the future," said Amit Batish, senior director marketing at Equilar. Company boards and CEOs themselves say that because their pay is tied closely to stock performance, their compensation reflects the larger wealth created for shareholders. If stocks plummet, CEO's can also see big pay drops. A 2021 MSCI study of top executive pay between 2006 and 2020 found a weak correlation between higher CEO pay and company performance. "This notion that the guy in the corner office is somehow almost single handedly responsible for company value, and everyone else is just little minions who don't contribute much of anything ... everyone can see that is not true," said Sarah Anderson, at the Institute for Policy Studies. According to the 2021 MSCI study, average performing CEO's took home only 4% less in realized pay than top-performing CEOs. "When we measured pay and performance against CEO tenure, we found little evidence that high CEO pay achieved this lofty goal of CEO incentivization," according to MSCI, an investment research firm. Since the 1990s, company boards have shifted away from stock options, which incentivize short-term performance, with stock awards, which boards argue are driven by longer-term incentives. Shareholders of publicly traded companies can now vote in an advisory capacity on CEO pay, known as "say on pay" votes, but company boards have final say when it comes to compensation packages. While restraining CEO pay has proven ineffective, given the natural "ratcheting up" of median CEO pay by board compensation committees, some economists advocate more stock awards for employees to help close the gap between employees and CEOs. Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs, for instance, are qualified retirement plans that give employees shares in the company through a trust. Employees who can partake in ESOPs tend to end up with better financial security, said Loren Rodgers, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership. That in turn benefits their companies, he said. Watch the video above to hear more about the uptick in CEO pay and what is driving these massive pay outs.

Some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people traveled to Switzerland this week, to attend the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos. That meant some of the world's fanciest aircraft descended on nearby airports, too. Business Insider has been tracking the private jets and government aircraft that arrived there this week. On Monday alone, there were around 160 private jet arrivals from over 40 countries spread across five continents. The majority appeared to land at Zurich Airport, which is 75 miles from Davos. Others landed at Friedrichshafen, over the border with Germany, or St Gallen, also near Lake Constance. From Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 to Air Force One, here's some of the most impressive aircraft. On Monday, 31 of the 157 private jet arrivals were Gulfstream G650s. Throughout the week in Switzerland, data from JetSpy showed such planes belonging to: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Blackstone, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase. Gulfstream jets are known for their large, circular windows, which give high-flyers great views. Business jets can be configured in different ways depending on what the customer wants. Sometimes, they have double beds and an on-board shower. It's more likely that a billionaire flying solo would choose that, whereas a company would probably prefer more seats. A Boeing Business Jet version of the 737 Max costs about $100 million. Flight-tracking data showed a private 737 that flew from Dubai to Zurich on Sunday. Another one from Dubai went to Friedrichshafen, a lakeside German city just over the Swiss border, on Tuesday. Some governments also use the 737 to transport political leaders. Due to its size, the Boeing 737 business jet is even more customizable than Gulfstream or Bombardier aircraft. Sometimes they are laid out like a typical airliner, with six seats abreast. But there is room for all sorts of amenities, too. The first Gulfstream G800 was only delivered last August, so they're still relatively rare to see. A handful of them flew into Swiss airports this week. JetSpy data shows they included ones owned by Visa, Qualcomm, and Pfizer. It's big enough to have room for four living areas on board. Passengers also shouldn't feel as fatigued as flying commercial, because the G800's cabin pressure makes it feel like the altitude is 2,480 feet. This is the interior of a Global 7500 owned by VistaJet, a private charter firm that operates the most such jets. Emmanuel Macron appeared to arrive in Davos on Tuesday. That morning, two French government jets — a Dassault Falcon 7X and a smaller Falcon 900 — flew to Zurich from an air base near Paris. Even the president couldn't help compliment Macron's eyewear, which spawned plenty of memes and jokes online. A Dassault Falcon 8X arrived in Zurich from Scottsdale, Arizona, on Tuesday, flight-tracking data showed. However, 30 minutes into his journey, the plane U-turned and went back to Joint Base Andrews. This week served as a reminder of Trump's impatience with Boeing over delays in building the new Air Force One. That plane is currently undergoing modifications and refitting by the Air Force. The Sikorsky VH-60N White Hawk flew in a convoy of at least five helicopters. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has had a busy start to the year. He flew on a military version of the Airbus A330. It first arrived in Beijing on January 14, flew to Doha a few days later, and then to Zurich on Monday. The above Azerbaijani private jet landed in Zurich on Tuesday. The Argentine government's Boeing 757 jet, registered as "ARG-01," arrived in Zurich on Tuesday. Flight-tracking data showed it departed Buenos Aires on Monday evening, then stopped in the Canary Islands, before heading to Switzerland.</p>

Starting January 26, food delivery apps, including DoorDash and Uber Eats, will have to display for customers the option to tip a courier when they pay under city law. It's a particularly important topic for delivery workers, many of whom rely on tips to make the job financially worthwhile. Protections for delivery workers, including the tip law and enforcing an existing minimum pay law, have been a focus for the department since Mayor Zohran Mamdani took office on January 1. Under the new law, customers will still have the final say on how much to tip — or whether to tip at all. But research suggests it matters if customers see the option to tip earlier. Tips are a major source of gig worker earnings on apps like DoorDash and Uber Eats. Nationally, tips accounted for almost 49% of food delivery workers' earnings in 2025, according to Gridwise, a data analytics company. In a lawsuit that DoorDash and Uber filed last month to block the law, the companies said that mandating a tipping option at checkout would lead to "tipping fatigue" among customers. On Friday, a federal judge rejected the companies' suit. "Allowing this law to take effect means we will likely see an immediate drop off in orders for New York's small businesses, a worse experience for customers, and fewer overall deliveries for New York City dashers," a DoorDash spokesperson told Business Insider after the court decision. DoorDash did not directly respond to questions about its concern that orders would decrease as a result of the law. An Uber spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. In late 2023, about a month before DoorDash removed the option to tip at checkout in New York City, it warned some customers that their orders might take longer to arrive if they didn't tip in advance. He knows other delivery workers who work for Grubhub, a delivery service that has continued to prompt customers to tip at checkout in New York City. While a good day for him on Uber Eats involves making just over $100, Ricky said, some of the Grubhub workers make double that, thanks in large part to gratuities from customers. Ricky said he's hoping for a similar bump in earnings after the city's tip law takes effect on Monday. "That would give me the motivation to stay outside and work all day," he said. With fewer tips over the past two years, many delivery workers in New York City have had to take extra orders to cover their costs, such as the cost of an e-bike to make deliveries, said Ligia Guallpa, executive director of the Workers Justice Project and cofounder of Los Deliveristas Unidos, two advocacy groups for delivery workers. "Often, tipping allows them to have the additional income that they need to cover the additional operating costs," she said.</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Zina Malas, 24, who lives in Beirut. The following has been edited for length and clarity. When I visited Canada as a 5-year-old, it was the dream. I was born and raised in Lebanon, and grew up fearing I'd get kidnapped in the streets or a random bomb would fall on me. There were nice parks, and "exotic" activities like ice skating. Three years in, I had struggled to find a job or save money, and began feeling very depressed, so I moved back to Lebanon. I'd still advise others to try relocating abroad, but living in Canada just didn't work for me. My time spent studying media and communication at the American University of Beirut was disrupted by a national revolution that started in fall 2019, COVID, and the Beirut explosion in August 2020. I already had friends in Montreal and Canadian citizenship through one of my parents, so I headed to Canada and gave myself three months to find a job. Even though my Montreal friends warned me that finding a job wouldn't be easy, I didn't think it would be that hard. I was used to sending my application to a potential employer, DM'ing the company on Instagram, and having an interview the next day. Some recruiters told me I didn't have the right experience. I'm not sure if it was because my experience was Lebanese or not Canadian, but it felt like people were treating me like I had no professional history. I also struggled to understand interviewers who spoke Québécois French, a dialect used in Montreal. I went to a French school in Lebanon, so I'm fluent, but I couldn't for the life of me understand this particular accent, which lost me opportunities. After applying for what I'd estimate were at least 200 jobs, I connected with a Lebanese HR rep who saw my résumé and gave me the chance to interview for a content manager role. After roughly three months of searching, it became my first job in Canada. I stayed at the company for 1.5 years, and then moved into tech sales at a different company for a few months. In Lebanon, the work culture was generally less formal. I could show up late to work in a random outfit and no one would say anything. We could have disorganized files and communicate with team members over Whatsapp. I knew exactly what my tasks were, and was given proper equipment. But with the cost of rent, bills, and groceries, I feel like I wasn't saving much, and was basically living paycheck to paycheck. It's one of the reasons I left. Another reason was how hard it was to meet new people, and my mental health suffered as a result. In Lebanon, if I go out with one friend to a restaurant, I'll end up meeting 10 new people. If I tried to talk to people in Canada while I was out, conversations would end abruptly. I imagined I'd meet so many new people and have the time of my life, but my expectations weren't met. Plus, I couldn't deal with the cold weather. I'm currently running my own company, Tawlé Consultancy, which helps businesses in the MENA region who are declining or feel stuck. I started it in Canada, but working on it from the West felt weird, as though I was righteously telling people what to do from a distance. Now, I can sit with people, help them come up with new ideas, and feel like I'm making a valuable impact. I've noticed many people my age in Lebanon are also trying to build their own thing. Being in a stable country like Canada eased my mind, as I wasn't worried about my physical safety, and it helped me deal with the trauma I experienced in Lebanon.</p>

Jeremy Cerza, a 45-year-old retail investor, admits he isn't that experienced in markets, but even he knows metals stole the show in 2025. Gold and silver were among the best-performing investments last year— and should the S&P 500 drop more than 1% for five days in a row, Cerza says he's jumping into the rally, with a plan to yank money out of the US stocks and plough around $20,000 into precious metals.

A lot of investors felt that way in 2025, with more people squirreling away money into gold and silver as concerns about inflation, tariffs, and the strength of the US economy dominated the conversation and talk of "Sell America" took off. That only picked up steam in the second half of the year, with more investors jumping into metals as prices went parabolic. A FOMO-driven, meme-like rally that's taken many investors by surprise — and is leaving some worried that the flight to safety may itself be a bubble. That doesn't hold a candle to silver's increase. On average, retail investors poured a net $15 million into gold and a net $7 million into silver investments each day last year, according to data from VandaTrack Research. Chatter about gold and silver has also been strong online. The iShares Silver Trust ETF was among the top 20 most-talked about investments, according to data it shared with Business Insider. Bilaal Dhalech, one retail investor, said he began buying gold and silver during the pandemic, but has invested more aggressively in recent years to hedge against inflation and "excessive money printing." "I was shocked to see a conservative investment like gold and silver explode. Almost like meme coins," Dhalech said of the rally in 2025. Jesse Gaddis, a public relations professional who works with precious metals companies, said he had been tracking gold for years, back when Donald Trump talked about gold on an episode of The Apprentice. He finally began purchasing metals during the pandemic, after his client, a CEO of a precious metals firm, encouraged him to do so. When the investments rocketed higher in 2025, Gaddis says he wasn't surprised. He sees gold and silver as a form of "wealth preservation" and acknowledges that "Sell America" is one reason so many investors jumped into metals. At its Diamond District location in Manhattan, a line of 10 to 20 people consistently forms outside the doors at all hours of the day. On the one hand, many investors seem to be influenced by prominent gold bugs, who have been more vocal about the virtues of owning metals as tariffs and inflation have become bigger threats, Gozenput said. He said he believes many clients have been learning about trends like the debasement trade, which says the US dollar and dollar-denominated investments will weaken as debts pile up and fiat currency is devalued. "I would say it's a combination of both people have FOMO as well as realizing they're not properly insured with their financial future and investments if they have zero physical precious metals exposure," he said. Jeffrey Christian, a commodities expert and the managing director at CPM Group, said he believed "Sell America" fueled most of gold's and silver's rally through the end of last summer. Then, gold prices shot up last August as the Fed signaled it would continue lowering interest rates. At that point, he believes the speculative trade kicked into high gear. "That started this, what you call FOMO," he said, noting that his clients who were more "traditional" metals investors began to pull back as prices rocketed higher. Concern that the rally has run too far is growing. Dhalech said he didn't believe the metals would crash, though he wouldn't be surprised to see a 10% correction in gold and silver in the near term. This past week, Gaddis sold around half of his silver and gold ETFs to take some profits. "It's a nice slow ride up, but it's a quick elevator down," he said of a potential correction, adding he knew it would be harder for him to get rid of his physical metals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Friday ruled President Donald Trump's administration unlawfully suspended funding awarded to support the expansion of electric vehicle charger infrastructure, in a victory for 20Democratic-led states that sued over the action. U.S. District Judge Tana Lin in Seattle ruled in favor of 20 states as well as the District of Columbia, which had filed their lawsuit after the U.S. Department of Transportation in February suspended an EV charger infrastructure program enacted by Congress in 2021 under Democratic President Joe Biden. Lin's order permanently bars the Transportation Department from taking away the states' funds or canceling their previously approved implementation plans. "Judge Lin's order is a resounding win for the rule of law and for smart investment in our clean energy future," Mike Faulk, a spokesperson for Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown, said in a statement. The Transportation Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shortly after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took office in February, the DOT suspended the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, which was part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that Biden signed into law in 2021. The Trump administration has pursued a number of policies to boost the sale of gas-powered vehicles and cut EV incentives for automakers and consumers. States led by California, Colorado and Washington sued in May, alleging the Trump administration was wrongly withholding billions of dollars they were previously awarded. The administration argued it was but a temporary pause, which it later ended after the judge earlier issued a preliminary injunction and the agency issued new guidance. But Lin said the 2021 law never contemplated even temporary pauses in funding for the construction of EV infrastructure. "In short, Defendants defied the will of Congress by withholding funds in a manner not contemplated by the IIJA," she wrote. The U.S. Senate is slated next week to consider legislation that has already cleared the U.S. House of Representatives that would redirect $879 million in funds approved under Biden for the EV charging network to other infrastructure priorities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met in Abu Dhabi on Friday to tackle the vital issue of territory, with no sign of a compromise, as Russian airstrikes plunged Ukraine into its worst energy crisis of the nearly four-year war. Kyiv is under mounting U.S. pressure to reach a peace deal in the war triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, with Moscow demanding Kyiv cede its entire eastern industrial area of Donbas before it stops fighting. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the territorial dispute was a central issue for the tripartite talks, including Russian, Ukrainian and U.S. officials, which were scheduled to conclude on Saturday. "The most important thing is that Russia should be ready to end this war, which it started," Zelenskiy said in a statement on the Telegram app, adding he was in regular contact with the Ukrainian negotiators, but it was too early to draw conclusions from Friday's talks. The negotiations come a day after Zelenskiy met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Zelenskiy said on Friday that a deal on U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine was ready, and that he was only waiting on Trump for a specific date and place to sign it. Ukraine has sought robust security guarantees from Western allies in the event of a peace deal to prevent Russia, which has shown little interest in ending the war, from invading again. The tripartite talks, brokered by the U.S., are unfolding against a backdrop of intensified Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy system that have cut power and heating to major cities such as Kyiv, as temperatures dip well below freezing. The head of Ukraine's top private power producer, Maxim Timchenko, told Reuters on Friday the situation was nearing a "humanitarian catastrophe" and that Ukraine needs a ceasefire that halts attacks on energy infrastructure. Kyiv's energy minister said on Thursday that Ukraine's power grid had endured its most difficult day since a widespread blackout in November 2022, when Russia began bombing energy infrastructure. Russia says it wants a diplomatic solution but will keep working to achieve its goals by military means as long as a negotiated solution remains elusive. Russian President Vladimir Putin's demand that Ukraine surrender the 20% it still holds of the Donetsk region of the Donbas - about 5,000 sq km (1,900 sq miles) - has proven a major stumbling block to a breakthrough deal. Zelenskiy refuses to give up land that Russia has not been able to capture in four years of grinding, attritional warfare. Polls show little appetite among Ukrainians for territorial concessions. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Russia's insistence on Ukraine yielding all of Donbas was "a very important condition." A source close to the Kremlin told Reuters that Moscow considers an "Anchorage formula" - which Russia says was agreed between Trump and Putin at a summit in Alaska last August - would hand Russia control of all of Donbas and freeze the front lines elsewhere in Ukraine's east and south. Donetsk is one of four Ukrainian regions Moscow said in 2022 it was annexing after referendums rejected by Kyiv and Western nations as bogus. Ukraine, backed by European allies, demands that Russia pay it reparations. Asked about Russia's idea, Zelenskiy dismissed it as "nonsense." Last year, Russian and Ukrainian delegations had their first face-to-face meeting since 2022 when they met in Istanbul. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a complaint filed on Friday, while paying his staff "minimal wages" and feeding residents at his housing sites "ramen noodles, canned beans, and breakfast bars," Soofer pocketed at least $10 million "through bank accounts associated with other businesses in his and his wife's names" for personal expenses after "fraudulently obtaining" $23 million in public funding. Federal officials said that between 2018 and 2025, Soofer's organization received more than $5 million directly from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority and over $17 million through other nonprofits. Investigators found Soofer's misuse of funds includes $47,000 in luxury home purchases from stores like Restoration Hardware, $15,000 at Hermès, $15,000 at Chanel, $1,000 for cosmetic dermatology, and $4,500 for a four-night stay at the Wynn Las Vegas. Authorities said they have yet to determine what Soofer bought at Chanel, but listed his purchases at Hermès as including a $1,250 pair of men's Paris calf-skin loafers, a $910 pair of women's Chypre sandals, a $455 Chevaux en Symetrie tie, and a $2,450 men's trotting jacket. In addition to luxury brands, the complaint said there is at least one property under his name associated with the misappropriated funds. That property in question is located in Greece and relates to "a $475,000 check issued from an Abundant Blessings bank account." The case against Soofer feeds into concerns that California's efforts to combat homelessness may be ineffective and inconsistent despite large spending. State Auditor Grant Parks wrote in a 2024 report to Gov. Gavin Newsom and lawmakers that, when his department analyzed five housing programs that received approximately $13.7 billion in combined funding, only two were "likely cost-effective." Parks also added in the report that, between fiscal years 2018-2023, California cities lacked reliable data to track cost efficiency and outcomes needed to fully understand why the problem didn't improve, despite the billions spent by more than 30 housing programs.</p>
