                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Thursday night at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles, U.S. Women's National Team star Trinity Rodman put pen to paper on a deal that will go down as one of the most significant contracts in women's sports. Rodman signed a new agreement with the Washington Spirit that is notable not only for its price tag - though the numbers are historic - but for what it represents: progress, friction, and a clear investment in the future of the women's game. The three-year deal will see Rodman earn upwards of $2 million annually, plus bonuses, according to ESPN. At a moment when elite American talent has increasingly looked overseas, Rodman's decision to remain with the Washington Spirit through 2028 represents a meaningful statement about the league's present and future. That outcome was not without its hurdles. When Rodman's previous contract neared expiration, NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman was asked how the league planned to retain a player of her stature. Berman responded - and reiterated - that the league would “fight for her.” Yet when the Spirit and Rodman agreed to a four-year deal reportedly valued at more than $1 million annually, the league vetoed the contract, citing concerns over structure and precedent. What followed was a rare and public standoff. Still, amid the ongoing legal questions, Rodman's deal was finalized. Rodman is not only one of the most talented players in the league - she is one of its most magnetic. Her ability to draw fans, inspire young players to be unapologetically themselves, and elevate the entertainment value of the league sets her apart. At a time when stars like Naomi Girma, Alyssa Thompson, and Sam Coffey have departed for Europe, keeping Rodman at home marks a shift in narrative. There has been no clear indication that the High Impact Player rule was used in Rodman's signing, leaving some ambiguity around how - or if - the mechanism was applied. Shortly before Rodman finalized her deal with the Spirit, expansion side Denver Summit signed USWNT captain Lindsey Heaps from OL Lyonnes, a move that could have marked the first use of the HIP rule. The NWSL Players Association filed a grievance shortly thereafter. One of the primary critiques of the HIP rule centers on its criteria, which are based on national team minutes and evaluations from select media members. When USWNT head coach Emma Hayes was asked about the rule - and whether it could impact her lineup choices - on the Unfiltered podcast, she was candid in her response. That's been designed by somebody else, and you have to take that up with someone else,” Hayes said. “My job is to pick the very best team for the U.S. Women's National Team, regardless of status, contracts, or wherever you are. “It's not the right position to put me, or any coach, in,” she added. Their ownership group also includes NBA legend Magic Johnson as a minority owner. Retaining a player like Rodman in the league is one thing, but her wanting to stay with the Spirit and continue her career in the DMV is another. "I've made the DMV my home and the Spirit my family, and I knew this was where I wanted to enter the next chapter of my career," Rodman in a press release. "I'm proud of what we've built since my rookie season, and I'm excited about where this club is headed. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Rodman is reportedly making upwards of $2 million per year with the Spirit, under her new contract. If she signed a deal overseas would it have been more lucrative? When the whispering of interest overseas came to the forefront, her agent, Mike Senkowski, said, "We worked really hard to put together an agreement that we felt complied with the CBA and would keep Trinity in the league for the foreseeable future... With no certain way to get her fair market value within the NWSL, naturally, that forces you and encourages you to look elsewhere." Rodman reportedly received multiple offers from clubs in England, none of which were restricted by a salary cap. Still, there is no higher designation than becoming the highest-paid female soccer player in the world - and Rodman has now reached it. "Trinity is an inspiration to young girls across America. She is a player they can relate to, and those young fans matter more than anything to her," Senkowski said on Thursday. "The decision to continue to play here represents a very clear vision for the future of women's soccer. Rodman's decision to remain in the NWSL is not only a landmark moment for her career, but one that helps set the tone for what is possible for others. When she signed the deal on Thursday, Rodman was joined by her biggest fan - a young girl named Emma, wearing long pink braids - a small but powerful reminder of the impact she has beyond the field. That influence on the next generation is already clear. But by signing a deal of this magnitude, Rodman is also helping open the door for players across the NWSL - and beyond it - to envision a future where staying home does not mean settling for less. "Not only me personally but all of us at the Spirit are profoundly grateful that she has chosen to stay with us for another three years despite some very compelling alternatives she had," Kang said at the press conference on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 World Cup is just months away as the United States — alongside Canada and Mexico — is preparing to host soccer's foremost competition. However, German soccer federation executive Oke Göttlich is calling for talks about a boycott amidst U.S. President Donald Trump's recent actions. Trump as stirred some outrage in Europe recently with his insistence on acquiring Greenland, a territory currently owned by Denmark. Trump has further strained relations with Europe as well by threatening to impose tariffs on eight European nations in his effort to pursue Greenland. French sport minister Marina Ferrari said earlier this week that they were not considering a boycott, but did not rule the possibility out entirely if the situation with Greenland escalates. "At the moment we are speaking, there is no desire from the ministry to boycott this major, much-anticipated competition," Ferrari commented on Tuesday. "That said, I am not prejudging what might happen." There has been a boycott of the World Cup before. Göttlich claimed, "By my reckoning the potential threat is greater now than it was then. The Germans were also displeased about 2022 World Cup host Qatar. "Qatar was too political for everyone and now we're completely apolitical? The 2026 World Cup is set to begin on June 11 with two Group A matches. ET, and South Korea's opponent has yet to be determined for their 10 p.m. match. The United States' first game will be on June 12, a match against Paraguay that is set to start at 9 p.m.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The president of Bundesliga club FC St. Pauli, Oke Gottlich, has called for a serious discussion about boycotting the 2026 FIFA World Cup due to recent actions by U.S. President Donald Trump. In an interview with German media, Gottlich made clear that the idea of a boycott should not be dismissed lightly. “The time has come [to] seriously consider and discuss this,” Gottlich said. By my reckoning, the potential threat is greater now than it was then. Reports indicate that political tensions in the United States have already contributed to protests and even ticket cancellations linked to politics and safety concerns, with thousands of fans withdrawing from ticket plans in recent months amid a hashtag-driven boycott movement. Taboos are an essential part of our stance,” he continued. I would like to know from Donald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from Bernd Neuendorf and Gianni Infantino,” Gottlich concluded. Political rhetoric about safety and internal U.S. policy has at times spilled into discussions about match locations and travel, prompting debates over how politicised events should be when international sport is meant to unify fans from across the world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bournemouth president of football operations Tiago Pinto claimed Real Madrid summer signing Dean Huijsen is the “only center back” that can win the Ballon d'Or one day. Huijsen had a bright start in a white shirt at the Club World Cup and in the early stages under former boss Xabi Alonso, but his form took a dive in October and he has yet to fully return to the level needed to play at Real Madrid. Still, Pinto backs the former Bournemouth standout to reach extraordinary heights as he continues to grow and evolve his game. “I'll give you a headline: For me, he's the only center back who can win the Ballon d'Or. That's what I think of Dean Huijsen,” he told MARCA. Huijsen made the move to the Spanish capital with lofty expectations, not just because of his price tag, but also because of his five-year contract. After all, Antonio Rüdiger is 32 years old and in the final six months of his contract. David Alaba is a year older and also expected to leave the club this summer. The pathway for Huijsen to rise and eventually assume full control of the team's backline is clear, and he could bring a silkiness on the ball that his current fellow center backs and even club legends like Sergio Ramos never had. Yet his confidence at the minute is lacking. “I've had quite a few injuries lately and I finally feel physically fit,” Huijsen told Movistar+ after Real Madrid's 6–1 rout over Monaco. “I've been playing injured for two or three months, unable to sprint properly. One week later against Levante, new boss Álvaro Arbeloa pulled him 60 minutes into the game after several head-scratching, nervy decisions. It has no doubt been a whirlwind seven months for Huijsen, who signed with Real Madrid in May and then made his debut one month later at the Club World Cup. Since then, the Spaniard has amassed 26 appearances in a white shirt, played in his first Clásico and Madrid derby, suffered nagging injuries and then saw the club swap Alonso for Arbeloa on the touchline. “You can't expect them to ‘devour' Real Madrid in six months. They have to learn and develop other things,” Pinto said. Huijsen has the chance to make up for his shaky start at Real Madrid by putting in a solid second half of the season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A French politician has questioned whether the United States should be allowed to host the FIFA World Cup following renewed controversy surrounding Donald Trump's political positions and foreign policy rhetoric. The comments add to a growing international debate about whether global sporting events should be insulated from geopolitical tensions. “Seriously, one imagines going to play the World Cup in a country who attacks its ‘neighbours,' threatens to invade Greenland and rides roughshod over international law,” Coquerel said. Coquerel's remarks came as part of a broader European reaction to comments and positions associated with Trump, which have reignited debate about the political environment surrounding the 2026 FIFA World Cup, set to be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Donald Trump's connection to Greenland dates back to his first presidency, when he publicly confirmed interest in the United States purchasing the Danish territory in 2019. The proposal was rejected by Denmark, which reiterated that Greenland is not for sale. Since then, Greenland has remained a subject of political discussion due to its strategic importance in the Arctic, where the United States already maintains a military presence at Pituffik Space Base under long-standing agreements with Denmark. There is no evidence of any formal plan by the United States to invade or seize Greenland. However, Trump has repeatedly spoken about expanding American influence and security interests in the region, rhetoric that critics argue undermines international norms and fuels diplomatic unease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Calls grow to weaponize football as the U.S. president escalates tensions with Europe. A senior German football executive has urged Europe to consider boycotting the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating rhetoric over Greenland and broader foreign policy moves spark unease across the continent. “By my reckoning, the potential threat is greater now than it was then. “Qatar was too political for everyone, and now we're completely apolitical?” he said. His comments add momentum to a growing debate in Europe over whether global sport can remain insulated from politics as Trump ramps up pressure on allies — from threats surrounding Greenland to U.S. military action in Venezuela — while treating the World Cup as a major soft-power trophy of his second term. France's sports minister said this week there was “no desire” in Paris to boycott the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, arguing that sport should remain separate from politics. Still, several European football leaders have already shown a willingness to wade into political disputes. The president of Norway's football federation, Lise Klaveness, has repeatedly criticized human rights issues tied to major tournaments, while Ireland's football association pushed to exclude Israel from international competition before the Gaza peace agreement last year. Göttlich also dismissed concerns that a boycott would unfairly punish players, including St. Pauli's international stars. Zelenskyy says trilateral negotiations were constructive, with more meetings possible next week, despite massive Russian airstrikes overnight.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the 2026 FIFA World Cup set to kick off in just under five months, the Department of State has officially launched the FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System (FIFA PASS) – a new program designed to expedite visa interviews for international ticket holders while maintaining national security standards. Announced in November 2025 during a high-profile White House event featuring President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and FIFA President Gianni Infantino, FIFA PASS is meant to represent a proactive step to handle the massive influx of visitors expected for the games – as well as somewhat of a partnership between America's leaders and the tournament's organizers. The visa system allows those who have purchased tickets directly from FIFA to opt in and schedule their own prioritized visa appointments ahead of the tournament's June 11 start date, helping to avoid last-minute bottlenecks at U.S. embassies and consulates. “This will be a once in a lifetime opportunity to showcase the beauty and the greatness of America. According to those guidelines, applicants must demonstrate that they qualify for a nonimmigrant visa, intend to comply with all U.S. laws, and plan to leave the U.S. after the tournament ends on July 19. Scheduling an interview does not guarantee visa approval; every applicant will undergo thorough security vetting and background checks before being allowed into the United States. The visa strategy comes after FIFA reported record-breaking ticket sales, as previously reported by The Dallas Express, and now anticipates that 5 to 10 million international visitors will flock to host cities across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. To improve the processing capacity for all these football fans, the State Department is deploying hundreds of additional staff members to handle these applications. A state department press release reads, “The United States Department of State is surging over 450 extra staffers to consulates around the world to make sure that we can continue to decrease these appointment times. While a recent pause on immigrant visa issuances was announced on January 14, State Department officials have clarified that it does not affect nonimmigrant categories such as those for tourists and World Cup attendees.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. -- The U.S women's national team will play its first game of the year, and winger Trinity Rodman is back in the mix following an MCL Sprain and with a brand new historic club contract. Head coach Emma Hayes selected a 26-player roster for the annual January camp, and this year's edition will include two games. While a large portion of the group is less experienced and has fewer camps, there are a few players who were part of Hayes' gold medal-winning squad during the 2024 Paris Olympics, including Trinity Rodman. Rodman entered USWNT camps without a club affiliation as contract negotiations were ongoing, but she recently signed a new record-setting contract on Thursday. Manager Emma Hayes quickly quelled any doubts on whether or not Rodman would play after a long time away from the national team. The head coach unveiled that Rodman will captain the team during their first match against Paraguay, a conversation she had with the winger as they mapped out training camps and evaluated her progress. One of the things that was spoken about is when there is an absence of so many caps and so much leadership here. I've also had the same conversation with Claire Hutton. I've had the same conversation with Emily Sams. I think those three in particular have been given more leadership responsibilities by me this week." Head coach Emma Hayes has been transparent about the unique winter camp and how it will be utilized, as it falls outside of an official international window. I always approach things like it's the day before a World Cup final, and every game should be played with that same intention, no matter the starting lineup," Hayes said. "Yes, we have a much different group than we would ordinarily have, but what a great development opportunity for so many of them. Not all of them, I think, will compete to be part of the group that qualifies for 2027, but I've said it countless times, my job is to prepare players, not just for a single tournament, but to line up successive competitive teams, and some of these players, I think that we'll see on show could be stars of 2031 as well as some that will push into 2028, so, I think we have to be mindful of that." The January camp game will also feature a retirement celebration for Christen Press. The long-time former USWNT forward recently announced her retirement and will be honored in her home state when the team faces Paraguay. "When I think of Christen Press and how well traveled her career was, I think she had to do that in the backdrop of maybe being a little bit harder to make those choices as a U.S. women's national team player, whereas I think in this day and age, there is more freedom to move, or more opportunity too that comes with that, because the game has grown. So I think, I think Christen Press is somebody who pioneered in some regards to play abroad, to go and do different things," said Hayes. I was always a big fan of her play. So whomever it is, being celebrated I feel like I get the chance to honor that and celebrate that as well." There is no gambling offered on this site.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"One-person companies": How FIFA is using influencers to drown out traditional media -  The Bridge Chronicle FIFA's partnership aims to generate an "avalanche of posts" by providing online personalities with front-row seats, archive footage, and match highlights. This follows a successful blueprint set by DAZN during the FIFA Club World Cup, where a network of 50 creators drove over 500,000 fans to their streaming service. Authenticity: Creators are viewed as more "trustworthy" by the 16-to-34 demographic compared to traditional anchors. Productivity: Known as "one-person companies," these influencers perform, shoot, edit, and post with a speed that legacy media cannot match. Control: Unlike independent journalists, creators often operate within a media environment where the demands of the "client" (FIFA) come first. By using a roster of hand-picked creators, FIFA can steer the global conversation away from "problematic" topics and toward pure enthusiasm. A notable example cited is DAZN's use of creator Emily Austin to interview Donald Trump; rather than a hard-hitting journalistic inquiry, the segment served to celebrate the tournament's success and flatter both the host nation and FIFA. Whether these traditional broadcasters will allow TikTok creators to "disrupt" their exclusive territory remains the primary roadblock to FIFA's total digital domination.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this World Cup year, Fifa has come out of the blocks quickly. Among the ever-expanding list is an intriguing deal with TikTok, a partnership that will give digital creators front-row seats at the 104-match tournament. In Fifa language its partnership with the short-form video platform will make “the most inclusive event in football history … even more accessible”. According to TikTok's global head of content, James Stafford, it will bring fans “closer to the action in ways they can't get anywhere else”. It plans to do so by granting an unspecified number of online personalities behind-the-scenes access, giving them archive and highlights footage to use in their content and, in return, requesting an avalanche of posts that will make the World Cup inescapable for TikTok users. In choosing TikTok as its preferred platform Fifa is catching up with the times. The use of creators, also known as influencers, is increasingly essential for any consumer business. Last summer the streaming company Dazn built its own creator network for Fifa's Club World Cup. It enlisted as many as 50 creators to post videos that built excitement around the event, be they behind-the-scenes tours, interviews with players and coaches or stunts such as racing to see who could make it to the Chelsea v Palmeiras game on time. “It was a new tournament and we wanted to hit every lever we possibly could to generate awareness in as many places as possible, particularly with a younger audience,” says Joe Caporoso, the president of Team Whistle, a Dazn-owned company that specialises in digital strategy. We wanted to make sure we had people and creators who spoke authentically and were not shy about showing everything that goes on around the game.” From there, Caporoso's team laid out a campaign that defined the amount of content creators were expected to generate. A group of editors and content programmers made sure each post was optimised for maximum exposure and liaised with creators to make sure no potential talking point or key moment was missed. This is a degree of oversight materially higher than that of, say, the BBC over Gary Lineker at the last European Championship. TikTok says the Club World Cup creator platform drove more than 500,000 fans to Dazn's service and that 90% of fans take “at least one off-platform action” after viewing sports content on their app. Fifa says its creator platform is designed for similar purposes, such as directing new viewers to its match coverage, but it could perform other functions too. It could be a new revenue stream, for example, with Fifa taking a cut from the advertising revenue generated on TikTok through the deal. Instead of allowing the post-match debate or attention between matchdays to be channeled by media companies, a creator platform deal keeps sports organisers in the conversation. “It's a way for them to become a partner and to have their say, a bit of their say, in how their material is presented on second screens,” says François Godard of the media research company Enders Analysis. Creators offer the possibility of drumming up enthusiasm should interest begin to wane, but also keeping discussion away from topics that might be problematic. When Dazn secured an interview with Donald Trump before the Club World Cup final, it asked Emily Austin, from its roster of creators, to conduct it. Creators present an efficient and effective way of reaching audiences with a defined message. Godard, however, is sceptical of how useful they might be in driving audience growth for sport. According to the publication Puck, TikTok would need a sublicensing deal with the broadcaster Fox, an arrangement yet to be struck. The BBC said it would not comment on rights negotiations. Godard believes that instead the platform is a play to develop new places where Fifa may ultimately sell its rights, even as it extends the offering on its Fifa+ broadcast platform (thanks to a new deal with Dazn).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three years on from his seismic arrival at Chelsea after one of the most dramatic transfer sagas in recent memory, Enzo Fernandez is facing an uncertain future at Stamford Bridge. Supposedly growing disillusioned with life under BlueCo, the midfielder has been linked with some of Europe's biggest clubs - and his current employers are said to be willing to do business. This unwanted noise comes almost exactly three years since Fernandez joined the Blues in a blockbuster £107 million ($131m) move from Benfica. In truth, we have only recently started to see the Argentine at his best, but if the rumours are to be believed, he won't be hanging around much longer. Fernandez's time at Chelsea has been a slow burn, but three years on from his arrival, it feels as though we are beginning to witness a player entering his peak years. Enzo Maresca's arrival as head coach in the summer of 2024 seemed to propel his game to another level, while Moises Caicedo's form at the base of midfield has freed him up to assert himself further up the pitch. Having racked up a combined 26 goals and assists last term, albeit those numbers are padded by the Conference League, Fernandez has struck eight times and laid on four more from the middle of the park this time around, and we're only in January. That figure doesn't include his four Club World Cup contributions, either. But his eye for goal and creativity are not even his greatest attributes, with his tireless running, intensity and leadership qualities, as he often dons the captain's armband, all absolutely vital to a young squad that is so often criticised for lacking nous and experience. Crucially, Fernandez has been a near ever-present, too, in a team that has had more than its fair share of injury problems; the Argentine has missed just one Premier League match so far, and that is despite struggling with chronic knee pain. The truth is that I feel very happy today." Fernandez shared a heartfelt farewell message to Maresca on social media in the aftermath, writing: "Mister, thank you for everything shared and experienced during this stage, I learned a lot and I value every advice and experience. We won two titles together that I will never forget. Much success to you and hopefully our paths will cross again in the future." Two weeks later, reports emerged in France claiming that the midfielder was 'considering his future' in west London as a result of the decision to part ways with Maresca, with the suggestion that he is growing disillusioned by the managerial churn at Chelsea; Maresca's replacement, Liam Rosenior, is the seventh manager he has worked under in just three years if you include interims Bruno Saltor, Frank Lampard and Calum McFarlane. According to L'Equipe, it is Paris Saint-Germain who are keen to capitalise on Fernandez's purported disenchantment with the way Chelsea are being run, earmarking him as a long-term target as the Champions League winners look to build a more competitive squad having fallen below their lofty standards so far this season. Fernandez has long been linked with La Liga giants Real Madrid, too, but that speculation seems to be gaining more momentum as Los Blancos face up to the possibility of having to overhaul parts of their squad in what could become a transitional period following Xabi Alonso's sacking. The midfielder has previously admitted to "always" playing as Real on video game EA FC. However, all of this is caveated by the fact that Fernandez still has a massive six years to run on his contract with the Blues, and because his current employers overpaid massively to sign him in 2023 for £107m, he will command a fee that would surely need to be north of that, which feels likely to price Madrid out of the equation. Whether PSG see fit to go that high for someone who wouldn't necessarily start among a group of midfielders that features Vitinha, Joao Neves and Fabian Ruiz remains to be seen. It is worth noting that the 25-year-old did switch representatives recently - often a sign that a player is weighing up his future - and has conspicuously signed with the agency owned by his compatriot and former PSG player, Javier Pastore. For what it's worth, new Chelsea head coach Rosenior has been outspoken in his desire to keep one of the club's most influential figures. He's been outstanding in the time I've worked with him. And I think we're going to have a really, really good, hopefully winning relationship moving forward in the short term and the long term." A player of his level can do many different things. I will do that with Enzo because he's an outstanding player." However, Rosenior's position on Fernandez may well be undermined by those above him in the Stamford Bridge food chain. It has been reported that Chelsea are in fact willing to sell one of their prized assets, with Enzo not among a group of players - presumably including Caicedo and Cole Palmer - who are considered to be off limits when it comes to transfer offers. The implication is that, should a bid arrive that is close to their valuation, the Blues would surprisingly be open to doing business. Bearing in mind the eye-watering fee that Fernandez arrived for three years ago, it would surely take an astronomical figure to really pique Chelsea's interest, but it seems an exit isn't out of the question. This is the BlueCo model, after all: buying young, high-potential players, developing them, inherently increasing their market value and eventually selling them for a profit. Selling Fernandez at this stage of Chelsea's transition would be the latest in a string of grave missteps in the transfer market by BlueCo. "I think last season was the first year in which we've really seen what the Chelsea project is about, having seen only a few moments of potential on the pitch in recent years," he said in a recent interview with Ben Jacobs. "When Chelsea came in for me, I had no doubts," he continued. Everyone knows that and thank God it worked out. Though Maresca's exit has brought more uncertainty, there is no doubt that Chelsea stand within reach of tangible, consistent success once again, if they play their cards right. This is not the way for Chelsea to take that next step.</p>

FIFA will pay $2.3 million in prize money to the club that wins the first Women's Champions Cup at Arsenal's stadium next week. The final stages in London are a warmup for a planned full Women's Club World Cup in 2028. European champion Arsenal will play ASFAR of Morocco after Gotham from the United States plays Corinthians of Brazil in back-to-back semifinals on Wednesday (January 28, 2026) at the home of Premier League club Brentford. Two continental champions already eliminated in earlier rounds — Auckland United from Oceania and Wuhan Chegu Jiangda representing Asia — each get $100,000. “The prize money is a clear statement of the belief in women's club football and the players, teams and competitions driving its continued rise,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafström said in a statement. Arsenal got more than 1.5 million euros ($1.8 million) in prize money for winning the UEFA Women's Champions League last season. FIFA paid $1 billion among 32 teams in the men's 2025 Club World Cup. That tournament in the United States was backed by Saudi Arabian money to ensure influential European clubs got the prize money they sought to agree to take part.

Team USA soccer player DeJuan Jones and MLS player Dominique Badji spoke to Fox News Digital about the upcoming World Cup, their hope to spread world peace through their sport and the debate over renaming soccer to football in America. A German soccer federation executive committee member has advocated for the consideration of the nation boycotting the upcoming FIFA World Cup in response to recent actions by President Donald Trump. Oke Göttlich, president of Bundesliga club St. Pauli and one of the German federation's 10 vice presidents, told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper in an interview Friday "the time has come" to "seriously consider and discuss this." By my reckoning, the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion," Göttlich said. Göttlich went on to reference the political conversations about the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and called out FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who is considered a close ally of Trump. "Qatar was too political for everyone, and now we're completely apolitical? Taboos are an essential part of our stance. I would like to know from Donald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from Bernd Neuendorf and Gianni Infantino." Göttlich also dismissed the suggestion a boycott would hurt St. Pauli's national team players, Australia's Jackson Irvine and Connor Metcalfe, and Japan's Joel Chima Fujita. "The life of a professional player is not worth more than the lives of countless people in various regions who are being directly or indirectly attacked or threatened by the World Cup host," he said. French Minister of Sports, Youth and Community Life Marina Ferrari told reporters this week the country has "no desire" to skip the World Cup, which takes place in North America this year. "As it stands now, there is no desire from the ministry for a boycott of this great competition," Ferrari said. "Now, I will not anticipate what could happen, but I have also heard voices raised from certain political blocs. I am one who believes in keeping sport separate [from politics]. The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport."

(Emilee Chinn/FIFA via Getty Images) Far-left French politician Éric Coquerel has called for the U.S. to be stripped of World Cup hosting rights and has suggested a boycott by France. "Seriously, one imagines going to play the World Cup in a country who attacks its ‘neighbours,' threatens to invade Greenland and rides roughshod over international law?" Trump announced on Truth Social Wednesday that the framework for a deal has been reached for the U.S. to gain control of parts of Greenland. "Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region," he wrote. "This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations," Trump wrote in the post. "Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st. Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland." Despite similar calls for sanctions in response to Trump's foreign policy, the U.S. has not been penalized by any major sports bodies for its recent intervention in Venezuela either.
