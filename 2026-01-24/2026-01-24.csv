President Donald Trump and his administration have adopted a rather confusing posture on their highly controversial immigration raids.
    


            On the one hand, they seem to recognize that ICE's actions are a growing political problem for them, as polls show 6 in 10 Americans say the agency has gone “too far.” Both Trump and Vice President JD Vance have begun acknowledging “mistakes” have been made or could be made in the future.
    


            But besides those rhetorical shifts, there is little evidence that the administration is actually changing up its practices. Indeed, just this week the administration has doubled down on one of its most aggressive volleys yet: claiming the power to enter people's homes without a judicial warrant, which was laid out in a May 2025 memo revealed this week.
    


            All of it suggests an administration that is sticking with an aggressive path.
    


            But there's plenty of evidence that path may continue causing political problems for the administration. The polling suggests a narrative of overreach and over-aggression has clearly set in, with a growing volume of videos and images likely hardening those perceptions.
    


            Here's what's really driving that narrative home right now.
    


            This remains the flashpoint because it in many ways epitomizes what stepping over the line between aggressive tactics and overzealous ones can mean.
    


            ICE agent Jonathan Ross' shooting and killing of Good in Minneapolis remains contentious. The main question is whether he legitimately feared Good running him over.
    


            But beyond that, his tactics have come under fire, including standing in front of Good's car (which ICE officers are generally advised not to do) and continuing to shoot at her from the side of the car, when he was objectively not in danger of being run over.
    


            What's clear is that the American people have come down decidedly against ICE and the administration's defense of the agent's actions. A CNN poll showed US adults said 56%-26% that the agent's use of force was inappropriate. Other surveys showed the same thing but by slightly smaller margins.
    


            The polls also show the Minneapolis shooting earned huge attention, with a Quinnipiac University poll finding 82% of registered voters said they'd seen video of the shooting.
    


            And finally – perhaps worst of all for the administration – a majority of Americans didn't see this as an isolated incident, per the CNN poll. While 56% said the use of force was inappropriate, 51% said both that it was inappropriate and that it “reflects bigger problems with the way ICE is operating.”
    


            Those findings suggest this episode has come to symbolize the larger controversy over ICE – and not in a good way for the administration.
    


            This is perhaps the most recent major development. And CNN's Michael Williams has a full download.
    


            Basically, an ICE memo has claimed agents have the authority to enter someone's home even if there is no warrant signed by a judge. It claims agents can instead use warrants signed by ICE officers themselves, called “administrative warrants.”
    


            But experts that Williams spoke to say that's not how it's supposed to work, with some going so far as to say it invalidates the Fourth Amendment and its protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
    


            The problem here is that there is basically no check on the executive branch's use of such administrative warrants. The ICE officer who signs the administrative warrant works for the executive branch. So the executive branch is both carrying out the search and deciding it has the authority to do so.
    


            A Department of Homeland Security training manual last year indicated the agency agreed – at least at that time – that judicial warrants were required to enter a home, The New York Times reported.
    


            Even when defending the use of administrative warrants Thursday, Vice President JD Vance didn't give it the most resounding defense.
    


            “Now it's possible, I guess, that the courts will say no,” he said, adding: “That's our understanding of the law.”
    


            Will your average American distinguish between judicial warrants and administrative warrants? Perhaps not. But this is the executive branch effectively giving itself the power to enter anyone's home without a court's say-so. That's the kind of thing that could seemingly rub those who value civil liberties the wrong way.
    


            We are still learning about the 5-year-old boy who was pictured being taken by ICE and is now being held with his father in a Texas facility.
    


            The administration claims it had no choice because the boy's father had fled his arrest and abandoned the child, and the mother would not accept custody of him. It has said it has treated the boy with great care.
    


            But the family's lawyer said the father and his son are not even in the country illegally – that they presented themselves to border officers in Texas in 2024 and were in the process of applying for asylum. And the superintendent of a local school district has alleged that the 5-year-old was used as bait to try and get another adult living in the home to come out. (A DHS spokeswoman who has made a series of dubious claims called the bait allegation a “horrific smear.”)
    


            But regardless of the particulars, this situation points to something that's quite politically problematic for the White House.
    


            I wrote in December 2024 about how scenes like this were inevitable. If you're truly pursuing a mass deportation agenda, it's virtually impossible to avoid either separating families or holding children in detention. There are simply too many minor citizen children (millions) who live with undocumented parents, for example.
    


            And indeed, overnight we learned about a similar example – a 2-year-old girl who was taken into ICE custody with her father and flown with him to Texas before being returned to her mother on Friday, according to a family lawyer. The family lawyer in an affidavit said the child was taken to Texas despite a court order requiring her immediate release.
    


            And these are the kinds of situations in which you tend to see support for deportation plummet.
    


            A 2018 CNN poll tested not detaining children and parents together, but separating them. Americans said by nearly 40 points that they preferred to focus on keeping families intact rather than prosecuting illegal immigration, if they had to choose.
    


            And the photos of the 5-year-old are perhaps the most indelible reminder yet that, while the administration has played up these efforts as apprehending the “worst of the worst,” there is plenty of much-more-sympathetic collateral damage.
    


            The administration often justifies its actions by saying undocumented migrants shouldn't benefit from the same protections as citizens. But citizens have often gotten snapped up, too.
    


            ProPublica found in October that more than 170 US citizens had been held by immigration agents by that point – including some who underwent rough treatment and were held for days. (“We don't arrest US citizens for immigration enforcement,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told ProPublica).
    


            Those detentions came into focus this week with the apprehension of a Hmong man in St. Paul who was escorted outside his home wearing little clothing in freezing-cold temperatures. The man, ChongLy Scott Thao, is a naturalized US citizen with no criminal record. He was released about an hour later.
    


            And we've since learned that not only was the man the victim of a mistaken identity, but one of the sex offenders ICE said it was looking for was actually already in custody, according to the Minnesota Department of Corrections. The situation would seem to point to a distinct lack of care in the federal government's actions, but also the fact that it's not just migrants who are finding themselves targeted – in ways that can rob them of their dignity.
    


            CNN reported last year on some federal officials raising concerns about Homeland Security officials using overly aggressive tactics, including possibly engaging in racial profiling. And the issue has begun to boil over in Minnesota.
    


            The sheriff of Minneapolis-based Hennepin County has cited multiple instances of ICE stopping people “solely because of the color of their skin.”
    


            The police chief in nearby Brooklyn Park said law enforcement is inundated with similar allegations from US citizens. He even said his off-duty police officers have been stopped, including one at gunpoint.
    


            “Every person who has had this happen to them is a person of color,” Chief Mark Bruley said.
    


            (DHS has said it has “no record of ICE or Border Patrol stopping and questioning a police officer.” It has also denied allegations of racial profiling.)
    


            And then there is the video last week of a US Border Patrol agent asking a man for his paperwork and saying he was doing so “because of your accent.”
    


            Whether any of it amounts to actual, provable profiling, we don't know. But it's become abundantly clear that agents are being put under lots of pressure to apprehend undocumented immigrants and there is relatively little caution involved. That can lead to shortcuts and lots of problems.

            Scott Bessent was everywhere in Davos.
    


            At one press conference during the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps, the Treasury Secretary dismissed Denmark as “irrelevant” amid President Donald Trump's demands that the country sell Greenland. He mocked California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was also in Davos and had called Bessent smug by saying he's, “Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken.”
    


            Bessent defended Trump's desires to acquire Greenland, in an appearance on CNBC, claiming it was important to national security that it be controlled by the US. He accused Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of “trying to put his thumb on the scale” by attending a Supreme Court argument over Trump's attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, though Bessent himself had attended the high court's tariff arguments last fall.
    


            And during a panel discussion with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo, he told European officials — and perhaps more importantly investors — not to overreact to Trump's threats to use tariffs to coerce a sale of Greenland.
    


            “I'd tell everyone to sit back, take a deep breath — do not retaliate,” Bessent said, repeating the last line for emphasis.
    


            Bessent's ubiquitous presence at Davos underscored his unique and critical dual roles in the Trump administration: Publicly, he's a stout defender of the president and his impulsive policy demands. Privately, he's the translator of his boss to Wall Street, charged with keeping the markets from overreacting to Trump-induced whiplash.
    


Trump's latest TACO moment puts his increasingly erratic temperament in the spotlight



            “He views the markets and their stability as a huge part of his job,” said a source with knowledge of Bessent's thinking. “He doesn't want the administration to do anything that could disrupt the markets and make his job more difficult.”
    


            On Wall Street, Bessent is still seen as a crucial voice to help soothe investor fears — even if the latest volatility over Trump's Greenland tariff threats may have left a lasting impression.
    


            “We used to say Trump can't be stopped. The best you can hope for is to contain him. And that's Bessent's job,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial and a critic of Trump's policies. “He still says things that, to me, are cringeworthy supporting the position du jour of the administration. We are lucky to have him, but I still get uneasy about some of the things that come out of his mouth.”
    


            At Davos, Bessent didn't just defend the administration's economic policies — he weaponized them, framing the proposed “Greenland acquisition” not as a real estate whim but as a strategic “national emergency” avoidance maneuver. By telling European allies to “sit back and relax” amidst tariff threats, Bessent effectively moved the Treasury from its role as a stabilizer to a tip-of-the-spear enforcer for the “Trump Model.”
    


            Bessent has been the administration's most important economic official in Trump's second term. The South Carolinian hedge fund manager who previously donated to Democrats has adopted a persona that is part investment strategist and part MAGA firebrand.
    


            He's likely the first Treasury Secretary to treat a Davos presser more like a segment on Steve Bannon's “War Room,” signaling that the administration's economic success is predicated not on global consensus, but on ignoring “media hysteria” and forcing the world to “take the President at his word” — even if the president has gone back on his word repeatedly on tariff threats.
    


            The tone and message marks a sharp departure the cautious, market sensitive communications approach deployed by Bessent's predecessors in the role. But it's also fitting: Bessent was a contributor to Bannon's show before entering government service and made sure to join for a half-hour while in Davos.
    


            The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment.
    


            When Trump talks about the economy, Bessent is usually on his mind. In his public remarks over the past two weeks, the president mentioned Bessent's name 11 times in his hour-long economic speech in Detroit on January 14, seven times in his 90-minute remarks in Davos and again appeared to marvel at Bessent's firm insistence that he has no desire to leave his role, even for the coveted Fed chair nomination.
    


            Heading into the annual World Economic Forum, Trump sparked instability across NATO countries — and the financial markets — by ratcheting up the pressure on Denmark to sell Greenland to the US. When European countries pushed back and deployed military personnel to Greenland, Trump threatened a 10% tariff that would kick in February 1.
    


            The markets dropped on Trump's tariff threat as he arrived in Davos Tuesday, with the S&P 500 dropping 2%.
    


            Among the large US contingent that descended on Davos, Bessent was the point person publicly driving home the US message on Greenland.
    


            Over the course of the week, Bessent conducted three TV interviews and appeared on two podcasts. He held two press conferences and a gaggle in Davos and appeared in a fireside chat on the forum's the main stage.
    


            Bessent generated headlines for taking on Newsom with insults — after the California governor accused the Treasury secretary of being out of touch when Bessent suggested that “mom and pop” investors “bought five, 10, 12 homes.”
    


            And he rankled diplomats by dissing Denmark after the country's pension fund announced it would unwind investments in US bonds amid the Greenland turmoil.
    


            “Denmark's investment in US Treasury bonds — like Denmark itself — is irrelevant,” Bessent told reporters when asked how concerned he is about institutional investors in Europe potentially pulling out of Treasuries. “It is less than $100 million. They've been selling Treasuries. They have for years.”
    


            Behind the scenes, Bessent held a face-to-face meeting with his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng, and, according to several European diplomats and business executives in Davos, was the most sought after member of the US contingent at the annual economic forum, with European business executives scrambling to secure time with Trump's chief economic official.
    


            Bessent's message behind the scenes to the Europeans was to “take a deep breath” and ignore the hysteria, reminding them how quickly the stock market recovered last April, according to two people who spoke with him.
    


            By the end of the day Wednesday — after Trump called off the European tariffs and said there was a framework for a Greenland deal following his meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte — the markets had mostly recovered, even if the whole episode left lingering uncertainty on Wall Street.
    


            For Bessent, Trump's Greenland walkback affirmed his earlier message not to overreact to tariff threats. The Treasury Secretary often points to the dire economic warnings from Trump's “liberation day” tariffs last April.
    


            The worst predictions largely have not materialized: There has been no massive spike in inflation and the potential for catastrophic supply chain disruptions has diminished as countries and businesses have navigated and come to terms with a reshaped global trading system. Trump's most draconian threats were often pulled back, and in many cases served as catalysts for bilateral agreements with close allies. Perhaps most critically — and largely due to Bessent's role — the all-out economic war between the US and China has been managed to a fragile truce after several flare ups.
    


            Of course, Trump's own willingness to walk back his most seismic tariff actions is a significant reason why some of the dire economic forecasts weren't realized. The US-China détente remains unstable, and executives continue to warn that price spikes on products will filter through to consumers in the months ahead.
    


            “The business community is confused and disappointed with Bessent's public statements but still has high confidence in his private messaging and persuasive influence with Trump,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.
    


            Multiple White House officials said Bessent's growing profile was indicative of how much Trump relied on and valued him.
    


            ”Secretary Bessent has done a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump, there's nobody better, smarter or more qualified to serve in this role,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.
    


            Bessent has had more than a few tussles with other administration officials and Trump loyalists since taking office. In April, Bessent got into a shouting match with now-former White House adviser Elon Musk over who would lead the IRS, CNN reported last year.
    


            In September, Bessent almost came to blows with the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, during an intimate dinner at the Executive Club, an exclusive MAGA-aligned group started by some of Trump's closest advisers.
    


            One source close to the White House described Bessent as “a bit of a hot head.”
    


            Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick have also had friction, sources told CNN. Part of the tension dates back to before Trump took office, when Lutnick, who was running Trump's transition, made a play to be Treasury secretary, while Bessent was the lead contender. This week, while speaking to CEOs in Davos, Trump seemed to acknowledge their at times strained relationship.
    


            “I would say these are two exact opposites, and I like that,” Trump said. “I like that they are the exact opposite.”
    


            Trump has made clear his feelings about Bessent's place in the administration — even as the Treasury Secretary prepares to tackle what might be his most delicate and risk-laden balancing act yet: Leading the selection process for a new Fed chair.
    


            Bessent has led a meticulous search that's now down to four finalists — while keeping himself out of the running — as Trump has continued to attack Powell.
    


            The Treasury secretary has maintained a position as a neutral facilitator rather than a kingmaker. He's deliberately avoided ranking his finalists or providing an explicit preference, instead presenting the president with a “slate” of distinct archetypes ranging from institutionalists to market practitioners.
    


            Central to this approach was a lesson learned from the first Trump administration. Bessent observed how his predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, was often blamed by the president for the subsequent policy decisions that Powell made.
    


            “Because he had proposed Powell for the Fed job, Mnuchin had to absorb abuse from the president at the start of virtually every meeting for his recommendation from that point on,” one official said.
    


            Trump has signaled he has expectations for his selection — repeatedly demanding Powell lower interest rates to help juice the economy. Bessent will be challenged to manage reaction from Wall Street but also from the president — who is likely to blame Bessent for future Fed actions he dislikes.
    


            The Fed chair search was complicated even further earlier this month after the Justice Department issued subpoenas to Powell and opened an investigation over the renovation of the Fed's headquarters.
    


            Bessent told people that he was unhappy with the DOJ probe, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN, and he reportedly expressed concern to the president that the investigation had “made a mess” of the transition by causing Powell to “dig in.”
    


            Appearing this week on “War Room,” the podcast hosted by Bannon, a Trump ally who briefly served in his first White House, Bessent reflected on what amounted to a lengthy year inside the Trump administration.
    


            “Trump years are like dog years, I feel like I've aged seven years, but it's been worth it,” Bessent said. “It's been worth it.”

The Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua has ridiculed the administration of US President Donald Trump for using the popular ‘Nihilist penguin' meme to promote its campaign to gain control of Greenland.

On Saturday, the White House's page on X decided to exploit the hype around the meme, which features a lone Adelie penguin abandoning his colony to walk towards distant icy mountains.

It published an AI-generated picture of Trump leading the flightless bird by his wing along an ice-covered plane towards the mountains, where a flag of Greenland is erected. In his other wing, the penguin is holding a US flag. “Embrace the penguin,” the caption reads.

The stunt did not go unnoticed online; Xinhua responded to it by educating the White House about the birds, who don't live in Greenland, which is located in the Northern Hemisphere. Only Galapagos penguins are to be found north of the equator.

“Even if there are penguins in Greenland, it would be like this,” the Chinese journalists wrote in their post, which included an AI generated video of Trump, dressed in an Uncle Sam costume, dragging a resisting penguin on a leash, while carrying a baseball bat in the other hand.

Even if there are penguins in #Greenland, it would be like this... @WhiteHouse#USA#Hegemonypic.twitter.com/X9lwM3yE1F

The original ‘Nihilist Penguin' image was taken from German filmmaker Werner Herzog's 2007 documentary about Antarctica, titled ‘Encounters at the End of the World,' and has only gone viral online since the start of the year.

The scene has inspired numerous memes, and users have come up with various interpretations of it: from being a commentary on loneliness and existential crisis to a metaphor of independent thinking and rebellion.

Earlier this week, Trump announced that a “framework” for a Greenland deal, negotiated with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, is now on the table and would provide the US with “all the military access we want.” The agreement reportedly grants the US “sovereign base areas” on the world's largest island and fast-tracks rights to mine rare earth minerals.

On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun insisted that Beijing has no plans to exploit the division created between the US and EU over Greenland. “China follows an independent foreign policy of peace. We conduct friendly exchanges with other countries based on mutual respect and equality,” he said.

WASHINGTON, January 24. /TASS/. The Pentagon has published its updated National Defense Strategy, outlining the priorities and new approaches to the Western hemisphere, Europe and the Asia-Pacific Region.

The document names Russia a ‘persistent threat' to NATO countries, and says that deterrence of China is viewed as a top priority.

TASS has gathered the document's key statements.

The strategy names Russia as a ‘persistent' threat to the eastern flank of NATO.

The responsibility for resolving the conflict in Ukraine lies mostly on Europe's shoulders.

The US armed forces will view as their priority the deterrence of China and the protection of the US territory, not Europe's

Washington believes that Europe should concentrate its efforts an resources on its own defense.

The modernization of the US defense industry will require mobilization of effort of the entire American nation.

Washington plans an extensive modernization of its nuclear forces, because ""the United States should never - will never - be left vulnerable to nuclear blackmail.""

The Department of War will focus on creating and deploying systems to counter unmanned aerial vehicles and other present-day aerial threats

The United States will no longer cede access or influence over key terrain in the Western hemisphere, from the Arctic to South America, in order to ""ensure that the Monroe Doctrine is upheld in our time.""

In the past, Washington used to allow its allies to spend less on defense, but this attitude has changed. US allies in Europe, the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula should undertake the primary responsibility for their own security.

The Indo-Pacific region was named among the priorities of the US national defense. The long-term US policy on China does not include attempts to change the government or other forms of conflict with it.

The US will not let Iran obtain nuclear weapons.

The Pentagon believes that North Korea is boosting its nuclear potential and sees ""a clear and present danger of nuclear attack on the American Homeland.""

The US Department of War will maintain a ‘resource-sustainable' approach to countering Islamic terrorist groups, ""focused on organizations that possess the capability and intent to strike the US Homeland."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:tass.com","Territorial issue remains to be most difficult at trilateral talks on Ukraine in Abu Dhabi","https://tass.com/politics/2076305","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 10:23:55 GMT","

ABU DHABI, January 24. /TASS/. The territorial issue is still the most complicated one at the trilateral talks between Russia, the United States and Ukraine in Abu Dhabi and the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Donbas remains a priority for Russia, a source close to negotiations told TASS on Saturday.

""This issue remains to be the most complicated,"" the source said. ""The withdrawal of the Ukrainian military from Donbass is important and various security parameters are being considered regarding this issue,"" the source stated.

On January 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and businessman Jared Kushner, which was described as extremely substantive, constructive, frank, and based on trust by Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov. The talks, focused on the Ukrainian settlement, lasted about four hours.

The parties agreed that the first meeting of a Russia-US-Ukraine working group on security issues would take place in Abu Dhabi on January 23.

On Friday, a source told TASS that the consultations were over, and the sides will inform their respective governments about the preliminary outcomes. At the same time, the participants have agreed to continue dialogue the following day.

Shooting comes less than three weeks after Renee Good was shot and killed by an ICE officer in the city

The police chief of Minneapolis, Brian O'Hara, has kicked off a press conference by acknowledging that people are angry about the latest fatal shooting by federal law enforcement of a man in the city.

He called on federal personnel in the city to conduct themselves with discipline and humanity.

Then he said that members of the public gathered to protest at the scene of the shooting in south Minneapolis were taking part in an “unlawful assembly”.

“There is a lot of anger and questions around what has happened,” O'Hara said.

And he called for calm and begged the public not to damage the city.

Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey is now talking and we will bring you his remarks asap. He's calling on Donald Trump to “end this operation” and “take action now to remove these federal agents.”

In a statement sent to the Guardian, assistant secretary of homeland security Tricia McLaughlin said that at 9.05am local time, “as DHS law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted operation in Minneapolis” against a person they said was in the country illegally, who she said was “wanted for violent assault”, “an individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun.”

McLaughlin said that “the officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted” and that “more details on the armed struggle are forthcoming.”

“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots” she said, adding: “Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene.”

She added that the man also had “2 magazines and no ID”.

The Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of ICE and Border Patrol, has just said that the man shot dead by federal immigration enforcement earlier this morning was pronounced dead at the scene.

The federal agency said an agent fired “defensive shots”. It is now characterizing protesters as “rioters”, saying there are about 200 people on the scene in south Minneapolis trying to “obstruct and assault law enforcement”.

Illinois governor JB Pritzker has called for a bipartisan reponse to this shooting from US state governors.

“I am asking my fellow Republican and Democratic Governors across the nation to have a unified response. We must all stand against the lawlessness being inflicted in our states,” he posted on X moments ago.

He then posted: “Masked federal agents in Minnesota just shot and killed another person. We must put a stop to Trump's ICE. Now. Stop the funding, stop the occupations, stop the killings.”

Mary Moriarty, the top prosecutor of Hennepin county, where Minneapolis is located, has issued a statement saying that her team is working with state law enforcement, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), to coordinate on a response to this shooting.

“The scene must be secured by local law enforcement for the collection and preservation of evidence,” Moriarty said. “We expect the federal government to allow the BCA to process the scene.”

After Renee Good was killed, the FBI at first cooperated with Minnesota law enforcement and then abruptly shut them out and said it would be only a federal investigation. This outraged state and county officials.

After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them “cowards” and telling them to go home.

One officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: “Boo hoo.” Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car, the Associated Press reports.

The intersection where the shooting occurred has been blocked off, and border patrol agents are on the scene wielding batons.

Teargas has been deployed and the crack of munitions such as flash-bang grenades used in crowd control can be heard close to the scene of this shooting in south Minneapolis.

Clouds of teargas are floating in a haze above the street, while protesters are not leaving the scene.

A US government source directly briefed on the situation rapidly unfolding in Minneapolis has confirmed reports to the Guardian that the man shot by federal immigration officers this morning was armed.

The source, who cannot be named because they are not authorized to give out details at this time, provided an image of a handgun next to a loaded magazine, connected to the man the Department of Homeland Security is calling a suspect.

“Suspect had a firearm with two magazines,” the source said. “Situation evolving. Will get … more information ASAP.”

The Guardian has not yet been able independently to verifiy this information.

A 51-year-old man shot by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis has died, a hospital record obtained by the Associated Press shows.

CNN has also reported that the man shot during the federal immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis has died this morning. The Minnesota Star Tribune has also reported the man has been killed.

Minnesotans have been protesting against the White House's decision to flood the relatively small, liberal midwestern city of Minneapolis with federal immigration enforcement personnel in recent weeks.

Those demonstrations have become a daily constant in much greater volume since an ICE officer shot dead resident (and US citizen) Renee Good on 7 January instead of stepping out of the way of her departing car.

At the time there were fears of a things slipping out of control in the city if protests turned into riots or mass law-breaking.

But in fact demonstrations have been fierce but very much in control. Federal officers and agents from ICE officers to the border patrol have drawn outrage for aggressive and sometimes violent tactics against people they are targeting for immigration enforcement but also against protesters and mere bystanders or passersby.

Governor Tim Walz said: “Minnesota is meeting fear and division with decency and generosity.”

The Guardian's immigration reporter Maanvi Singh said from her experience she had to agree with descriptions of the city as feeling like it is “under siege”.

Minnesota's governor Tim Walz has called for Donald Trump to end his administration's aggressive federal immigration enforcement operations in the state the began a few weeks ago and has caused chaos, injury and death.

“I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. This is sickening,” Walz wrote on the X social media platform.

He continued: “The president must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”

Minneapolis officials are urgently looking into the multiple reports that federal enforcement has shot a man.

Officials in Minneapolis have received reports of another shooting involving federal law enforcement officers in the city during the Trump administration's immigration crackdown there.

The shooting comes less than three weeks after Renee Good was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in the city in Minnesota while she tried driving away from a confrontation with officers. The killing sparked protests nationwide and constant protests in Minneapolis since.

City officials said on Saturday morning in a statement that the “shooting involving federal law enforcement” and occurred in the area of West 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue South – and that they are “working to confirm additional details”.

“We ask the public to remain calm and avoid the immediate area,” the statement added.

Governor Tim Walz called for an immediate end to the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations in the state.

President also claimed US refineries will process seized Venezuelan oil, saying ‘we take the oil'

Donald Trump on Saturday said he would impose a 100% tariff on all Canadian imports if the North American country makes a trade deal with China.

Beside that tariff threat, another Trump foreign policy maneuver to make news on Saturday involved the president announcing the US had taken the oil that was on recently seized Venezuelan tankers.

The US president wrote on social media that if the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, “thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken”.

“China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the [US].”

Trump has repeatedly invoked tariffs in a bid to bend countries to his will – with some success, though he also repeatedly backed down from his most extreme tariff-related threats.

Notably, days earlier, Trump walked back his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on several European countries in order to facilitate the US's acquisition of Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish Arctic island which the president has been fixated on. Trump claimed he had reached “the framework of a future deal” on Greenland.

In a New York Post interview published on Saturday, Trump boasted that the US will gain sovereignty and take ownership over land in Greenland where American bases are located.

“We'll have everything we want,” Trump reportedly told the Post. “We have some interesting talks going on.”

Meanwhile, in the same Post interview published on Saturday, Trump said US refineries will process the oil which his administration had taken from seized Venezuelan tankers.

“Let's put it this way – they don't have any oil,” Trump told the Post. “We take the oil.”

The oil is being refined in “various places” including Houston, he said.

The US military has seized seven Venezuela-linked tankers since the start of Trump's month-long campaign to control Venezuela's oil flows. Trump said on Tuesday that his administration had taken 50m barrels of oil out of Venezuela and was selling some of it in the open market.

The intercepted vessels either were under US sanctions or said to be part of a “shadow fleet” of ships that disguise their origins to move oil from major sanctioned producers – Iran, Russia or Venezuela.

Trump's Latin American foreign policy has homed in on Venezuela, initially aiming to push the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, from power. After failing to accomplish that aim through diplomacy, Trump ordered US forces to fly into the country to grab Maduro and his wife in an overnight raid on 3 January, bringing them to New York to face criminal drug-related charges and detaining them there.

In Saturday's interview with the Post, Trump bragged that a new weapon he called “the discombobulator” played a central role in that raid.

Those remarks came after the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, shared on social media a purported eyewitness account of the US military using some sort of “very intense sound wave” to incapacitate Maduro's bodyguards.

Trump has said the US plans to control Venezuela's oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country's dilapidated oil industry in a $100bn plan that is prompting many raised eyebrows, not least from environmentalists and the US oil giants.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Many of those moved into an asylum return centre have held jobs for years and can speak the language

“Sweden did this for us,” said Sofiye*, making a supportive scooping up gesture with her hands. “And then, bam.” She dropped them to the ground.

Sofiye, who has three children, arrived in Sweden from Uzbekistan as an asylum seeker in 2008, and for much of that time she was able to build a life in the Scandinavian country. The family lived in a flat in a Stockholm suburb and Sofiye worked for the municipality in the home help department. She learned Swedish and her children went through the Swedish school system. Her youngest son was born in Sweden and her 18-year-old son, Hamza, who is studying in college to be a technician, doesn't know life anywhere else.

Three years ago, however, after unsuccessfully seeking refugee status four times, Sofiye lost her right to work and is now living under the threat of a deportation order. For the last two years she and two of her children have been living in limbo in an asylum return centre in an industrial area near Stockholm's Arlanda airport

The situation is causing her so much anxiety that for the last two months she has lost her appetite and been vomiting with stress. As she spoke to the Guardian she held a plastic bag into which she regularly retched.

“I cannot sleep. I sleep just one or two hours. I throw up. I am so stressed. I don't want to speak to the children because here,” she said, pointing to her head, “is occupied. I don't know physically, mentally what I should do.”

The centre, one of a growing number of reception and return facilities aimed at housing an estimated 11,000 asylum seekers in the coming years, is part of Sweden's increasingly hostile asylum and immigration policy. The centre-right government, which depends on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats, says it wants to “redirect focus” away from receiving asylum seekers to instead becoming a “country for labour immigration”.

The government recently celebrated data showing that Sweden had its lowest level of asylum seekers since 1985, claiming that lower numbers “create better conditions for successful integration”. Thousands of people like Sofiye – who have lived in Sweden for years and are well-established in society and the job market, with children who were born in Sweden – face deportation.

Among the recent policy changes include asylum seekers being placed in reception centres instead of being provided with individual accommodation who are then offered “repatriation grants” to leave the country voluntarily.

The government has also introduced stricter conditions for gaining citizenship and tightened family reunification rules. Applicants must prove their identity through an in-person visit and provide more documentation than was previously the case.

Committing a crime can now result in losing the right to live in Sweden for anyone who is not a Swedish citizen. In 2025 a total of 440 people were subjected to criminal deportations, according to government figures.

“If you do not want to become part of this community, you should not come to Sweden,” the government has stated.

The hostile environment is a far cry from Sweden's immigration policies of the past. In 2014, at the start of a period when the number of people arriving to Europe from countries in the Middle East rose sharply, the then prime minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt, made a speech urging Swedes to “open your hearts” to newcomers.

The direction of travel is unlikely to change even with a general election next year, say observers, as the main political parties, including the opposition centre-left Social Democrats, have embraced similar hardline policies.

“Many people that we meet say to us: ‘We came to Sweden believing this was a country that respected human rights: where are they?'” said Nannie Sköld, a counsellor at Stockholm Stadsmission's Who Am I Tomorrow? project, which provides legal and psychosocial support to individuals and families with deportation orders.

The latest government figures show that 8,312 people returned to their home countries in 2025, the highest number in a decade, while the number of asylum seekers decreased by 30% on the previous year.

“We meet people who came to Sweden for work or to study, and people who don't have grounds for asylum,” said Sköld. “We also meet people who are fleeing from the Taliban or they are LGBTQ from Uganda, and who then see that their request for international protection is denied.”

One of the changes that was having a particularly damaging impact is the decision to abolish “track changes”, she said. The new rule, which came into force at short notice last April, prevents people who have had their asylum applications rejected from applying for a residence permit, even if they have worked in Sweden. It also prevents those who had already obtained a work permit from extending it.

The decision is estimated to have put 4,700 people who were established in Swedish society at risk of deportation.

Sköld added: “People [who] are well integrated and established in Sweden … are asking: ‘What else could I have done? … How could I possibly prove my worth if even doing everything that is supposedly correct isn't enough and will never be enough?'”

Life in the return centres is tough. The facility near Arlanda, which also houses new arrivals, is an “open” centre, meaning people can come and go. But getting around from there is logistically difficult and many people are getting by on a few kronor a day. It was a difficult place to be in for children, said Sköld, who said her team heard from LGBTQ asylum seekers that the shared spaces could feel unsafe. Many there suffer from poor mental health as a result of their precarious circumstances.

“There is a lot of fear, a lot of anxiety,” she said. “People who have received a deportation order fear being deported any day.”

Thamer and Faten are a married couple who came to Sweden from Iraq on work visas with their two sons, who are now 20 and 16. Their third son was born in Sweden in 2021. But they now face deportation after their asylum applications were denied and work visas expired. Thamer said that a criminal organisation has threatened to harm their children if they return to Iraq.

“There are people who have lived in Sweden for 30 years but they don't talk Swedish like me,” said Thamer, 52. “I write as well, not just speak. What do they want more than that? I am not a criminal.”

Thamer said he was offered a job as a car mechanic but was unable to take it because his work visa had expired. “Sweden wants men and I have three. Can they not make use of them?”

The Swedish migration agency said it was unable to comment on individual cases. It was “working to ensure that the [reception and return centres] are safe for everyone staying there, with particular consideration given to children and other vulnerable groups, such as LGBTQ persons”, a spokesperson said.

When US Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticized European culture on X this week, a team at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs was swift to hit back online. 

“Our culture,” they wrote on Thursday, posting a comparison table of key life-standard indicators, showing the EU beat the US in many areas, from life expectancy to student debt. 

Their X account in English, called “French Response,” is the latest way France is seeking to defend itself against an ever-growing tide of online disinformation.

Doing its best to be funny, it has since September last year been battling information it deems to be false from Russian and US accounts — but also US President Donald Trump's White House. 

Information had become “a new battleground,” ministry spokesman Pascal Confavreux said. 

“We're choosing to occupy the space by turning up the volume and raising our voice,” he said of the X account, which now counts 100,000 followers — although still a drop in the ocean compared with X owner Elon Musk's more than 230 million. 

The account, maintained by a group of diplomats, ex-journalists and fact-checkers, has been active this week as global leaders met at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. 

French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday squared up to Trump in flashy aviator sunglasses — which his team said were due to a burst eye blood vessel, saying his country did not like “bullies.” 

Newspapers the next day were covered with images of the rebel French leader in his shades, with commentators likening Macron to Maverick from Top Gun. 

The French Response account celebrated the headlines. 

“When the world does your French response for you,” it wrote, just after Trump mocked Macron's sunglasses. 

To a Russian account that falsely claimed Macron left Davos early to avoid Trump, when the French president had in fact never planned to be there the same day, it responded in English: “Another impeccably planned French leave.” 

However, Ruslan Trad, an expert in global security at the Digital Forensic Research Lab, said there was a fine line between tackling trolls and being perceived as one yourself. 

“When official diplomatic channels adopt trolling tactics, they implicitly validate the information ecosystem's descent into provocation-based discourse,” he said. “More problematically, matching adversaries' tone risks creating equivalence in audiences' minds between democratic institutions and disinformation actors.” 

Trump this week backed down from his threats to seize the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland by force and agreed to talks. 

However, earlier this month, the French Response account had felt compelled to reply after a US user claimed Trump would easily take over France after “we conquer Greenland and Canada.” 

“Breaking: Statue of Liberty reportedly spotted swimming back across the Atlantic. Said she ‘preferred the original terms and conditions,'” it quipped, referring to the statue France gave the US in the 19th century.

Vice Premier Yang Sung-ho was sacked “on the spot,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency said, in a speech in which Kim attacked “irresponsible, rude and incompetent leading officials.”
“Please, comrade vice premier, resign by yourself when you can do it on your own before it is too late,” Kim reportedly said.
“He is ineligible for an important duty. Put simply, it was

Syrian Kurdish leader Mazloum Abdi said he had agreed to the deal to avoid a broader war.
He made the decision after deadly clashes in the Syrian city of Raqa on Sunday between Kurdish-led forces and local fighters loyal to Damascus, and fighting this month between the Kurds and government forces.

Climb of 101 postponed

Poor weather yesterday forced US climber Alex Honnold to postpone his “free solo” rope and harness-free ascent of the outside of Taipei 101, one of the world's tallest buildings. The climb, organized by Netflix for live broadcast, has been rescheduled for this morning, the streamer said on social media. “Safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding,” it added. The top of Taipei 101 was obscured by cloud yesterday morning, with intermittent rain showers. In 2004, French climber Alain Robert, dubbed “Spider-man” for his ropeless ascents of some of the world's highest skyscrapers, climbed the building, in a time of four hours with a safety rope.

SAFETY

Rubbish truck tragedy

A recycling truck driver reportedly lost consciousness on Friday evening, causing the vehicle to crash into a crowd of people throwing trash into a garbage truck, killing a 78-year-old woman, according to local authorities. The incident occurred at about 6pm in Taoyuan's Gueishan District (龜山), and left six others injured, including the 52-year-old driver, who were all taken to hospital, the city's fire department said. The 78-year-old woman, surnamed Chiu (邱), was trapped underneath the truck and reportedly had no vital signs at the scene. She was rushed to hospital, but later pronounced dead. According to authorities, the casualties include an 83-year-old woman surnamed Ting (丁), who sustained an open fracture to her right leg, and a 39-year-old man surnamed Huang (黃), who sustained a wound to his leg and reported abdominal pain. Wu has no significant health problems and passed a mandatory breath alcohol test before his shift began, authorities said, adding that the exact cause of the incident remains under investigation.

Badminton bow-out

Chi Yu-jen (戚又仁), the only Taiwanese badminton player remaining in the men's singles at this year's Indonesia Masters, was eliminated after losing in straight games in the semi-finals yesterday. World No. 27 Chi was defeated by Indonesia's world No. 18 Alwi Farhan 21-11, 21-12 in 35 minutes. Alwi confounded Chi with his precise smashes that repeatedly landed deep in the corners or just inside the sidelines, while Chi struggled with unforced errors and led only twice in the match, both times in the second game. Despite the loss, the semi-final run in Jakarta was the 28-year-old Taiwanese's best result in a Super 500-level tournament or higher.

Overtime work steady

About 24.6 percent of employees in Taiwan said they had been asked to work outside of scheduled hours, down by 0.9 percentage points from 2024, the Ministry of Labor said on Friday. The latest survey garnered 4,029 valid responses and found that these workers received orders from their companies to do tasks for their employers outside of scheduled hours by phone, over the Internet, or on messaging apps like Line. The ministry said that 36.6 percent of respondents worked overtime last year, little changed from 36.3 percent in 2024. While 88.1 percent of those who worked overtime said they were compensated with overtime pay or additional leave, 21.8 percent of the “other category” in the service sector, such as laundry, beauty treatment, funeral services and housework services, said they did not receive compensation. More than 20 percent in the real estate, video/audio publication, and information and communications industry also said so.

The service was first made available to Taiwanese travelers throughout the winter vacation of 2024 and during the Lunar New Year holiday.
In addition to flights to the Japanese cities of Hakodate, Asahikawa, Akita, Sendai, Niigata, Okayama, Takamatsu, Kumamoto and Kagoshima, the service would be available to travelers to Kobe and Oita.
The service can be accessed by passengers of 15 flight routes operated by

Guan Guan has said many controversial statements in her videos posted to Douyin (抖音), including “the red flag will soon be painted all over Taiwan” and “Taiwan is an inseparable part of China,” and expressing hope for expedited reunification.
The agency last year received multiple reports alleging that Guan Guan had advocated for armed reunification.

GIVE AND TAKE:

The last month of the lunar year is National Blood Donation Month, when local centers seek to stockpile blood for use during the Lunar New Year holiday.
The blood demand in southern Taiwan — including Tainan and Kaohsiung, as well as Chiayi, Pingtung, Penghu and Taitung counties — is about 2,000 units per day, the center said.

Nepal captain Rohit Paudel said that his side have “nothing to lose” in next month's T20 World Cup as they target more famous upsets and a place in the tournament's Super Eight second phase.

The Himalayan nation stunned two-time T20 World Cup winners the West Indies last year for their first series win over a Test-playing side in the shortest format.

It gave them huge belief ahead of the 20-team event scheduled to start on Feb. 7 in India and Sri Lanka that they can repeat the feat and take down one of the cricketing powers.

Nepal face the West Indies again in Group C alongside fellow two-time champions England and debutants Italy. Bangladesh, who are refusing to play in India, were also drawn in the group, but look likely to be kicked out and replaced by Scotland.

Paudel and his team are in Colombo, practicing ahead of their opener against England on Feb. 8 at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.

“As a team, we have everything to gain from here,” said Paudel, who at 23 is the youngest captain at the event. “Nothing to lose, and we can play freely. We will try to showcase our skills in front of the world.”

The 17th-ranked Nepal do not have any group matches in Sri Lanka, but it is a sign of their confidence that they opted to train in Colombo as preparations for the subsequent Super Eight round, where they would play in Sri Lanka if they qualify as one of the top two in the group.

“Realistically, I think beating a Test-playing country would be a great opportunity for all of us,” Paudel said “Reaching the Super Eight would be another one, so we are eyeing that spot, but the first aim is to play the best brand of cricket we know. And we will try to do that.”

Cricket does not enjoy the same adulation in Nepal as it does in neighboring South Asian nations, where the game dominates popular culture.

However, interest has surged over the past decade.

Nepal made their T20 World Cup debut in 2014 and returned in 2024, pushing South Africa and Bangladesh close in narrow defeats.

The International Cricket Council granted Nepal one-day international status in 2018, a milestone that helped accelerate investment and fan interest.

Domestic competitions such as the Nepal Premier League have drawn growing crowds and commercial backing, further widening the talent pipeline.

Team manager Prabal Gautam said training in the Sri Lankan capital was to help players adapt from the cool Himalayan climate to the heat and humidity further south.

Players initially struggled with temperatures above 30°C in Colombo, Gautam said, but were gradually acclimatizing.

“This is the first step of practice matches before the World Cup, just to cope with the weather and to play quality cricket,” he said.

The squad plan further sessions in Mumbai before their group matches tournament and fancy their chances of going further.

“Being a small nation, being a small cricketing team, we also have a dream of winning the World Cup,” Gautam said, adding that dreams can come true. “First we had a dream of playing in a World Cup. Now this is our third time at a World Cup.”

Donald Trump is threatening to impose a 100 per cent tariff on Canada if it makes a trade deal with China, registering opposition to closer ties between Ottawa and Beijing under Prime Minister Mark Carney.

In a post on Truth Social, the U.S. President argued a trade agreement between Canada and China would result in Canadian territory being a transit point for shipping Chinese goods into the United States.

“If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a “Drop Off Port” for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,” Mr. Trump said, in belittling language that cast the Prime Minister as state governor instead of the leader of a sovereign country.

“If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,” the President wrote.

The Prime Minister's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When asked by reporters Thursday how talks with the United States were going, Mr. Carney declined to answer, calling the query “the most boring question.” On Friday he cancelled an expected news conference with reporters following a cabinet retreat in Quebec City.

The new tariff threat is the latest attack by Mr. Trump on Mr. Carney since the Prime Minister delivered a provocative speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that amounted to a veiled attack on the damage the U.S. President has done to the international rules-based order built on international law, norms, treaties and institutions such as the United Nations and World Trade Organization.

Read and watch Mark Carney's Davos speech at the World Economic Forum

Since taking office in January, 2025, Mr. Trump has hit Canada with a slew of tariffs. While most goods still enter the United States tariff-free because they are sold according to the provisions of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the President has imposed a 50 per cent levy on steel and aluminum, 25 per cent on autos and 35 per cent on any goods traded outside the USMCA, with the exception of oil, gas and potash, at 10 per cent. His administration has also significantly hiked duties on Canadian softwood.

Canada and China struck a “strategic partnership” earlier this month to boost ties and allow Chinese investors to play a larger role in Canada's economy. During a four-day visit to Beijing, Mr. Carney praised China as a more predictable trading partner than the United States and broke with Washington over tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.

What to know about the Canada-China tariff deal on EVs and canola

The Prime Minister agreed to allow nearly 50,000 Chinese-made electric vehicles into Canada at a low tariff instead of a 100 per cent tariff Ottawa imposed on these imports in 2024 along with the former Biden administration. In return, Beijing scaled back retaliatory tariffs on canola seed, Canada's No. 1 export to China.

Mr. Carney also welcomed Chinese EV makers into the Canadian market, saying he would like to see investments in Canada within three years.

  Opinion: Carney's survival plan: Canada and other ‘middle powers' must co-operate in order to thrive

Mr. Trump, who previously expressed no opposition to Canada's entente with China, has now shifted his position.

“China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,” the President predicted in his Saturday social media post.

He had previously praised Mr. Carney's agreement with China, saying “That's what he should ⁠be doing. It's a good thing ‍for him to sign a trade deal. If you ⁠can get a deal with China, you should do ‍that,” the U.S. President said at the time.

Canada's annual exports to China – about 5 per cent of overall exports – pale in comparison what it ships to the United States each year. Traditionally about 75 per cent of Canadian exports go to the U.S.

In his Jan. 21 address at Davos, Mr. Trump described Mr. Carney as ungrateful toward the United States.

Eight notable moments from Trump's Davos speech

“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us, by the way. They should be grateful. But they're not,” Mr. Trump said. “I watched your Prime Minister yesterday, he wasn't so grateful. They should be grateful.”

He said Canada only exists because of the United States.

U.S. President Donald Trump takes aim at Prime Minister Mark Carney in a speech at Davos, saying 'Canada lives because of the United States,' a day after Mr. Carney warned the forum that a U.S.-led rules-based international order is over.

The next day, Mr. Trump also retracted an invitation to Mr. Carney for Canada to join his so-called “Board of Peace” project.

“Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time,” the U.S. President posted Jan. 22.

This followed Mr. Carney's address in Davos, a global gathering of political and business elites, in which he called for middle powers to stop pretending the rules-based international order is still functioning, and instead build coalitions to survive in a new era where great powers prey on smaller countries to take what they want.

In his speech, Mr. Carney urged countries to start publicly condemning economic coercion, even when practised by an ally, in another clear reference to the United States. “The old order is not coming back,” he said.

Legal issues in Japan, South Korea plus schisms in North America spell trouble for once powerful Unification Church

Hak Ja Han, the leader of the Unification Church, arrives at a court to attend a hearing to review her arrest warrant requested by special prosecutors in Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 22, 2025.Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters

Hak Ja Han, the 82-year-old head of the Unification Church, sat in a wheelchair late last year as prosecutors in a sparse Seoul courtroom outlined an alleged plot to bribe South Korea's former first lady with Chanel bags and a diamond necklace in return for political favours. 

It was a dramatic fall from grace for Ms. Han, who as recently as 2022 had been feted by world leaders – including U.S. President Donald Trump and former prime minister Stephen Harper – at a conference organized by one of many groups under the vast umbrella that is the Unification movement, also known as the “Moonies” for the name of its founder, Ms. Han's late husband, Sun Myung Moon.

At their height, the Moonies had tens of thousands of followers around the world, controlled a business empire worth billions, and wielded significant political power in Japan, South Korea and the United States. 

Today, the movement appears to be in crisis, with twin legal cases in South Korea and Japan threatening to hamstring its operations in Asia − vital for fundraising and continued growth − while its North American operations are still reeling from multiple schisms that erupted after the death of Mr. Moon in 2012.

Demian Dunkley, president of the Unification Church, USA, said suggestions legal problems presented a major crisis for the church “conflates distinct and unrelated matters across different countries, legal systems, and organizational jurisdictions.” 

“Developments in Korea and Japan are separate issues governed by different facts and legal contexts, and they do not constitute a single, unified ‘crisis,'” Mr. Dunkley said in response to a request for comment. (South Korean officials have repeatedly referenced Japan's handling of the Unification Church in discussing potential future action against the group.) 

Ms. Han has denied the charges against her, saying she has “no interest in the politics” of South Korea. 

In 2022, almost a decade after Mr. Moon's death, while the movement he founded had lost some of the public profile it once had in the West − where its mass weddings and accusations of “brainwashing” briefly made it a media sensation in the 1970s and ‘80s − it retained massive political influence and wealth in both Japan and Mr. Moon and Ms. Han's home country of South Korea. 

One gunshot changed all that.

Former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe was campaigning for his Liberal Democratic Party in Nara, a city in southwest Japan, in July, 2022, when a man in the crowd fired a homemade gun, hitting Mr. Abe in the neck and chest. He would die of his wounds hours later. 

Tetsuya Yamagami, Mr. Abe's assassin, who was sentenced to life in prison this week, told police he had been motivated by the former prime minister's ties to the Unification Church, which he blamed for bankrupting his mother and tearing their family apart. 

In a letter to a journalist sent before the assassination, Mr. Yamagami wrote that “I can no longer afford to think about the political implications and consequences that Abe's death would bring.” It's unlikely however, he ever imagined the dramatic upheaval his actions would set off, threatening both the survival of the LDP – Japan's ruling party for almost all of its post-Second World War history – and the Unification Church itself.

Mr. Abe's killing brought to light the open secret that was the Church's vast influence over the LDP, which had relied on the conservative religious movement for donations and volunteers for decades. The scandal forced multiple resignations by high-ranking politicians, and as the LDP distanced itself from the Church, ministers moved to dissolve it as a religious organization, putting it in the same category as the Aum Shinrikyo cult, which carried out the deadly 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attacks. 

A Tokyo court upheld the order last March, but the Unification Church is appealing. Losing its base in Japan would be devastating for the movement, which has long taught that the country is spiritually impure, and only by acts of sacrifice – including monetary donations – could Japanese followers cleanse themselves of the sins the country committed during the Second World War. 

“The Church has always been very secretive in terms of its membership and finance,” said Elle Hardy, author of a coming book on the Moonies. “But it's clear that there was a much larger membership base in Japan than anywhere else.”

Japanese money helped build Mr. Moon's small Korean Christian sect into a global movement, and in 1971, he and Ms. Han moved to the U.S., where the “Moonies” soon became a media obsession. 

Mr. Moon shored up his movement by becoming a political player. He founded The Washington Times – which Ms. Hardy described as a “proto Fox News” for its influence on American conservatism – and courted politicians including George H.W. Bush. In 2004, more than a dozen lawmakers attended a congressional reception at which Mr. Moon declared himself the messiah and was presented with an ornate golden crown. 

While many attendees would later claim to have been duped into attending, the subsequent scandal, and Mr. Moon's often outlandish statements – he described himself as the second coming of Christ and said only he could save the world from Communism – did not prevent him from having political influence, including in Canada. 

As Radio Canada reported in 2023, dozens of Canadian politicians have attended Unification Church events since 2013, most notably Mr. Harper, who spoke at the 2022 conference organized by the Church just months after Mr. Abe's assassination.

At that event, focused on bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula, Mr. Harper paid tribute to Mr. Abe, and praised Ms. Han for “her leadership and ongoing vision.” Representatives for Mr. Harper did not respond to a request for comment. The Canadian branch of the Church also did not respond. 

The 2022 conference was a brief moment of triumph for Ms. Han, who was nearing the end of a decade-long fight with two of her sons for control over the Church, one that erupted almost immediately after Mr. Moon's death in 2012. 

In 1998, Mr. Moon named his son Preston vice president of one of the main arms of the Church, and suggested he was the “fourth Adam,” and would succeed his father as leader of the movement. (Moonies believe Mr. Moon is the “third Adam,” and Jesus the second.) 

Over the following decade, Preston accumulated more and more power within the Unification movement, but after he publicly criticized the direction the Church was taking in 2008, his parents moved to replace him as heir apparent with Sean Moon, his younger brother.

After Mr. Moon's death, a similar pattern played out, with Ms. Han marginalizing Sean and seizing control of FFWPU, the main Unification organization, according to a civil case brought by Sean. Since then, she has advanced herself as her husband's true successor in her role as “True Mother.” 

Multiple lawsuits were filed as all sides of the split attempted to assert control over the Unification movement and its billions of dollars. U.S. courts largely punted on the issue, ruling they could not decide the case without wading into questions of constitutionally protected theology. 

In July, an appeals court left Preston in charge of a significant chunk of Unification assets; he now heads the non-denominational Family Peace Association, seeking to create a universal “One Family under God,” building on the original vision of Mr. Moon. 

Sean Moon, meanwhile, created the schismatic Rod of Iron Ministries, or Sanctuary Church. He has denounced his mother as the “harlot of Babylon,” and held a ceremony in which he and his wife were crowned the Unification's new “True Parents.” A supporter of Mr. Trump, Sean and his followers took part in protests at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and are notorious for toting assault rifles during church services.

Mr. Dunkley, the Unification Church USA president, said “the existence of independent groups or sects – whether in the United States or elsewhere – does not represent institutional instability."" 

“As with other global faith traditions, the Unification Church includes a diversity of expressions and organizations that operate independently,” he said. “The U.S. church remains stable, active, and growing.”

While Preston largely focuses on inter-Korean peace issues, Sean Moon has publicly revelled in his mother's legal problems. In September, he said her arrest on corruption charges had been prophesied by his father 12 years earlier and was “only the beginning of the Judgment.”

“My mother's heresy and those who profited from aiding the Han heresy have lost God's blessing and judgment has come to her rebellious organization that has betrayed the Lord (both the Korean and Japanese Governments have cracked down on her heretical organization),” Sean wrote in a statement. 

Ms. Han has twice applied for bail on health grounds, and if convicted even a short jail term could end up being a life sentence. What happens in the event of her death is unclear, but will almost certainly reopen a battle for succession among her 10 surviving children, with potentially more schisms and fracturing of the movement. The Church has also expressed concern South Korea could follow Japan in dissolving its operations, a potentially fatal blow to its Asian arm. 

Stephen Kent, an emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Alberta, said that “almost all new religions die.” 

“The death throes however can take multiple generations,” he added. “If these charges stick in South Korea then there will be more damage, just as there has been damage to the reputation of the Unification Church and its ability to fundraise in Japan.”

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators began a second day of U.S.-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi on Saturday after an overnight wave of Russian airstrikes that knocked out power for millions of people amid freezing winter temperatures.

The strikes by hundreds of Russian drones and missiles on Kyiv and Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv prompted Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha - who was not present at the talks - to accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of acting “cynically.”

“This barbaric attack once again proves that Putin's place is not at (U.S. President Donald Trump's) Board of Peace, but in the dock of the special tribunal,” Sybiha wrote on X.

A source familiar with the situation told Reuters that the talks - which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said were the first trilateral meetings under the U.S.-mediated peace process - had resumed on Saturday morning.

Kyiv is under mounting Trump administration pressure to make concessions to reach a peace deal in the war triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion in February, 2022.

Zelensky had said on Friday that it was too early to draw conclusions from the first day of meetings in Abu Dhabi, and he had urged Russia to show it was ready to end the war. Senior representatives from Ukraine's armed forces and military intelligence were due to join the talks on Saturday.

Although U.S. peace envoy Steve Witkoff struck an upbeat tone at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week, saying that only one sticking point remained in the talks, Russian officials have sounded more sceptical.

Ahead of the discussions, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday Russia had not dropped its insistence on Ukraine yielding all of its eastern area of Donbas, Ukraine's industrial heartland grouping the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Putin's demand that Ukraine surrender the 20% it still holds of Donetsk - about 5,000 sq km (1,900 sq miles) - has proven a major stumbling block to any deal.

Zelensky refuses to give up land that Russia has not been able to capture in four years of grinding, attritional warfare. Polls show little appetite among Ukrainians for any territorial concessions.

Russia says it wants a diplomatic solution but will keep working to achieve its goals by military means as long as a negotiated solution remains elusive.

Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council and the head of its delegation, said in a statement late on Friday that the first day of talks had discussed parameters for ending the war and the “further logic of the negotiation process.”

Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 375 drones and 21 missiles in the overnight salvo, which once again targeted energy infrastructure, knocking out power and heat for large parts of Kyiv, the capital. At least one person was killed and 23 injured.

Before Saturday's bombardment, Kyiv had already endured two mass overnight attacks since the New Year that knocked out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings. Ukraine's deputy prime minister said on Saturday that 800,000 people in Kyiv - where temperatures were around -10 C - had been left without power after the latest Russian assault.

Zelensky said on Saturday that Russia's heavy overnight strikes showed that agreements on further air defence support made with Trump in Davos this week must be “fully implemented.”

Both leaders described their talks on the sidelines of the Davos gathering of the world's political and business elite on Thursday as positive but declined to provide further details.

An internet blackout has cut off much of Iran from the outside world, but reports of soaring protester death tolls are trickling out of the country. US President Trump said he was sending a ""massive fleet"" to the region.

US President Donald Trump renewed the threat of military action against Iran late Thursday as reports of rising death tolls from a brutal government crackdown on protests reach the outside world.

Trump delivered the threat while speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on route to Washington from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

""We have a massive fleet heading in that direction… and maybe we won't have to use it… we have a lot of ships heading in that direction, just in case,"" Trump said when speaking of a possible US reaction to ongoing unrest in the Islamic Republic.

""We're watching Iran,"" said Trump. ""I'd rather not see anything happen but we're watching them very closely.""

Trump had made similar threats before, while also urging Iranian protesters to take over Iranian institutions and pledging that ""help is on its way."" But the tensions ebbed last week with the US president saying he had received word from Iran that ""killing has stopped"" and Tehran had no plans to execute detained protesters.

The Pentagon has not confirmed Trump's statement about the US military fleet movements. However, the AP news agency reports the aircraft carrier group USS Abraham Lincoln and a fleet of associated vessels is currently in the Indian Ocean on its way to the Middle East from the South China Sea.

Iran was rocked by nationwide anti-government protests that began in late December and have yet to be entirely quelled; though the government's brutal crackdown on dissenters has kept most Iranians at home, fearful of repression, arrest or death.

On January 8, Iranian government has decided to cut off all internet access and to block international phone use.

Internet monitor NetBlocks on Friday said that the blackout had now entered its third week.

The IT company Cloudflare said later Friday that nationwide data traffic when accessing websites has now reached around 30% of the usual level from before the blockade.

Limited or blocked communication has made it close to impossible to verify death tolls reported by various actors both inside and outside the country. On Wednesday, the Iranian government — which has a historical tendency to underreport the numbers of dead protesters — said 3,117 people had been killed, including security forces.

Death tolls put out by international rights groups have ranged from 4,500 to more than 20,000.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) — which has provided accurate numbers during previous unrest in Iran — said that over 5,000 people had been killed and more than 26,800 arrested.  

That death toll exceeds all other protests or unrest in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

HRANA noted that not all those killed had been protesters, with several innocent women and children among the dead.

""All the evidence gradually emerging from inside Iran shows that the real number of people killed in the protests is far higher than the official figure,"" said Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of the Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights.

This organization reported verifying at least 3,428 deaths.

On Thursday, Iranian state television said that 200 further arrests had been made in western and southern provinces.

United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk urged Tehran on Friday to end its ""brutal ⁠repression,"" saying that children included the thousands killed. 

""I call on the ‍Iranian authorities to reconsider, ​to ​pull back, and to end their brutal repression,"" Turk told an emergency session of ‍the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.

​He called the crackdown ""a pattern of subjugation and ⁠overwhelming ​force that can never address people's ‌grievances ‌and frustrations."" 

The UN Human Rights Council also voted on Friday for a probe into human rights abuses in Iran. Twenty-five countries voted in favor of the motion with China, Pakistan and Iraq among the countries voting against the proposal.

Iran has accused Israel and the US of being behind the nationwide protest.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard, labeled a terrorist entity by the US, Canada and Australia, has been accused of being on the frontline of the government crackdown.

On Thursday, the Iranian government, the army and the IRGC responded to Trump's pressure campaign with warnings.

""The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and dear Iran have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief,"" said IRGC commander, General Mohammad Pakpour.

Pakpour advised the US and Israel to ""avoid any miscalculations,"" saying they would otherwise face a ""painful and regrettable fate.""

General Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi, who runs Iran's Joint Command Headquarters and is under US sanctions, said ""all US interests, bases and centers of influence"" would become ""legitimate targets"" in the event of a US attack.

Last June, Iran, Israel and the US sparred in a 12-day war that ended with US long-range bombers attacking nuclear enrichment facilities in the Islamic Republic. 

Trump on Thursday said future US attacks would make those carried out last summer ""look like peanuts.""

Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine told DW he is in hiding after a military raid on his home, which he blames on forces loyal to President Museveni and his son, army chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba. Wine said his family is under house arrest, and he rejected going to court over disputed election results, arguing Uganda's judiciary serves the regime.

Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine has said he is in hiding after a military raid on his home following a disputed election that he claims he won, but which declared President Yoweri Museveni the victor. Uganda's election on January 15 ended with another term for Museve.

Wine said his family is under house arrest, and that army chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba — Museveni's son — has threatened him, leaving Wine fearing for his safety. Wine said he has no faith in Uganda's courts and is instead urging Ugandans to pursue nonviolent resistance.

When Usha Vance, the second lady of the United States, announced she was pregnant with her fourth child this week, Conservatives heralded the start of a “Maga baby boom”.

It is the first known time in modern US history that a sitting second lady is expecting a baby while her husband is in office. The White House, in response, labelled itself on social media as “the most pro-family administration in history”.

Also pregnant currently are Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesman, and Katie Miller, the wife of the White House deputy chief of staff.

A post shared by Karoline Leavitt Riccio (@karolineleavitt)

The “America needs more babies” rallying cry has been central to Trump 2.0.

The messaging is that Maga women can take on anything while pregnant – even a wall of reporters in a packed press room, à la Mrs Leavitt.

The US fertility rate reached a record low of 1.6 children per woman in 2024. Without immigration, the US population is projected to start shrinking by 2030 – an issue at the heart of the “pronatalist” movement.

Pronatalists believe government policy should be geared towards more childbearing and they increasingly draw supporters at the centre of power.

Mr Trump pledged on the campaign trail to create a “baby boom” to tackle America's ailing birth rate. He has made children a visible part of day-to-day operations, including babysitting Elon Musk's son in the Oval Office.

After declaring himself to be the “fertilisation president”, Mr Trump announced a slew of policies aimed at encouraging women to have more babies, including plans to reduce the cost of IVF and establish newborn savings accounts.

Mr Vance, in turn, has made the need for “more babies” an explicitly Maga cause.

He used his first public address as vice-president to proclaim: “I want more babies in the United States of America”, criticised prominent Democrats who do not have biological children of being “childless cat ladies” and framed America's falling birth rate as a “civilisational crisis”.

Mr Vance's views are also shared by a growing number of Silicon Valley titans with links to the Trump administration, including Mr Musk, a father of 14, who believes declining birth rates are the “biggest danger civilisation faces”.

Sean Duffy, the transport secretary and a father of nine, is pushing for grants to be funnelled into communities with higher marriage and birth rates.

But the administration's policies, rooted in the importance of “family values”, fall well short of what is being proposed by pronatalists.

The movement's supporters frame the falling birth rates in the US as an existential crisis that could lead to societal collapse. Its critics, however, say that pro-family policies will encroach on reproductive freedom and reinforce outdated gender roles, while ignoring the economic and societal issues behind decisions about having children.

The Heritage Foundation, a Right-wing think tank tied to the architects behind Project 2025, in a January report called for a “culture wide Manhattan Project” to restore the nuclear family.

It is considered the central institutional force in the US pronatalist movement, casting the issue of falling birth rates as a national crisis that could devastate the US economy – and derail the Maga agenda.

Their report this month, entitled “Saving America by Saving the Family”, encourages Mr Trump to boost marriage and birth rates by creating tax breaks for bigger families, discourage online dating, restrict access to pornography and “reform divorce culture”.

Delano Squires, director of the Heritage Foundation's Centre for Human Flourishing, told The Telegraph that at the centre of the problem is a “decline in marriage”.

“The American marriage model has gone from early and often to less and later,” he said, echoing a key concern of the pronatalist movement.

To fix the issue, the federal government should play a “limited role in healthy family formation”.

“Every signal I've seen from the current administration is in support of American families. I have no doubt it is open to our ideas,” Mr Squires said, while acknowledging it is “not likely to accept every policy proposal”.

However, critics say such plans represent an overreach and pushes for the type of government intervention that undermines privacy rights and female autonomy.

Family policy appears to have been sidelined while Mr Trump focuses on fulfilling key campaign pledges of enforcing steep tariffs, “solving wars” and carrying out mass deportations.

The immigration crackdown, experts also warn, is accelerating the decline in US population growth, compounding the already low fertility rates and projecting to cause constraints on the economy.

There is also little evidence to suggest government-led policies can reverse declines in birth rates. For example, South Korea and Hungary's aggressive pro-family policies have achieved little impact.

“All these pro-family policies are doomed to fail,” said Brian Dixon, senior vice-president at Population Connection, a US-based non-profit that promotes population stabilisation through increased access to contraception and gender equality.

He pushed against what he called the White House's “parading of babies”, arguing it is “driven by a Right-wing idea about gender roles”. “We need to give people the power to live the lives they chose, not what JD Vance chooses for you,” he added.

“People are making choices, they want smaller families, and this is happening across the world,” he said. And meanwhile, the US government “is not doing anything to make it easier to raise children”.

After US intervention in Venezuela, Trump's threats against cartels may be seen as paving the way for actions in Mexico.

An anti-imperialist movement is building in Mexico, where the U.S. invasion of Venezuela has been seen as an act of intimidation for all of Latin America. Protests are swelling in response to this latest blow after decades of political and economic subjugation by its neighbor to the north.

Across the country, larger-than-usual marches on January 3 and 10 condemned the U.S. attacks on Venezuela. The marches included some pro-Morena groups (the governing party) as well as students, workers, farmers, and Indigenous groups that are critical of Morena.

Over a hundred organizations met in university union offices in Mexico City and collectively

condemned the U.S. intervention in Venezuela, calling for anti-imperialist action around the continent, as “Latin American sovereignty is at stake.” The Zapatistas also released a statement, supported by around 170 organizations in Mexico, in solidarity with the Venezuelan people and denouncing “big capital's wars of conquest.”

In Mexico City, unions, environmentalists, feminists, sexual diversity activists, students, movements for housing rights, and anti-racists chanted “Yankees out of Latin America” and held banners that read “Down with the Monroe Doctrine.”

Here in Puebla, thousands of street vendors, small farmers, university workers, students, solidarity groups, and revolutionary organizations chanted, “We don't want to be a colony.” The local anti-imperialist front was created on January 12.

“The day the U.S. bombed Venezuela, we mobilized in Puebla … and we condemned the aggression and denounced that this would be the start of something bigger,” Rubén Sarabia Sánchez, known as Simitrio, tells Truthout. The founder and general advisor of the UPVA 28 de Octubre, which organizes thousands of market and street vendors in Puebla, he has been a political prisoner twice and his daughter was murdered in 2017 as part of the repression of the group.

The front also called for another protest on January 21. That day, some 10,000 people shut down a major highway and marched along it for six kilometers (3.7 miles). “We're not heard unless the circulation of goods are affected,” Simitrio said.

Unions, environmentalists, feminists, sexual diversity activists, students, movements for housing rights, and anti-racists chanted “Yankees out of Latin America”

Other fronts have been formed around the country, including in Guanajuato, where civil society groups are calling for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Latin America. In Sinaloa, the new front has held protests in Culiacán, rejecting the U.S. attacks on Venezuela and defending self-determination throughout the continent.

“The sentiment in the marches has been ‘if it happens to them, it could happen to us.' It seems like the U.S. president has no limits now,” Axel Hernández tells Truthout. He is part of the Journalism Cooperative in Mexico City, which has been documenting police abuse at protests and observing movements against gentrification, for water rights, and against the upcoming World Cup to be held in Mexico City, among other venues.

“With the supposed ceasefire in Gaza, the mobilizations for Palestine became smaller, but now we are seeing huge numbers of people coming into the street, for some of the biggest mobilizations in the past year … including unions, housing organizations, and even some members of Morena, and some of its leaders like the writer Paco Ignacio Taibo,” Hernández said. Formal political parties like Morena, PRI, PAN, etc. aren't typically welcome in most mobilizations, such as demonstrations for women's rights or for the forcibly disappeared.

Mexico's National Education Workers Union (CNTE), with an estimated 350,000 members, condemned the attack on Venezuela, saying it confirmed Trump's “monopolizing ambitions towards Latin America” and his “determination to use his military power for the capitalist interests of his empire.” Rural Indigenous organizations also released statements of solidarity, noting “Trump thinks the whole world is his village … but we understand that it is the people's time … to wake and unite more.”

At the same time, a few right-wing figures in the country celebrated the attacks on Venezuela, with billionaire and media mogul Ricardo Salinas Pliego calling it a “victory” and source of “hope” for Mexico.

“The day the U.S. bombed Venezuela, we mobilized in Puebla … and we condemned the aggression and denounced that this would be the start of something bigger.”

President Donald Trump's direct threats and attacks against Mexico and Latin America have continued since the U.S. kidnapping of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, with the U.S. selling stolen Venezuelan oil on January 14. The next day, The New York Times reported that the U.S. was intensifying pressure on Mexico to allow U.S. military forces into its territory, allegedly to dismantle fentanyl labs. Trump has also said the U.S. could strike land targets to combat cartels in Mexico. Then, on January 16, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a 60-day-long warning urging airlines to “exercise caution” over Mexico, Central America, Ecuador, and Colombia due to “military activities.”

“January 3 was a bigger blow in a war that has been going on for many years,” Miguel Guerra Castillo, an organizer of a new anti-imperialist front in Puebla and national leader of the Popular Socialist Party of Mexico, told Truthout. “But it was a warning and Mexicans are realizing this threat affects us.”

While Trump paved the way for military intervention in Venezuela by first bombing boats in the Caribbean under the pretext that they were supposedly trafficking drugs, his threats against cartels may also be laying the groundwork for actions in Mexico. Many U.S. companies depend on Mexico for nearshoring, low-paid labor, and access to land, water, and energy that is cheaper than in the U.S. Trump “wants to take control of” Mexico's petroleum, water, and lithium, said Simitrio.

Trump designated six Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations in February 2025. Nearly a year later, on January 7, 2026, he called for a US$1.5 trillion military budget for 2027, up from $901 billion for this year. The next day, he suggested that the U.S. military could launch land strikes on drug cartels in Mexico. “We've knocked out 97 percent of the drugs coming in by water. And we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels,” Trump said, adding, “The cartels are running Mexico, it's very sad to watch and see what's happened to that country.”

Anti-imperialist organizers in Mexico see Trump's statements as a cover for U.S. imperialism.

“Drug trafficking is the pretext, the reality is that they want to impose their policies of domination on Mexico,” said Guerra.

Simitrio agreed. “Yes, it's a pretext, a construct created by the United States to justify aggression whenever they want something.”

Mexico has already lived through a U.S.-led so-called “War on Drugs,” with disastrous consequences for the country. In 2006, then-president Felipe Calderón launched a military offensive against cartels, heavily supported by U.S. funding and strategy through the Merida Initiative. Conflict and violence between security forces and armed groups led to more violence, and organized crime groups bloomed, growing from just a handful in 2006 to reportedly over 400 by 2021, “many of them with ties to the U.S,” Business Insider noted. Further, the vast majority of cartels' guns come from the U.S. now. From 2006 to 2020, there were over 250,000 narco-related deaths in Mexico — with homicides in Mexico tripling in the first six years of the “War on Drugs.”

On January 14, three U.S. congresspeople introduced the No Unauthorized War in Mexico Act to prohibit taxpayer funds being used for military invasion of Mexico. However, its passage is unlikely, as a resolution to limit the future use of U.S. military force in Venezuela has already failed.

The attack on Venezuela demonstrated that the U.S. under Trump is ready for escalation. The attack “was also to plant fear, to demobilize us,” said Guerra, “It's an intolerable pressure, that we can't ignore or assume nothing will happen. Nor should we see it as a done deal. The United States has global military supremacy. It is the international police, and with the latest policies, they have declared themselves the owners of the Americas.”

“The U.S. has never stopped attacking our continent — with weapons or economically, it's always there, protecting its economic and geopolitical interests.”

Nearby, Cubans are also anxious, as Trump has said Venezuelan oil supplies — a lifeline to the country — will be cut. The U.S. is saying Cuba has to make a deal before it's “too late,” but Cuba is refusing.

“The threats regarding supplies have people worried, but at the same time, they're used to it … from friends, I'm getting angry resignation. More worrying, is the idea of military intervention, though many don't think that is likely, since Cuba doesn't have oil or key resources. But with Trump, anything is possible,” Catriona Goss told Truthout from Havana.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has offered to mediate dialogue between the U.S. and Cuba, and this month she has consistently responded to Trump's pressure on Mexico with rhetoric about “coordination” and “cooperation.” She has also stressed the Mexican government's “positive results” in capturing key criminal leaders and destroying drug laboratories. However, if drugs are just a pretext, as was the case in Venezuela (Trump has only talked about and sold oil since the intervention), then such “collaboration” by Mexico will have its limits.

Just over the past year, the U.S. has canceled CBP One appointments and left thousands of migrants and refugees stranded in Mexico. Mexico has sent troops to its north and south borders to appease U.S. anti-migrant policies, and the U.S. has forced Mexico to continue to “cooperate” via tariffs as threats or punishments.

Mexican officials have reported that in every call between Trump and Sheinbaum, the U.S. president has raised the specter of troop deployment. As a result, the government is reassessing its assumptions that obedient economic and security policies are sufficient to protect Mexico from unilateral U.S. action.

“The U.S. has never stopped attacking our continent — with weapons or economically, it's always there, protecting its economic and geopolitical interests,” said Hernández.

Sheinbaum and Trump also disagree on the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) — the new version of NAFTA that went into effect in 2020 — which is due for review in July. Trump said on January 14 that the USMCA is “irrelevant” without any “real benefits,” while Sheinbaum believes it is important, given the highly integrated economies between the three participating countries. But while major automakers have said they depend on it, Mexican people and the environment do not benefit in the long term. The USMCA promotes extractivism and mining and protects transnational miners over Indigenous communities' rights and the Mexican environment. It also permits extreme wage inequality between U.S. and Mexican workers who are doing exactly the same work for the same company.

“United States imperialism is in our veins — it's not just this external thing where they crush and pressure you from the outside, it's also within the economy.”

Trump is only against the USMCA because he wants to be able to use tariffs to extort, Simitrio explained. The agreement includes a no-tariffs policy for products that meet certain requirements and are largely made in North America.

“I don't think there is real sovereignty here, because economic interests take precedence. The law, or the Mexican state, always come down in favor of transnational companies,” Hernández said, agreeing with Estrada that, “Everything changed with NAFTA, now the USMCA. I was born after NAFTA, but all the uncles and parents always talk about how things were different before it.”

NAFTA opened Mexico up much more to imports and exports, and U.S. multinationals quickly set up hundreds of factories to exploit Mexican labor and resources. NAFTA provisions forced Mexico to tolerate most pollution and environmental consequences of these factories, as the government could be sued if environmental regulations negatively impacted transnationals' profits. NAFTA reorganized Mexico's economy, replacing local products and food traditions with U.S. products, and millions lost their jobs and land.

As a continuation of this approach, under USMCA, U.S. corn exports to Mexico (where Indigenous people created modern corn) are protected, Mexico can't ban genetically modified crops from the U.S., and private pharmaceutical corporations are prioritized over public health.

“United States imperialism is in our veins — it's not just this external thing where they crush and pressure you from the outside, it's also within the economy,” said Simitrio. He believes the Mexican government uses sovereignty as a “disguise for subordination to the United States,” and describes how transnationals are often the main beneficiaries of fuel, energy, and other resources, even when petroleum is extracted and managed by a state company.

Coca-Cola for example, uses 419.7 million cubic meters of water a year, leaving many Chiapas residents without water, and private car manufacturing has increased its energy consumption (provided by the publicly-owned CFE) by 75 percent over the past decade.

The three countries in USMCA will also host the World Cup in June and July this year. The event is bringing other issues to the forefront, Hernández said, as the Mexican government is spending a lot of money and time on tourism, while urgent social issues are sidelined.

“The U.S. is present everywhere in Mexico, it owns half the country, it is meddling in everything.”

“Processes of colonization that have been denounced and protested for a while are more visible now,” he said, referring to displacement of Indigenous and other local communities and the diversion of resources for gentrification, multinational construction, and transnationals like FIFA and Airbnb. Protesters argue that the proliferation of Airbnb and other types of gentrification are increasing the rent of locals and leading to mass evictions by landlords, while legislation fails to protect renters and Mexico City has an agreement with Airbnb to promote tourism.

Protesters outside the U.S. embassy on January 18 called for a boycott of U.S. chains like Walmart and McDonald's because they “finance wars” and for a boycott of the World Cup because the government is prioritizing it and the needs of tourists over the needs and demands of movements.

“Younger people in Mexico haven't known any life other than being under the thumb of an empire,” Juan Francisco Estrada García tells Truthout. He is a university professor and general secretary of SUNTUAP, the University of Puebla Workers' Union that was a key convener of the recent anti-imperialist marches in Puebla.

“What happened (in Venezuela) is a continuation of history, of the U.S. tradition of ruling over the governors — imposing its will through local leaders,” said Estrada. “It's a system that was established a very long time ago. The U.S. is present everywhere in Mexico, it owns half the country, it is meddling in everything.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks.

We can only resist Trump's attacks by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

            Years of economic and social crisis, political repression, insecurity, and collapsing institutions forced millions of Venezuelans to leave their country and rebuild their lives abroad during Nicolás Maduro's rule.
    


            “I left Venezuela in 2017 due to political persecution of my family. I was afraid and desperate and thought about leaving before something happened to me,” Bárbara Briceño, who has lived in Mexico City for almost eight years, told CNN.
    


            Maduro's nearly 13 years in power were marked by a deep economic, political and social crisis. His government was accused of authoritarianism, repression of the opposition and electoral manipulation.
    


            Venezuela faced turmoil in oil markets, while years of financial mismanagement, corruption and sanctions decimated the economy and led to hyperinflation that sent prices soaring daily.
    


            After months of tensions between the US and Venezuela, on January 3, President Donald Trump announced that Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores had been captured in a US military operation. The ousted president was detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and other serious drug-related crimes. Maduro denies all accusations and claims they are politically motivated.
    


            The news was initially celebrated by some members of the Venezuelan diaspora in different countries, but later caused uncertainty on two fronts: the appointment of Vice President Delcy Rodríguez as acting president and the Trump administration's plans for the South American country.
    


            Nearly 8 million Venezuelans left the country between 2014 and 2025. The numbers have made Venezuela the nation with the largest displacement crisis in the region. If exiled Venezuelans lived in a single country, they would have a population larger than Nicaragua (7 million), Paraguay (6.4 million), or El Salvador (6.3 million). It is estimated that 2,000 people left Venezuela every day between 2014 and 2025.
    


            Jean Carlo Cruz, originally from Maracay, Aragua state, told CNN that when he left Venezuela in 2011 due to economic and security concerns, the situation had not yet fully deteriorated.
    


            ﻿His parents and other relatives still live in Venezuela, but his siblings and many friends now live in other countries.
    


            “The typical thing now is that Venezuelan families are everywhere, all over the world,” he said.
    


            After 15 years of living in Mexico City, Cruz said he can help his parents financially, feels free to express himself, and has access to services like internet, electricity, water and gas.
    


“In Venezuela, it's hard to live, from the internet connection, to power outages, or no water or gas. In some conversations with my mom, she tells me: ‘Well, today they cut the power for three, four, six hours.' That happens every day and they're used to it now.”



                    - Jean Carlo Cruz
                


            For Bárbara Briceño, born in Puerto Cabello, Carabobo state, being far from her family has been the hardest part of living in another country.
    


            But still, she says, “The best decision was to leave the country before ending up like the political prisoners now.”
    


            On January 8, the president of Venezuela's National Assembly, Jorge Rodríguez, announced the release of “a significant number” of detainees. More than 140 political prisoners have been released so far, according to the organization Foro Penal, and over 700 detainees remain.
    


            “I never went back out of fear. I haven't been to Venezuela since 2017 and I long to return, to spend Christmas at home, family gatherings, it's priceless,” Briceño said.
    


            Venezuela's population decreased by roughly 13% between 2015 and 2024, going from more than 32.6 million inhabitants to just over 28.4 million, according to figures from the National Institute of Statistics (INE) and the UN.
    


            The drop was mainly due to migration, according to the 2024 National Survey of Living Conditions (Encovi) — conducted by Andrés Bello Catholic University in Caracas — although it is also attributed to factors such as increased mortality and a significant drop in the birth rate.
    


            Eighty-seven percent of those who left Venezuela between 2014 and 2025 settled in a Latin American or Caribbean country, while only 11% went to the US and Europe, according to R4V, a UN mission that organizes assistance for Venezuelan refugees and migrants.
    


            Most Venezuelans settle in other countries in the region due to “reasons of accessibility and family networks,” according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Of the more than 7.9 million counted, about 6.9 million were in Latin America and the Caribbean as of November 2025, according to R4V.
    


            Among the more than 2.8 million Venezuelans living in Colombia is Alejandro Méndez, 50. He left his homeland a decade ago with his wife and two children due to multiple factors.
    


            “Freedom of expression started to become complicated, I had a good economic position and lost it, it became hard to get a spot in public schools and private institutions were very expensive. The problem of shortages also began, lack of products, power and water cuts,” he told CNN.
    


            Originally from Caracas, he chose Colombia because there was an opportunity to attain regular migration status, his sister-in-law already lived there, and he considered it a good economic and political option for Venezuelan migrants.
    

Some Venezuelans are celebrating after the US confirmed it captured the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, on Saturday. Video shows crowds dancing, chanting and singing in Doral, Florida, and Santiago, Chile.


            After arriving in Bogotá, Méndez and his wife began sharing their stories, and thus the social media community Cedrizuela was born, a platform where they shared their experiences and how they adapted to their new life. “That's how a new virtual community of communication and integration was consolidated, because if there's one thing migrants need, it's to identify with each other,” he explains.
    


“I am grateful to Colombia for the opportunities it has given us. Of course, we have worked hard, but our quality of life compared to Venezuela has improved significantly.”

            Laima Sanz and her family left Venezuela to start anew in Florida eight years ago as the country was experiencing a “deep political, social, and economic crisis,” she told CNN.
    


            “I didn't want my children to live like that, and the US offered good opportunities for life and education for my children,” she said.
    


            Although she faced the dilemma of starting over in a new country at 49, she now believes she and her husband made the best decision. “Here I am calmer, I can do activities at any time, something that was dangerous in Venezuela. My children live and study in another city, and we have all the services. That didn't happen in Caracas,” she said.
    


            Men aged 15 to 49 represent the largest number of Venezuelans leaving the country. From 2017 to 2024, between 51% and 56% of those who emigrated were men, according to Encovi in 2024.



            The demographics of migration flows from Venezuela have changed considerably over the years. By age group, the largest number of exiled Venezuelans between 2017 and 2021 were aged 15 to 29, and between 2022 and 2024, those aged 30 to 49 led the statistics, meaning that much of the Venezuelan population abroad was of working and voting age.
    


            Statistics on education levels show an increase in the departure of Venezuelans with primary and secondary education — equivalent to high school — rising from 40% in 2017 to 73% in 2024, according to Encovi. In contrast, those with technical and university education dropped from 52% in 2017 to 26% in 2024.
    


            The search for work has been the main reason for leaving the country even for those who had jobs (78% in 2024), but the percentage leaving Venezuela for family reunification reasons rose from 4% to 10% between 2017 and 2024.
    


            Regarding their migration status, two out of three have regular status, either with a temporary residence permit (29%), as residents (21%), or with citizenship in their country of residence (12%). In contrast, 23% have an unknown status and 12% are in irregular status due to lack of documents or expired documents, according to Encovi.
    


            Amid the years-long economic crisis that has marked Venezuela, remittances have become a growing source of income for many Venezuelan households, according to the Inter-American Development Bank.
    


            The Venezuelan diaspora has become a lifeline for their families back home. A 2022 report cited by the IOM indicates that households receiving remittances have significantly lower poverty levels than those that do not.
    


            Meanwhile, Venezuelan migration has also become a key factor in economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean, contributing more than US$10.6 billion annually, mainly through spending on housing, food, education and health, according to an IOM report.
    


            Although the capture of Maduro marked a new chapter in Venezuela's history, much of the Venezuelan diaspora views the country's future with caution and skepticism after Rodríguez became acting president.
    


            “The dictatorship is still in power, whether we like it or not,” said Bárbara Briceño from Mexico City. “Delcy Rodríguez is no saint, she's the country's vice president for a reason. I understand it's part of the transition, but she's not someone Venezuelans trust,” she added.
    


            For that reason, Briceño wouldn't feel comfortable returning to Venezuela. “Not while they're still in power,” she said.
    


Venezuela: Four signs that the Trump-Rodríguez relationship is warming up



            For Alejandro Méndez, Rodríguez's assumption of power adds to his distrust and anxiety about whether there will be real change in the economic, political and social situation.
    


            “There are days when I have a lot of hope that things will definitely change, there will be a transition, and we'll return to a democratic path. But there are also days when I think they're just buying time while the same people are in power,” he said.
    


            The current situation makes it hard to think about returning to the land they were forced to leave. For Venezuelans abroad, it's not just about Maduro's departure, but about the conditions in Venezuela and whether there will be real change.
    


            “I'd love to return,” says Jean Carlo Cruz, “but for that to happen, the conditions have to be optimal, because you live with the memory, the nostalgia for your country, but the country I left in 2011 no longer exists.”
    


            When asked about their first impressions upon hearing of Maduro's capture, exiled Venezuelans described an emotional roller coaster between disbelief, happiness, confusion and uncertainty.
    


            But some also saw it as a first step toward the change they want to see.
    


            “It was a feeling of disbelief, I think that's what overwhelmed me, I thought ‘someone finally helped us' because we've had 26 years of dictatorship and we didn't achieve it with protests, deaths, and all sorts of things,” Briceño told CNN.
    


            Cruz agrees: “If that hadn't happened, nothing would have happened. Because in Venezuela, everything was tried and it's a regime with absolute control.”
    


            Now, Venezuelans wonder if it's finally time to see their homeland prosper, without economic problems and with freedom of expression. A country where people enjoy basic services, a good education system and honest institutions.
    


            “The Venezuela I dream of is a Venezuela with super strong institutions, that guarantees access to goods and services,” Méndez said. “Where it doesn't matter who the prosecutor or president is, there's no messiah saving people, but institutions ensuring the country works.”

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Follow our live coverage of this developing story.



            Officials are currently working to confirm reports of a shooting involving federal law enforcement, the City of Minneapolis said in a post on X.
    


            The city urged the public to remain calm and avoid the area near 26th Street W and Nicollet Avenue as the situation develops and details are confirmed.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the the Trump administration to end its immigration enforcement operations in the state in a post on X.
    


            “I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. Minnesota has had it. This is sickening,” Walz said. “The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”
    


            Minneapolis residents filled frigid city blocks again Saturday to demand ICE leave their neighborhoods, even as the immigration official orchestrating the crackdown promised detentions would not let up.
    


            Protests touched virtually every corner of the city Friday. Storm-weathered Minnesotans endured subzero temperatures at a downtown march, airport protest, arena rally and saw an “economic blackout” in which businesses closed their doors to boycott ICE's presence.
    


            But Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino doubled down on the unrelenting detention effort, which has at times swept up legal residents, US citizens and even a preschooler. He vowed earlier Friday to continue the government's search for “criminal aliens.”
    


            “We're going to take them off the streets wholesale,” Bovino said at a Friday news conference. “It's on. We won't quit.”
    


            Children and families are among those caught up in the mass deportation campaign. A 5-year-old boy was detained alongside his father in their driveway earlier this week, adding to the mounting list of controversial encounters over which federal and state officials are clashing.
    


            Fallout continues over the ICE shooting of Minneapolis mother Renee Nicole Good, as two sources tell CNN an FBI agent originally tasked with an investigation into the encounter has resigned.
    


            As tensions reach a fever pitch in Minnesota, Maine has found itself to be the latest state in the crackdown crosshairs. The Trump administration, continuing its penchant for meme-ready monikers, has dubbed the effort “Operation Catch of the Day” and announced more than 100 arrests this week.
    


            Here's the latest:

            The Chinese military's top general is being investigated for suspected serious violations of discipline and law the Defense Ministry said Saturday.
    


            Zhang Youxia, the senior of the two vice chairs of the powerful Central Military Commission, is the latest figure to fall in a long-running purge of military officials.
    


            Analysts believe the purges are designed both to reform the military and to ensure loyalty to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who also chairs the military commission. They are part of a broader anti-corruption drive that has punished more than 200,000 officials since Xi came to power in 2012.
    


            Another member of the commission, Liu Zhenli, has also been placed under investigation by China's ruling Communist Party, a Defense Ministry statement said. Liu is the chief of staff of the commission's Joint Staff Department. The commission is the top military body in China.
    


            The statement did not provide any details on the alleged wrongdoing.
    


            Zhang, who is 75, joined the People's Liberation Army in 1968 and is a general from its ground forces.
    


            The Communist Party expelled the other vice chair of the commission, He Weidong, last October and replaced him with commission member Zhang Shengmin.

            A massive pipe that moves millions of gallons of sewage has ruptured and sent wastewater flowing into the Potomac River northwest of Washington, DC, polluting it ahead of a major winter storm that has repair crews scrambling.
    


            DC Water, which operates the sewer system, is hooking up pumps to divert sewage around the rupture and allow crews to make repairs. It has cautioned people to stay out of the area and to wash their skin if exposed.
    


            The spill was caused by a 72-inch diameter sewer pipe that collapsed late Monday, shooting sewage out of the ground and into the river. DC Water spokesperson John Lisle said the utility estimates the overflow at about 40 million gallons each day — enough to fill about 66 Olympic-size swimming pools — but it's not clear exactly how much has spilled into the river since the overflow began.
    


            “Oh, my god, the smell is horrific,” said Dean Naujoks, the Potomac Riverkeeper and part of an environmental nonprofit. “It's such high concentrations of sewage that just grabbing a sample is a public health risk.”
    


            Associated Press video from the scene showed signs posted near the river that read “DANGER” and “Raw Sewage” and warned people not to enter the area. Naujoks and another man donned protective gloves to take samples of water from the river to test for E. coli and other bacteria. Small bits of debris could be seen floating in some of the sample bottles.
    


            The spill occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland, along Clara Barton Parkway, which hugs the northern edge of the Potomac River near Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historic Park.
    


            Crews are removing lock gates on the C & O Canal and will set up pumps to divert the sewage into the canal, rerouting it away from the river and back into the sewage system downstream. The pumps have enough capacity to capture all of the sewage flow in dry weather, said Lisle, but they could be overwhelmed by a surge in stormwater. Crews will work through the weekend, when a bad winter storm is expected, Lisle said, and they hope to have the bypass set up by Monday.
    


            The spill does not impact drinking water, which is a separate system, DC Water said.
    


            Naujoks said the spill is happening at a time when the river is low. He went out to look at it Wednesday and was “kind of stunned.”
    


            “Sewage is just bubbling up like a small geyser, maybe 2, 3 feet into the air,” he said. “Sewage water is running in every direction.”
    


            The District of Columbia Department of the Environment did not immediately respond to a request for comment, including whether it is testing the river's water.
    


            DC Water knew the pipeline was deteriorating, and rehabilitation work on a section about a quarter-mile from the break began in September and was recently completed, Lisle said. Repair work on additional “high priority” sections of the pipeline is expected to start later this year, according to the DC Water website.
    


            The pipeline, called the Potomac Interceptor, was first installed in the 1960s.
    


            There's a huge funding gap for water infrastructure in the US, said Gary Belan, a senior director with American Rivers, an environmental organization that advocates for clean waterways.
    


            “I know a lot of the wastewater folks are trying to catch up as best they can, but this is something we see and will continue to see, where these pipes fail and these massive sewage dumps occur,” Belan said. “This is why we can't defer maintenance of our wastewater infrastructure. Too often, we're dependent on these disasters to prod us forward.”
    


            Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, speaking at a press conference declaring a snow emergency for the impending storm, said authorities there were aware of the sewage spill “but I can't give you an intelligent response right now.” She said DC officials would be more forthcoming as soon as they could.
    


            Kelly Offner, a US Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson for the mid-Atlantic region, said the agency was coordinating with DC Water, the Maryland Department of the Environment and other federal, state and local authorities to assess the impact on the environment from the Potomac Interceptor sanitary sewer overflow. The federal agency oversees DC Water's sewer operations under a 2015 federal consent decree.
    


            “DC Water has provided daily updates since the overflow was discovered on January 19, 2026, and has been coordinating efforts to contain the overflow, monitor environmental impacts, and communicate with the public,” Offner said in an emailed response to questions.
    


            An EPA survey of wastewater infrastructure needs from 2022 estimated that the District of Columbia needs roughly $1.33 billion to replace or rehabilitate structurally deteriorating sanitary or combined sewers within the next 20 years.
    


            Nationally, hundreds of billions in infrastructure investment is needed over the next two decades for clean water problems like aging sewer pipes. In other places where sewer breaks are persistent, it can lead to backups into homes and regular flooding.

            The first trilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States aimed at ending the war in Ukraine have been hailed as “constructive” as they concluded in the United Arab Emirates on Saturday.
    


            Th﻿e two-day talks, which saw officials from all three countries sit down together for the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wrapped up Saturday evening local time, according to the Ukrainian delegation and Russian state media.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement that “a lot was discussed, and it is important that the conversations were constructive,” adding that further meetings could take place as early as next week.
    


            “The central focus of the discussions was the possible parameters for ending the war,” the Ukrainian leader said. He added that US officials had suggested formalizing these parameters, as well as the security conditions required to achieve them.
    


            “All sides agreed to report back in their capitals on each aspect of the negotiations and to coordinate further steps with their leaders,” he added. “Provided there is readiness to move forward – and Ukraine is ready – further meetings will take place, potentially as early as next week.”
    


            Meanwhile, a UAE government spokesperson said the talks had a “positive and constructive atmosphere” and saw Ukrainian and Russian representatives engage directly on elements of a US-proposed peace framework.
    


            The spokesperson added that the UAE “commended the efforts of U.S. President Donald Trump in facilitating these talks, reinforcing stability, and advancing the political track.”
    


            The negotiations were conducted in English and Russian, Russian state news agency TASS reported, citing a source.
    


            Earlier, TASS had reported that territory remained the key sticking point in the negotiations. Going into the talks, it was widely understood that territory was the only remaining key issue to be resolved. The Kremlin had reiterated Russia's stance that Ukraine must withdraw from the Donbas region in the eastern part of the country, which Ukraine has repeatedly rejected.
    


            The Donbas region is formed of the two coal-rich regions of Donetsk and Luhansk that used to make up Ukraine's industrial heartland. The region has a significant Russian-speaking population living there. And it was in the Donbas that Putin's mission to destabilize and conquer Ukraine started in 2014. 



            The area also contains the “fortress belt” of industrial cities, railways and roads that form the backbone of Ukraine's defense and supply the frontline. Kyiv has spent years fortifying this area and losing it would leave the rest of eastern Ukraine wide open.
    


            Russia sent a military team to attend the talks in Abu Dhabi, including a top spy and military intelligence chief; Ukraine sent top negotiators including diplomats and security officials; and the US was represented by President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and White House adviser Josh Gruenbaum.
    


            The Trump administration has previously pressured Ukraine to accept a peace deal, despite widespread concerns such an arrangement could favor Moscow.
    


            Nearly four years since launching a full-scale invasion of its neighbor, Russia occupies around 20% of the territory recognized under international law as part of sovereign Ukraine. That includes almost all of the Luhansk region, and parts of the Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.
    


            Hours after negotiators from Kyiv, Moscow and Washington had finished their first day of talks in the UAE on Friday, Russia launched its biggest overnight aerial attack on Ukraine so far this year, local authorities said Saturday.
    


            Between the two rounds of talks, missile and drone attacks targeted the Ukrainian capital, according to the country's air force, which activated air defenses. CNN journalists in Kyiv reported hearing explosions.
    


            At least one person died and four people were wounded by the strikes, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. He added that falling debris had caused fires and damaged buildings, with nearly 6,000 apartment blocks losing heat and other parts of the city cut off from water supply. As of Saturday morning local time it was -12 degrees Celsius (10 degrees Fahrenheit) in Kyiv.
    


            Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv in the northeast, also came under attack – with strikes damaging a maternity hospital and a dormitory for displaced people, according to city mayor Ihor Terekhov. At least 19 people were wounded, including one child.
    


            In total, Russia launched more than 370 drones and 21 missiles overnight, with other targets including Sumy and Chernihiv, said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday. He added that the attacks had focused on Ukraine's energy sector, which is “critical” during the cold winter.

As more than 2,000 federal agents surge in Minneapolis in an immigration crackdown and clash with protesters on the streets, residents are also finding ways to covertly disrupt the operation. One volunteer says she was a Trump voter (AP Video: David R. Martin)

When federal immigration agents pounded on the door of his Minneapolis home, the oldest son in a family of 10 knew he had to move his siblings to a safer place. 

Their mother, a 41-year-old Indigenous Ecuadorian office cleaner without a known criminal record besides minor traffic offenses, had been detained in early January because she entered the country illegally. Her eldest children feared they would be next, leaving behind their 5-month-old brother and six other children under 16 years old.

“The immigration agents were knocking on our door very late at night, and that's when I became afraid,” said the 20-year-old son, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear additional family members could face deportation. “I'm afraid that I'll be taken and my brothers and sisters will be in the hands of the government.”

That's when the family contacted Feliza Martinez, a friend from church, who rallied a group of volunteers to quietly move them to a safe house in south Minneapolis. 

Martinez is one of the countless Twin Cities residents aiding immigrants like Melida Rita Wampash Tuntuam's family, prompted by word-of-mouth appeals for help — mostly ordinary people appalled by the aggressive tactics of federal agents who have broken down doors without warrants and violently clashed with protesters during the Trump administration's crackdown. 

As more than 2,000 federal agents scour Minneapolis-St. Paul for immigrants to detain and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports more than 3,000 arrests since early December, residents have organized to monitor, disrupt and protest the crackdown in the streets and in less visible ways.

These Minnesotans have paid rent for immigrant families whose breadwinners are afraid to go to work, delivered home-cooked meals and arranged for regular check-ins and emergency custody arrangements to make sure children are cared for in case their parents are detained. Christian nonprofit Source MN has expanded its food bank program to provide for hundreds of sheltering immigrant families.




“I do receive calls every single day from families and they're terrified, and we're just trying to help them as much as we can,” said Martinez, a mother of five who has been taking time off her job on a factory assembly line to volunteer for Source MN. “I just try to bring hope — like, ‘We're here with you.'”

Snow covered the street as the Wampash Tuntuam family arrived at the safe house. A stream of visitors brought snacks, baby supplies and coloring books for the children. They assembled bunk beds and carried in mattresses. 

The younger siblings settled in quickly, nestling on the couch in pajamas to share a bag of Cheetos and opening a coloring book to draw butterflies. The house soon sounded like any other filled with the shrieks and giggles of small children at play.

But Wampash Tuntuam's older children, fidgeting on the couch, still worried about their future. They told The Associated Press that their mother gave the address of their rental home to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, who said they wanted to send a social worker to check on the younger children. Instead, armed masked immigration officers appeared and surrounded the house twice.

“That's when we knew they hadn't sent a social worker but agents to detain us,” recalled Wampash Tuntuam's 22-year-old daughter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she and three other family members have final orders of removal. Her 20-year-old brother and other siblings are working on obtaining legal status. The two youngest children are U.S. citizens. 

Martinez, a devoted Christian, said she voted for President Donald Trump in the past three elections because of his hard-line stance against abortion and gender-affirming care for youth. The granddaughter of a Mexican immigrant supported deporting violent criminals and had not paid much attention to reports of family separations in the first Trump presidency.

But over the past two months, after watching videos of federal agents aggressively detaining her neighbors and working directly with children parted from their parents, she has changed her views.

“Being on the front line and what I have experienced and seen, I wish I would've never voted for him,” Martinez said. “What he's doing, it's not Christian. It's not my beliefs.”

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE does not separate families,” noting that parents are asked whether they want to be removed with their children or place them with a designated person.

McLaughlin said Wampash Tuntuam entered the country illegally in 2022 via the Texas border and later received a final order of removal from an immigration judge. She said Wampash Tuntuam received due process and the administration is enforcing the law.

According to Wampash Tuntuam's family, their mother had been planning to self-deport but was preparing custody documents for her infant son. The older children said their mother did not want her children to be deported because they will all end up living on the streets in their hometown in the Ecuadorian Amazon, like they did before coming to the U.S.

The older children expect their mother will be deported at any moment and worry about what will happen to her five youngest.

“If they found out that the baby was alone, they may take him away,” the 22-year-old daughter said. “We have all grown up together. I saw my baby brother's birth. I am very scared they will take him away and I will never see him again.”

After their mother was detained, the 20-year-old son quit work at a restaurant to watch over his child siblings. He's still figuring out how to care for his infant brother, who has had to switch from breastfeeding to formula and struggles to sleep without his mother. 

The 20-year-old said he once saw Minneapolis as a “beautiful city” offering opportunities for immigrants like him until the surge of federal agents. There are still good people here, he said, referring to the volunteers who sheltered his family.

But his younger siblings continue to ask when their mother will return. He comforts them by saying she's at the hospital and will be home soon. 

“I keep telling them that she is going to come back, that she is already on her way,” he said. “They think that.”

The new U.S. National Defense Strategy released by President Donald Trump's administration is the first since 2022 and contrasts with its predecessor, issued under former President Joe Biden. Here's a look at how the two Pentagon strategies address some of the traditional concerns of U.S. security policy. 

2022: “The United States derives immense benefit from a stable, peaceful, and democratic Western Hemisphere that reduces security threats to the homeland. To prevent distant threats from becoming a challenge at home, the Department will continue to partner with countries in the region to build capability and promote security and stability.

“As in all regions, the Department will work collaboratively, seeking to understand our partners' security needs and areas of mutual concern.”

2026: “We will actively and fearlessly defend America's interests throughout the Western Hemisphere. We will guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland. We will provide President Trump with credible military options to use against narco-terrorists wherever they may be. We will engage in good faith with our neighbors, from Canada to our partners in Central and South America, but we will ensure that they respect and do their part to defend our shared interests. And where they do not, we will stand ready to take focused, decisive action that concretely advances U.S. interests.” 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




2022: “The Department will maintain its bedrock commitment to NATO collective security, working alongside Allies and partners to deter, defend, and build resilience against further Russian military aggression and acute forms of gray zone coercion. As we continue contributing to NATO capabilities and readiness — including through improvements to our posture in Europe and our extended nuclear deterrence commitments — the Department will work with Allies bilaterally and through NATO's established processes to better focus NATO capability development and military modernization to address Russia's military threat.”

2026: “Russia will remain a persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members for the foreseeable future.”

“European NATO dwarfs Russia in economic scale, population, and, thus, latent military power. At the same time, although Europe remains important, it has a smaller and decreasing share of global economic power. It follows that, although we are and will remain engaged in Europe, we must — and will — prioritize defending the U.S. Homeland and deterring China.”




“Fortunately, our NATO allies are substantially more powerful than Russia — it is not even close. Germany's economy alone dwarfs that of Russia. At the same time, under President Trump's leadership, NATO allies have committed to raise defense spending to the new global standard of 5% of GDP in total, with 3.5% of GDP invested in hard military capabilities. Our NATO allies are therefore strongly positioned to take primary responsibility for Europe's conventional defense, with critical but more limited U.S. support. This includes taking the lead in supporting Ukraine's defense.”

2022: “The NDS (National Defense Strategy) directs the Department to act urgently to sustain and strengthen U.S. deterrence, with the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the pacing challenge for the Department.”

“The most comprehensive and serious challenge to U.S. national security is the PRC's coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region and the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences.”

“The PRC's increasingly provocative rhetoric and coercive activity towards Taiwan are destabilizing, risk miscalculation, and threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait. This is part of a broader pattern of destabilizing and coercive PRC behavior that stretches across the East China Sea, the South China Sea, and along the Line of Actual Control.”

“The Department will support Taiwan's asymmetric self-defense commensurate with the evolving PRC threat and consistent with our one China policy.”

2026: “Were China — or anyone else, for that matter — to dominate this broad and crucial region, it would be able to effectively veto Americans' access to the world's economic center of gravity, with enduring implications for our nation's economic prospects, including our ability to reindustrialize. That is why the NSS (National Security Strategy) directs DoW (Department of War) to maintain a favorable balance of military power in the Indo-Pacific. 

“Not for purposes of dominating, humiliating, or strangling China. To the contrary, our goal is far more scoped and reasonable than that: It is simply to ensure that neither China nor anyone else can dominate us or our allies. This does not require regime change or some other existential struggle. Rather, a decent peace, on terms favorable to Americans but that China can also accept and live under, is possible.”

2022: “The Department will continue to deter attacks through forward posture; integrated air and missile defense; close coordination and interoperability with our ROK (South Korea) Ally; nuclear deterrence; resilience initiatives; and the potential for direct cost imposition approaches that come from globally deployable Joint Forces.” 

2026: “With its powerful military, supported by high defense spending, a robust defense industry, and mandatory conscription, South Korea is capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea with critical but more limited U.S. support. South Korea also has the will to do so, given that it faces a direct and clear threat from North Korea.”

2022: “As the Department continues to right-size its forward military presence in the Middle East following the mission transition in Afghanistan and continuing our ‘by, with, and through' approach in Iraq and Syria, we will address major security challenges in the region in effective and sustainable ways.”

“The Department will prioritize cooperation with our regional and global partners that results in their increased ability to deter and defend against potential aggression from Iran, for example by working to advance integrated air and missile defense, maritime security, and irregular warfare capabilities. Working in concert with global and interagency partners, the Department will redouble efforts to support regional security coalitions within the Gulf Cooperation Council and among states in the region to ensure maritime security and improve collective intelligence and warning.”

2026: “DoW will empower regional allies and partners to take primary responsibility for deterring and defending against Iran and its proxies, including by strongly backing Israel's efforts to defend itself; deepening cooperation with our Arabian Gulf partners; and enabling integration between Israel and our Arabian Gulf partners, building on President Trump's historic initiative, the Abraham Accords. As we do, DoW will maintain our ability to take focused, decisive action to defend U.S. interests.”

BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese military's top general is being investigated for suspected serious violations of discipline and law the Defense Ministry said Saturday,

Zhang Youxia, the senior of the two vice chairs of the powerful Central Military Commission, is the latest figure to fall in a long-running purge of military officials.

Analysts believe the purges are designed both to reform the military and to ensure loyalty to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who also chairs the military commission. They are part of a broader anti-corruption drive that has punished more than 200,000 officials since Xi came to power in 2012.

Another member of the commission, Liu Zhenli, has also been placed under investigation by China's ruling Communist Party, a Defense Ministry statement said. Liu is the chief of staff of the commission's Joint Staff Department. The commission is the top military body in China.

The statement did not provide any details on the alleged wrongdoing.

Zhang, who is 75, joined the People's Liberation Army in 1968 and is a general from its ground forces. 

The Communist Party expelled the other vice chair of the commission, He Weidong, last October and replaced him with commission member Zhang Shengmin.

In 2024, the party expelled two former defense ministers over corruption charges.

The Trump administration released a new National Defense Strategy on Friday acknowledging China as a military power that it said needs to be deterred from dominating the U.S. or its allies.

“This does not require regime change or some other existential struggle,” the strategy said. “Rather, a decent peace, on terms favorable to Americans but that China can also accept and live under, is possible.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon released a priority-shifting National Defense Strategy late Friday that chastised U.S. allies to take control of their own security and reasserted the Trump administration's focus on dominance in the Western Hemisphere above a longtime goal of countering China.

The 34-page document, the first since 2022, was highly political for a military blueprint, criticizing partners from Europe to Asia for relying on previous U.S. administrations to subsidize their defense. It called for “a sharp shift — in approach, focus, and tone.” That translated to a blunt assessment that allies would take on more of the burden countering nations from Russia to North Korea.

“For too long, the U.S. Government neglected — even rejected — putting Americans and their concrete interests first,” read the opening sentence.

It capped off a week of animosity between President Donald Trump's administration and traditional allies like Europe, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs on some European partners to press a bid to acquire Greenland before announcing a deal that lowered the temperature.

As allies confront what some see as a hostile attitude from the U.S., they will almost certainly be unhappy to see that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's department will provide “credible options to guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain,” especially Greenland and the Panama Canal. 

Following a tiff this week at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the strategy at once urges cooperation with Canada and other neighbors while still issuing a stark warning.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




“We will engage in good faith with our neighbors, from Canada to our partners in Central and South America, but we will ensure that they respect and do their part to defend our shared interests,” the document says. “And where they do not, we will stand ready to take focused, decisive action that concretely advances U.S. interests.”




Much like the White House's National Security Strategy that preceded it, the defense blueprint reinforces Trump's “America First” philosophy, which favors nonintervention overseas, questions decades of strategic relationships and prioritizes U.S. interests. The National Defense Strategy last was published in 2022 under then-President Joe Biden and focused on China as America's “pacing challenge.”

The strategy simultaneously courts help from partners in America's backyard, while warning them that the U.S. will “actively and fearlessly defend America's interests throughout the Western Hemisphere.” 

It specifically points to access to the Panama Canal and Greenland. It comes just days after Trump said he reached a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security with NATO leader Mark Rutte that would offer the U.S. “total access” to Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.

Danish officials, who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, say formal negotiations have yet to begin.

Trump previously suggested that the U.S. should potentially consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accused Panama of ceding influence to China. Asked this week if the U.S. reclaiming the canal was still on the table, Trump demurred.

“I don't want to tell you that,” the president responded. “Sort of, I must say, sort of. That's sort of on the table.”

The Pentagon also touted the operation that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month, saying “all narco-terrorists should take note.”

The new policy document views China — which the Biden administration saw as a top adversary — as a settled force in the Indo-Pacific region that only needs to be deterred from dominating the U.S. or its allies.

The goal “is not to dominate China; nor is it to strangle or humiliate them,” the document says. It later adds, “This does not require regime change or some other existential struggle.”

“President Trump seeks a stable peace, fair trade, and respectful relations with China,” it says, which follows efforts to climb down from a trade war sparked by the administration's sky-high tariffs. It says it will “open a wider range of military-to-military communications” with China's army.

The strategy, meanwhile, makes no mention of or guarantee to Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own and says it will take by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by its own laws to give military support to Taiwan.

By contrast, the Biden administration's 2022 strategy said the U.S. would “support Taiwan's asymmetric self-defense.”

In another example of offloading regional security to allies, the document says, “South Korea is capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea with critical but more limited U.S. support.”

While saying that “Russia will remain a persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members for the foreseeable future,” the defense strategy asserts that NATO allies are much more powerful and so are “strongly positioned to take primary responsibility for Europe's conventional defense.”

It says the Pentagon will play a key role in NATO “even as we calibrate U.S. force posture and activities in the European theater” to focus on priorities closer to home.

The U.S. already has confirmed that it will reduce its troop presence on NATO's borders with Ukraine, with allies expressing concern that the Trump administration might drastically cut their numbers and leave a security vacuum as European countries confront an increasingly aggressive Russia.

National Park Service crews removed a slavery exhibit at Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park after an executive order, taking down panels naming nine people enslaved by George and Martha Washington.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Outraged critics accused President Donald Trump of “whitewashing history” on Friday after the National Park Service removed an exhibit on slavery at Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park in response to his executive order “restoring truth and sanity to American history” at the nation's museums, parks and landmarks.

Empty bolt holes and shadows are all that remains on the brick walls where explanatory panels were displayed at the President's House Site, where George and Martha Washington lived with the people they owned as property when Philadelphia was the nation's capital. One woman cried silently at their absence. Someone left a bouquet of flowers. A hand-lettered sign said “Slavery was real.”

Workers on Thursday removed the exhibit, which included biographical details about the nine people enslaved by the Washingtons at the presidential mansion. Just their names — Austin, Paris, Hercules, Christopher Sheels, Richmond, Giles, Oney Judge, Moll and Joe — remain engraved into a cement wall.

Karen Oliver, a retired Philadelphian who was visited the exhibit Friday, said she was “heartbroken” at the removal of references to slavery and a chance for visitors to learn from the nation's history.

“You show all of it,” she said. “The good, the bad, and the ugly.”

Seeking to stop the display's permanent removal, the city of Philadelphia on Thursday sued Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and acting National Park Service Director Jessica Bowron.

“Let me affirm, for the residents of the city of Philadelphia, that there is a cooperative agreement between the city and the federal government that dates back to 2006,” Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker said during a press conference Friday. “That agreement requires parties to meet and confer if there are to be any changes made to an exhibit.”

Slavery is central to the site's story, Philadelphia's lawsuit argues: The people enslaved at the mansion included Oney Judge, who famously ran away and remained free despite Washington's attempts to return her to bondage.

The panels came down because Trump's order requires federal agencies to review interpretive materials to “ensure accuracy, honesty, and alignment with shared national values,” an Interior Department statement said. It called the city's lawsuit frivolous, aimed at “demeaning our brave Founding Fathers who set the brilliant road map for the greatest country in the world.”

The department did not answer questions about what will replace the exhibits that were removed.

Critics condemned the removals as confirmation the Trump administration seeks to erase unflattering aspects of American history.

“Their shameful desecration of this exhibit raises broader, disturbing questions about this administration's continued abuse of power and commitment to whitewashing history,” said Rep. Dwight Evans, a Democrat whose district includes the city. 

“America's history, as painful as some chapters are, isn't disparaged by telling the whole truth. Trying to whitewash American history, however, disparages who we are. This is yet another egregious example of revisionist history that will be reviled for generations,” said Philadelphia state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta.

Taking pride in American independence shouldn't mean hiding its mistakes, said Ed Stierli, a regional director for the National Parks Conservation Association. Historic sites should help Americans grapple with our difficult truths and historical contradictions, he said. Removing the exhibit insults the memory of the enslaved people who lived there, reverses years of collaborative work and “sets a dangerous precedent of prioritizing nostalgia over the truth,” Stieri said.

“It shows that the United States is still unwilling to reckon with the horrors of its past and would rather prefer to sanitize the history that it has and try to present a convenient lie,” said Timothy Welbeck, director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University.

As the Trump administration prepares to celebrate the country's 250th anniversary, it has focused on a more positive telling of the American story and put pressure on federal institutions including the Smithsonian to tell a version of history less focused on race. 

The executive order Trump signed last March accused the Biden administration of advancing a “corrosive ideology.” 

“At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — where our Nation declared that all men are created equal — the prior administration sponsored training by an organization that advocates dismantling ‘Western foundations' and ‘interrogating institutional racism' and pressured National Historical Park rangers that their racial identity should dictate how they convey history to visiting Americans because America is purportedly racist,” the order states.

Paul Gigot hosts a 'Journal Editorial Report' panel discussing the Global Electric Vehicle retreat, Ford's decision to cut back on EV production and Europe backtracking it's decision to ban gas-powered cars by 2035.

In 2022, Democrats rammed through what they misleadingly called the Inflation Reduction Act. The name was deceptive then, and the results are undeniable now: it didn't reduce inflation. What it did accomplish was shovel hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into ""Green New Deal"" subsidies — chief among them, electric vehicle (EV) tax credits that disproportionately benefited the wealthy.

At the time, I stood on the Senate floor and asked: why should working Americans struggling with high prices be forced to subsidize luxury car purchases for the rich? Nearly every Senate Democrat voted to keep these handouts alive. Now, more than four years later, the data proves I was right.

The National Bureau of Economic Research found that seven out of 10 EV tax credit recipients would have bought an electric car anyway. In other words, taxpayers were footing the bill for decisions affluent households were already going to make. That's not an incentive — that's a windfall.

AMERICANS ARE PUMPING THE BRAKES ON ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION: 'AFFORDABILITY IS A BIG ISSUE'

And who reaped that windfall? The wealthiest Americans. A study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that before the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, the top 5% of earners claimed half of all EV tax credit benefits, while the bottom 60% of earners received less than 3%. Democrats claim they fixed this by adding income caps, but they set the ceiling at $300,000 for joint filers. Since when is $300,000 considered middle class? In what world should taxpayers be buying $80,000 SUVs for families earning three times the median household income?

The environmental case isn't much stronger. Yes, EVs produce fewer emissions than gas-powered cars. But the Congressional Research Service highlights research showing that the credits mostly displaced sales of other efficient vehicles like hybrids. When you account for that substitution, the supposed climate benefits are overstated by nearly 40%. Simply put: these credits aren't nearly as ‘green' as Democrats claim.

Meanwhile, the price tag was massive. That's why I'm pleased we repealed these wasteful tax credits in July's reconciliation law. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this will save taxpayers $190 billion over the next decade. Republicans are saving taxpayers from this costly policy that was never going to deliver on Democrats' own goal of 50% EV sales by 2030.

 In what world should taxpayers be buying $80,000 SUVs for families earning three times the median household income?

The verdict is clear: EV tax credits are inefficient, inequitable, and irresponsible. They don't meaningfully change consumer behavior, they don't deliver the promised environmental gains, and they drain taxpayer dollars into the pockets of the rich. If Democrats were serious about helping working families — instead of virtue-signaling about climate change — they would back policies that deliver a real return on investment.

A good place to start would be addressing the dwindling Highway Trust Fund (HTF), which is projected to run insolvent by 2028. While drivers of gasoline-powered cars pay into the HTF through the federal gas tax, EVs currently do not contribute at all – despite their heavier batteries putting greater wear and tear on our roads and bridges. That means higher maintenance costs – and once again, working Americans footing the bill.

That's why I introduced the Fair SHARE Act, which would require EVs to contribute to this fund. I encourage my Democratic colleagues to cosponsor it and to work with me on including an EV fee in the upcoming Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act. That would be a fairer, smarter policy – one that actually serves working families instead of subsidizing the wealthy.

Heritage Foundation Family Policy analyst Emma Waters joins ‘Fox News Live' to explain America's declining birth rate and what the Trump administration is doing to address it.

A new report by the Congressional Budget Office shows that, absent immigration, America's population will begin to shrink by 2030. As we approach the 250th anniversary of our nation's founding, this projection underscores a hard truth: the collapse of marriage and family life represents the gravest threat to our great nation's future.

That is why The Heritage Foundation has released the first in a series of special reports on Saving America by Saving the Family. The central argument is straightforward. Our country cannot afford to continue ignoring our declining marriage and falling birthrates, as lawmakers on both the Left and Right have done for decades. The discussion ranges from eliminating all marriage penalties embedded in welfare programs, to new tax credits for married families, to offering public honors to couples for every decade they remain married.

These proposals reflect a blend of longstanding conservative priorities and new ideas, all animated by a shared belief: that strong American families were at the heart of the nation in 1776 and remain essential to its future. They are not offered as a final word, but as the beginning of a long-overdue national conversation about how to halt America's demographic and social collapse.

HERITAGE FOUNDATION WARNS AMERICA 'DANGEROUSLY CLOSE' TO FAMILY BREAKDOWN POINT OF NO RETURN

Unfortunately, there are those—on both the radical Left and the libertarian Right—who are rigidly and ideologically opposed to our key ideas for supporting married families.

Critics on the Left argue that opposition to abortion and support for married parents who prefer to provide home child care (usually through the mother) amount to a patriarchal assault on women's ""autonomy"" and ""reproductive freedom."" Meanwhile, critics on the libertarian Right contend that government has no business trying to incentivize decisions related to family structure.

America is a nation rooted in its people, culture, laws, and customs, as well as its ideals—and it cannot be sustained if Americans themselves do not marry, form families, and raise children

Few dispute that marriage rates are falling, that traditional families are weakening, or that the nation stands on a demographic precipice. What is striking is how our critics echo each other in saying the government should not be doing anything proactively about it.

The problem is that if traditional families continue to disappear, we will eventually lose America itself.

AMERICA'S NEXT HEALTH REVOLUTION STARTS IN THE KITCHEN — AND AROUND THE DINNER TABLE

America is a nation rooted in its people, culture, laws, and customs, as well as its ideals—and it cannot be sustained if Americans themselves do not marry, form families, and raise children. And yes, we do believe it is legitimate for government to encourage ways of life that allow its people to endure and flourish, and the social science is crystal clear—traditional married families outpace the alternatives in a host of wealth, education, health, and happiness measures.

We make no apology for wanting to persuade more young Americans to marry, own homes, raise the next generation, and find deep fulfillment in family life.

We also do not believe the solution lies in mass immigration when we can't even assimilate the immigrants that are already here. Nor do we believe that modern technology can substitute for the home, the neighborhood, and the family.

The quintessential American Dream of a family with a house and a white-picket fence remains as important as ever to the American imagination and our task is to convert that dream into a reality. We want to make sure young Americans can realistically achieve these goals by, at a minimum, removing obstacles that stand in the way, and by assuring our policies actually privilege, prefer, and support married family formation.

That is a winning message conservatives would do well to embrace in 2026. And the good news is that President Trump is already leading the way. He recently announced his intention to tackle the unaffordability of single-family homes and abuses in the credit-card industry, and Heritage looks forward to contributing our thoughts and recommendations into that discussion and those to come.

More broadly, we will continue to answer those—on the Left and on the libertarian Right—who either see no problem or see no solution. They are wrong on both counts. A society that refuses to defend marriage and child-rearing is not neutral; it is choosing between accelerated or managed decline. And a movement that shrugs its shoulders in the face of that decline offers nothing but surrender.

If our critics have new ideas, they should by all means present them. But we are done watching our kids fall further behind, our families struggle, and our societal pillars crumble, and we are calling for action that meets the moment. Heritage will be proud to work on ushering in a new American Golden Age, centered on the family, and the next phase in reaching that goal begins now.

Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson reports on President Donald Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on ‘Special Report.'

The Pentagon said in an unclassified national defense strategy document titled ""Restoring peace through strength for a new golden age of America"" on Friday that it plans to shift more of the responsibility of deterring North Korea to South Korea.

The U.S. would take a ""more limited"" role in keeping North Korea in line, the Pentagon said in the document obtained by Fox News Digital.

""With its powerful military, supported by high defense spending, a robust defense industry, and mandatory conscription, South Korea is capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea with critical but more limited U.S. support,"" the document said.

It added, ""South Korea also has the will to do so, given that it faces a direct and clear threat from North Korea. This shift in the balance of responsibility is consistent with America's interest in updating U.S. force posture on the Korean Peninsula. In this way, we can ensure a stronger and more mutually beneficial alliance relationship that is better aligned with America's defense priorities, thereby setting conditions for lasting peace.""

The new policy plan on North Korea followed similar strategies for other parts of the world, with the wide-ranging document adding that the department will ""no longer be distracted by interventionism, endless wars, regime change, and nation building. Instead, we will put our people's practical concrete interests first.""

The document clarified the policy doesn't mean ""isolationism,"" but rather a ""strategic approach to the threats our nation faces.""

Further down, it added, ""We will insist our allies and partners do their part and lend them a helping hand when they step up.""

Our allies will do so not as a favor to us, but out of their own interests.""

Iranian leaders not only “intend” to rebuild their conventional military forces, but they are open to “the possibility” of trying to obtain a nuclear weapon, according to the Pentagon's newly released National Defense Strategy.

The Pentagon's assessment of the Iranian regime comes more than six months after the U.S. military carried out Operation Midnight Hammer, targeting three of the country's nuclear facilities. It also comes as the United States increases its presence in the region as Iran cracks down on nationwide protests.

“Although Iran has suffered severe setbacks over recent months, it appears intent on reconstituting its conventional military forces. Iran's leaders have also left open the possibility that they will try again to obtain a nuclear weapon, including by refusing to engage in meaningful negotiations,” the National Defense Strategy said.

The Pentagon released the NDS, a guiding document that explains how the department will implement the National Security Strategy, on Friday evening.

The U.S. Air Force carried out the bombings of three Iranian nuclear facilities last June during the Israel-Iran 12-day war. In the aftermath of the strikes, President Donald Trump and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth insisted the facilities were “totally obliterated,” while a preliminary report from the Defense Intelligence Agency concluded there was less damage than publicly indicated.

About two weeks after the bombing, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said, “We have degraded their program by one to two years at least.”

The U.S. is currently increasing its presence in the Middle East after Trump threatened to intervene militarily in Iran's crackdown on protests nationwide earlier this month. Amid an intentional internet blackout, Iran's security forces allegedly killed thousands of protesters, though tallies have not been confirmed.

The Iranian government announced earlier this week that the anti-government protests came to an end after 25 days, and state television reported that 3,117 people were killed during that time, though human rights groups have warned the death toll could be much higher.

Trump warned that “HELP IS ON ITS WAY,” but ultimately said that Iran's apparent decision to halt roughly 800 executions last week had a “big impact” on his decision not to approve military action, even though an Iranian official disputed what happened on Friday.

The U.S. dispatched an aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, to the region from the Pacific, and increased its air power as well with the deployment of a dozen F-15Es assigned to the 494th Fighter Squadron at Royal Air Force Base Lakenheath, U.K.

“We have a lot of ships going that direction just in case,” Trump said on Air Force One Thursday night, adding that “we have an armada heading that direction and maybe we won't have to use it.”

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed this week that Iran will not show the same “restraint” it showed after the U.S. strikes on their nuclear facilities, “our powerful armed forces have no qualms about firing back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack.”

After the U.S. strikes, Iranian forces launched short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles at Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest American military base in the Middle East. The U.S. was able to evacuate most of the personnel ahead of the retaliatory operation because Iran intentionally telegraphed it to ensure it wouldn't further escalate the war. No U.S. personnel were injured or killed.

The U.S. evacuated some personnel from Al Udeid earlier this month due to heightened tensions.

“President Trump has consistently made clear that Iran will not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons,” the NDS said.

WHAT ARE TRUMP'S MILITARY OPTIONS FOR IRAN?

The NDS, like the national security strategy, identified the defense of the homeland as the dominant priority, and that has been on display during the first year of the administration. Over the last year, the Department has taken on a larger role in securing the southern border and is now in the planning stages for a comprehensive air defense system. Trump named the Golden Dome, while the administration sought to acquire Greenland, arguing its location makes it essential for the air defense system.

The document also explains that the U.S. does not seek to “dominate… strangle or humiliate” China, but it wants to “prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or allies” in the region.

Even with the emphasis on diplomacy between the two military powers, the NDS acknowledged that the department has to be “clear-eyed and realistic about the speed, scale, and quality of China's historic military buildup.”

The FBI agent who initiated an investigation into a federal immigration officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good has resigned from her role at the agency, according to multiple reports.

The agent, Tracee Mergen, worked in the Minneapolis Field Office as the acting supervisor of the Public Corruption Squad. She resigned last week after FBI leadership pressured her to discontinue the investigation into the Minneapolis fatal shooting, according to The New York Times.

The FBI has been leading its own investigation into the ICE officer who shot the 37-year-old mother, in an inquiry separate from that of local, Minnesota prosecutors.

“It is FBI policy not to comment on personnel matters,” the FBI's Minneapolis field office told the Washington Examiner, in response to an inquiry about Mergen's resignation.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot Good on Jan. 7. Federal officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, have stated the officer shot Good in an act of self-defense as she drove her car towards his direction. But many Democratic and state officials have pushed back on that assertion, as Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) organized a “Day of Unity” in response to Good's killing.

The fatal shooting has lead to anti-ICE protests throughout Minnesota and the country. 

The response has also included a debate between Minnesota and federal leaders over wether or not absolute immunity applies to the ICE officer who fatally shot Good.

DOJ SAYS ‘NO BASIS' FOR CIVIL RIGHTS INVESTIGATION OF MINNEAPOLIS ICE SHOOTING

The Department of Justice announced on Jan. 14 that it would not conduct a criminal civil rights investigation into the shooting, saying there is “currently no basis” for one.

“As with any officer-involved shooting, each law enforcement agency has an internal investigation protocol, including DHS,” a DOJ official told the Washington Examiner earlier this month. “As such, ICE OPR has its own investigation underway. This runs parallel to any FBI investigation.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

EUROPEANS WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF THEY HAD LISTENED TO TRUMP. President Donald Trump is back in the United States, tending to urgent political matters, including the upcoming midterm elections. But as usual, when he travels to Europe, Trump leaves a lot of turbulence in his wake. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, many European leaders appeared to flip out over Trump's designs on Greenland. 

“I think we are past Munich now,” one unnamed European diplomat told Politico, referring to Britain's 1938 appeasement of Adolf Hitler. The diplomat continued, “We realize that appeasement is not the right policy anymore,” apparently suggesting that Europeans must stand up to Trump, who they see in the role of the new Hitler. Another European diplomat anonymously told Politico, “Our American Dream is dead. Donald Trump has murdered it.” Others, only slightly less dramatically, warned of “dark times” to come.

Trump backed down from his demand that the U.S. be allowed to buy Greenland, but that did not appear to lower the temperature among the Europeans. Indeed, some observers saw the episode as a turning point. “[Trump's] erratic bullying has forced European leaders to recognize that they need independence from unreliable America,” the Washington Post‘s David Ignatius wrote from Davos.

But Ignatius noted that the Eurocrats realized they need to do more than declare independence — they also need to “break with their own moribund economic and security policies.” Ignatius went on to explain that over the years, Europe has undermined its own security by skimping on defense spending, and then stifled its potential for economic growth by overtaxation and overregulation. Trump's rough treatment of them in Davos, Ignatius said, was a “wake-up call.”

Here's the thing. If Davos was a wake-up call for European leaders, it was a wake-up call to tell them they should have listened to Trump for the last decade. On four of the most important issues facing Europe over that period, Trump has given Europe sound advice, which the Europeans at times ignored, dismissed, or even ridiculed.

First, Trump told Europe: You're killing yourself with mass migration. Stop. Second, Trump told NATO: You've got to spend more on your own defense. Third, Trump told the European Union: You're hurting yourselves with draconian regulations. And fourth, Trump told former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others: Don't build the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. It's a terrible idea to depend on Putin's Russia for your energy.

Trump was right about each of those things. Many Europeans still refuse to recognize that. But others see some positive effect from Trump. NATO Secretary Mark Rutte credits Trump for many countries' increases in defense spending. “Would it ever have happened if President Trump had not been reelected as President 47 of the United States? Absolutely not,” Rutte told Fox News's Bret Baier on Wednesday.

Will Europe really change? The Post‘s Ignatius, a fundamentally anti-Trump article — he called Trump's Greenland play a “putsch” — still noted that Europe has to realize that it has huge problems of its own making. Will they also realize that they would be in better shape if they had followed Trump's advice — not everything Trump ever said, but his counsel on the big issues — over the last several years? That seems highly unlikely. But they would be.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

As President Donald Trump's administration doubles down on its aggressive immigration enforcement agenda, new polling data shows public approval for Immigration and Customs Enforcement has plummeted to new lows.  

The Democratic Congressional Progressive Caucus has taken advantage of the waning public support, making the “abolish ICE” movement a pillar in its 2026 legislative platform — vowing to block all Department of Homeland Security funding until meaningful reforms are enacted.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has remained a staunch defender of the agency's tactics, stating that federal agents have “been serving [their] country [their] entire life” and describing pushback from local leaders and media as “reckless behavior.”

“President Trump and I will always stand with you. Please take some time today to thank an officer or agent today,” Noem said in a news release Jan. 9, Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. “Make them a meal, buy them a cup of coffee, or simply thank them. To every officer who puts on the badge each day: thank you. Your service is paramount to our nation's safety.” 

The shift in public sentiment comes amid the massive federal immigration enforcement campaign known as “Operation Metro Surge,” which deployed approximately 2,000 federal officers to cities such as Minneapolis.

Tensions reached a boiling point following the fatal shooting of Renee Good by ICE officer Jonathan Ross after Good struck Ross with her SUV, causing internal bleeding.

The killing has sparked national protests and a fierce public clash between Minnesota leadership and the Trump administration over ICE's presence.

Recent data from the Economist and YouGov shows a hard shift in how the public views federal immigration officers. 

According to mid-January 2026 polling, 46% of respondents support abolishing ICE, a staggering increase from March 2025, when polling showed only 8% of respondents supported eliminating ICE.

As the administration moves beyond its more than 150,000 arrests, 47% of the public believes the agency is making the country less safe.

While the exact cause of the shift in public opinion is unknown, Roberto Suro, a professor of journalism and public policy at the University of Southern California, argued the backlash stems from a campaign promise by Trump that has been carried out far differently than originally pitched to voters. 

“The predominant image is of these big, burly masked men wrestling people to the ground and grabbing people out of their cars and, you know, cussing and pulling guns and looking, you know, like stormtroopers,” Suro told the Washington Examiner. “That message that, ‘We are taking dangerous people off the street' is getting drowned out by the fact that they're putting dangerous people on the street. I mean, it's just not working.”

On the campaign trail, Trump promised the “largest deportation operation in the history of our country,” specifically targeting “criminal illegal alien gang members.” 

At a December 2023 rally, he told supporters, “We have no choice (but) the largest deportation operation in American history.” 

“In 2024, his rhetoric and his campaigning, the ads … all focused relentlessly on criminal immigrants, and as would put it, the worst of the worst,” Suro said. “The most visible part of the effort, which is now the deportation campaign in the cities, was not the forefront of his campaign. It is a big deal, and people are reacting to it, and it's not what they voted for, nor is it what I think they expected.”

Trump presented a plan in 2024 to militarize the border to keep people from illegally entering the U.S., and he followed through with that. However, once ICE was deployed to metropolitan and sanctuary cities, the visuals of how agencies have conducted immigration operations have turned off viewers.  

Suro said the administration's shift from militarizing the border to deploying masked agents into metropolitan and sanctuary cities has created a “visual barrage” that is failing to resonate with voters who initially backed a crackdown on illegal immigration.

The YouGov poll found that a majority of the public now supports major changes to the agency's tactics, 73% of respondents said ICE should be required to wear uniforms when making arrests and 56% said officers should not be allowed to wear masks.

In direct challenges to the Trump administration, several Democratic-led jurisdictions have moved to ban law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing face coverings during operations. 

In September 2025, California became the first state to pass such a measure, the “No Secret Police Act,” which makes it a misdemeanor for officers to wear masks that conceal their identity. 

The Trump administration has vehemently pushed back, with the Justice Department filing a lawsuit to strike down California's law.  

Furthermore, 50% of respondents said the recent fatal ICE shooting in Minnesota was “unjustified.” 

The shooting and killing of Good in her car became a flashpoint for national debate, with the Trump administration arguing that Good used her vehicle as a “deadly weapon.” Good was allegedly impeding immigration operations by using her SUV to block the road while she and her wife taunted ICE. When officers approached her vehicle and demanded she get out so they could arrest her, she hit the gas and struck an officer, leading to a debate as to whether the shooting was justified regardless of whether she intended to hit the officer.

Critics of ICE pointed to the bystander video and said Good was trying to turn away from Ross before he fired the three shots. ICE supporters pointed to the fact that Good's wheels began spinning while they were pointed directly at Ross, before she started to turn and struck him with the SUV.

After the shooting of Good, a Siena poll said that while people approve of deportations, they do not approve of ICE, with 61% of respondents saying ICE has “gone too far.” 

Despite the optics, the Trump administration remains unrelenting in its support for the agency. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt recently described Trump as a “strong leader who keeps the American people safe,” asserting that his handling of immigration remains among his “best polling issues.”

One year into his second term, the administration continues to emphasize that it will not back down, even as the president's popularity polling has reached new lows. 

A January 2026 Economist/YouGov poll shows that only 37% of the public approves of the president's job performance, while 57% disapprove. 

Despite these numbers, Trump has remained defiant about the operations, recently stating at a White House press conference that federal agents are “dealing with rough people” and that mistakes will happen. 

Suro said Trump's continued support has a lot to do with public image, especially as a president who has continually gone after political enemies. 

“The president has sort of committed himself publicly, so loudly now that backing down would … be portrayed as giving in to his critics,” Suro said. 

The administration defends the current crackdown as a necessary response to “sanctuary” policies in liberal cities. DHS officials have accused local leaders of refusing to cooperate with federal agents and releasing hundreds of criminal illegal immigrants from local jails back into the community. 

As the legal and political challenges mount, the administration has reportedly had conversations about dialing back immigration enforcement. 

“It's the nature of American politics now that a view that is not the majority view can produce a nomination,” Suro said. “Trump knows that.” 

The nature of internal enforcement has changed significantly since the Obama and Bush eras.

Under former President Barack Obama, internal enforcement relied heavily on “detainers,” which involved cooperation with local jails to seize individuals already in custody. 

As blue cities withdrew that cooperation, the Trump administration pivoted to Metro Surge, deploying thousands of federal officers directly into residential neighborhoods. 

Suro said that once Trump shut down the border, his pivot to sending ICE into metropolitan areas led people to turn against immigration enforcement. 

“He would continue to have great support for his immigration policies, if that was the focus,” Suro said. 

Instead, the images of officers enforcing the law in the streets have sparked a resurgence of the “Abolish ICE” movement. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) recently announced that the movement is now a formal part of the Congressional Progressive Caucus platform. 

Despite this congressional opposition, the House passed a DHS funding bill on Jan. 22 that increases the ICE detention capacity without the reforms demanded by the Progressive Caucus. 

Suro said that while the majority opinion has shifted, the segment of the population that decides Republican primaries remains highly supportive of aggressive enforcement.

There is also a possible political upside for the White House if demonstrations turn violent, Suro said. During past unrest in Los Angeles, the administration successfully used images of chaos to frame their opponents as “radicals.” 

“Maybe they're thinking that they'll go into blue cities and they'll provoke a riot in which they can say, ‘Look, they're the ones who are out of hand,'” Suro suggested.

As the 2026 midterm elections loom, these aggressive visuals are increasingly used as political ammunition by left-wing politicians. 

While the administration hopes to frame the opposition as radicals and adjust immigration enforcement approaches, Democratic politicians push forward on their “Abolish ICE” mantra by saying they will not support ICE's upcoming budget approval.

Republicans can deploy the same tactic by using images of protests in Minneapolis and previous protests in Los Angeles as a strategic weapon.

By highlighting “shock and awe” tactics, such as daily tally arrests and photographs of handcuffed deportees, they aim to paint their opponents as soft on crime or weak on security. 

HOW TRUMP CAN FLIP THE SCRIPT IN THE ICE WARS

“It's an old playbook, it goes back all the way to the '60s, and the idea of protecting you from radicals is a very old trope in American politics,” Suro said. 

Ultimately, the administration is betting that the visuals of “law and order” will outweigh the data of disapproval by the time voters head to the polls for midterm elections.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Four Types of Trump Supporter","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/trump-roles-supporters-categories/685706/","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

The president's political power depends on his ability to play different roles for different parts of his coalition.

The first year of Donald Trump's second term has made two things clear. First, the MAGA coalition is not breaking up any time soon. Even after the especially chaotic events of the past few weeks, Trump supporters are sticking by their man. Second, faith in Trump's leadership is not driven by his adherence to a coherent political ideology. Trump, who, as part of his “America First” policy, once declared that he would be “getting out of the nation-building business,” has now declared that the U.S. “will run the country” of Venezuela for the foreseeable future. An administration that promised to look out for the “working man” has handed billions of tax dollars back to America's wealthiest households while stripping health care from the most vulnerable.

If ideological consistency can't explain the enduring loyalty of Trump's base, what does? A new study by More in Common, the nonprofit research organization where we work, finds that Trump's coalition is not monolithic. It consists of four groups, each with a distinct profile and perspective. Trump's political power depends on his ability to connect with these groups on different emotional and psychological grounds.

Over the course of 10 months, we surveyed more than 10,000 people who said they voted for Trump in 2024, and conducted extensive focus groups, conversations, and in-depth interviews. We then identified groups of Trump voters with similar attitudes and beliefs.

About 29 percent of 2024 Trump voters are what we call the “MAGA Hardliners.” These are the fiery core of Trump's base, mostly composed of white Gen Xers and Baby Boomers, who are animated by the belief that God is on their side in America's existential struggle between good and evil. Then there are the “Anti-Woke Conservatives” (21 percent): a more secular and affluent group of voters deeply frustrated by what they perceive as the takeover of schools, culture, and institutions by the progressive left. Another 30 percent are the “Mainline Republicans”: a more racially diverse group of middle-of-the-road conservatives who prioritize border security, a strong economy, and cultural stability. Finally, we have the “Reluctant Right” (20 percent). Members of this group, unlike the other three, are not necessarily part of Trump's base; they voted for him, but have ambivalent feelings toward him. Only half identify as Republicans, and many picked Trump because he seemed “less bad” than the alternative.

Yair Rosenberg: The biggest myth about Trump's base (and why many believe it)

Our research suggests that Trump's ability to play different roles for his coalition yields an emotional payoff that exceeds the value of philosophical or logical consistency.

The first role that Trump plays, which resonates for all four groups, is that of a “builder.” Trump's social-media rants and diatribes against “corrupt” institutions create a common misperception that his appeal centers on tearing things down. In fact, his voters see him primarily as a constructive force. When asked to choose from a set of roles that they associate with Trump, 58 percent of survey participants selected “a builder trying to fix a broken system”—the highest share of any option offered. For the Reluctant Right, this sense of construction is paired with an image of managerial competence: They are more likely than any of the other groups to describe Trump as a “businessman” or a “CEO running a company.” The perception of Trump's positive, constructive role helps explain why “hope” is the emotion that Trump supporters most commonly associate with his presidency.

Trump's second role is that of “redeemer”: someone who can restore his supporters' status and respect in a society that they feel has long looked down on them. Most Trump voters in our study believe that America's cultural institutions have been dominated by those who scorn their values and way of life. Seventy-six percent agree with the statement “The woke left has ruined American education, news, and entertainment.” Accompanying this diagnosis is a sense of disrespect from political elites and Democrats. Only a quarter of Trump voters feel respected by Americans who voted for Democrats, whereas 84 percent believe that “President Trump respects people like me.” (The important exception to this is the Reluctant Right, who feel respected by neither Trump nor Democrats.)

The third role is that of an energizing “blasphemer”—a violator of progressive norms. This identity resonates most strongly with MAGA Hardliners and Anti-Woke Conservatives, who believe that the political left has become a sanctimonious elite imposing its worldview on everyone else. About 90 percent of MAGA Hardliners and Anti-Woke Conservatives agree that the “left actually hates America.” This generates a desire not just for redemption but also for retribution. Trump presents himself as a norm-breaker who delights in poking his finger in his critics' eyes: More than three-quarters of MAGA Hardliners and more than half of Anti-Woke Conservatives believe that “President Trump should make the left pay for its mistakes and lies.” This sense of transgression fuels a gleeful energy that runs through much of Trump's public communication. As Gina, a 50-year-old white woman who lives in Florida, told us, Trump is “a gigantic orange flashing middle finger, and I love it.”

The final role—one that appeals especially to MAGA Hardliners—is what we call the “grand narrator.” Trump's appeal can be understood only in the context of a decades-long collapse of trust in American institutions including Congress, the press, academia, and the scientific establishment. MAGA Hardliners—and, to a lesser extent, Anti-Woke Conservatives—overwhelmingly view the media as dishonest and believe that the “deep state” is setting the course for the whole nation. Even with unified Republican control of the White House, Supreme Court, and Congress, a majority of both groups still distrusts the federal government. In this uncertain epistemic landscape, Trump has emerged not just as a decisive leader but as a central purveyor of truth: 93 percent of MAGA Hardliners and 72 percent of Anti-Woke Conservatives say they trust him more than “all” or “most other sources.” In other words, Trump has positioned himself as both the narrator and the hero of his own story.

David Brooks: Why do so many people think Trump is good?

Politicians typically try to appeal to voters by aligning their policies with voters' preferences. Trump satisfies deeper needs. For those despairing about our country's direction, he offers hope; for those who feel disrespected, validation; for those who feel doubtful, clarity.

Trump's political skills were forged in WWE arenas, on reality-TV sets, and in the luxury real-estate business—industries that live and die by their ability to capture attention, simplify narratives, and deliver emotional impact. These experiences taught him how to establish emotional bonds with audiences that far outweigh any connection based on shared ideology.

Trump's detractors may dismiss these bonds as empty or irrelevant. But for the people who experience them, they are very real. The relationship Trump has established with tens of millions of Americans offers them something they cannot attain through conventional politics. In his various roles, he embodies the reality that they want. This is the source of his power.

And 3 other takeaways from a conversation with the state's attorney general, Keith Ellison.

Editor's note, January 24, 12 pm ET: Federal agents shot a person in Minneapolis on Saturday morning, according to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The shooting appeared to be captured on video, which shows federal agents wrestling someone to the ground and shooting them multiple times. This story was originally published on January 24 at 8 am.

MINNEAPOLIS — President Donald Trump is not budging. On his tariffs. On his controversial deployment of federal immigration agents. On his willingness to use the Justice Department to go after his political enemies. On his war against blue cities.

In the weeks after the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, administration officials have doubled down on comments that laid blame with the victim and stonewalled local officials trying to investigate the shooting. This week, the Justice Department opened criminal investigations into several Minnesota Democrats, issuing subpoenas that allege they have impeded federal immigration priorities.

The result is a community on edge. Five years after the killing of George Floyd made Minneapolis the center of a global movement for racial justice and police reform, the eyes of the country have returned to the Twin Cities. And while the foremost question may be, “Just how far is Donald Trump willing to go?” the pressure campaign from the president has also challenged the state's Democratic elected officials, including state Attorney General Keith Ellison.

Ellison, a former Congress member and DNC vice chair, has served as attorney general since 2019 — and he's also a rumored candidate for the state's Democratic nomination for governor. In an extended interview, I asked Ellison about his future in state politics, the playbook for pushing back on Trump, whether state Democrats were slow to investigate claims of social services fraud, and whether the solution for ICE is to abolish it.

Here's what most struck me in our conversation.

Ellison stressed an important point: The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division declined to open an investigation into the ICE officer who shot and killed protester Renee Good. They didn't review evidence and decided not to pursue charges.

“Look, what happened that day has been reviewed by millions and millions of Americans because it was recorded on phones,” US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in an interview with Fox News. “The Department of Justice, our civil rights unit, we don't just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody putting his life in danger.”

Meanwhile, the FBI has seized critical evidence from the scene — bullet casings, as well as Good's car, which could show the bullet trajectory — and won't share any of it with state and local prosecutors who want to pursue the case. According to Ellison, the federal government is sitting on evidence that could help determine what happened, and they're keeping it from the people trying to get answers for Good's family.

One of the Trump administration's core arguments is that Minneapolis is a “sanctuary city” where local officials actively block ICE from doing their jobs. Ellison was adamant: that's just not true, and the distinction matters.

Minneapolis has what's called a “separation ordinance.” Ellison says that while state and local law enforcement do not block ICE from accessing jails, as some other cities do, the ordinance means that city workers are under no statutory obligation to do it. Ellison argued that going beyond that would expose the state to legal liability.

For example, ICE can collect people with immigration detainers, Ellison said. What Minnesota won't do is hold someone beyond what a court has ordered based on their criminal charges. For example, if a judge says someone charged with a DUI should be released, the state releases them. If ICE wants to pick them up for immigration violations, they're free to do so — but Minnesota isn't going to detain them on immigration charges.

Ellison compared the politics of the situation to summer 2020, when Republicans successfully branded Democrats as supportive of the activist movement to “defund the police” even when most Democratic officials never embraced that slogan.

This week on Truth Social, Trump argued that Minnesota Democrats need to be asked about documented cases of social services fraud in the Somali American community. Trump further alleged that Minnesota Democrats had not properly investigated those cases under state Democratic leadership, which was one of his pretexts for sending in federal agents.

In our interview, Ellison vehemently denied that Democrats slow-walked fraud cases among politically supportive communities. He said Trump and the White House were unjustly targeting an entire community for the criminal actions of a few. When I mentioned the “Feeding Our Future” scandal, where a Minneapolis nonprofit conspired with a Somali restaurant to take in more than $200 million in federal money, the attorney general was indignant.

“This ICE surge is about fraud, but [Trump] is sending armed men with guns, wearing masks,” Ellison said. “He's not sending accountants. He's not sending forensic financial investigators. He's sending aggressive men with guns. So you gotta get the impression that we're not really talking about fraud.”

Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act is to be taken seriously. Ellison said he and other state officials have been war-gaming responses since early 2024, preparing legal challenges to what would be an extraordinary assertion of federal power.

Ellison also laid out just exactly what the Insurrection Act would mean in Minneapolis: active-duty federal troops patrolling the streets of an American city, ostensibly to support ICE operations.

Ellison argued Trump is living out his campaign promise for retribution against political enemies. “I am your retribution” isn't just a campaign slogan — it's a governing philosophy. And Minnesota, with its large Somali population, its progressive politics, its history of protest after George Floyd, makes the perfect target to send a message about what happens when you resist this administration.

The president's retreat, explained.

And just like, the Greenland crisis seems to have been defused.

It was a crisis of President Donald Trump's own making. After broaching the idea of the United States taking Greenland a year ago, Trump ramped up his rhetoric in recent weeks, culminating with the threat of tariffs against Europe and the specter of military action and the dissolution of NATO if the US didn't get what it wanted.

But this week, after speaking before world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump announced that he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte had reached a framework of a deal over Greenland's future — one that did not include US ownership of the island.

The announcement was widely seen as a comedown for Trump. So why did he back down?

To answer the question, Today, Explained co-host Noel King spoke with Henry Farrell, a professor of international affairs at Johns Hopkins University. Farrell recently wrote an op-ed for the New York Times titled “Europe Has a Bazooka. Time to Use It.” In the piece, he argues that Europe had been too timid in pushing back against Trump's threats, and that it needed a more forceful posture, one grounded in “deterrence theory.” According to reports, that's what Europe's leaders showed at Davos this week — and it may well explain Trump's retreat on Greenland.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

It's been roughly 80 years since the last World War, which means we've been doing something right, all of us. How do big powers deter attacks from other big powers?

So I think that you really want to start with the nuclear age and the nuclear era, and you even want to start with the Cuban Missile Crisis, which was a moment when the United States and the USSR scared the hell out of each other because it was very close to a situation in which we would've actually had a nuclear war and possibly the extinction of humanity.

So after that, we began to see the development of a set of concepts, a set of ideas, which really tried to figure out, how can you work through the situation of nuclear crisis, the risk of nuclear armageddon, the fact the United States and the USSR have fundamentally different political interests, and how can you actually get to a place of stability?

So you begin to get the development of all of these ideas by people such as Thomas Shelling, who won a Nobel Prize for economics. He's a game theorist who begins to work out, how do you deter? How do you in a sense use the fact that you have nuclear weapons as something that people will pay attention to without ever actually having to use them.

You want to make it so that you don't have to use a nuclear weapon. How?

The key example, which I think shows some of the brutality in a certain sense of this way of thinking that Shelling offers, is troops in West Berlin during the Cold War. The idea behind this was that, as Schelling describes these people, these soldiers, their job in a certain sense was to, as he said it bluntly, their job is to die.

And so what the calculus is, is that if you have these soldiers there, these soldiers are in a sense not going to be able to defend the city particularly well, but they will die or be captured if the city is in fact attacked by the Soviet Union. If that happens, then any president is not going to want to be able to stand over the fact that thousands of troops have been captured and killed.

This is likely to lead to further escalation, and Shelling's argument is that this risk of further escalation and the possibility, maybe a 10 percent possibility, that this might actually lead to nuclear war, is sufficient to deter the Soviet Union from attacking.

Nobody is threatening anybody with a nuclear weapon, but Donald Trump is making some statements that very clearly make Europe very nervous. Where do we see deterrence theory operating now, today?

First of all, we see these eight European countries who send a small military force for a brief period of exercises to Greenland. What they're doing here is they're setting up a trip wire, which is like a less powerful version of what the United States did with West Berlin. So really what they're doing here is they are saying effectively to Trump that if Trump actually goes ahead and invades Greenland, that there are going to be eight other NATO allies who are willing to be on Greenland's and Denmark's side if this happens.

That is one of the reasons plausibly why Trump goes from these saber-rattling threats where he suggests that he is indeed going to invade Greenland, [then] moves instead to economic measures of one sort or another. In particular, these tariffs. He imposes tariffs against these eight European countries in order to punish them for what they do.

And then that leaves a second set of questions for Europe, which is, how do they respond to that? And they have this very weird, very complicated, very awkward legislative mechanism called the anti-coercion instrument, which possibly serves as a very imperfect trip wire. And that is more or less where the argument goes.

How does that serve as an economic trip wire? 

This is a legal instrument that the European Union brought into being, which allows them to retaliate in a wide variety of ways. It's one of these very vague seeming instruments, which allows the EU legally to retaliate against economic coercion by, for example, blocking investments by taking away intellectual property, by imposing import or export restrictions. It's very, very open-ended.

It sounds like the European Union did not have to use the economic bazooka but Trump backed down anyway. Why? 

[There's] some interesting clues as to what is happening, which come from some of the statements of the people who were at Davos representing Trump before he got there. Over a period of two days, [there's] a huge difference in the ways that they're talking about the problem.

So it begins with [Treasury Secretary Scott] Bessent being quite insulting to Europe, more or less saying, “Well, yeah, so they're just going to mount some kind of a committee of inquiry or words that affect sort of, let's see how far that gets.” In other words, completely dismissing the possibility that Europe can do anything which is effective. And then a few hours later, he is saying that Europeans really shouldn't escalate. We really don't want you to escalate; please don't escalate, don't escalate, don't escalate, don't escalate.

And so that suggests that he has been having conversations in between the first statement and the second where clearly there has been some real sense that there is a coalition which is engaging against this measure, and that coalition is sufficiently credible that the United States has something to worry about.

So it really does look like a climbdown disguised as a declaration of enormous victory. The fact that this is happening through Rutte and through NATO rather than, for example, through direct negotiations with Denmark, suggests that what is going to happen is that we're going to get some kind of agreement on security in the Arctic region, which everybody is more or less on the same page on and Trump will declare this a glorious victory over Greenland and then move on.

﻿Trump's paramilitary forces just shot and killed another person in Minneapolis.

The video of the latest killing in Minneapolis is truly horrific. In it, about half a dozen men in military garb, who appear to be federal immigration officers sent to Minnesota by President Donald Trump, wrestle a man to the ground and repeatedly strike him. Then one of the officers appears to fire multiple shots into the man. The shots continue, even after the target is lying motionless on the ground.

According to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara, the man, who has yet to be identified, is dead.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Any arrests or prosecutions that arise out of this killing will have to await a police investigation. The video does not show what happened before this man's killers started wrestling with him, so it is not yet clear if he was engaged in criminal or even violent activity before the altercation began. But the limited evidence available right now appears incredibly damning. Even if there is some legal argument that could justify the first shot fired, it's hard to imagine one for continuing to fire multiple shots into a man lying on the ground.

But it is also exceedingly unlikely that the Trump administration will conduct a real investigation into this killing. After federal officers shot and killed Renee Good earlier this month, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche reportedly did not just shut down an investigation into her killer, he also ordered federal officials to conduct a criminal investigation into Good.

But the federal government isn't the only sovereign entity in Minneapolis, and state officials are understandably livid about the second killing by Trump's paramilitary forces in just a few weeks. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) called for Trump to “Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.” State prosecutors could also attempt to bring charges against the officers responsible for the two killings.

The Supreme Court's Republican majority has made it very difficult for private citizens to sue federal law enforcement officers who break the law. But can a federal officer actually be charged with, and convicted of, violating a state criminal law?

Until fairly recently, the law was favorable to federal officials who allegedly violate state criminal laws while they carry out their official duties. The seminal case, known as In re Neagle (1890), held that a deputy US marshal who shot and killed a man could not be charged with murder in state court, because this federal officer did so while acting as a bodyguard for a US Supreme Court justice.

Last June, however, the Supreme Court handed down Martin v. United States (2025), which held that Neagle does not always protect federal officials who violate state law. The rule announced in Martin is vague, so it is unclear how it would apply to the shooting in Minneapolis. But the gist of the ruling is that a federal officer is only protected if they can demonstrate that “their actions, though criminal under state law, were ‘necessary and proper' in the discharge of their federal responsibilities.”

If the officers responsible for the Minneapolis killings broke Minnesota law, in other words, any prosecution against them would turn on whether the courts decide shooting this woman was a “necessary and proper” exercise of the officer's official duties.

There is one other potential complication. A federal law provides that state criminal charges against “any officer (or any person acting under that officer) of the United States or any agency thereof” may be removed from state court and heard by a federal judge. This statute does not prevent state prosecutors from bringing charges or from prosecuting a case. But it does ensure that the question of whether Neagle applies to this case would be decided by federal courts that are increasingly dominated by conservative Republicans.

Federal cases out of Minnesota appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, a very conservative court where 10 of the 11 active judges were appointed by Republicans. And, of course, any decision by the Eighth Circuit might be appealed to the Supreme Court, where Republicans control six of the nine seats.

All of which is a long way of saying that, while the law does not absolutely preclude Minnesota prosecutors from filing charges against these officers, it is far from clear that those charges will stick.

The facts underlying the Neagle case are simply wild. David Terry was a lawyer and former chief justice of the state of California, who had served with Supreme Court Justice Stephen Field while the two were both state supreme court justices. At the time, federal justices were required to “ride circuit” and hear cases outside of Washington, DC. And so, Field wound up hearing a dispute about whether Terry's wife was entitled to a share of a US senator's fortune.

At the court proceeding, where Field ruled against Terry's wife, Terry punched a US marshal, brandished a Bowie knife, and was jailed for contempt of court. After his release, he and his wife continued to threaten Field's life, and so, the attorney general ordered Deputy Marshal David Neagle to act as Field's bodyguard.

Then, Terry attacked Field while Field was traveling through California by train, and Neagle shot and killed Terry.

Given these facts, it's unsurprising that the Supreme Court ruled that California could not bring charges against Neagle for this killing. The case involved a physical attack on a sitting justice! And, besides, Neagle acted within the scope of his responsibilities as Field's federally appointed bodyguard.

135 years later, however, the Court decided Martin. That more recent decision focused on language in the Neagle opinion that suggested that its scope may be limited. Neagle, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in Martin, arose from concerns that “California could frustrate federal law by prosecuting a federal marshal “for an act which he was authorized to do by the law of the United States.” Protecting Field was something that “it was [Neagle's] duty to do.” And, in shooting Terry, Neagle “did no more than what was necessary and proper.”

Thus, Gorsuch extracted a rule from Neagle that federal officials are only protected from state law when their actions “were ‘necessary and proper' in the discharge of their federal responsibilities.”

In the wake of Martin, Minnesota may very well be able to prosecute the officers responsible for the Minnesota killings. As a general rule, federal law enforcement officers are not authorized by the law of the United States to shoot people without justification. So, if it turns out that this killing was legally unjustified, federal courts may conclude that the officer's actions were not necessary and proper in the discharge of his official duties.

That said, Martin is a fairly new opinion, and the rule it announced is vague. And any prosecution against a federal immigration officer would be unavoidably political. So, it is unclear whether the judges who hear this case would approach it as fair and impartial jurists or as partisans.

The bottom line, in other words, is that the law governing when federal officers may be charged with state crimes is quite unclear. So, it is uncertain whether a prosecution against these particular federal officers would succeed — even assuming that a state prosecutor could convince a jury to convict.

Tesla appears to be getting closer to deploying Optimus in its factories — and Austin is the next training ground.

Tesla told workers during a town hall last week that it plans to begin collecting data to train its humanoid robot at its Austin Gigafactory, insiders told Business Insider.

The company is looking to train Optimus how to operate in the Texas facility, it said, adding that it was targeting a February start date.

Tesla has been collecting data and training Optimus prototypes in its Fremont, California, factory for more than a year.

The Optimus data collectors in Fremont are typically kept separate from the general factory workers to avoid interfering with output, people with knowledge of the program said.

There, data collectors have recorded themselves organizing vehicle parts and working on conveyor belts, Business Insider previously reported. The videos are then used to teach Optimus how to mimic the same movements.

CEO Elon Musk said during an interview at Davos on Thursday that Tesla has the humanoid robot doing ""simple tasks"" in its factory, though he didn't specify which.

""By the end of this year I think they'll be doing more complex tasks but still deployed in an industrial environment,"" he said. ""By the end of next year I think we'll be selling humanoid robots to the public.""

He warned earlier this week in a post on X that production of Optimus — and the company's Cybercab, which will be produced in Austin — will be ""agonizingly slow.""

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Tesla has been sharing sneak peeks of Optimus' capabilities since the product was first announced in 2021. In 2024, the automaker posted a video that showed the robot arranging batteries while tied to an overhead support structure at the company's lab in Palo Alto. The company said that it deployed two autonomous Optimus robots in one of its factories in 2024.

Tesla employs several dozen Optimus trainers. The company's factory workers, who number in the thousands, could be an ideal group to help train the robot due to their expertise and workforce size.

Last year, Tesla moved from primarily training the robot using teleoperation to collecting video data — a strategy that could help the carmaker rapidly collect larger amounts of data without the constraints of motion capture suits, Business Insider previously reported.

Tesla's Optimus trainers are outfitted with large helmets with cameras that point in several directions. The helmet is attached to a heavy backpack, which can be unwieldy at times. Tesla has experimented with a lighter fanny pack setup, but it's unclear if the company plans to use it in factory data collection, people with knowledge of the program said.

Musk has pitched Optimus as the ""biggest product of all time."" He's said the humanoid robot could be the solution to everything from housework and factory work to operating data centers in outer space.

The town hall also covered non-Optimus developments. The company is working on updating several production lines and construction will continue to be ongoing at the factory.

Over the past year, the carmaker has repeatedly slashed production hours for its Cybertruck line and moved workers to the Model Y line amid lackluster sales numbers for the electric pickup truck.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday called on President Donald Trump to end sweeping Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the state after what officials and witnesses described as a second fatal shooting this month by federal agents in Minneapolis.

""I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning,"" Walz wrote in a post on X. ""Minnesota has had it. This is sickening. The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.""

The governor's comments came after The Minnesota Star Tribune reported that a man was shot and killed by federal agents, citing Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara. Multiple sources with knowledge of the incident said the man was shot several times during an encounter with federal agents in south Minneapolis, according to the Tribune.

A video circulating online, captured outside Glam Doll Donuts, shows agents wrestling a man to the ground before gunshots ring out, investigators told the Tribune.

Minneapolis officials urged the public to avoid the area and remain calm as local law enforcement and state patrol units arrived to separate protesters from the ICE personnel, the Tribune reported.

The latest shooting adds to a tense standoff between Minnesota authorities and federal immigration agents that has persisted for weeks. Earlier this month, an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident, during an enforcement action, which triggered widespread protests and accelerated political backlash against the federal operation.

Elon Musk's pay package of up to $1 trillion highlights the continued escalation in CEO compensation, even as worker pay slows and rewards to shareholders remain mixed, according to several studies.  

Already, Musk is the richest person on the planet with a net worth that tops $660 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk saw his 2018 Tesla pay package -- now valued at over $130 billion -- reinstated in December, and his company SpaceX looks set to for a potential public offering in 2026. Those two events could well put Musk on his way to becoming the world's first trillionaire this year. In addition, his new pay package, valued at up to $1 trillion, could also start paying out over the next decade.

While Musk may be an outlier, his stock-fueled gains highlight the booming compensation and wealth gains of CEOs in recent decades that has been driven by rising stock markets and a broader adoption of stock-centric pay packages 

Over the past 50 years, top CEO compensation has climbed 1,094%, according to the Economic Policy Institute. That compares to a 26% increase in typical worker compensation. 

Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEO's was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% from 2023, according to Equilar, a corporate analytics firm. CEOs now make 192 times more than the average employee, up from a 186 to 1 ratio in 2023. 

Driving the acceleration in CEO pay is a shift in the types of stock awards used to incentivize and reward corporate chiefs. 

CEO compensation typically includes four categories: salaries, long-term incentives, short-term incentives and perks. Long-term and short-term incentives are largely stock awards, and make up far and away the largest portion of CEO compensation. Stock awards accounted for 72% of CEO pay packages in 2024, with the median value increasing 15% that year, according to Equilar. 

Musk's trillion-dollar pay package, for instance, doesn't include any salary. The potential value of the $1 trillion would come entirely from stock awards pegged to various targets. For Musk to get the full payout, Tesla must hit key milestones, including certain market capitalization and operational achievements. He could still earn billions in stock even if Tesla doesn't meet all the targets.

""Milestone achievements built into CEO pay packages could be the norm in the future,"" said Amit Batish, senior director marketing at Equilar.

Company boards and CEOs themselves say that because their pay is tied closely to stock performance, their compensation reflects the larger wealth created for shareholders. The CEO only does well if shareholders do well, they argue. If stocks plummet, CEO's can also see big pay drops. 

Others others argue that CEO's have only a partial impact on their companies' share price. A 2021 MSCI study of top executive pay between 2006 and 2020 found a weak correlation between higher CEO pay and company performance. 

""This notion that the guy in the corner office is somehow almost single handedly responsible for company value, and everyone else is just little minions who don't contribute much of anything ... everyone can see that is not true,"" said Sarah Anderson, at the Institute for Policy Studies. 

According to the 2021 MSCI study, average performing CEO's took home only 4% less in realized pay than top-performing CEOs. More importantly, CEO's with the lowest awarded pay saw the strongest returns for shareholders.

""When we measured pay and performance against CEO tenure, we found little evidence that high CEO pay achieved this lofty goal of CEO incentivization,"" according to MSCI, an investment research firm.

Since the 1990s, company boards have shifted away from stock options, which incentivize short-term performance, with stock awards, which boards argue are driven by longer-term incentives. Shareholders of publicly traded companies can now vote in an advisory capacity on CEO pay, known as ""say on pay"" votes, but company boards have final say when it comes to compensation packages.

While restraining CEO pay has proven ineffective, given the natural ""ratcheting up"" of median CEO pay by board compensation committees, some economists advocate more stock awards for employees to help close the gap between employees and CEOs. 

Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs, for instance, are qualified retirement plans that give employees shares in the company through a trust. Employees who can partake in ESOPs tend to end up with better financial security, said Loren Rodgers, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership. That in turn benefits their companies, he said. 

""Employee-owned businesses are more productive,"" Rodgers said. ""They're more able to recruit people. People quit at lower rates. They're more competitive.""

program, U.S. judge rules","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/24/us-judge-trump-admin-unlawfully-suspended-ev-charger-program.html","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 08:40:51 GMT","



A federal judge on Friday ruled President Donald Trump's administration unlawfully suspended funding awarded to support the expansion of electric vehicle charger infrastructure, in a victory for 20Democratic-led states that sued over the action.

U.S. District Judge Tana Lin in Seattle ruled in favor of 20 states as well as the District of Columbia, which had filed their lawsuit after the U.S. Department of Transportation in February suspended an EV charger infrastructure program enacted by Congress in 2021 under Democratic President Joe Biden.

Lin, a Biden appointee, said the DOT and the Federal Highway Administration ""yanked the NEVI Formula Program's cord out of the outlet,"" without working within the statutory confines of established administrative law as required.

Environmental groups including the Sierra Club hailed the ruling, saying it ensures states can move forward with building infrastructure funded by the law. Lin's order permanently bars the Transportation Department from taking away the states' funds or canceling their previously approved implementation plans.

""Judge Lin's order is a resounding win for the rule of law and for smart investment in our clean energy future,"" Mike Faulk, a spokesperson for Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown, said in a statement.

The Transportation Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shortly after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took office in February, the DOT suspended the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, which was part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that Biden signed into law in 2021.

The Trump administration has pursued a number of policies to boost the sale of gas-powered vehicles and cut EV incentives for automakers and consumers.

States led by California, Colorado and Washington sued in May, alleging the Trump administration was wrongly withholding billions of dollars they were previously awarded.

The administration argued it was but a temporary pause, which it later ended after the judge earlier issued a preliminary injunction and the agency issued new guidance.

But Lin said the 2021 law never contemplated even temporary pauses in funding for the construction of EV infrastructure.

""In short, Defendants defied the will of Congress by withholding funds in a manner not contemplated by the IIJA,"" she wrote.

The U.S. Senate is slated next week to consider legislation that has already cleared the U.S. House of Representatives that would redirect $879 million in funds approved under Biden for the EV charging network to other infrastructure priorities.

Over the last few years, Emma Kobil, a trauma counselor in Denver, started noticing a new topic coming up with her patients: artificial intelligence. 

""I've had clients lose their jobs due to AI, and it's something we've processed in our sessions,"" Kobil said. Often, they express ""shock, disbelief and fear about navigating a changing career landscape where their skills are no longer needed,"" she said. 

Other therapists said the technology is also vexing their patients. 

""What I hear most often is a fear of becoming obsolete,"" said Harvey Lieberman, a clinical psychologist in New York. ""People start questioning their judgment, their choices or their future."" 

More than a third — or 38% — of workers said they worry AI will make some or all of their job duties outdated in the future, according to a July 2025 survey by the American Psychological Association. 

These fears are not unfounded, said Rhiannon Batchelder, a career coach based in Denver. 

""Some employees are being asked to create pitches for how AI can take over portions of their job,"" Batchelder said. ""Among news of mass layoffs while CEO pay continues to rise, being replaced by technology just feels like another reason to lose hope in the possibility of a stable, fulfilling career."" 

AI was a major factor leading to nearly 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to December data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Overall, around 1.2 million jobs were cut in the year. 

Meanwhile, a recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology study found that AI can already replace around 11% of the U.S. labor market. 

Salesforce's CEO, Marc Benioff, said 4,000 customer support workers had been let go because artificial intelligence was already doing 50% of the work at the company. Other companies that pointed to AI in recent restructuring moves were tech consultancy firm Accenture and airline group Lufthansa. 

""People don't know where they fit into this new society,"" said Riana Elyse Anderson, a licensed clinical psychologist and associate professor at Columbia University. ""We probably don't even know the full extent of how psychologically damaging this type of replacement is."" 

Here's what therapists have to say about workers' artificial intelligence anxiety, and what they may be able to do to feel better. 

Losing your job to AI can trigger a host of existential questions, said Ben Yalom, a San Diego-based psychotherapist. 

""It may feel as if the universe is saying, 'You are no longer needed,' which may feel much more profound and disturbing than 'Our company is downsizing,' or even 'You are not doing a great job,'"" Yalom said. ""It goes deeply into questions of personal value, which is all very unsettling."" 

Underneath these feelings is usually ""a younger part that's terrified of being left behind or not being 'enough,' and that fear gets amplified because the technology itself feels so fast and out of our control,"" Kobil said. 

People can suffer even more when it's unclear whether or not a layoff was due to AI, Lieberman said. 

""They are left in a gray zone that magnifies anxiety and self-doubt,"" Lieberman said. 

Workers who know or think they lost their jobs to AI — or are grappling with the changes brought on by the technology — should first ""feel the loss,"" Kobil said. 

""Our society is changing quickly,"" Kobil said. ""Allow yourself to grieve and comfort the parts of you that feel shocked, hopeless and afraid right now."" 

For decades, studying computer science and learning to code was ""your ticket to success,"" for a ""long, thriving career,"" Anderson said. That may no longer be the case. 

But the disruptive and uncertain moment can also be a chance for reflection, Anderson said. As an exercise, she recommends pausing any quest to pin down what will lead to a stable, lucrative career, ""because that might not be totally known now."" Instead, she said, ask yourself: What do you want to do? 

""Do some inventory,"" Anderson said. ""Maybe at this time, take stock of who you are."" Some people may decide to return to school or make a career change, she added. 

As you ask yourself deeper questions about what you want, try to create some distance between you and your work, Kobil said. 

""We all experience huge change,"" Kobil said. ""We all lose our young bodies, for example, but we are not our bodies, just like we are not our ability to write code or manage others. You are so much more than your work."" 

While the growing role of AI in the workplace can feel overwhelming, ""retreating into avoidance or despair tends to narrow options rather than protect them,"" Lieberman said. 

""Learning enough about AI to understand where it genuinely alters work, and where it does not, often restores a sense of agency,"" he said. 

There are plenty of ways to start learning about the technology, including certificate programs and free opportunities, Batchelder said. 

""For most workers, understanding the basics of AI will be an asset, especially as we wait to see how the technology advances,"" she said. ""During times of uncertainty, information is always powerful.""

President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that the U.S. would impose 100% tariff on goods sold in the U.S. if the country strikes a trade deal with China.

""If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,"" the president wrote in a Truth Social post.

Trump also suggested Saturday that China would try to use Canada to try to avoid paying U.S. tariffs. 

""If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,"" Trump stated.

Earlier this month, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada and China reached a preliminary deal to remove trade barriers and lower tariffs. Under the tentative agreement, Beijing cut tariffs on some Canadian agricultural products, while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles, applying the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. 

Just a week ago, Trump had voiced his support for Carney on the China trade deal.

""That's what he should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 16.

The White House and the office of the Canadian prime minister didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

In August 2025, Trump raised the tariff on Canadian goods to 35%. Duties aren't imposed on most Canadian exports under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), but some goods, including steel, copper and certain autos and auto parts, are subject to U.S. tariffs. 

The new tariff threat comes one day after Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his ""Board of Peace"" after Carney's address at the World Economic Forum in Davos that cautioned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.

In his speech, Carney said the world's ""middle powers"" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers.

Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but the details hadn't been worked out. States seeking a permanent board seat would have to pay a $1 billion fee.

In this article

Meta's deprioritizing virtual reality in favor of artificial intelligence and Internet-connected smart glasses has chilled the industry, leading to concerns about its future. 

""I can see how it feels like a VR winter,"" said Jessica Young, an independent VR content creator specializing in Horizon Worlds, Meta's virtual social network. 

The social media giant last week laid off 10% of employees who work within its Reality Labs unit, with the cuts centering on VR-related initiatives like the Quest VR headsets, CNBC reported. Teams working on  Horizon Worlds were hit hard and some in-house studios were shuttered. Approximately 1,000 jobs were cut, CNBC reported. 

The move was part of the company's effort to redirect Reality Labs investments from VR to AI and wearable devices like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses that are co-produced with EssilorLuxottica, a spokesperson for the social media company said in a statement last week. Meta declined to comment further beyond its previous statement.

Meta's reduced investment in VR is notable considering how much the company has helped grow the industry since its $2 billion acquisition of Oculus in 2014. The company became synonymous with VR when CEO Mark Zuckerberg changed its name from Facebook to Meta, representing the founder's obsession with a future of digital worlds referred to as the metaverse. Since late 2020, Meta's Reality Labs division has logged over $70 billion in cumulative losses.

Zuckerberg's sudden reversal has some VR developers worried about their future prospects. While they said they don't see Meta killing its VR efforts, a major shift appears to be underway. 

Meta traditionally announces new Quest VR headsets during its annual Connect conference in the fall, but in 2025, the company skimped on VR hardware. Instead, Meta introduced its $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses that contain a single, built-in digital screen. 

""If Meta's not putting out a new headset for another year or two, it's going to feel stale,"" Young said. ""It already kind of does.""

Since the layoffs, Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth has been vocal that the social media giant is not abandoning VR.

""We're still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we hoped,"" Bosworth told tech newsletter Sources. ""And so you want to make sure that your investment is right-sized.""

Bosworth this week also circulated a post by Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey, who on Sunday wrote on X that Meta still employs the ""largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude."" 

Although Luckey said that he feels ""really bad for the people impacted"" by the layoffs, the Reality Labs changes represent ""a good thing thing for the long-term health of the industry, especially the ongoing incentives.""

Market research firm IDC said in a December report that a major transition is occurring in the so-called Extended Reality, or XR, device segment. This category includes VR and so-called mixed-reality headsets that allow users to switch between virtual environments and see their surroundings outside the helmet. The category also counts AI-powered smart glasses and more powerful versions with digital displays.

IDC projects the XR device category to have grown 41.6% year-over-year to 14.5 million units shipped for 2025. But that growth has nothing to do with VR and mixed-reality headsets — those shipments are expected to drop 42.8% to 3.9 million in 2025. The rest of this XR category, which includes AI glasses with and without displays, is projected to grow 211.2% year-over-year to 10.6 million units shipped for 2025.

Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager for market analyst firm IDC, characterized the VR headset market as niche and appealing to only a small segment of video gamers. Average consumers seem uninterested in wearing ""big, bulky headsets"" for lengthy VR sessions like much of the tech industry hoped for roughly a decade ago, he said.

""The market has spoken,"" Ubrani said. ""There are certain niche audiences that will continue to use these headsets, but it's not going to be broadly appealing.""

Andrew Eiche, the CEO of the Google-owned VR gaming studio Owlchemy Labs, said it was always misguided to think VR was on the cusp of having its breakthrough smartphone moment. He called it a ""strategic mistake"" to compare VR headsets to iPhones 

The VR market, Eiche said, more closely resembles old-school Atari video game consoles that were popular before sales crashed during an infamous 1983 gaming market meltdown. It wasn't until the late 1980s that Nintendo consoles helped revive the market, laying the groundwork for the overall industry to balloon to the massive sector it is today.

""Lot of tech people thought [VR] was going to be instantly amazing, and the same thing's happening with AI,"" Eiche said about the tech industry's pivot to the latest craze. ""When you're looking at long-term technologies, VR is not going anywhere.""

Still, Eiche said that beyond Meta's layoffs, other VR studios have also recently downsized as part of a broader video game industry slump. Because Quest is the dominant VR headset on the market, its app store is a key distribution channel for third-party VR.

Making matters worse, Eiche said that Meta's Horizon Worlds push came at the expense of third-party developers who were trying to find visibility among Quest users.

""We're at the mercy of Meta,"" Eiche said, adding that it ""creates a situation where if Meta pulls back, we all pull back."" 

Eiche said he's optimistic that the upcoming Steam Frame wireless VR headset from gaming company Valve will help the market, as well as the recent entries of other devices like the Samsung Galaxy XR, which debuted in October, and Apple's Vision Pro. 

But Apple's entry into the VR space in February 2024 hasn't done much to move the needle, and in January, IDC said that Apple's Chinese manufacturing partner Luxshare stopped producing new Vision Pro headsets, signaling a lack of widespread consumer demand. Still, Ubrani said that Apple's $3,499 spatial computing headset has found some footing as a business tool.

""Apple did do well in selling to a lot of developers, but they also sold into some very big companies,"" Ubrani said.

""There were certain quarters where Apple beat Meta in enterprise,"" Ubrani said, due in part to the iPhone-maker's experience selling devices to businesses. 

The enterprise VR market may not be as glamorous as its consumer counterpart, but it represents an area where IDC has ""seen slow but upwards movement, because companies are realizing that there is great ROI attached with deploying these headsets.""

As part of Meta's Reality Labs cuts, the company said in a support page that it would end its Horizon managed services program that was for businesses that used Quest headsets for internal tasks like virtual employee trainings.

Meta failed to realize ""how big VR could be if they adopted the bigger picture outside of gaming,"" said Sean Mann, CEO of the startup RP1, which develops a ""metaverse browser"" for people to access virtual and augmented reality environments. 

As Meta downsizes its VR ambitions and steers Horizon Worlds to be a mobile-focused online gaming platform like Roblox, Young said she plans to keep creating experiences on the platform. 

Young has been able to make a living by getting paid by other Horizon developers to create trailers to promote experiences available to users on the service. She's also earned money from Meta by winning Horizon-related competitions intended to help improve the overall platform.

But Young said she's less enthusiastic about Horizon's mobile push, because there was something special about the platform during its earlier, VR-centric years, particularly during the Covid era. 

""Horizon became a lifeline for people isolated by the pandemic, disability, age or geography,"" she said. ""Many users who never imagined themselves as creators, who had no background in art or programming, were inspired by their friends to try.""

But Horizon lost is way, and ""what's frustrating now is watching people declare it dead without ever having experienced or understanding what it was,"" Young said.

Moving between panels, hotel lobbies, and meetings this week, it often felt like two conferences were happening in the same snowy Swiss village.

In one Davos, the mood was strikingly optimistic. Executives and investors spoke about artificial intelligence moving from hype to production, terms like ""world models"" and ""physical AI"" were being thrown around, with discussions about the enormous pools of capital ready to back it.

In the other, a number of conversations seemed to end up back at tariffs, Greenland, geopolitical tensions, and a growing sense that the global rules investors have relied on for decades are shifting in real time.

Both worlds overlapped constantly. Often, in the same conversation.

""What Davos highlighted this year is not a crisis of innovation, but a crisis of coherence and loss of trust,"" Chavalit Frederick Tsao, chairman of Singapore-based family-run trading business Tsao Pao Chee, said on the sidelines. ""Technology is advancing faster than our collective wisdom.""

That tension between swift innovation and political uncertainty defined much of the week.

On Wednesday, thousands queued for more than an hour to hear U.S. President Donald Trump's address at the Congress Hall. I stood in line for 90 minutes. Inside, the atmosphere felt more like a concert than a policy forum.

Trump's speech swung between humor, provocation, and unpredictability. But when he turned to Greenland — insisting the U.S. needed to acquire the Arctic island — the mood in the room changed.

People who laughed moments before turned quiet. Some shook their heads; others exchanged uneasy glances.

In the next few hours, Greenland and tariffs dominated conversations and seemed to have moved on from AI infrastructure and energy investments to trade leverage and political risk.

The very next day, Elon Musk returned to Davos after years away from the forum.

In a packed session, Tesla's CEO outlined an ambitious vision for robotaxis, humanoid robots, and AI development. He said Tesla's driverless robotaxis would be ""very, very widespread"" in the U.S. by the end of 2026. He also predicted AI could surpass human intelligence as soon as this year.

For many attendees, it reset the mood. Afterward, conversations moved to data centers, battery storage, computing power, and how cities and grids will cope with the expected surge in demand for energy.

The contrast with the day before was stark.

One day, Davos was trying to understand the geopolitical implications of Trump's speech. Next, it was back to talking about the technological future at full speed.

That whiplash kept showing up in interviews throughout the week.

Waleed Al Mokarrab Al Muhairi, deputy CEO of Abu Dhabi-based investment giant Mubadala, told CNBC's Dan Murphy the investment stance into 2026 could be summed up in two words: ""conviction driven.""

""So it's not chaotic, but the world is becoming more fragmented, without a doubt,"" he said.

""That will come with its own opportunity, but pitfalls as well … As long as you can deploy capital in a methodical, strategic, conviction-driven sort of manner, then I think you're going to be ahead of the pack""

Meanwhile, Joe Kaeser, chair of Siemens Energy, framed AI as an industrial opportunity rather than a race for consumers.

""There is no such continent in the world which has as much data on industrialization, mechanization, and automation as Europe,"" he told CNBC. 

""Combine that with computing power, and Europe has the best options to define where the physical and the virtual come together.""

Kaeser said leaders were still waiting to see whether policy announcements would translate into action.

""The jury is still out on whether things will be executed as announced,"" he said. ""But if one of the very important players is not willing to play, it's bad for everybody.""

For finance ministers and other policymakers, much of the Davos message this year was about reassurance.

Enoch Godongwana, South Africa's finance minister, highlighted recent credit upgrades, his country's removal from the U.S. Financial Action Task Force's gray list, and political stability, before the conversation turned to managing ties with Washington and trade talks.

""The number one risk for South Africa's economy is the geopolitical situation,"" he told CNBC. ""It is difficult to predict, and we don't know its implications.""

Saudi Arabia's finance minister, Mohammed Al-Jadaan, returned repeatedly to the need for dialogue.

""What businesses need is certainty,"" he said, adding that disputes should be resolved through dialogue.

By week's end, a clear pattern appeared.

Panels on AI, the energy transition, and industrial reinvention were packed. Private discussions focused on expansion, deployment, and long-term prospects.

But in less busy moments — over coffee, in corridors, on shuttles — the talk returned to Greenland, tariffs, and how swiftly policy could alter the investment calculus.

One Davos focused on the tech frontier and what AI could unlock. The other focused on navigating geopolitical uncertainty and preserving the conditions that enable that progress.

Both unfolded at the same time, in the same village, often in the same conversation.

In this article

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)

Just a few weeks after Greg Abel formally became the new CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the company is apparently preparing to sell some or all of the Kraft Heinz shares it acquired in Warren Buffett's 2015 merger deal that has turned out to be a disappointment.

An SEC filing after Tuesday's closing bell by Kraft Heinz says Berkshire, by far its largest shareholder with a 27.5% stake currently worth $7.5 billion, may sell ""up to"" almost all its shares.

The filing doesn't necessarily mean Berkshire will sell, and it doesn't mean all the shares would be sold at the same time, but it's a strong indication some significant sales are coming.

Berkshire's quarterly 13F portfolio snapshots will probably be how we'll know if the position is shrinking. The report covering Berkshire's current quarter will be released in mid-May.

In Wednesday's trading after the filing, KHC fell about 7% to $21.99, near a six-year low, before rebounding.

It ended at $23.20 Friday, down 1.4% for the week.

For years the company has suffered from underinvestment and strong competition from store-branded alternatives.

In September, it announced a plan to reverse its declines by splitting into two companies, essentially undoing its 2015 merger.

At the time, Buffett criticized the move, telling CNBC, ""It certainly didn't turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together, but I don't think taking it apart will fix it.""

Berkshire joined with Brazil's 3G Capital Management to buy H.J. Heinz for $23.3 billion in 2013.

Two years later, in a deal championed by Buffett, Kraft merged with Heinz.

Berkshire's 325 million shares in the combined company were worth around $30 billion in 2016 but have been closer to $10 billion over the past six years.

In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Buffett wrote the shares cost Berkshire $9.8 billion, so right now it has an overall loss of around $2.3 billion.

In a 2019 live CNBC interview (at 17:33 in the clip) with Becky Quick, Buffett had some regrets about Berkshire's role in the Kraft Heinz merger, saying he had ""overpaid"" for a good company.

(A few months later, he elaborated on that point at the shareholders meeting. The clip and transcript are in Highlights from CNBC's Buffett Archive below.) 

CNBC.com quotes Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren telling clients, ""We ... view the timing of this sale as being reflective of Abel's desire to clean up and pare down the investment portfolio early in his tenure.""

Cutting back on the portfolio will put more cash in the company's already enormous pile of more than $350 billion as of the end of September, potentially putting more pressure on Abel to decide what to do with it amid calls from some shareholders for a dividend.

Warren Buffett admits Berkshire Hathaway paid too much for Kraft in its merger with Heinz, citing the growing pricing power of retailers over brands.

In his explanation he highlights one of the most important lessons he learned from Charlie Munger: you can make any transaction into a bad deal by paying too much, but you can't guarantee a good deal by paying too little.

CAROL LOOMIS: To what extent do the changing dynamics in the consumer food market change your view on the long-term potential for Kraft Heinz?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, actually, what I said was, we paid too much for Heinz — I mean Kraft — I'm sorry — the Heinz part of the transaction, when we originally owned about half of Heinz, we paid an appropriate price there. And we actually did well. We had some preferred redeemed and so on.

We paid too much money for Kraft. To some extent, our own actions had driven up the prices.

Now, Kraft Heinz, the profits of that business, 6 billion — we'll say very, very, very roughly — I'm not projecting, I'm not making forecasts — but 6 billion pretax on 7 billion of tangible assets is a wonderful business.

But you can pay too much for a wonderful business.

We bought See's Candy. And we made a great purchase, as it turned out. And we could've paid more. But there's some price at which we could've bought even See's Candy, and it wouldn't have worked.

So, the business does not know how much you paid for it.

I mean, it's going to earn based on its fundamentals. And we paid too much for the Kraft side of Kraft Heinz.

Additionally, the profitability has basically been improved in those operations over the way they were operating before.

But you're quite correct that Amazon itself has become a brand. Kirkland, at Costco, is a $39 billion brand. All of Kraft Heinz is $26 billion. And it's been around for — on the Heinz side — it's been around for 150 years.

And it's been advertised — billions and billions and billions of dollars, in terms of their products. And they go through tens of thousands of outlets.

And here's somebody like Costco, establishes a brand called Kirkland. And it's doing 39 billion, more than virtually any food company. And that brand moves from product to product, which is terrific, if a brand travels.

I mean, Coca Cola moves it from Coke to Cherry Coke and Coke Zero and so on.

But to have a brand that can really move — and Kirkland does more business than Coca Cola does. And Kirkland operates through 775 or so stores. They call them warehouses at Costco. And Coca Cola is through millions of distribution outlets.

So, brands — the retailer and the brands have always struggled as to who gets the upper hand in moving a product to the consumers.

And there's no question, in my mind, that the position of the retailer, relative to the brands, which varies enormously around the world. In different countries, you've had 35 percent, even, maybe 40 percent, be private-label brands in soft drinks. And it's never gotten anywhere close to that in the United States. So, it varies a lot.

But basically, retailers — certain retailers — the retail system — has gained some power. And particularly in the case of Amazon and Walmart and their reaction to it, and Costco — and Aldi and some others I can name — has gained in power relative to brands.

Kraft Heinz is still doing very well, operationally. But we paid too much. If we paid 50 billion, you know, it would've been a different business. It'd still be earning the same amount.

You can turn any investment into a bad deal by paying too much. What you can't do is turn any investment into a good deal by paying little, which is sort of how I started out in this world.

But the idea of buying the cigar butts that are declining or poor businesses for a bargain price is not something that we try to do anymore. We try to buy good businesses at a decent price. And we made a mistake on the Kraft part of Kraft Heinz.

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met in Abu Dhabi on Friday to tackle the vital issue of territory, with no sign of a compromise, as Russian airstrikes plunged Ukraine into its worst energy crisis of the nearly four-year war.

Kyiv is under mounting U.S. pressure to reach a peace deal in the war triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, with Moscow demanding Kyiv cede its entire eastern industrial area of Donbas before it stops fighting.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the territorial dispute was a central issue for the tripartite talks, including Russian, Ukrainian and U.S. officials, which were scheduled to conclude on Saturday.

""The most important thing is that Russia should be ready to end this war, which it started,"" Zelenskiy said in a statement on the Telegram app, adding he was in regular contact with the Ukrainian negotiators, but it was too early to draw conclusions from Friday's talks.

""We'll see how the conversation goes tomorrow and what the outcome will be.""

Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council and the head of its delegation, said in a statement the talks had discussed parameters for ending the war and the ""further logic of the negotiation process.""

The negotiations come a day after Zelenskiy met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Zelenskiy said on Friday that a deal on U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine was ready, and that he was only waiting on Trump for a specific date and place to sign it.

Ukraine has sought robust security guarantees from Western allies in the event of a peace deal to prevent Russia, which has shown little interest in ending the war, from invading again.

The tripartite talks, brokered by the U.S., are unfolding against a backdrop of intensified Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy system that have cut power and heating to major cities such as Kyiv, as temperatures dip well below freezing.

The head of Ukraine's top private power producer, Maxim Timchenko, told Reuters on Friday the situation was nearing a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" and that Ukraine needs a ceasefire that halts attacks on energy infrastructure.

Kyiv's energy minister said on Thursday that Ukraine's power grid had endured its most difficult day since a widespread blackout in November 2022, when Russia began bombing energy infrastructure.

Russia says it wants a diplomatic solution but will keep working to achieve its goals by military means as long as a negotiated solution remains elusive.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's demand that Ukraine surrender the 20% it still holds of the Donetsk region of the Donbas - about 5,000 sq km (1,900 sq miles) - has proven a major stumbling block to a breakthrough deal.

Zelenskiy refuses to give up land that Russia has not been able to capture in four years of grinding, attritional warfare. Polls show little appetite among Ukrainians for territorial concessions.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Russia's insistence on Ukraine yielding all of Donbas was ""a very important condition.""

A source close to the Kremlin told Reuters that Moscow considers an ""Anchorage formula"" - which Russia says was agreed between Trump and Putin at a summit in Alaska last August - would hand Russia control of all of Donbas and freeze the front lines elsewhere in Ukraine's east and south.

Donetsk is one of four Ukrainian regions Moscow said in 2022 it was annexing after referendums rejected by Kyiv and Western nations as bogus. Most countries recognise Donetsk as part of Ukraine.

Russia has also floated the idea of using the bulk of nearly $5 billion of Russian assets frozen in the United States to fund a recovery of Russian-occupied territory inside Ukraine. Ukraine, backed by European allies, demands that Russia pay it reparations.

Asked about Russia's idea, Zelenskiy dismissed it as ""nonsense.""

Zelenskiy said on Thursday in Davos that the Abu Dhabi talks would be the first trilateral meetings involving Ukrainian and Russian envoys and U.S. mediators since the war began.

Last year, Russian and Ukrainian delegations had their first face-to-face meeting since 2022 when they met in Istanbul. A top Ukrainian military intelligence officer also had talks with U.S. and Russian delegations in Abu Dhabi in November.

It's no secret that bitcoin BTC$89,307.80 is currently failing its many narratives, including the claim that it can serve as an inflation hedge or a safe-haven asset amid uncertainty.

While gold has climbed more than 80% during this period of high inflation, geopolitical skirmishes, and interest rate uncertainty, bitcoin has dropped 14% year over year. 

In theory, assets that protect against inflation should rise when the value of money falls. For gold and the rest of the precious metals complex, that theory has worked. For digital gold, not so much.

That divergence has raised fresh questions: why would anyone buy bitcoin now when precious metals and equities give better returns?

CoinDesk has asked a group of longtime bitcoin bulls, and this is how they are defending buying bitcoin:

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Crypto watchers are speculating that video game retailer GameStop (GME) might be the latest firm to abandon its bitcoin BTC$89,307.80 treasury after moving all its coins to Coinbase this week.

Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant spotted on Friday that a wallet labeled GameStop had transferred all its stash – some 4,710 BTC, worth about $420 million at current prices – to Coinbase Prime, the U.S.-based crypto exchange's institutional arm. Blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence confirms the transfers.

GameStop announced the bitcoin purchase in May. While the company did not disclose how much it spent on the stash, CryptoQuant estimated it invested roughly $504 million at an average price of $107,900 per coin. If sold today at roughly $89,000 BTC price, the company would likely take a loss of around $84 million.

The maneuver has sparked speculation in crypto circles that GameStop may be exiting its bitcoin position. Especially so that it happened at a time when digital asset treasury firms are under increasing pressure as crypto markets tumbled over the past months, leaving them sitting on steep unrealized losses on their holdings. Some of them, like Ethereum-focused ETHZilla (ETHZ), already sold a significant chunk of their ether stash to trim their debt load.

While moving funds to Coinbase Prime, a platform catering to institutional clients, often signals an intent to sell, not all large transfers necessarily imply an imminent liquidation. 

Coinbase Prime also offers custodial services for institutions through its regulated trust company, which could, in theory, mean internal transfers and wallet management.

GameStop has not commented on the transfer yet.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

On a brisk Monday morning before Thanksgiving, a Secret Service motorcade rolled through Vega, a town of fewer than 1,000 people in the Texas Panhandle. Someone of national significance had flown in on a private jet from Florida. His coming to town was “kept very, very quiet,” said Quincy Taylor, a county commissioner, the owner of Vega's only grocery store, and the editor of the town's newspaper. “I probably wasn't supposed to know,” she admitted.

The VIP broke his silence a few hours later. “Hey, friends, it's Eric Trump,” President Trump's son said in a post on Instagram. Behind him, rows of computer servers stretched into the distance. “Welcome to American Bitcoin.”





The post came after the 42-year-old scion had toured a data center the length of five football fields—his first visit since it went online in late June. The facility sits on a former cow pasture next to fields of spinning wind turbines, which power the data center up to 45% of the time. “I find great beauty in this,” said Eric, wearing jeans, a blazer, and a button-down as he strolled the rows of servers with a Fortune reporter and video team. “I really do—very different than the kind of real estate that I'm used to.” 





This real estate reflects a rare physical footprint for a crypto industry whose value exists primarily on the internet. Over the past few years, the U.S. has quietly become the leader in the creation of Bitcoin, and American Bitcoin—where Eric Trump is cofounder and chief strategy officer— aims to ride this Bitcoin mining wave.





More recently, the crypto industry has also become intertwined with a Trump corporate brand best known for traditional real estate. In just over a year, the family has made at least $1 billion in pretax earnings from multiple crypto ventures that share a common playbook with American Bitcoin: attracting savvy partners and executing complicated transactions that position the family's business organizations to scoop up profits. 




American Bitcoin, created in March 2025, also aligns with President Trump's push to Americanize key industries, from steel to AI to crypto, and frame them as strategic resources where America should be dominant. That message has been baked into the mining venture's branding since inception. In his Instagram post, Eric boasted that the business is “using American energy to mine Bitcoin right here on American soil.” In conversation with Fortune, he said he and his father shared the goal of making the U.S. “the crypto capital of the world,” and that Bitcoin mining was central to U.S. domination of the emerging industry. “If we don't do it, someone else will,” he said.





The company's success is far from guaranteed. Like all the Trump crypto holdings, American Bitcoin faces scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest. What's more, the company must show it can withstand a hyper-volatile crypto market: Since it went public in September, its share price has plummeted alongside a steep decline in Bitcoin's value. 





Its cofounder told Fortune he's taking the long view. “Cryptocurrency, if you look back in three years, in five years, and 10 years, I think these are the endeavors that are going to win,” Eric said.





Blinking lights on a wall of servers went from their customary green to an angry red. They were overheating. And every minute a server was down threatened the Vega data center's Bitcoin output, and by extension its revenue. 





Three technicians jumped onto a white warehouse cart and sped down a central aisle to the panel of ailing mining servers, which (like most in the industry) were designed with the help of Chinese Bitcoin-mining-chip manufacturer Bitmain. Working methodically, the Amarillo-based engineers identified the problem: a loose wire. “If you hit the right one, it could bring down the whole conveyance,” said one technician.




The repair effort and the giant facility in which it took place reflect how much Bitcoin mining has changed since 2009, the year the cryptocurrency launched. Back then, it was possible to mine 50 Bitcoins at a time—around $4.6 million worth, at current prices—on a home laptop. Today, the noise and machinery of Eric Trump's Vega operation show how industrial-scale the process has become.




To appreciate why, it's helpful to understand Bitcoin's origins. Its pseudonymous inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, launched Bitcoin as a protest of sorts against the profligacy of central banks and governments. Unlike other currencies, it is anti-inflationary—there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins—and it is supported by a decentralized network rather than a bank or government.  





The mining process distributes new batches of the currency, while also requiring miners to expend energy to maintain that network. Miners race to be the first to solve a random math problem that is generated every 10 minutes or so. The winning miner signs off on a “block” of Bitcoin transactions that it adds to the blockchain. In return, the winner receives a payout of Bitcoin, which today amounts to 3.125 coins per reward, plus the opportunity to collect additional transaction fees. 





Winning the competition, however, has become exponentially harder as the network has grown. It now requires massive computing power, specialized chips—and tremendous amounts of energy. In the U.S., crypto mining accounts for as much as 2.3% of electricity consumption, the Energy Information Administration estimated in 2024—putting it on par with some of the country's most energy-intensive industries. 





Today there are clusters of mining computers in locations worldwide where cheap energy is easily accessible—places like Vega. Affordable energy, in turn, has helped the U.S. build its Bitcoin mining market share, since the cheaper the power, the more likely the miners can turn a profit on their coins. The U.S. accounted for 38% of mining activity in the fourth quarter of 2025, far above Russia's second-best 16%, according to Bitcoin mining company Luxor Technology. At this point, Bitcoin is literally made in America.




Spurred by President Trump, who issued an executive order in March 2025 to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Republicans have framed the asset as a new front in the economic competition with Russia and China. “The Bitcoin for America Act will position our country to lead—not follow—as the world navigates the future of sound money and digital innovation,” said Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) in a November statement advocating for the bill.





It was amid the president's push to make America a “Bitcoin superpower” that Eric Trump's venture took shape. He found a partner in 31-year-old Asher Genoot.





Genoot had been in Bitcoin mining for several years, starting a company called US Bitcoin and becoming CEO of Hut 8 after the two companies merged in 2023. He works out of Miami and moves in the same circles as the Trumps in southern Florida, where the president holds court at his Palm Beach club Mar-a-Lago. “We had about 100 of the same friends,” Eric said. 





After meeting a few months earlier, Genoot and Eric started talking business in February 2025, over pizza at a Trump golf club in nearby Jupiter. Eric and his brother Donald Trump Jr. had just launched a corporate entity called American Data Centers; perhaps there could be a tie-in with Genoot's company. 





“I realized how punitive the financial institutions were in this country, and I fell in love with this new era of finance.”

American Bitcoin cofounder Eric Trump

In fact, there could be: Hut 8 already owned several Bitcoin mining facilities across the U.S. and Canada—warehouses of servers, close to cheap power sources. “We're long energy,” Genoot said. “And we build infrastructure assets, whether that be data centers that mine Bitcoin or data centers that go and support AI compute.” (“I would never have considered mining had I not seen the scale to which they had built,” Eric added in a statement.)





What followed was a headspinning series of financial transactions. Genoot and Eric agreed to split off Hut 8's Bitcoin mining operation into a separate, Trump-linked company. (“It has to have the word ‘American' in it,” Eric recalled saying about the name.) Hut 8 retained 80% ownership, and shareholders of American Data Centers received the other 20%; the remainder of Hut 8, meanwhile, became a pure data center and power infrastructure play. 





Late last March, the partners unveiled their new project, then raised $220 million in a private equity funding round led by Solari Capital, whose founder, AJ Scaramucci, is a son of investor and Trump supporter turned dissident Anthony Scaramucci. (“Bitcoin transcends politics,” AJ told Fortune.) In September, American Bitcoin went public, with Genoot as executive chairman.




Like some other mining ventures, the company employs a hybrid business model that also involves running a “digital-asset treasury.” Digital-asset treasuries raise money by issuing debt and equity, then use that cash to buy crypto for their balance sheets. The business premise, pioneered by Michael Saylor and his company Strategy, relies on the assumption that investors will buy a treasury company's stock to profit from digital assets without owning them directly. 





Saylor has become one of Bitcoin's most devoted evangelists and a friend of Eric's. He even pitched Eric on mortgaging Mar-a-Lago to buy more Bitcoin. Eric demurred, he said, “But I go, ‘You know…there's a second-best play, right?'” 




Shortly after it went public in September, Eric couldn't have been more ecstatic about his second-best play. American Bitcoin was worth nearly $8.5 billion at its height on Sept. 9, while Hut 8 was valued at more than $3 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, American Bitcoin generated $64 million in revenue, primarily from the 563 Bitcoin it mined during those three months. It was “pretty awesome for a company just coming out of the gate,” Genoot said. And as of early January, the new company had about $500 million worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet—enabling it to vault into the top 20 of the largest Bitcoin digital asset treasuries. 





Sitting in an atrium near the servers, Eric talked about the factors that made him a crypto convert. “I happened to become the most debanked human being in the history of debanked human beings,” he said. “Capital One pulled our accounts. JPMorgan pulled our accounts. Bank of America pulled our accounts.”





President Trump and Eric Trump, along with others in their family, have said many banks either stopped doing business with them or refused to take their deposits after the president and many of his supporters disputed the results of the 2020 election.





Banking privacy laws have largely prevented banks from commenting on why they might have stopped working with the Trumps—or even if they worked with the Trumps at all. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America declined to comment on specific customers' accounts, and Capital One did not respond to requests for comment. More broadly, the three banks have denied that they debank customers because of political affiliations. “This is false,” wrote lawyers for Capital One in response to a lawsuit the Trumps filed against the bank in which they alleged their accounts were closed because of their political beliefs. “While Capital One closes bank accounts occasionally, it does so for legally and regulatorily permissible reasons.” 





Still, the experience was one the Trumps shared with some crypto entrepreneurs, who believed that they and their companies had been debanked because of regulators' suspicions about the businesses' validity.




Eric says his family's battle with the banks prompted him to turn to crypto. “I realized how punitive the financial institutions were in this country,” he said, “and I fell in love with this new era of finance.” Like other crypto diehards, he sees Bitcoin as an improvement over the middlemen, fees, and delays associated with traditional banking. “It's cheaper, faster, more transparent than any other form of finance,” he said.





Eric wasn't the only Trump warming to crypto. Although Donald Trump once said that Bitcoin “seems like a scam,” he went on to launch his own collection of NFTs, or collectible images that exist on the blockchain. By 2024, during his campaign to reclaim the White House, he was proclaiming his intention to make the U.S. a dominant force in crypto. And once in office, he signed bipartisan legislation to regulate stablecoins; issued crypto-friendly executive orders, in a reversal of the cryptoskepticism of the Biden administration; and pardoned several people convicted of crypto-related crimes. 





Amid this political push, the Trump family's sprawling business has diversified beyond its original real estate empire and come to look more like a crypto conglomerate. But one strategy has been consistent: The family expands its range by attaching the Trump name to products and businesses largely developed and operated by others. 





Eric and his brother Don Jr. led the family business, the Trump Organization, after the elder Trump began his first term in 2017. That company owns a substantial real estate portfolio, but also licenses the Trump name for a fee to developers and other entrepreneurs—generating an income stream with a minimal investment from the organization itself. 





In crypto, the family has adopted analogous strategies. The Trump family's public social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), has launched a number of crypto-related investment products, including exchange-traded funds, but it has leaned on digital-asset exchange Crypto.com to build and administer them. World Liberty Financial, perhaps the most lucrative of the Trump family's crypto endeavors, has worked closely with Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, to launch and promote its own stablecoin. 




American Bitcoin is a similarly asset-light investment. The company says it has only five employees. While it owns almost 78,000 Bitcoin mining servers, American Bitcoin doesn't own or operate the Vega facility itself, or employ its technicians; that's also true of the company's three other data centers. Instead, American Bitcoin pays Genoot's Hut 8 to run its mining operations. 





“It's the playbook of take the Trump brand, generate a bunch of attention, get the money, and then pay other people to do the work,” said Austin Campbell, a longtime crypto executive and adjunct professor at New York University who teaches classes on blockchain technology. 





An American Bitcoin spokesman says of Campbell's description, “That characterization is inaccurate. American Bitcoin's leadership and founding partners are actively building the business for the long term.”





By most measures, these crypto ventures have been lucrative. They netted more than $1 billion in pretax profits for the year through October, according to the Financial Times—most of it earned through sales of the cryptocurrency attached to World Liberty Financial and the memecoin $TRUMP. And while their on-paper valuations wax and wane with the gyrations of the markets, the family's crypto ventures were worth north of $3 billion as of early January, according to an analysis by Fortune and data from crypto analytics firm Nansen. That estimate includes stakes in the memecoin and World Liberty Financial's currency, holdings that Fortune discounted because of their limited liquidity. The rough valuation also includes shares in crypto-related public companies, including American Bitcoin and TMTG. (The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.)





In early January, World Liberty Financial applied for a federal banking charter. A Trump crypto company was seeking regulatory approval from a decidedly pro-crypto Trump administration. That's the kind of intersection of the Trump family's business interests with President Trump's powers that has raised alarms in Washington.




There is, to be sure, a growing sentiment in tech and investing circles that policymakers and advisors might make better decisions if they have some skin in the game. But the president wields much greater authority over policy—and policies that benefit the crypto community now almost by definition benefit the family's businesses. 





Ethics experts say that the Trump family's crypto bets have created unprecedented conflicts of interest. “Is he making these decisions because he thinks this is a good thing?” asked Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School who researches government ethics, in reference to the president's crypto policies. “Or is he making these decisions because he knows what's going to have a direct effect on his family's finances?”





“Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, in a statement. She added that the administration “is fulfilling the President's promise to make the United States the crypto capital of the world.”





Eric Trump has also repeatedly pushed back against intimations of impropriety. He told Fortune that there's a “wall” between his business interests and his father's policymaking. “My father has no involvement in the Trump Organization,” he said. “He has no involvement in our crypto business. This is a company that I run, and he does a great job running the United States of America.”





Beyond rhetorical battles over propriety, there's the question of whether any public company in crypto—an industry inherently tied to politics and regulatory action—can maintain momentum after President Trump leaves office. But the bigger near-term threat to American Bitcoin is a recent collapse in the crypto market. 




As of mid-January its price was down more than 25% from its mid-autumn peak, after investors grew anxious over signs of a softening U.S. economy. That tumble coincided with a substantial drawdown in American Bitcoin's stock, which was down more than 70% since its early-September IPO. (Other digital asset treasury companies saw their stocks tumble at around the same time.)





The volatility has spread to other Trump crypto assets as well. But Eric, in late November, was unperturbed. “I've got more conviction on cryptocurrency right now than ever before,” he said. “Volatility is our friend.” In fact, he, Genoot, and other insiders bought more shares of American Bitcoin in December and early January—in time to benefit from a post–New Year bounce. 





The residents of Vega are not particularly attuned to the ups and downs of the crypto market. Some townspeople said the American Bitcoin mine hasn't substantially impacted life in the community, whose biggest claim to fame is its proximity to the historic Route 66. 





But others view the data center as a net positive. “It's going to provide some jobs for a rural area that doesn't always have jobs,” said Kari Mays, Vega's assistant city secretary. And local residents do know about the Trumps' role. “[The town] would probably love to tell that story,” said Taylor, the grocery store owner and newspaper editor, about Eric's motorcade driving through rural Texas. It's that brand appeal—whether in Vega or in the top echelons of the crypto community—that has helped propel the Trumps from crypto newcomers to central players.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum treasury firm ETHZilla (ETHZ) buys jet engines for $12 million in RWA tokenization push","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/01/24/ethereum-treasury-firm-buys-jet-engines-amid-tokenization-push-after-selling-eth","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 17:26:53 GMT","

After selling a significant portion of its crypto stash over the past months, Ethereum-focused treasury firm ETHZilla has now added jet engines to its balance sheet.

A Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that the company bought two CFM56-7B24 aircraft engines for $12.2 million through a newly formed subsidiary, ETHZilla Aerospace LLC.

The engines are currently leased to a major airline, and ETHZilla hired Aero Engine Solutions to manage them in exchange for a monthly fee, according to the document. The deal includes a buy-sell option agreement where either party can require the other to buy or sell the engines for $3 million each upon lease expiration, provided the engines remain in proper condition.

While the move may sound odd, for an ETH treasury company, buying jet engines and leasing them to aircraft operators is part of the normal aerospace business outside the crypto world. 

Airline operators lease jet engines as spares to ensure the planes can continue to operate without disruption if their primary engine fails. Companies such as AerCap, Willis Lease Finance Corporation, and SMBC Aero Engine Lease operate in this space. 

The aerospace business is also currently facing a big-engine supply squeeze, with IATA saying its airline members would be forced to pay about $2.6 billion to lease additional spare engines in 2025. In fact, the global aircraft engine leasing market is expected to grow from $11.17 billion in 2025 to $15.56 billion by 2031 at a 5.68% CAGR, according to TechSci Research. 

The strange maneuver comes as digital asset treasuries face growing pressure amid crypto markets' tumble over the past months. 

Many public firms that aggressively raised funds to accumulate tokens last year now trade well below the net asset value (NAV) of the crypto on their books, leaving little room to raise fresh capital.

ETHZilla itself previously sold $40 million in ETH in October to fund a stock buyback program, then offloaded another $74.5 million in December to redeem outstanding debt. Meanwhile, its stock has tumbled roughly 97% since its August peak.

Still, buying aircraft engines might be part of ETHZilla's broader ambition to bring tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) onchain.

In a December shareholder letter, the company outlined plans to tokenize assets in partnership with Liquidity.io, a regulated broker-dealer and SEC-registered alternative trading system (ATS). Before that, ETHZilla took a 15% stake in Zippy, a lender focused on manufactured home loans, with plans to tokenize those loans as compliant, tradable instruments. It also acquired a stake in auto finance platform Karus with plans to bring loans onchain.

""We're building a scalable tokenization pipeline across asset classes with predictable cash flows and global investor demand,"" the firm said in a Wednesday X post. The company expects to list the first tokenized asset offerings in the first quarter of the year.

Will EF's quantum push trigger ETH/BTC ratio to explode by 200%?

The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is going all in on a post-quantum (PQ) era and has unveiled a team to help the chain become more resistant. 

In a statement, EF researcher Justin Drake said that the foundation has declared PQ a “top security priority” and 2026 is the time to go full swing. 

“After years of quiet R&D, EF management has officially declared PQ security a top strategic priority. It's now 2026, and timelines are accelerating. Time to go full PQ.”

Source: X/Justin Drake

Drake noted that PQ research began in 2019, and several breakthroughs have been made. Hence, it is time to advance it into Ethereum's long-term strategy. 

To this effect, a new PQ team has been formed, led by Thomas Coratger with Emile (leanVM). This is being positioned as the backbone of Ethereum's cryptographic PQ future. The team will hold bi-weekly meetings to scale user-focused security for PQ. 

Additionally, EF is betting big on a hash-based cryptography, offering a $1 million cash prize to improve its security. Part of the statement read, 

“$1M Poseidon Prize to harden the Poseidon hash function. We are betting big on hash-based cryptography to enjoy the strongest and leanest cryptographic foundations.”

The infrastructure side of things is also progressing smoothly, with PQ devnets already focusing on a multi-client consensus system. The formal PQ roadmap will be shared soon, according to EF. 

Reacting to the update, Franklin Bi, General Partner at research-driven crypto investment firm Paradigm, said, 

“The post-quantum race begins. If done successfully & timely, blockchains can evolve into post-quantum ‘safe havens' for data & assets.”

Source: X/Franklin Bi 

In 2025, Google and Microsoft made significant breakthroughs in quantum computing, a move some believe meant its inherent risk to blockchain's cryptographic systems may be on borrowed time. 

So far, Solana [SOL] and Ethereum [ETH] have pushed forward with formal plans to become quantum-resistant. However, the Bitcoin community is split on the way forward on the issue. 

Some OG cypherpunks like Adam Back believe the threat is still years or decades away. Key BTC players like Michael Saylor think that it will be “figured out” with time.  Others, on the other hand, feel quantum is an immediate risk and is likely causing BTC's recent underperformance against gold and other metals. 

For his part, analyst Willy Woo believes that Bitcoin's quantum discussions have been “slow,” but have accelerated over the past few months.

But if Bitcoin lags behind Ethereum on PQ, the altcoin will outperform it in investor returns, warned Nic Carter, partner at crypto VC firm Castle Island Ventures. 

“ETHBTC will have to reach 0.1 before BTC devs recognize there's a problem.”

If so, that would imply a 200% outperformance for ETH against BTC, surpassing even the 2021 bull run level.

The Russell 2000 forms a Cup & Handle breakout, pointing to a potential altcoin rally with bullish crypto setups.

Altcoins remain in the red, seemingly waiting for a catalyst to ignite momentum. On the 23rd of January 2026, the Russell 2000 completed a ‘Cup & Handle' breakout, an event that has historically signaled positive trends for altcoins.

Coupled with a strong crypto market cap and Ethereum/BTC showing signs of breaking its downtrend, the stage is set for a possible altcoin rally.

At the time of writing, the Russell 2000 surged past the critical $2,461 neckline, completing its ‘Cup & Handle' pattern. Small-cap rallies like this are often a sign that investor appetite for risk is returning, and that's typically a good thing for altcoins. 

Source: TradingView

If the breakout holds, this could be the momentum altcoins have been desperately waiting for. Momentum indicators showed strength, adding to the bullish outlook. 

But if the index falls back below the neckline, we may need to reconsider the outlook, this is a critical moment for the market. 

At press time, the Total Crypto Market Cap (Total 2) formed an ascending triangle, a bullish pattern suggesting a potential breakout. Support near $1.2 trillion held firm, and if the market continued to rise, the next breakout target was $1.7 trillion.

Source: TradingView

Privacy coins, such as Monero [XMR], Zcash [ZEC], and Dash [DASH], also showed strong performance, signaling renewed interest in altcoins. 

There was a sense that the market was quietly building energy, especially if the Fed's quantitative easing took stage, which would bring in more capital. If that momentum were to hold, something exciting could follow.

Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin [BTC]  (ETH/BTC) also showed improvement, with a potential breakout from a long-term downtrend that began in 2018.

Source: TradingView

If it breaks out, a move of 45.95% would signal bullish momentum and could ignite a broader altcoin rally. 

Also, Ethereum's growing ecosystem and increasing institutional interest made this an exciting moment for the market. The energy around Ethereum [ETH] seemed to be the spark that could lift altcoins.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Searching for Altcoins to Buy? Why TradFi Investors Choose Digitap ($TAP) over $1.89 XRP","https://coincentral.com/searching-for-altcoins-to-buy-why-tradfi-investors-choose-digitap-tap-over-1-89-xrp/","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 15:02:25 GMT","

The current crypto market is filled with altcoins that promise the moon but deliver dust. Amid this environment, a new contender has emerged, and it does not simply speculate on future value; it is redefining how investors bank in the digital era.

While traditional finance (TradFi) has long considered Ripple's XRP as the gold standard for banking infrastructure, a structural shift is happening. Investors are no longer excited by backend settlement rails and are tired of XRP's lack of strong momentum, currently hovering near $1.89.

On that note, investors are turning to Digitap ($TAP), an omni-bank ecosystem that makes crypto spendable like cash in the real world. The project is attracting investors who want stability, growth, and tangible returns in a highly volatile and competitive crypto industry.

This explains why demand in its crypto presale is high, based on the more than 197 million $TAP tokens sold so far. Digitap is designed with a rare combination of retail spendability and institutional-grade security, making it one of the best altcoins to buy today.

For many years, XRP thrived as the best option for people who wanted to invest in the future of the payments industry. Its ability to work as a bridge currency for RippleNet gave it some real-world legitimacy that other tokens could match.

Nonetheless, TradFi investors are starting to notice a growing utility gap while XRP trades around the $1.89 level. XRP is considered a wholesale asset, helping move huge amounts of money between central banks and large financial institutions.



But XRP is hard to use for normal users and small businesses in their daily transactions. These users need to engage with multiple layers of third-party exchanges just to execute simple transactions. Digitap offers the solution to this by focusing on the consumer and business layer.

Its omni-bank ecosystem offers users the ability to hold fiat and crypto in one place and multi-currency IBANs. Furthermore, Digitap offers a direct connection to the global economy via Visa-integrated cards. Although XRP is a viable tool for the banking elite, Digitap outshines it because it is developing the bank of the future to serve the rest of the world.

Digitap's focus on immediate, retail-ready utility explains why investors are buying into its crypto presale. Also, its commitment to cross-chain interoperability makes it thrive above XRP and other traditional payment tokens.

Interestingly, Digitap has pushed the Solana integration, meaning that users can now top up their accounts with assets using the Solana network. This collaboration is considered a massive effort to enable Digitap to appeal to the most active retail community in the crypto space.

Thus, the strategic integration has enabled SOL holders to link their funds to a banking environment where they can spend them instantly. By adding Solana to its huge list of supported assets, Digitap is strengthening its position as the first omni-bank globally.

Investors will only need to top up their Digitap account with SOL and then use their virtual or physical Visa card to transact at more than 80 million merchant locations. The smooth transition from high-speed blockchain to real-world purchasing power is what TradFi investors want when looking for the best altcoins to buy.

$TAP is the main token powering the entire Digitap ecosystem, making it a workhorse asset. In that context, it is the fundamental unit of value powering the platform's rewards. Holding $TAP enables users to access premium features like offshore banking and enjoy high-yield staking of up to 124% APY.

Since $TAP is deeply connected with all functions of the Digitap network, its demand is fueled by real-world utility, not speculative trading. The project's economic model is built for long-term sustainability and scarcity.

Digitap has adopted a hyper-deflationary buy-back and burn mechanism, where 50% of all platform profits are used to buy $TAP from the open market. These tokens are then removed from circulation.

Therefore, as more people use Digitap and transact, $TAP's supply decreases. This operation model creates a revenue-backed scarcity, which is highly attractive to TradFi investors. Hence, $TAP is a good crypto to buy this January for long-term gains.



Another major reason why investors consider Digitap as the best crypto to buy in 2026 is its large, verified user base. More than 120,000 wallets have already connected to it, enabling it to achieve adoption levels that other projects take years to achieve. The product-first strategy is believed to be powering this growth.

While other crypto presales thrive on promises of future utility, Digitap is already live on iOS and Android. This means users can sample its technology before buying the token. The operational readiness helps to lower Digitap's risk profile considerably.



Currently, selling at $0.0439 with a set exchange listing price of $0.14, $TAP's value proposition becomes undeniable. Current investors will see their investment surge by 218% before the token hits the public market. Demand is high, which explains why over 197 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $4.3 million.

For investors who missed XRP in its early days, Digitap offers them a second chance to own a portion of the core infrastructure that could shape the next decade of digital finance.

As the market maneuvers deeper into the year, the era of speculative assets is ending. It is being replaced by functional PayFi projects. TradFi investors are focusing on $TAP because it has built a definite path toward sustainable profits powered by real-world utility.

By offering investors an omni-bank ecosystem that already works and integrating with the Solana network, Digitap has set a new standard for digital banking. It offers the utility, security, and growth potential that traditional investors demand.

While XRP is a dominant player for institutional cross-border remittances, Digitap offers better growth potential since it focuses on retail users. Therefore, $TAP is a better altcoin to buy for the banking bull run of 2026 than XRP at $1.89.

The North Korean hacker group Konni (Opal Sleet, TA406) is using AI-generated PowerShell malware to target developers and engineers in the blockchain sector.

Believed to be associated with APT37 and Kimsuky activity clusters, Konni has been active since at least 2014 and has been seen targeting organizations in South Korea, Russia, Ukraine, and various countries in Europe.

Based on samples analyzed by Check Point researchers, the threat actor's latest campaign focuses on targets in the Asia-Pacific region, as the malware was submitted from Japan, Australia, and India.

The attack begins with the victim receiving a Discord-hosted link that delivers a ZIP archive containing a PDF lure and a malicious LNK shortcut file.

The LNK runs an embedded PowerShell loader that extracts a DOCX document and a CAB archive containing a PowerShell backdoor, two batch files, and a UAC bypass executable.

Launching the shortcut file causes the DOCX to open and to execute one batch file included in the cabinet file.

The lure DOCX document suggests that the hackers want to compromise development environments, which could provide them ""access to sensitive assets, including infrastructure, API credentials, wallet access, and ultimately cryptocurrency holdings.""

The first batch file creates a staging directory for the backdoor and the second batch file, and creates an hourly scheduled task masquerading as a OneDrive startup task.

This task reads an XOR-encrypted PowerShell script from disk and decrypts it for in-memory execution. Finally, it deletes itself to wipe the signs of infection.

The PowerShell backdoor itself is heavily obfuscated using arithmetic-based string encoding, runtime string reconstruction, and execution of the final logic via ‘Invoke-Expression.'

The researchers say that the PowerShell malware ""strongly indicates AI-assisted development rather than traditional operator-authored malware.""

The evidence leading to this conclusion includes the clear, structured documentation at the top of the script, which is unusual for malware development; its modular, clean layout; and the presence of a “# <– your permanent project UUID” comment.

""This phrasing is highly characteristic of LLM-generated code, where the model explicitly instructs a human user on how to customize a placeholder value,"" explains Check Point.

""Such comments are commonly observed in AI-produced scripts and tutorials.""

Before execution, the malware performs hardware, software, and user activity checks to ensure it is not running in analysis environments, and then generates a unique host ID.

Next, depending on what execution privileges it has on the compromised host, it follows a separate path of action as shown in the following diagram.

Once the backdoor is fully running on the infected device, it periodically contacts the command-and-control (C2) server to send basic host metadata and polls the server at randomized intervals.

If the C2 response contains PowerShell code, it turns it into a script block and executes it asynchronously via background jobs.

Check Point attributes these attacks to the Konni threat actor based on earlier launcher formats, lure filename and script name overlaps, and commonalities in the execution chain structure with earlier attacks.

The researchers have published indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with this recent campaign to help defenders protect their assets.

A dangerous new threat is targeting blockchain engineers and developers. The North Korean group known as  is using smart AI tools to build powerful malware. This attack aims right at people working on crypto projects. It could steal wallets, API keys, and even whole crypto holdings.

Blockchain teams need to stay alert. These attacks are sneaky and use new tech like AI to hide better. In this post, we break down how it works, why it's scary for crypto, and simple steps to stay safe.

The , also called Opal Sleet or TA406, come from North Korea. They have links to groups like APT37 and Kimsuky. These teams have attacked since 2014.

They hit targets in South Korea, Russia, Ukraine, and Europe. Now, their latest moves focus on Asia-Pacific. Samples show hits from Japan, Australia, and India.

Blockchain pros are prime targets. Why? Dev environments hold gold for hackers: code, private keys, wallet access, and crypto funds. One breach can mean big losses.

It all begins with a fake link on Discord. Victims think it's a safe share. But it downloads a ZIP file with two bad items:

Click the shortcut, and things go wrong fast. It runs hidden PowerShell code. This code pulls out:

The DOCX opens like normal, but in the background, a batch file runs. This sets up the malware without you knowing.

Here's how the infection spreads:

The backdoor is super hidden. It uses math tricks to scramble strings, rebuilds them at runtime, and runs key code with Invoke-Expression.

Experts spotted clear signs this malware came from AI, not hand-coded by hackers. Here's why:

AI makes malware faster and harder to spot. Hackers can tweak it quick without deep coding skills.

Before acting, it checks your system:

If safe, it makes a unique host ID. Then, based on admin rights:

The backdoor phones home to a command server (C2). It sends host info like OS, user, and location. Then polls for orders at random times.

If C2 sends PowerShell code, it runs in background jobs. Hackers can steal data, run more malware, or grab crypto keys.

Crypto is big money for state hackers like . A dev machine might have:

One report lure promised blockchain jobs. It aimed to hook curious engineers.

Researchers tie this to  by:

IoCs are out now: bad Discord links, file hashes, C2 domains. Check security feeds for full lists.

AI malware is the future. It speeds up creation and evades old detectors. North Korea leads here, but others will follow.

For blockchain, risks grow. Devs use open tools, Discord, and shared repos. Perfect for phishing.

Blockchain engineers, here's your defense checklist:

Run threat hunts often. Tools like Sigma rules can flag Konni tricks.

The  show no signs of slowing. AI makes their malware smarter and deadlier. Blockchain firms must act now to protect devs and assets.

Stay safe, share IoCs with your team, and keep learning about threats. Crypto's future depends on strong security.

Nifty Gateway, the non-fungible token (NFT) trading platform that was once central to the 2021 digital art boom, will shut down on Feb. 23, 2026.

Starting immediately, the platform has entered withdrawal-only mode, giving users one month to move any NFTs or funds still on the site, according to an announcement from the company. The website also shows a notice of closing on its homepage. Users can withdraw their funds from the platform through a connected Gemini Exchange account or to their bank via Stripe.

The Gemini-owned platform helped bring digital collectibles to a broader audience by simplifying NFT purchases. It was one of the oldest NFT trading platforms and hosted curated “drops” with artists like Beeple and Grimes, and accepted credit card payments, a rarity in a crypto-native market.

At its peak in mid-2021, Nifty Gateway had facilitated over $300 million in sales. But in April 2024, the company shifted away from marketplace operations, rebranding as Nifty Gateway Studio.

The focus moved toward building onchain creative projects in partnership with brands and artists.

“This decision will allow Gemini to sharpen its focus and execute on the vision of building a one-stop super app for customers,” the marketplace's parent company, Gemini, wrote in a blog post. “We will continue to support NFTs via the Gemini Wallet.”

The NFT market reached a $17 billion market capitalization in early 2022 but has since been in a long, drawn-out bear market. Its current market capitalization is now at $2.8 billion.

Gemini is winding down its NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway as it shifts focus toward building a one-stop super app for customers.

The digital art platform has entered withdrawal-only mode and will cease operations on February 23, according to a statement issued on Friday. Customers with remaining USD, ETH, or NFT holdings will be notified by email with instructions on transferring assets off the platform.

An OG in the NFT space, Nifty Gateway is home to exclusive NFT drops from top digital artists, musicians, and brands like Beeple, CryptoKitties, and Pak.

“Nifty Gateway was launched in 2020 with the vision of revolutionizing digital art,” the team said in a statement. “We are incredibly proud of the work the Nifty team has pioneered and grateful to Nifty Gateway's customers and artists for joining us on this journey.”

Gemini acquired Nifty Gateway in late 2019, marking the exchange's entry into the NFT sector. In early 2023, founders Duncan and Griffin Cock Foster departed the company amid declining NFT trading volumes.

Gemini said it will continue supporting NFTs through the Gemini Wallet, which launched in August 2025.

The NFT market recorded $122.5 million in sales volume over the past week, surging 101.61% from the previous period.

NFT buyers climbed 38.75% to 187,288, while sellers jumped 47.19% to 164,685. Transaction volume increased 7.99% to 702,526.

This is happening at a time when Bitcoin has retreated to the $89,000 level, while Ethereum has slipped below the $3,000 mark.

The global crypto market cap now stands at $3.02 trillion, down from last week's $3.22 trillion. Despite this broader market weakness, the NFT sector posted strong gains, with weekly sales volume more than doubling.

Ethereum (ETH) dominated all blockchains with $77.57 million in NFT sales, jumping 179.42% over the seven-day period.

The network attracted 23,994 buyers, up 38.03% from the prior week. Wash trading on Ethereum totaled $4.63 million during this timeframe.

Bitcoin (BTC) secured second place among blockchains with $21.66 million in sales, soaring 126.61% week-over-week. The network drew 8,333 buyers, up 60.71% compared to the previous period.

BNB Chain (BNB) ranked third with $7.52 million in sales, declining 3.20% despite buyer activity rising 68.29% to 24,784. 

Immutable (IMX) dropped to fourth position at $3.70 million in sales, down 10.98%, while Base claimed fifth with $3.55 million, climbing 88.69%.

Solana (SOL) rounded out the top six blockchains with $3.32 million in sales, posting an 8.85% gain and attracting 30,235 buyers who surged 84.73% from last week.

Flying Tulip PUT on Ethereum dominated the collection rankings with $51.57 million in sales, showing flat performance week-over-week. The collection processed 2,103 transactions from 1,516 buyers.

$X@AI BRC-20 NFTs on Bitcoin claimed second place with $15.71 million in sales, surging 687.41% over the week. The collection completed just nine transactions from seven buyers.

YES BOND on BNB Chain landed in third with $4.18 million in sales, climbing 28.15%. CryptoPunks took fourth position with $4.01 million in sales, recovering 46.74% after last week's 23.81% decline.

Guild of Guardians Heroes posted $2.31 million in sales, up 7.41%, while Moonbirds recorded $1.91 million with a 69.75% surge. Pudgy Penguins rounded out the top seven with $1.82 million in sales, down 4.72%.

The week's highest-value sale shattered previous records as a $X@AI BRC-20 NFT on Bitcoin sold for $13.73 million (153.5837 BTC) just one day ago. 

Two additional $X@AI pieces followed, fetching $1.01 million (11.2771 BTC) two days ago and $895,348 (10.0001 BTC) three days ago.

CryptoPunks claimed two spots among the top five individual sales.

The Irish Chamber Orchestra launches its Winter/Spring 2026 season with a performance by celebrated cellist and composer Abel Selaocoe at University Concert Hall, on Tuesday 3 February.

Selaocoe, one of the most in-demand musicians of his generation, brings his distinctive fusion of classical virtuosity and African vocal traditions to what promises to be a rare intimate orchestral experience. Fresh from global acclaim for his album Hymns of Bantu, the South African artist transforms traditional recitals into what have been described as “shared rituals” – blending improvisation, rhythm and storytelling with works by classical masters.

The programme, titled HOME, seamlessly weaves together European and African musical traditions. Janácek's Suite for Strings opens the evening, flowing into Selaocoe's own composition Lerato (Love). Debussy's Cello Sonata and Sibelius's Romance provide contrasting textures before Selaocoe's Ibuyile l'Africa (Africa Is Back) delivers what organisers promise will be a “full-tilt celebration of return and identity”. The concert concludes with Kea Morata (I Love Them So), uniting classical and South African sound worlds.

ICO guest leader Nicola Sweeney co-directs, with the orchestra supported by Alan Keary on bass and Bernhard Schimpelsberger on percussion.

Stablecoins aren't supposed to make you money. So how do you pick the right one?

You don't invest in a stablecoin. You use one.

USD Coin (USDC +0.00%) and PayPal USD (PYUSD +0.12%) are both pegged to the U.S. dollar. Hold one for a year, and you'll still have one dollar. Anything else (up or down) is a failure.

Stablecoins aren't about capital gains. They're about utility; moving money quickly, cheaply, and globally without waiting for banks to open. They're the native currency of crypto exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and increasingly, mainstream payment apps. And behind the two stablecoins I'm comparing today, you'll find two very different public companies: Circle Internet (CRCL 0.03%) and PayPal (PYPL 0.84%).

Circle's USDC is the native currency of crypto. It's what you hold on exchanges, or what you use to move money across blockchains without touching a bank. If you're active in the crypto economy, you've probably held USDC at some point; maybe without even thinking about it.

PayPal's PYUSD is different. It lives inside PayPal and Venmo, designed for consumers who want to dip a toe into digital assets without leaving the familiar confines of their favorite payment apps. You can buy it, hold it, and send it to friends, but it's not really meant for the wild west of DeFi.

So the question isn't which one will make you money. It's which fits how you actually use your money.

Circle launched USDC in 2018, and it has since become the standard plumbing of the crypto economy. With $73.7 billion in circulation as of Jan. 21, 2026, USDC commands a 24% share of the global stablecoin market. That's second only to Tether (USDT 0.05%). Unlike the more controversial Tether, Circle has built its reputation on regulatory compliance and transparent cash reserves.

If you've ever traded on a crypto exchange, you've probably encountered USDC. It's the quote currency for countless trading pairs, the settlement layer for decentralized exchanges, and the asset of choice for DeFi lending and yield protocols.

On-chain transaction volume hit $9.6 trillion in Q3 2025 alone, up 580% year over year. That's not people holding USDC as a store of value. That's money on the move.

USDC lives on more than a dozen blockchains, letting you move dollars across different crypto ecosystems without converting to various native tokens first. For traders, developers, and institutions, it's a universal translator.

The trade-off? USDC is built for people who are comfortable with crypto. You need a wallet, to understand gas fees, and know which chain you're on. So it's powerful, but not exactly plug-and-play.

PayPal launched PYUSD in August 2023, positioning it as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. Unlike USDC, which requires a working knowledge of cryptocurrency mechanics, PYUSD lives entirely inside the popular PayPal and Venmo payment apps. You buy it with a tap, hold it in your existing account, and send it to friends like any other payment. No seed phrases, no chain selection, no learning curve.

That simplicity is the point. PayPal isn't chasing DeFi power users or institutional traders here. It's targeting the hundreds of millions of people who already use its apps, but have never touched crypto.

PYUSD is a gentle on-ramp to the dizzying world of blockchains and digital currencies. It's a way to say ""yes, we do stablecoins now"" without asking customers to change their existing financial habits.

The trade-off is utility. PYUSD doesn't really exist outside PayPal's walled garden. You can't use it on decentralized exchanges, earn yield in DeFi lending protocols, or move it across a dozen blockchains. It's a stablecoin tethered to a single ecosystem.

For PayPal's target audience, that's fine -- it's working as designed. For anyone deeper into crypto, it's more of a limitation.

Adoption has been slow. PayPal doesn't break out PYUSD circulation in its earnings reports, and the token remains a tiny fraction of the stablecoin market with a $3.7 billion market cap today. The company is betting that mainstream consumer reach will eventually matter more than crypto-native credibility.

That bet hasn't paid off yet, but as a money-moving tool with one foot in the crypto world and the other deep in PayPal's internal operations, PYUSD plays an important role for the company.

Image source: Getty Images.

USDC and PYUSD both do the same basic thing: hold your dollars in digital form, pegged 1:1 to the cold, hard greenback. Both even pay interest; USDC typically yields around 3.5% APR through DeFi protocols or crypto exchange accounts, while PYUSD offers 3.75% APR directly in the PayPal app. Not bad for a dollar that's supposed to stay a dollar.

But that's where the similarities end. USDC is for people who live in crypto. From traders and DeFi users to developers moving money across blockchains, USDC is a go-to solution.

Meanwhile, PYUSD is for people who don't want to think about any of that. Its holders are PayPal and Venmo users who want a low-friction way to hold digital dollars without leaving apps they already trust.

There's no ""better buy"" here, in the traditional sense. Neither token will gain value over time, apart from single-digit annual yields. The question is which tool fits your needs.

If you're active in the crypto economy, USDC is the obvious choice; it's more widely accepted, more liquid, and more versatile. If you just want to park some dollars in PayPal and earn a modest yield, PYUSD does its thing with zero learning curve.

You have a money-managing job to do. Pick the tool that matches that job. For some people, that'll be a bit of both.

Americans may be tapping cards and phones more often, but they're not ready to give up cash. A new survey suggests that while digital payments dominate daily spending, most people still want the option to pay with paper bills (1) and they strongly oppose the U.S. becoming a cashless society.

The findings highlight a growing tension between convenience and choice, and raise a bigger question: Is relying on cash actually a bad habit, or an underappreciated financial tool?

In a survey of roughly 5,000 Americans conducted by the Siena Research Institute, 84% said they oppose the U.S. moving to a cashless society, even as digital payments become the norm. About 85% of respondents said they had paid cash for something in the past month, signaling physical currency's role in everyday life.

“Seeing ‘no cash accepted' signs when people walk into retail establishments is both an affront to peoples' right to choose how to pay or who want control over their personal data. It's also discriminatory against those who fully depend on cash,” said Jeff Thinnes, of the Payment Choice Coalition, which advocates for cash's role in the payment ecosystem, and sponsored Siena's study.

Debit cards lead the pack, with 35% of Americans saying they're their preferred way to pay. Cash and credit cards follow at 24% each, underscoring that while most people lean on plastic, they still want cash as a viable option.

Privacy emerged as a major driver. More than 90% said cash protects privacy better than cards or digital currency. Budgeting also factored in: 70% said using cash makes it easier to stay on budget, though 75% said it's easier to track spending with cards or apps.

The survey also found strong support for policy intervention, with 85% supporting laws requiring most brick-and-mortar businesses to accept cash. This may reflect frustration with the growing number of venues, from restaurants to sports stadiums, that no longer offer cash payment options.

The cash debate isn't just philosophical. It has real consequences for access and inclusion. A 2024 FDIC survey (2) found that approximately 4.2% of U.S. households (about 5.6 million) were unbanked in 2023, meaning they had no checking or savings accounts, while 14.2% (about 19 million households) were underbanked, meaning they had relied on services outside of banks for their credit needs, including payday loans, pawn shops or rent-to-own services. For those households, cash is a necessity. A fully cashless system could effectively lock them out of basic commerce.

Older Americans also tend to rely more on cash, as do people without consistent access to smartphones, broadband or stable banking relationships. When businesses refuse cash, they may be both streamlining payments and narrowing who can participate.

There's also a resilience argument. Economists say cash plays a critical role during natural disasters, power outages, and cyber disruptions. If payment networks go down, digital wealth can become temporarily unusable.

“Future wars are probably going to be cyber wars and you might think you're wealthy, but if you're cut off from all electronic access to your funds, then you really can't spend money,” Jay Zagorsky, author of The Power of Cash, told USA Today (3).

Growing preferences for cards or digital currency don't mean cash is obsolete, but it does suggest it's becoming situational. Cards offer rewards, fraud protection and convenience. Cash offers immediacy, privacy, and spending discipline. Neither is universally better.

Behavioral research suggests cash can curb impulse spending because parting with physical money feels more “real.”

“Cash, with its high transparency and tactile cues, encourages deliberate spending, whereas cards introduce moderate detachment and reduced emotional friction,” researchers noted in a 2025 paper studying the effect of payment modes on spending (4).

On the other hand, cards and apps provide detailed records that can help people analyze and optimize their finances over time. The Siena survey reflects that trade-off: people value cash for control, but appreciate digital tools for tracking.

The takeaway from the data isn't that Americans want to go back to stuffing envelopes with cash; they want choice. Most people already mix payment methods depending on context, income, and comfort level.

As more businesses move away from accepting paper money, that choice is shrinking. Whether through legislation like the proposed Payment Choice Act (5) or market pressure from consumers, Americans are signaling they don't want convenience to come at the expense of access.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Revolut prepares to offer crypto services in the UAE","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/revolut-to-offer-crypto-services-in-uae/","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 12:57:00 GMT","

UK-headquartered Revolut, a global financial application with over 60 million customers, has posted a job announcement for a “Crypto Technology Manager” for the UAE. This comes months after it received its in-principle approval for Stored Value Facilities and Retail Payment Services licenses from the Central Bank of the UAE.

At the time, Revolut noted that this was a significant achievement, signaling its plans to launch in the UAE with the aim of offering a comprehensive product experience to retail customers.

The job post notes that the crypto technology manager is part of the technology team that will build the systems and experiences that keep Revolut moving forward. The opportunity claims, “We're looking for a Technology Manager to support our crypto expansion in the UAE, focusing on technology risk, operational resilience, and regulatory readiness.”

The crypto technology manager will work not only with Revolut's internal engineering, product, operations and compliance teams but with local regulators as well to ensure their crypto platforms operate in line with UAE regulatory requirements.

The role entails implementing and maintaining a technology and operational risk framework for crypto activities in the UAE, ensuring compliance with ICT regulations and requirements, and supporting crypto licensing and regulatory engagement with local authorities (e.g., Central Bank of the UAE, VARA, DFSA, FSRA).

Of course, the candidate has to have experience in financial services, fintech, crypto/digital assets, and knowledge in the blockchain domain.

Currently, Revolut allows users to buy, sell, and hold over 175 cryptocurrencies directly within its app, offering features like instant exchanges, automatic “round-up” investing, and advanced trading via the specialized Revolut X platform. It recently partnered with Trust Wallet to offer enhanced, low-fee purchasing options for users.

In November, Ambareen Musa, Head of Revolut in GCC noted the firm is in “day zero build mode” in the UAE, completing governance and licensing requirements and is hopeful for an upcoming launch subject to regulatory approval.

The expansion in the MENA region is part of their strategy to serve 100 million customers by 2027, and Revolut as such aims to enter 30 new markets by 2030. It also committed $13 billion in investments over the next five years to accomplish this while creating 10,000 jobs globally.

This includes significant funding for established and high-growth regions, such as a $4 billion commitment to the UK, $1.2 billion for its Western Europe hub in France, and $500 million to accelerate its operations in the US. The investments will also drive further growth in other European markets as well as launches in new markets across Latin America, APAC, and the Middle East.

January 24, 2026

Nigeria's experiment with formally regulating cryptocurrency businesses has encountered its first visible constraint, after Quidax, a provisionally licensed digital asset exchange, discontinued its peer-to-peer (P2P) trading feature just five months after launching it.
The move comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tightens oversight of the crypto sector under its Accelerated Regulatory Incubation Programme (ARIP), a sandbox designed to transition exchanges from a largely informal market into Nigeria's capital markets framework.
While Quidax framed the decision as a response to user preferences, the P2P exit highlights the practical limits of what regulators are currently willing and able to supervise.
Quidax informed customers via email that its P2P marketplace would be shut down, disabling ads, merchant chats and escrow services, while other products such as instant swaps and order-book trading would continue to operate.

A stress test for the sandbox
P2P trading has long been one of the most active and most controversial segments of Nigeria's crypto economy. It enables users to buy and sell digital assets directly with one another, often settling transactions through bank transfers outside the exchange itself. That structure has made P2P platforms a crucial liquidity channel, but also a persistent regulatory headache.
In 2024, the SEC publicly raised concerns about P2P crypto markets, pointing to opaque transaction flows, difficulties in monitoring off-platform settlements, and risks of exchange-rate manipulation. The regulator also flagged the dominance of foreign P2P platforms operating in a legal grey area, complicating enforcement and investor protection.
Quidax's P2P feature was positioned as a corrective to those risks. Rather than allowing trades to spill into informal channels, the exchange attempted to internalise P2P activity within a controlled environment. Only verified users could become merchants, with eligibility requiring full account registration, Level-3 know-your-customer verification, two-factor authentication, and a minimum participation history. Merchant applications were reviewed by Quidax, and approved traders were issued special badges.
Despite those safeguards, the feature has now been shelved, suggesting that even tightly controlled P2P models may sit beyond the regulator's current comfort zone.
Licensing delays and rising thresholds
The timing of Quidax's decision is significant. Startups admitted into the SEC's ARIP programme, including Quidax and competitor Busha, were expected to transition to full crypto licences by August 2025, after completing the one-year incubation period. That process has since stalled, with the regulator pausing licensing approvals to reassess its supervisory readiness.   
At the same time, Nigeria's crypto rulebook is becoming more demanding. On January 16, the SEC raised minimum capital requirements for capital-market operators, including virtual asset service providers. Under the Investment and Securities Act (2025), digital assets are now classified as securities, bringing crypto activities firmly under capital-markets regulation.

While the SEC has not issued a standalone framework for P2P platforms, the classification regime offers guidance. A P2P service could be treated as a Digital Assets Intermediary (DAI) or a Digital Asset Platform Operator (DAPO), both of which now carry a minimum capital requirement of N500 million ($352,000). Where services are stacked, combining P2P trading with exchange operations, custody, or escrow, the regulatory burden increases further.
For sandbox participants operating under close scrutiny, product complexity now carries regulatory risk.
What the sandbox allows and what it doesn't
Quidax's P2P exit also provides insight into what Nigeria's crypto sandbox currently permits. Activities that mirror traditional capital-market structures such as order-book trading, centrally settled swaps, and custodial services, appear easier for regulators to oversee.        
P2P trading, by contrast, amplifies concerns around informal settlement, limited transaction visibility, and investor protection. Even when conducted on-platform, much of the actual value transfer occurs outside the exchange's direct control, complicating supervision.
In that sense, Quidax's decision marks the sandbox's first clear boundary: innovation that cannot be cleanly mapped onto existing regulatory frameworks is likely to be deferred.

A broader retreat from risk
The P2P shutdown also coincides with a broader tightening of Quidax's platform. The exchange has announced plans to delist 35 crypto tokens, including meme coins, gaming tokens, and higher-profile assets such as Worldcoin and World Liberty Financial.
Taken together, the moves point to a strategic recalibration as Nigeria's regulatory posture hardens. For exchanges seeking full licences, reducing exposure to high-risk or hard-to-supervise activities may now be a prerequisite for survival.   
Nigeria's crypto sandbox was designed to balance innovation with investor protection. Quidax's P2P exit suggests that balance is being tested and that, for now, the regulator is prioritising visibility, control, and capital adequacy over the market's most informal trading structures.

While the SEC has not issued a standalone framework for P2P platforms, the classification regime offers guidance. A P2P service could be treated as a Digital Assets Intermediary (DAI) or a Digital Asset Platform Operator (DAPO), both of which now carry a minimum capital requirement of N500 million ($352,000).

What the sandbox allows and what it doesn't
Quidax's P2P exit also provides insight into what Nigeria's crypto sandbox currently permits. Activities that mirror traditional capital-market structures such as order-book trading, centrally settled swaps, and custodial services, appear easier for regulators to oversee.        
P2P trading, by contrast, amplifies concerns around informal settlement, limited transaction visibility, and investor protection. Even when conducted on-platform, much of the actual value transfer occurs outside the exchange's direct control, complicating supervision.
In that sense, Quidax's decision marks the sandbox's first clear boundary: innovation that cannot be cleanly mapped onto existing regulatory frameworks is likely to be deferred.

The P2P shutdown also coincides with a broader tightening of Quidax's platform. The exchange has announced plans to delist 35 crypto tokens, including meme coins, gaming tokens, and higher-profile assets such as Worldcoin and World Liberty Financial.
Taken together, the moves point to a strategic recalibration as Nigeria's regulatory posture hardens. For exchanges seeking full licences, reducing exposure to high-risk or hard-to-supervise activities may now be a prerequisite for survival.   
Nigeria's crypto sandbox was designed to balance innovation with investor protection. Quidax's P2P exit suggests that balance is being tested and that, for now, the regulator is prioritising visibility, control, and capital adequacy over the market's most informal trading structures.

P2P trading has long been one of the most active and most controversial segments of Nigeria's crypto economy. It enables users to buy and sell digital assets directly with one another, often settling transactions through bank transfers outside the exchange itself. That structure has made P2P platforms a crucial liquidity channel, but also a persistent regulatory headache.
In 2024, the SEC publicly raised concerns about P2P crypto markets, pointing to opaque transaction flows, difficulties in monitoring off-platform settlements, and risks of exchange-rate manipulation. The regulator also flagged the dominance of foreign P2P platforms operating in a legal grey area, complicating enforcement and investor protection.
Quidax's P2P feature was positioned as a corrective to those risks. Rather than allowing trades to spill into informal channels, the exchange attempted to internalise P2P activity within a controlled environment. Only verified users could become merchants, with eligibility requiring full account registration, Level-3 know-your-customer verification, two-factor authentication, and a minimum participation history. Merchant applications were reviewed by Quidax, and approved traders were issued special badges.
Despite those safeguards, the feature has now been shelved, suggesting that even tightly controlled P2P models may sit beyond the regulator's current comfort zone.
Licensing delays and rising thresholds
The timing of Quidax's decision is significant.

Quidax's P2P exit also provides insight into what Nigeria's crypto sandbox currently permits. Activities that mirror traditional capital-market structures such as order-book trading, centrally settled swaps, and custodial services, appear easier for regulators to oversee.        
P2P trading, by contrast, amplifies concerns around informal settlement, limited transaction visibility, and investor protection. Even when conducted on-platform, much of the actual value transfer occurs outside the exchange's direct control, complicating supervision.
In that sense, Quidax's decision marks the sandbox's first clear boundary: innovation that cannot be cleanly mapped onto existing regulatory frameworks is likely to be deferred.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to withdraw its enforcement action against Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange founded by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The decision follows the full recovery of assets by investors in its Gemini Earn lending program.

Legal documents filed in Manhattan federal court indicated that Gemini returned investors' crypto assets through the Genesis Global Capital bankruptcy process. This comes after SEC accusations in 2023 that Gemini and Genesis Global Capital illegally sold securities via a lending program, affecting numerous investors.

Under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, the SEC has adapted its stance on cryptocurrency enforcement, promoting a more favorable regulatory environment. Gemini, which debuted on Nasdaq amid increasing digital asset optimism, now holds a valuation of $1.14 billion.

It's no secret that bitcoin BTC$89,561.83 is currently failing its many narratives, including the claim that it can serve as an inflation hedge or a safe-haven asset amid uncertainty.

While gold has climbed more than 80% during this period of high inflation, geopolitical skirmishes, and interest rate uncertainty, bitcoin has dropped 14% year over year. 

In theory, assets that protect against inflation should rise when the value of money falls. For gold and the rest of the precious metals complex, that theory has worked. For digital gold, not so much.

That divergence has raised fresh questions: why would anyone buy bitcoin now when precious metals and equities give better returns?

CoinDesk has asked a group of longtime bitcoin bulls, and this is how they are defending buying bitcoin:

Strategy (MSTR) introduced its first non-U.S. perpetual preferred product, Stream (STRE), in November, aiming to tap demand across the European Economic Area (EEA). 

However, it didn't pan out the way Michael Saylor's firm intended. 

The preferred share was issued with a stated value of EUR100 ($115) per share, pays a 10% annual dividend, and sits above common equity in the capital structure. STRE was positioned as a European analogue to Stretch (STRC), the company's high-yield money-market-style preferred share. Strategy ultimately raised $715 million, pricing the instrument at a 20% discount to EUR80 per share due to market conditions and demand. 

While, in theory, the financial product sounded good, since its issuance, however, STRE has struggled to gain traction. There has also been little public communication from the company about the product, and it has since been removed from the company's dashboard.

So what happened?

Khing Oei, founder and CEO of Treasury, a bitcoin treasury company based in the Netherlands, has pointed to several structural reasons why STRE may not have taken off, despite Europe being a sufficiently large addressable market.

First, STRE is difficult to access, according to Oei. The product is listed on Luxembourg's Euro MTF, a venue that lacks user-friendly distribution. Interactive Brokers, one of the largest global brokerage platforms, does not offer STRE, and many other retail-focused platforms also do not support trading in the instrument.

Then there is the lack of transparent historical pricing and reliable market data. Limited visibility across platforms such as TradingView hinders adoption, as investors struggle to assess liquidity and performance. At present, TradingView displays a $39 billion market capitalisation for STRE alongside trading volume of just 1.3k.

What will happen to STRE, given the issues it is facing? 

Oei suggests that STRE should be relisted on alternative venues. 

Dutch financial and trading infrastructure, for example, offers stronger distribution, deeper market making, tighter bid-ask spreads, and broader retail accessibility. These conditions are likely more conducive to scaling the adoption of the financial product.

While executive chairman Michael Saylor has previously played down expansion into markets such as Japan, it remains an open question whether Strategy will double down on Europe as a growth opportunity, or instead continue to focus primarily on the U.S. market, where it has four perpetual preferred share products.

After more than a decade building infrastructure for exchanges, financial institutions and central banks, R3 saw the market starting to bend in a new direction. About a year ago, the firm initiated a strategic reset, asking a simple but fundamental question: what is the best way for customers to move assets fully onchain?

Todd McDonald, R3's co-founder, said that process coincided with a deep review of the blockchain landscape. 

“We spoke to essentially all the layer ones and layer twos,” he explained in an interview with CoinDesk, as R3 evaluated where institutional capital markets were most likely to migrate. That work culminated in a strategic partnership with the Solana Foundation, announced last May at the blockchain's Accelerate conference, he said.

A layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of offchain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s.

The decision, McDonald said, was grounded in a long-term conviction that all markets will ultimately become onchain markets. 

“We think Solana is the best network for that future,” he said, pointing to its structure, throughput and trading-first design. R3 came to see Solana as “the Nasdaq of blockchains,” a venue purpose-built for high-performance capital markets rather than general experimentation.

Through its Corda blockchain platform, R3 supports more than $10 billion in assets and works with participants including HSBC, Bank of America, the Bank of Italy, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Swiss National Bank, Euroclear, SDX and SBI, he said.

Tokenization, the process of representing real-world assets such as stocks and bonds as digital tokens tradable on blockchain networks, has emerged as one of the key use cases drawing growing interest and investment from traditional financial institutions.

Activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) remains concentrated on a handful of chains, with Ethereum still the largest by total value locked (TVL), reflecting its deep liquidity, broad developer ecosystem and institutional adoption. However, Solana has emerged as one of the fastest-growing DeFi platforms, benefitting from high throughput, ultra-low fees and rapidly expanding user engagement. 

Recent data shows Solana's DeFi ecosystem holding more than $9 billion in TVL, making it one of the top networks outside Ethereum and its Layer 2s, and in some periods rivaling the combined DeFi activity of major Ethereum L2s. 

Solana's model has driven significantly higher onchain transaction volume and active wallets, especially for trading and high-frequency applications, even as Ethereum retains overall TVL dominance and the largest share of institutional assets.

Since that pivot last May, R3 has spent the past eight to nine months almost entirely focused on one problem: how to tokenize the next trillion dollars of assets and bring them onchain in a way that actually works for investors. That means not just issuing tokens, but designing products that existing onchain allocators want to use, and that traditional investors can grow into over time.

McDonald said R3 is already seeing a shift in focus on Solana toward capital formation and capital allocation, rather than pure speculation. 

Liquidity, McDonald argued, is the real bottleneck for tokenized real-world assets. 

“The beating heart of DeFi is borrow and lend,” he said. The breakthrough moment will come when a tokenized real-world asset can be treated as credible collateral on equal footing with native crypto assets. Today, limited liquidity, and in some cases rigid permissioning, discourages DeFi investors from engaging meaningfully with these products.

Rather than forcing demand, R3 is starting from where onchain appetite already exists. McDonald pointed to boom-and-bust cycles and notes that many sophisticated investors are now looking for yield that is more stable and less correlated to crypto markets.

“We're trying to bring these assets onchain and package them in a DeFi-native way,” he said, while working closely with existing allocators to improve access.

The firm's asset focus reflects that strategy. R3 is prioritizing higher-yielding products, with private credit as a core pillar. 

“You need a headline yield to get attention,” McDonald said, noting that returns around 10% tend to resonate strongly with onchain investors. At the same time, these products must balance return, liquidity and composability; a challenge given that private credit liquidity is often quarterly or “by appointment” in traditional markets.

Beyond private credit, R3 sees significant opportunity in trade finance, where McDonald said demand and supply are highly elastic. 

“If DeFi allocators really leaned into trade finance, the supply from the traditional world is enormous,” he explains, pointing to the sheer scale of the market and the potential for sustainable returns.

Trade finance is notoriously opaque, spanning fragmented jurisdictions, bespoke contracts and uneven data standards, which makes risk difficult to price, assets hard to standardize and liquidity slow to scale despite the market's enormous size.

On the issuer side, R3 is already working with household-name investment managers, alongside a longer tail of asset owners, from factories to shipping firms, who see tokenization as a new distribution channel and a new model for capital formation. The aim is not just to mirror off chain products, but to redesign them so they are investable, tradable and composable onchain.

Improving liquidity will also require more risk capital deployed directly onchain. McDonald said that while there are large native DeFi players today, participation remains narrow. 

“We need more diversity of balance sheets willing to put capital to work,” he said, alongside more flexible redemption mechanisms that give investors genuine choice.

That vision underpins R3's newly announced Corda Protocol. Built natively on Solana, the protocol introduces professionally curated, real-world-asset-backed yield vaults that issue liquid, redeemable vault tokens. Launching in the first half of 2026, the vaults are designed to give stablecoin holders access to tokenized debt instruments, funds and reinsurance-linked securities, without sacrificing DeFi-style liquidity or composability.

""Assets available through Corda will be supported by protocol-native liquidity layer, enabling instant swaps out of otherwise illiquid or liquidity-constrained assets for onchain investors. This unlocks the use of the assets as collateral at scale. The protocol will be integrated with top curators and lending protocols to power borrowing and levered position building,"" McDonald said.

In a sign of strong early demand, Corda has received more than 30,000 pre-registrations to date.

He framed the effort as a direct response to a growing gap in the market. As DeFi investors move away from purely speculative strategies, demand is rising for stable, diversified yield that is uncorrelated with crypto markets. While hundreds of billions of dollars in real-world assets are now represented onchain, most institutional-grade yield still forces capital to move off chain.

“Our goal is to close that gap,” McDonald said. “To bring Wall Street-quality assets onchain in a way that finally makes sense for DeFi, and to bring off chain capital into onchain markets at scale.”

Crypto watchers are speculating that video game retailer GameStop (GME) might be the latest firm to abandon its bitcoin BTC$89,561.83 treasury after moving all its coins to Coinbase this week.

Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant spotted on Friday that a wallet labeled GameStop had transferred all its stash – some 4,710 BTC, worth about $420 million at current prices – to Coinbase Prime, the U.S.-based crypto exchange's institutional arm. Blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence confirms the transfers.

GameStop announced the bitcoin purchase in May. While the company did not disclose how much it spent on the stash, CryptoQuant estimated it invested roughly $504 million at an average price of $107,900 per coin. If sold today at roughly $89,000 BTC price, the company would likely take a loss of around $84 million.

The maneuver has sparked speculation in crypto circles that GameStop may be exiting its bitcoin position. Especially so that it happened at a time when digital asset treasury firms are under increasing pressure as crypto markets tumbled over the past months, leaving them sitting on steep unrealized losses on their holdings. Some of them, like Ethereum-focused ETHZilla (ETHZ), already sold a significant chunk of their ether stash to trim their debt load.

While moving funds to Coinbase Prime, a platform catering to institutional clients, often signals an intent to sell, not all large transfers necessarily imply an imminent liquidation. 

Coinbase Prime also offers custodial services for institutions through its regulated trust company, which could, in theory, mean internal transfers and wallet management.

GameStop has not commented on the transfer yet.

How math can reveal lottery fraud

In one day, 433 people won the Philippine lottery jackpot. What were the chances?

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

Peter Dazeley/Getty Images

On October 1, 2022, something strange happened in the Philippines: 433 people won the jackpot in the local lottery. For this particular lotto, six numbers ranging in value from 1 to 55 were randomly selected, and the 433 winners all matched. Even more bizarre, when arranged in ascending order, the winning numbers were: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45 and 54. In other words, the winning numbers were multiples of 9 (9 × 1, 9 × 2, 9 × 3, etcetera). The curious coincidence drew international attention and accusations of suspicious behavior.

So, mathematically speaking, how likely is this outcome? When drawing numbers for the lottery, six numbers are chosen randomly from 55 possibilities, with no repeating numbers. The order the numbers are drawn in does not matter. We describe the number of possible combinations this process can result in as 55 choose 6. Which equals roughly 29 million. So the probability of these exact numbers being drawn is 1 in roughly 29 million. But every other possible outcome has a similar likelihood of around 1 in 29 million. To mathematically investigate the possibility of fraud, you have to level up the complexity and engage with Bayesian probability, which is exactly what the renowned mathematician and Fields Medal recipient Terence Tao did in an October 2022 blog post.

The real question we want answered is: What is the probability that these numbers will be drawn in a rigged lottery? And that, it turns out, is quite difficult to determine, because it depends not only on mathematically calculable quantities but also requires assumptions that do not necessarily have a scientific basis.

If you're familiar with statistics, at this point, you may realize we need to work with multiple hypotheses and the theory of Bayesian probability to examine this lottery scenario. If these topics are uncharted for you, don't worry! I can help.

First, there are essentially two hypotheses for us to consider. In the null hypothesis, we assume that nothing has been manipulated and the lottery draw is completely fair. In the alternative hypothesis, the lottery was somehow manipulated. You can already see this could get complicated because “somehow manipulated” is a very vague term and could encompass many scenarios. But let's try to work with what we have.

In Bayesian statistics the procedure is as follows: First, determine the probability of which of the two hypotheses is generally true. In other words, do we assume that these lotteries are fair, or do we assume that they're rigged more frequently? This question is subjective without a lot of inside knowledge on this topic. Some people may assume that most of the time the drawings are fair, meaning the null hypothesis is supported. Skeptics, meanwhile, may believe the alternative hypothesis is more probable.

Next, we can calculate how much an event alters these subjectively determined probabilities using Bayes's theorem. In this case the event is, of course, the six drawn lottery numbers remarkably all being multiples of 9. What is the probability that the event (the drawing) occurs under the assumption of the null hypothesis? We already calculated this at the beginning: the answer is approximately 1 in 29 million. And what is the probability that the event occurs under the assumption of the alternative hypothesis? Now it gets tricky again because we have to think through the scenarios in which the game could be rigged.

For example, the lottery on October 1, 2022, could have been manipulated by corrupt officials who fixed the numbers before the draw in order to share the winning outcome with a select few. If they drew the numbers randomly, then the probability of the aforementioned event occurring under the alternative hypothesis would still be 1 in 29 million—after all, in this scenario, the corrupt individuals would have drawn the numbers fairly; they just would have done so before the official draw.

Because the probabilities of the event occurring under both the alternative and the null hypotheses are the same, they cancel each other out. This means that the probabilities for the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis remain completely unchanged by this suspicious draw.

Of course, another assumption might be that if corrupt officials wanted to manipulate a specific draw and chose the numbers randomly beforehand, they would have rejected such a conspicuous set of numbers as 9, 18, 27, 36, 45 and 54. Taking this into account, the probability of the event occurring under the alternative hypothesis decreases, making that scenario less likely.

Another possibility is that this was not a deliberate manipulation but the result of a faulty machine that didn't randomize the numbers correctly. In this version of our alternative hypothesis, there are still more variables to consider that make it harder to determine probability.

One could, for example, assume that there was a machine malfunction that caused only unusual groups of numbers between 1 and 55 with a discernable pattern to be drawn. If so, the probability we are looking for is one using the set of all such unusual number groups. The probability of drawing the six multiples of 9 is quite high under this assumption, so it would seem as if the alternative hypothesis is supported, but the hypothesis is virtually refuted by the next lottery on October 3, 2022. On that day, the numbers drawn were 8, 10, 12, 14, 26, 51—a group of numbers without a discernible pattern. If this new event is incorporated into the Bayesian statistics, it reduces the likelihood of the alternative hypothesis to almost zero.

As Tao notes, there are other alternative hypotheses we can explore, but these, too, fail to produce a convincing result. He identifies three properties that an alternative hypothesis must fulfill to be statistically relevant:

The hypothesis needs to have a good likelihood of being true in general.

The alternative hypothesis must have a much higher probability of producing the specific event than the null hypothesis.

The alternative hypothesis must still make sense, given subsequent events that have been observed, such as the outcome of later lotteries.

Those three points offer us a guide for evaluating unusual events and the question of whether there might be something fishy afoot.

Toward the end of his blog post, Tao turned his statistical attention to one more question: Why would so many people—a full 433—select these same six numbers? Perhaps many people tend to choose numbers according to a specific pattern, such as a sequence of multiples of 9. A more convincing argument arises when one considers the layout of a lottery ticket in the Philippines, which arranges the numbers 9, 18, 27, 36, 45 and 54 along a diagonal. In other words, that geometric pattern could explain how people chose these numbers.

The new forensic science of proving what's real

As deepfakes blur the line between truth and fiction, we'll need a new class of forensic experts to determine what's real, what's fake and what can be proved in court

By Deni Ellis Béchard edited by Eric Sullivan

Imagine this scenario. The year is 2030; deepfakes and artificial-intelligence-generated content are everywhere, and you are a member of a new profession—a reality notary. From your office, clients ask you to verify the authenticity of photos, videos, e-mails, contracts, screenshots, audio recordings, text message threads, social media posts and biometric records. People arrive desperate to protect their money, reputation and sanity—and also their freedom.

All four are at stake on a rainy Monday when an elderly woman tells you her son has been accused of murder. She carries the evidence against him: a USB flash drive containing surveillance footage of the shooting. It is sealed in a plastic bag stapled to an affidavit, which explains that the drive contains evidence the prosecution intends to use. At the bottom is a string of numbers and letters: a cryptographic hash.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Your first step isn't to look at the video—that would be like traipsing through a crime scene. Instead you connect the drive to an offline computer with a write blocker, a hardware device that prevents any data from being written back to the drive. This is like bringing evidence into a sterile lab. The computer is where you hash the file. Cryptographic hashing, an integrity check in digital forensics, has an “avalanche effect” so that any tiny change—a deleted pixel or audio adjustment—results in an entirely different code. If you open the drive without protecting it, your computer could quietly modify metadata—information about the file—and you won't know whether the file you received was the same one that the prosecution intends to present. When you hash the video, you get the same string of numbers and letters printed on the affidavit.

Next you create a copy and hash it, checking that the codes match. Then you lock the original in a secure archive. You move the copy to a forensic workstation, where you watch the video—what appears to be security camera footage showing the woman's adult son approaching a man in an alley, lifting a pistol and firing a shot. The video is convincing because it's boring—no cinematic angles, no dramatic lighting. You've actually seen it before—it recently began circulating online, weeks after the murder. The affidavit notes the exact time the police downloaded it from a social platform.

Watching the grainy footage, you remember why you do this. You were still at university in the mid-2020s when deepfakes went from novelty to big business. Verification firms reported a 10-fold jump in deepfakes between 2022 and 2023, and face-swap attacks surged by more than 700 percent in just six months. By 2024 a deepfake fraud attempt occurred every five minutes. You had friends whose bank accounts were emptied, and your grandparents wired thousands to a virtual-kidnapping scammer after receiving altered photos of your cousin while she traveled through Europe. You entered this profession because you saw how a single fabrication could ruin a life.

The next step in analyzing the video is to run a provenance check. In 2021 the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) was founded to develop a standard for tracking a file's history. C2PA Content Credentials work like a passport, collecting stamps as the file moves through the world. If the video has any, you could track its creation and modifications. But most have been slow to adopt, and Content Credentials are often stripped as files circulate online. In a 2025 Washington Post test, journalists attached Content Credentials to an AI-generated video, but every major platform where they uploaded it stripped the data.

Next you open the file's metadata, though it rarely survives online transfers. The time stamps don't match the time of the murder. They were reset at some point—all are now listed as midnight—and the device field is blank. The software tag tells you the file was last saved by the kind of common video encoder used by social platforms. Nothing indicates the clip came directly from a surveillance system.

When you look up the public court filings in the homicide case, you learn that the owner of the property with the security camera was slow to respond to the police request. The surveillance system was set to overwrite data every 72 hours, and by the time the police accessed it, the footage was gone. This is what made the video's anonymous online appearance—with the murder shown from the exact angle of that security camera—a sensation.

You begin the Internet sleuthing that investigators call open-source intelligence, or OSINT. You instruct an AI agent to search for an earlier copy of the video. After eight minutes, it delivers the results. A video posted two hours before the police download shows a partial record that says the recording was made with a phone.

The reason you are finding the C2PA data is that companies such as Truepic and Qualcomm developed ways for phones and cameras to cryptographically sign content at the point of capture. What's clear now is that the video didn't come from a security camera.

You watch it again for physics that don't make sense. The slowed frames pass like a flip-book. You stare at shadows, at the lines of an alley door. Then, at the edge of a wall, light that shouldn't be there pulses. It's not a light bulb's flicker but a rhythmic shimmer. Someone filmed a screen.

The flicker is the sign of two clocks out of sync. A phone camera scans the world line by line, top to bottom, many times each second, whereas a screen refreshes in cycles—60, 90 or 120 times per second. When a phone records a screen, it can capture the shimmer of the screen updating. But this still doesn't tell you if the recorded screen showed the truth. Someone might have simply recorded the original surveillance monitor to save the footage before it was overwritten. To prove a deepfake, you have to look deeper.

You check for watermarks now—invisible statistical patterns inside the image. For instance, SynthID is Google DeepMind's watermark for Google-made AI content. Your software finds hints of what might be a watermark but nothing certain. Cropping, compression or filming a screen can damage watermarks, leaving only traces, like those of erased words on paper. This doesn't mean that AI generated the whole scene; it suggests an AI system may have altered the footage before the screen was recorded.

Next you run it through a deepfake detector like Reality Defender. The analysis flags anomalies around the shooter's face. You break the video apart into stills. You use the InVID-WeVerify plug-in to pull clear frames and do reverse-image searches on the accused son's face to see if it appeared in another context. Nothing comes up.

On the drive is other evidence, including more recent footage from the same camera. The brickwork lines up with the video. This isn't a fabricated scene.

You return to the shooter's face. The alley's lighting is harsh, casting a distinct grain. His jacket and hands and the wall behind him have its coarse digital noise, but his face doesn't. It's slightly smoother, from a cleaner source.

Security cameras give moving objects a distinct blur, and their footage is compressed. The shooter has that blur and blocky quality except for his face. You watch the video again, zoomed in on only the face. The outline of the jaw jitters faintly—two layers are ever so slightly misaligned.

You move back to when the shooter appears. He raises the weapon in his left hand. You call the woman. She tells you her son is right-handed and sends you videos of him playing sports as a teenager.

Lastly you go to the alley. The building's maintenance records list the camera at 12 feet high. You measure its height and downward angle, using basic trigonometry to calculate the shooter's height—three inches taller than the woman's son.

The video makes sense now—it was made by cloning the son's face, using an AI generator to superimpose it on the shooter and recording the screen with a phone to remove the generator's watermark. Cleverly, whoever did this chose a phone that would generate Content Credentials, so viewers would see a cryptographically signed claim that the clip was recorded on that phone and that no edits were declared after capture. By doing this, the video's maker essentially forged a certificate of authenticity for a lie.

The notarized document you will send to the public defender won't read like a thriller but like a lab report. In 2030 a “reality notary” is no longer science fiction; it is the person whose services we use to ensure that people and institutions are what they appear to be.

Astronomers at the International Centre of Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) have produced the largest low-frequency radio color image of the Milky Way ever assembled. The new image presents an extraordinary view of our galaxy as seen from the Southern Hemisphere, revealing the Milky Way across a broad range of radio wavelengths, often described as different colors of radio light.

By capturing the galaxy in this way, the image opens up powerful new opportunities to study how stars are born, how they evolve, and how they ultimately die within the Milky Way.

Years of Computing Power Behind the Image

The image was created by Silvia Mantovanini, a PhD student at the Curtin University node of ICRAR. She spent 18 months working on the project and used roughly 1M CPU hours on supercomputers at the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre. These systems were needed to process and combine massive amounts of data collected during two major sky surveys.

The observations were carried out with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) telescope, located at Inyarrimanha Ilgari Bundara, the CSIRO Murchison Radio-Astronomy Observatory on Wajarri Yamaji Country in Western Australia.

The data came from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey and its follow-up, GLEAM-X (GLEAM eXtended). GLEAM was observed over 28 nights during 2013 and 2014, while GLEAM-X gathered data across 113 nights from 2018 to 2020.

Sharper, Deeper, and Wider Than Before

Focusing specifically on our own galaxy, the new image represents a major leap forward compared with the earlier GLEAM image released in 2019. It delivers twice the resolution, ten times the sensitivity, and covers twice as much of the sky.

These improvements allow astronomers to examine the Milky Way in far greater detail than before, uncovering features that were previously difficult or impossible to see.

""This vibrant image delivers an unparalleled perspective of our Galaxy at low radio frequencies,"" Ms. Mantovanini said.

""It provides valuable insights into the evolution of stars, including their formation in various regions of the Galaxy, how they interact with other celestial objects, and ultimately their demise.""

Tracing Exploded Stars and Stellar Nurseries

Ms. Mantovanini's research focuses on supernova remnants, the expanding clouds of gas and energy created when a star explodes at the end of its life. While astronomers have already identified hundreds of these remnants, many researchers believe thousands more remain undiscovered.

The new image makes it easier to separate the material surrounding newly forming stars from the gas left behind by dead ones, revealing clearer structures throughout the galaxy.

""You can clearly identify remnants of exploded stars, represented by large red circles. The smaller blue regions indicate stellar nurseries where new stars are actively forming,"" Ms. Mantovanini said.

New Clues About Pulsars

The image may also help scientists better understand pulsars, the rapidly spinning remnants of massive stars. By analyzing how bright pulsars appear across different GLEAM-X frequencies, astronomers hope to learn more about how these objects produce radio waves and where they are distributed throughout the Milky Way.

A Milestone in Mapping the Milky Way

Associate Professor Natasha Hurley-Walker, a member of the same ICRAR team and the principal investigator of the GLEAM-X survey, highlighted the importance of the achievement for studying the structure of our galaxy.

""This low-frequency image allows us to unveil large astrophysical structures in our Galaxy that are difficult to image at higher frequencies,""

""No low-frequency radio image of the entire Southern Galactic Plane has been published before, making this an exciting milestone in astronomy.""

""Only the world's largest radio telescope, the SKA Observatory's SKA-Low telescope, set to be completed in the next decade on Wajarri Yamaji Country in Western Australia, will have the capacity to surpass this image in terms of sensitivity and resolution,"" concluded Associate Professor Hurley-Walker.

Tens of Thousands of Cosmic Sources Revealed

The surveys behind the image required hundreds of hours of observations using the MWA radio telescope at Inyarrimanha Ilgari Bundara, the CSIRO Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory. Using this data, ICRAR researchers catalogued around 98,000 radio sources across the portion of the Galactic Plane visible from the southern hemisphere.

These sources include pulsars, planetary nebulae, compact HII regions -- which are dense, ionized gas clouds in space -- as well as distant galaxies that lie far beyond the Milky Way.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New catalyst makes plastic upcycling 10x more efficient than platinum","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260124003806.htm","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 09:17:16 GMT","

Many common products, including plastics and detergents, rely on chemical reactions that depend on catalysts made from precious metals such as platinum. These metals are effective but costly and limited in supply. For years, scientists have been searching for alternatives that are cheaper and more sustainable. One promising option is tungsten carbide, an Earth-abundant material already widely used in industrial machinery, cutting tools, and chisels.

Despite its potential, tungsten carbide has not been easy to use as a catalyst. Its chemical behavior can be unpredictable, which has restricted its broader adoption. Researchers led by Marc Porosoff, an associate professor in the University of Rochester's Department of Chemical and Sustainability Engineering, have now made important progress that could allow tungsten carbide to compete with platinum in key chemical reactions.

Why Atomic Structure Matters

According to Sinhara Perera, a chemical engineering PhD student in Porosoff's lab, one of the main challenges lies in how tungsten carbide atoms arrange themselves.

Tungsten carbide's atoms can form many different configurations, known as phases, says Perera. These phases can strongly influence how well the material performs as a catalyst.

""There's been no clear understanding of the surface structure of tungsten carbide because it's really difficult to measure the catalytic surface inside the chambers where these chemical reactions take place,"" she says.

To address this problem, the research team designed a method to precisely control the structure of tungsten carbide during active reactions. In a study published in ACS Catalysis, Porosoff, Perera, and chemical engineering undergraduate student Eva Ciuffetelli '27 manipulated tungsten carbide particles at the nanoscale inside chemical reactors that operate at temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius.

Using a technique called temperature-programmed carburization, the researchers created tungsten carbide catalysts in specific phases directly inside the reactor. They then ran chemical reactions and analyzed which versions delivered the strongest performance.

""Some of the phases are more thermodynamically stable, so that's where the catalyst inherently wants to end up,"" says Porosoff. ""But other phases that are less thermodynamically stable are more effective as catalysts.""

The team identified one phase in particular, β-W2C, that showed exceptional performance in reactions that convert carbon dioxide into key building blocks for fuels and useful chemicals. With additional optimization by industry, the researchers believe this form of tungsten carbide could match platinum's effectiveness without its high price or supply limitations.

Turning Plastic Waste Into New Materials

Beyond carbon dioxide conversion, Porosoff and his collaborators have also explored tungsten carbide as a catalyst for recycling plastic waste. Their work focuses on upcycling, a process that transforms discarded plastics into higher-value products rather than lower-grade materials.

In a study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, led by Linxao Chen from the University of North Texas and supported by Porosoff and University of Rochester Assistant Professor Siddharth Deshpande, researchers demonstrated how tungsten carbide can drive a chemical process known as hydrocracking.

Hydrocracking breaks large molecules into smaller ones that can be reused to make new materials. In this case, the team targeted polypropylene, which is used in water bottles and many other plastic products.

While hydrocracking is common in oil and gas refining, applying it to plastic waste has proven difficult. The long polymer chains in single-use plastics are extremely stable, and contaminants in waste streams can quickly deactivate traditional catalysts. Platinum-based catalysts also rely on microporous structures that are too small for large plastic molecules to enter, limiting their effectiveness.

""Tungsten carbide, when made with the correct phase, has metallic and acidic properties that are good for breaking down the carbon chains in these polymers,"" says Porosoff. ""These big bulky polymer chains can interact with the tungsten carbide much easier because they don't have micropores that cause limitations with typical platinum-based catalysts.""

The results were striking. Tungsten carbide was not only far less expensive than platinum catalysts, but it was also more than 10 times as efficient in hydrocracking plastic waste. Researchers say this approach could open new pathways for recycling plastics and advancing a circular economy where materials are continuously reused.

Measuring Heat Where It Matters

A key factor behind these advances is the ability to precisely measure temperature on catalyst surfaces. Chemical reactions either absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic), and managing temperature is critical for efficiency. Many industrial processes rely on multiple reactions occurring together, making accurate temperature control even more important.

Current temperature measurement methods provide only rough averages, which can hide critical variations at the catalyst surface. This lack of precision makes it difficult to fully understand and reproduce catalytic behavior.

To solve this problem, the research team adopted optical measurement techniques developed in the lab of Andrea Pickel, a visiting professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. In a study published in EES Catalysis, they described a new method for directly measuring temperatures inside chemical reactors.

""We learned from this study that depending on the type of chemistry, the temperature measured with these bulk readings can be off by 10 to 100 degrees Celsius,"" says Porosoff. ""That's a really significant difference in catalytic studies where you're trying to ensure that measurements are reproducible and that multiple reactions can be coupled.""

Using this technique, the team examined tandem catalyst systems in which heat released by one reaction drives another reaction that requires heat input. Better matching these reactions can reduce wasted energy and improve overall efficiency.

Porosoff says the method could influence how catalysis research is conducted more broadly, encouraging more accurate measurements, stronger reproducibility, and more reliable results across the field.

Funding and Support

The ACS Catalysis study was supported by the Sloan Foundation and the Department of Energy. The Journal of the American Chemical Society research received funding from the National Science Foundation. The EES Catalysis study was funded by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority through the Carbontech Development Initiative.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Brain waves could help paralyzed patients move again","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260124073926.htm","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:37:21 GMT","

People with spinal cord injuries often lose the ability to move their arms or legs. In many cases, the nerves in the limbs remain healthy, and the brain continues to function normally. The loss of movement happens because damage to the spinal cord blocks signals traveling between the brain and the body.

This disconnect has led researchers to search for ways to restore communication without repairing the spinal cord itself.

Testing EEG as a Noninvasive Solution

In a study published in APL Bioengineering by AIP Publishing, scientists from universities in Italy and Switzerland explored whether electroencephalography (EEG) could help bridge this gap. Their research focused on determining whether EEG could capture brain signals linked to movement and potentially reconnect them with the body.

When a person attempts to move a paralyzed limb, the brain still produces electrical activity associated with that action. If these signals can be detected and interpreted, they could be sent to a spinal cord stimulator that activates the nerves responsible for movement in that limb.

Moving Beyond Brain Implants

Most earlier studies relied on surgically implanted electrodes to record movement signals directly from the brain. Although these systems have shown encouraging results, the research team wanted to investigate whether EEG could offer a safer option.

EEG systems are worn as caps covered with electrodes that record brain activity from the scalp. While the setup may appear complex, the researchers say it avoids the risks involved with placing devices inside the brain or spinal cord.

""It can cause infections; it's another surgical procedure,"" said author Laura Toni. ""We were wondering whether that could be avoided.""

Challenges in Reading Movement Signals

Using EEG to decode movement attempts pushes the limits of current technology. Because EEG electrodes sit on the surface of the head, they struggle to capture signals that originate deeper within the brain.

This limitation is less problematic for movements involving the arms and hands. Signals controlling the legs and feet are harder to detect because they come from areas located closer to the center of the brain.

""The brain controls lower limb movements mainly in the central area, while upper limb movements are more on the outside,"" said Toni. ""It's easier to have a spatial mapping of what you're trying to decode compared to the lower limbs.""

Machine Learning Helps Interpret Brain Activity

To better analyze the EEG data, the researchers used a machine learning algorithm designed to work with small and complex datasets. During testing, patients wore EEG caps while attempting a series of simple movements. The team recorded the resulting brain activity and trained the algorithm to sort the signals into different categories.

The system successfully distinguished between moments when patients tried to move and when they remained still. However, it had difficulty telling different movement attempts apart.

What Future Research Could Achieve

The researchers believe their method can be improved with further development. They plan to refine the algorithm so it can recognize specific actions such as standing, walking, or climbing. The team also hopes to explore how these decoded signals could be used to activate implanted stimulators in patients recovering from spinal cord injuries.

If successful, this approach could move noninvasive brain scanning closer to helping people regain meaningful movement after paralysis.

You have to be careful with budget laptops. They all have flaws and compromises, and you have to be aware of the trade-offs. With budget gaming laptops, that's even more true.

These machines aren't thin, quiet, or overly powerful. Many times, they have low-quality screens and keyboards. But there are a few that stand out, managing to walk the tightrope while keeping the price low. These gaming laptops aren't perfect, but they're all under $1,000 and offer a solid gaming experience for the money if your budget is tight.

There is only one gaming laptop selling for under $1,000 that doesn't make any significant trade-offs to the experience of using a modern laptop. That's this one, the Lenovo LOQ 15 (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It comes with an Nvidia RTX 5060 laptop graphics card, for one thing, meaning you get solid frame rates in games, without needing to depend on image upscaling through Nvidia's DLSS technology or frame generation. The advantage in performance over RTX 5050 laptops, like the MSI Cyborg A15 (see below), is substantial—anywhere between 11 and 40 percent depending on the benchmark. I was impressed by the performance across a suite of games, even though the system gets undeniably loud under heavy load.

The display is even more surprising, though. So many gaming laptops under $1,000 (and cheap laptops in general) use dim, crummy-looking screens with terrible colors. Sorry, not sorry. But the LOQ 15 looks fantastic by comparison. It's still only 1920 x 1080 resolution, but the colors are more vibrant, covering 100 percent of the sRGB color space. It can also be cranked up to 347 nits of brightness, which is bright enough as long as you're not gaming by a window. The significantly better screen makes the LOQ 15 a far better option as a laptop that can be used for school or work just as enjoyably as it is for gaming. On that note, I love the clicky keyboard, which feels tactile and fast to type on. Even the touchpad has a smooth, responsive surface.

If you want to go cheaper, Lenovo offers an RTX 5050 model that uses the same CPU. At the time of writing, this brought the price of the LOQ 15 to just $780. You get the same good display and keyboard, with less performance.

Acer

Amazon (Ryzen 5)

Occasionally, a product gets so heavily discounted that it makes some of its unsavory elements more acceptable. That's true of the Acer Nitro V 16 (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The display is bright enough and has a fast refresh rate of 180 Hz, but the colors are an issue. As I saw in my tests, the color accuracy and gamut are wildly off, resulting in some funky, desaturated color. It's not enough to ruin the gaming experience entirely, but it's a serious downgrade from the Lenovo LOQ 15. I like that this is the only option in this guide with a more modern, 16:10 aspect-ratio screen. That gives you more screen space and thinner bezels.

The other big issue with the Acer Nitro V 16, however, has to do with the power supply. It only comes with a 135-watt charger rather than a larger 180-watt brick that most RTX 5050 laptops have. While the smaller power brick is nice, it means you can't run intensive games in Turbo mode without draining the battery—even while plugged in. The default Balanced mode doesn't have that problem; it's problematic for long-term battery health, and it just feels wrong. I've been told that the updated 2026 model will fix this problem, but it's not available yet.

Even with those issues, the price is undeniable. You won't find a cheaper gaming laptop that's this powerful, which gives it an upper edge for anyone looking to save as much as possible. There's also a 15-inch model with a 16:9 aspect ratio, an RTX 5050, and an Intel processor. It's slightly more expensive, though, and has a 16:9 aspect-ratio display.

MSI

Walmart

Best Buy

Amazon (Intel)

The MSI Cyborg A15 has a lot in common with the Lenovo LOQ 15. It's the only other gaming laptop with an RTX 5060 currently selling for under $1,000. That alone makes it worthy of mention, though the LOQ 15 has two major upgrades over the Cyborg: the higher-quality IPS display and the higher-resolution webcam. Unfortunately, MSI cut some corners with the Cyborg A15, especially with its 720p webcam. The Cyborg A15 even comes with one less USB-A port.

Still, there's a lot to like. The touchpad and keyboard are both nice, and if you like a colorful machine, the Cyborg gives you three-zone RGB backlighting. It's also a more portable design, with a smaller footprint and thinner chassis—even slightly lighter.

Availability is tough on this one right now, though. I tested the RTX 5050 model, which is available only via preorder at the moment. While this configuration is over $1,000, it comes with a terabyte of storage. Fortunately, cheaper versions are available with the more powerful RTX 5060, even under $1,000.

What You Should Look For in a Cheap Gaming Laptop

Most cheap gaming laptops share a lot in common. They're all usually between 0.8 and 1 inch thick and tend to have bare-bones gaming-capable hardware. Here are some of the key specs to look for:

Display: 15-inch or 16-inch display. Depending on the aspect ratio, they'll have basic displays with a standard 1920 x 1080 or 1920 x 1200 resolution. You won't find higher-resolution panels on gaming laptops under $1,000. Also, take a look at the refresh rate. 144 Hz is the standard, but the higher the better for less motion blur and smoother animation. While OLED and mini-LED are more common in higher-end gaming laptops, all budget-oriented options use LED IPS.

CPU: The latest processors from Intel and AMD will all be here, and in the budget tier, the differences aren't as significant as in higher-end options. For AMD, that's usually either the Ryzen 5 220 or Ryzen 7 250. Intel's latest gaming chips in this price range are Intel Core Ultra 5 225H or Core Ultra 7 240H. While Intel has announced its next-gen Core Ultra Series 3 chips, these still haven't come out just yet.

GPU: We're currently in Nvidia's RTX 50-series graphics cards, which came out at the beginning of 2025. In gaming laptops under $1,000, you'll be stuck with either the RTX 5050 or 5060. These likely won't be replaced until at least 2027, so it's safe to buy these for now.

Memory: You want at least 16 GB of RAM, and that's typically what you'll be stuck with in budget gaming laptops. Many gaming laptops let you upgrade RAM yourself later, though with the price of stand-alone memory these days, it might not be a bad idea to configure it with 32 GB upfront.

Storage: Gaming laptops start at 512 GB, and that will be enough for most. Upgrading to 1 terabyte isn't a bad idea, though, whether that's configured up-front or doing it yourself later. You can always store games on an external hard drive, but with the size of games these days, the more storage you have the better.

What About Older Gaming Laptops?

The laptops above are the cheapest gaming laptops you should buy, but as you'll discover with some research, there are some even lower-priced options out there—some as low as $500 or $600. Most come with older graphics cards and processors, meaning you're getting a dip in performance. This is especially true if you buy something like an RTX 3050 or 2050. The RTX 50 series is the latest version, which came out at the beginning of 2025. The RTX 40 series was announced in 2023, meaning anything older than that is well over three years old. I wouldn't recommend anything that old, especially not if it was already budget-oriented. I haven't seen anything cheap enough that would make me think you shouldn't go with one of the RTX 50 series options above instead.

Take a look at this older version of the Lenovo LOQ 15, which has an RTX 3060 (and a different design) and is currently selling for $550. That's only $50 more than the Acer Nitro V 16 with the RTX 5050, which is more powerful, comes with more VRAM, and has multiframe generation. It's clearly the better purchase and will last you longer before you feel the urge to upgrade.

Other Cheap Gaming Laptops to Consider

There are a few other affordable gaming laptops I haven't tested yet that are worth considering. Asus and Dell both have RTX 5050 options, but neither is under $1,000. The Asus ROG A14 is out there, but I can't find a version cheaper than $1,270. Meanwhile, the Alienware Aurora 16 starts at $1,200 at Dell.com but is currently on sale for $899 at Walmart. It's definitely on my list to test next, as Alienware generally has great build quality.

If you're willing to spend a bit more, you'll find gaming laptops over $1,000 with more memory and storage, higher-quality displays (sometimes even OLED), thinner chassis, and most importantly, more powerful CPUs and GPUs. At the time of writing, the cheapest RTX 5070 gaming laptop came in at $1,500 when on sale. That goes up to $1,879 for the most affordable RTX 5070 Ti gaming laptop on sale. That should give you an idea of how performance scales up from what is considered “budget.” Read our Best Gaming Laptops guide for more high-end picks.

How We Test Budget Gaming Laptops

Here at WIRED, we test budget gaming laptops the same way we test high-priced ones. Gaming comes first, and we run a series of in-game benchmarks to establish a baseline that can be compared apples-to-apples, including titles from different genres like Cyberpunk 2077, Marvel Rivals, and Monster Hunter: Wilds. This spits out a score, yes, but while it's running, we pay attention to factors like fan noise, internal temperatures, and surface temperatures. We also test the game in more realistic scenarios to get a feel for how all the elements of the system come together, including the screen. We also use other CPU and GPU benchmarks like 3DMark Steel Nomad and Cinebench to evaluate performance.

Speaking of the screen, we use a colorimeter to test the breadth and accuracy of the colors, the peak brightness, and the contrast. These are all important and contribute to the overall experience of using the laptop both in and out of gaming. We also test battery life in local video playback. This is not so much for gaming, but more to see how well it works for other work or for school. We also test out the speakers and webcam to see how they hold up.

Lastly, we handle these laptops to get a sense for durability, build quality, and usability. That means typing on the keyboard, swiping on the touchpad, opening and closing the hinge, carrying it from place to place, and applying pressure to the lid and palm rests. Add in the included specs, price, and configuration options, and it comes together in something that I'd either personally recommend or not. For budget-oriented devices, price is given more weight in this evaluation. If one gaming laptop costs more than another, it needs to add something that offers a qualitative benefit.

Miniaturization has long been a challenge in the history of robotics.

While engineers have made great strides in the miniaturization of electronics in the past few decades, builders of miniature autonomous robots have not been able to meet the goal of getting them under 1 millimeter in size. This is because small arms and legs are fragile and difficult to manufacture. Above all, the circumstances of the laws of physics change in the microscopic world. Instead of gravity and inertia, drag and viscosity become dominant.

Against this backdrop, researchers in the US have announced the results of a study that accomplishes a 40-year-old challenge. A team of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan has developed a new robot that is smaller than a grain of salt, measuring only 200 x 300 x 50 micrometers. At 0.3 mm on its longest side, that's far below the 1-mm threshold. Yet it can sense its surroundings, make decisions on its own, and swim and move in water.

This experimental robot is smaller than a grain of salt.

Moreover, it operates completely autonomously and is not dependent on any external controls such as wires or magnetic fields. The production cost is said to be as low as 1 cent per unit.

“We have succeeded in miniaturizing an autonomous robot to 1/10,000th the size of a conventional robot,” says Mark Miskin, one of the researchers, who's an assistant professor of electrical systems engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. “This opens up a whole new scale for programmable robots.”

The propulsion system developed by Miskin and his team is a breakthrough in conventional robotics. Fish and other large aquatic organisms move forward due to the reaction of water pushing backward, in accordance with the third law of motion in Newtonian mechanics. But pushing water on a microscopic scale is like pushing sludgy tar. The viscosity of the water is so great that small arms and legs can never compete with it.

So the researchers adopted a completely new approach. Instead of swimming by moving parts of its body, the new robot moves by generating an electric field around it and gently pushing charged particles in the liquid. The robot exploits the phenomenon that moving charged particles drag nearby water molecules, creating a water current around the robot. It is as if the robot itself is not moving, but the ocean or river is moving.

This image shows the movement of charged particles generated around a robot moving in liquid.

The robot is driven by light from an LED and can move a distance equal to its body length in a maximum of one second. The direction of movement can be changed by adjusting the electric field, and the robot can follow complex paths or move in groups like a school of fish.

The greatest advantage of this method of movement is its extremely high durability due to the absence of moving parts. According to Miskin, it can swim continuously for months on end.



Propulsion alone is not enough to achieve true autonomy. Autonomous robots must sense their environment and make decisions about how to navigate it. All of this must be controlled by a chip measuring less than 1 mm. David Blau and his team at the University of Michigan took on this challenge.

Blau and his team hold the record for building the world's smallest computer. When they first met Miskin at a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency presentation, they were convinced that their technologies would complement each other perfectly. It took five years for the idea to actually take shape.

The biggest obstacle to making the tiny robot work, he says, was power. The robot's solar panels generate only 75 nanowatts of power. That is less than 1/100,000th of the power consumed by a smartwatch. To solve this problem, the team designed a special circuit that operates at extremely low voltages. This successfully reduced the power consumption to a sustainable level.

Space constraints were another hurdle. The solar panels took up most of the surface, leaving little space for the computational infrastructure. So the researchers radically rethought the program, which required many instructions, and condensed it into a single special instruction, which they were able to fit into the robot's small memory space.

These robots can be manufactured in units of several hundred at once.

The robot is equipped with an electronic sensor that can detect minute temperature changes. However, because its microscopic body can't carry robust communications components, the robot uses a method borrowed from the insect kingdom to transit the measurements it detects.

The robot is programmed to translate the sensor readings into “dance moves.” The researchers use a microscope to observe the robot's movements and decode the information. “This is very similar to the way honeybees communicate with each other,” Blau explains.

In addition to this, each robot is given a unique ID and is designed to upload different instructions to different units. This allows multiple robots to play different roles in performing large tasks collaboratively.

Each individual robot is equipped with a complete onboard computer that can receive and execute instructions autonomously.

According to the team, this is the first time a complete computer with a processor, memory, and sensors has been mounted on a robot less than 1 mm in size. The micro-robot functions on the same scale as a microbe, which could be useful for applications such as helping doctors monitor individual cells and helping engineers assemble tiny devices.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This Mega Snowstorm Will Be a Test for the US Supply Chain","https://www.wired.com/story/here-comes-a-mega-snowstorm-shipping-logistics/","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 01:19:38 GMT","

Here it comes. Up to two-thirds of the US is facing down the threat of serious snow, cold, and ice this weekend, with the potential to snarl roads (and the businesses that depend on them) from Texas up to New York City. At this point, grocery stores, logistics experts, warehouse operators, and trucking companies have been prepping for days. Still, the effects on the supply chain—and the retail store shelves that depend on them—are yet to be determined.

On one hand, this is winter business as usual. Snowstorms happen every year, and the freight industry has a playbook.

“If you're a retailer, this happens all the time,” says Chris Caplice, the chief scientist at the transportation management firm DAT Freight & Analytics. “For people in the supply chain, this is just another Tuesday.”

On the other hand, the places where this storm is happening, and its breadth, pose an extra challenge.

“This one's kinda tough, because you don't have a lot of snow storms hitting the states that this one is hitting,” says Chris Long, the executive vice president of operations at Capstone Logistics, a third-party logistics firm. Affected southern states, including Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, are often equipped to handle hurricanes, with networks of distribution centers set up to disburse what's often needed after that sort of storm: generators, water, plywood. But if roads in those states, less equipped for cold, freeze over for several days—“the worst-case scenario,” Long says—buyers might see shortages of some perishable items, including food and pharmaceuticals.

To prevent that, retailers have spent the last few days positioning specific inventory they know customers will want—say, snow shovels, bottled water, canned goods, de-icer—in local distribution warehouses, where it can quickly get to store shelves. Large trucking companies have situated their vehicles and staff where they'll likely be needed; independent truckers have likely vacated the road.

Next week, as everyone digs or thaws out of whatever the storm has wrought, freight prices will likely spike, says Caplice, as freight companies try to get the supply chain chugging again. But this sort of shock is likely priced into retailers' businesses—it's winter, after all—and won't affect the prices customers see at checkout. This year, uncertainty in the freight industry around tariffs and immigration is a much bigger deal, he says. “This will be a blip.”

Whatever the next few days bring, companies are likely better equipped to respond than they were before the pandemic, when lockdowns sent global supply chains into turmoil. “When I first got into the industry it was all about ‘just-in-time,'” says Long, who worked for years in the grocery industry. The pandemic made retailers, and the freight businesses supporting them, more focused on stocking up to survive the unexpected. “We're in a way better place,” he says.

Water filters are a booming fear-based economy. But people have good reasons to be leery of their drinking water—chlorine, microplastics, PFAS everywhere, heavy metals in the groundwater, whatever else bothers me tomorrow.

But while most water filters seem to make many promises, only some back them up with independent third-party lab tests—something I've been sad to discover while testing and researching countertop, under-sink, and shower water filters. I'm downright relieved when I see the letters NSF or IAPMO, two of the main independent labs and certifying bodies based in the United States.

Those are the bodies that tested and certified filters from California-based Clearly Filtered, whose pitchers and under-sink systems I've been testing this month alongside a number of other brands. This is relevant, because Clearly is offering discounts on all of its filters right now. This includes a 10-percent-off blanket deal on all filters bought through its website, and 19 percent off if you enter your phone number to receive a promo code.

Clearly Filtered is a bit different from one of its main competitors, ZeroWater, whose filters I'm also testing. ZeroWater removes pretty much all total dissolved solids, including minerals like calcium and magnesium, from water that has passed through its filter. This is an utterly thorough approach, but I've also noted it usually doesn't taste quite as good as water that still has some mineral content.

Clearly Filtered

Clearly Filtered's water pitcher uses a carbon filter and other media to remove a number of substances, including free chlorine, PFAS and PFOA, and other heavy metals. But it doesn't remove the mineral content or lower the total dissolved solids in your water at all. In part because of the activated carbon filter, my testing showed that the filter actually slightly increased the total dissolved solids. (Trace amounts of activated carbon are not a problem: if anything, some think it's good for you.)

Clearly certifies its water pitcher to filter out chlorine and PFAS to international NSF specifications. The company also released lab results from IAPMO lab in New Jersey showing the reduction or near-elimination of hundreds of other contaminants that don't all have corresponding international standards. (See all IAPMO lab results here.)

The resulting water still tastes pleasantly like the semi-soft water that comes out of my tap, minus nearly all of the chloramine (the chlorine compound used to disinfect my water in Portland, Oregon). The pitcher filter takes about 13 minutes to filter a half-gallon of water from the top reservoir into the bottom reservoir. But note that the priming process is a bit awkward, involving squeezing water through a somewhat fragile plastic bag to force it through the filter. This bag is then meant to be kept for future filters, or bought again for $15 if you lose or puncture it.

A 32-ounce stainless steel water bottle uses similar filtration technology as the pitcher but requires that you suck water through a filter attached to the washable drinking spout—a solution that lets you filter water out in the wild, wherever you may find it. You'll have to suck pretty hard on the straw to pull water through the filter, but it's a mostly elegant solution to instant water filtration—similar in concept to some backpacking filter straws but a lot more socially acceptable.

But the filtration system that I find most useful at home is Clearly Filtered's three-stage under-sink system. In part, it solves a problem for me. A goodly percentage of under-sink water filter systems require some level of installation, space for a separate tap, or even integration with a faucet. As a renter, this makes them difficult for me to consider.

But the under-sink filter from Clearly installs in-line with the water line and works with your existing tap. It took me less than five minutes to install, without drilling a single hole or having to call my landlord. All I had to do was shut off my cold water line, unscrew the water line at the valve, and attach the water lines to the appropriate connections on the Clearly Filtered system.

It's a more expensive system than the others from Clearly Filtered, but it does not require filling and refilling a pitcher that takes up space in my fridge or on my counter. It also lowered my water flow rate a little, but not enough to bother me. The lab-reported filtration levels for PFAS are also as good as I could expect, at or near 99 percent in most cases. My own chemical testing showed that the three-stage filter removed chloramine in my water system to undetectable levels. (The pitcher filter almost, but not quite, achieved this.)

Note that priming the three-stage filters does take at least 15 minutes of running out the tap, though I'd say I needed to run the water for a half hour before total dissolved solids went back down to normal levels. This mirrored my experience with the pitcher, which also required a few extra filtration cycles to prime fully.

Anyway, none of the Clearly Filtered systems are at the bottom of the market, price-wise. So the discounts are much appreciated, especially on the three-stage system, where percentage discounts pay off the most.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

With AI weaving itself into the fabric of the global economy, executives are turning to creative solutions to power this new workforce. At the forefront of these conversations are an increasing need for security to mitigate enterprise risk.

One company balancing the ROI of rapid AI expansion with guardrails around an expectation gap and vulnerability exposure is Rubrik.

“The number one thing stopping AI acceleration actually isn't that it's difficult to build models or agents anymore,” Dev Rishi, GM of AI at the company tells GeekWire Studios during a conversation at AWS re:Invent 2025. “It's really security and risk.”

To illustrate these challenges, Rishi shares three critical issues that organizations must solve to unlock AI's value:

“With AI agents, you have the potential for 10x the damage in one-tenth the time,” Rishi warns.One solution to tackle these challenges is Rubrik Agent Cloud, a comprehensive platform that addresses all three risk dimensions.

The platform starts with a single pane of glass across various AI platforms, tracking what agents are running, their potential impact, and the type, and scope of, data they can access. Integrating natively, and through gateway-based traffic observation, these tools work with multiple platforms including those available on AWS.

During re:Invent, Rubrik announced a key integration with AWS Bedrock Agent Core, enabling seamless observability for agents running on one of the industry's most popular AI platforms. “You need to have native hooks into the most popular areas so you can have a turnkey experience for observability,” Rishi explains.

Monitoring the scope and potential impact of AI systems is the first step, but the ability to undo destructive action by AI Agents is where Rubrik's AI Agent Rewind steps in. Using Rubrik's protected backup data, the ability to revert changes creates what is essentially a time machine for AI operations.

While Rubrik has long been known for data resilience, (first for disaster recovery, then for ransomware protection), the evolution of their core mission is clear.

“Over the next 3 to 5 years, it's going to be about being resilient to the next generation of the AI workforce,” Rishi predicts. “Today, all employees go through background checks, they're manual, and they operate at human speed. Increasingly, organizations are going to be operating at AI speed, and they're going to need an infrastructure system that can support that.”

Weaving these intelligent observability tools, governance systems, and risk management models into the core of your AI-powered agents will provide the resilience necessary to unlock the transformative power of AI investments. Rubrik provides timely solutions to meet the challenges of the coming AI workforce.

They're rivals in the cloud, and competitors for customers and talent. But Microsoft and Amazon are on the same page when it comes to Washington state's housing crisis — literally, in the case of an op-ed Friday and full-page ad last Sunday in The Seattle Times.

The Seattle region “faces a housing emergency that threatens our state's quality of life, health and economic competitiveness,” write Brad Smith, Microsoft's vice chair and president, and David Zapolsky, Amazon's chief global affairs and legal officer.

It was an unusual joint byline, to say the least, but it reflected the similar big-picture goals of their separate housing initiatives. 

Combined, the two companies have committed $1.6 billion to preserve and build more than 26,000 affordable homes in the region. But the executives say even that isn't enough, framing the problem as a supply issue that requires building “more homes of all kinds.”

They're backing several bills in the current legislative session, including SB 6026, which would allow residential development on commercial land like strip malls and big-box stores. They also praise Gov. Bob Ferguson's proposed $225 million in bonds for the state Housing Trust Fund.

“Going forward, legislators must commit to a simple test: If a policy makes housing more costly or takes longer to build, don't pass it. Consider an alternative,” they write. “Enact policies that pencil in today's market, not aspirational measures that might work down the line.”

They warn that other states are moving faster to attract developers. “Capital is fluid,” they write. “Banks, investors and lenders are going where they can make predictable returns.”

The joint push comes after Microsoft released a report last week outlining lessons learned from its housing investments. Read our earlier coverage for more details.

With the change in TikTok ownership, TikTok users in the U.S. are collectively freaking out over the company's updated privacy policy after being alerted to the changes through an in-app message. The revised document details the U.S. joint venture's conditions for using its service, including the specific location information it may collect. Many users are also posting to social media about language found in the policy, which says that TikTok could collect sensitive information about its users, including their “sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status.”

But despite the panic, this disclosure isn't new — and it doesn't mean what many users fear. The same language appeared in TikTok's privacy policy before the ownership deal closed, and it's primarily there to comply with state privacy laws like California's Consumer Privacy Act, which requires companies to agree to disclose to consumers what “sensitive information” is collected. Similar disclosures appear in other social media apps' policies.

To understand why users are concerned — and why the policy reads this way — it helps to look at both the current political climate and the legal requirements TikTok is navigating.

Specifically, the policy states that TikTok could process information from users' content or what they may share through surveys, including information about their “racial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information.”

It's not surprising that Americans would find this type of language troubling, especially given the current political climate.

The escalation of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration has led to widespread protests across the country, which have now come to a head in Minnesota. On Friday, hundreds of businesses closed their doors in an economic blackout to protest the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the state. The move follows weeks of clashes between Minnesota residents and ICE agents, which have led to thousands of arrests and the death of American citizen Renée Good.

But the privacy policy language predates these concerns. In TikTok's earlier policy, updated on August 19, 2024, the company explained that some of the information it collects and uses may “constitute sensitive personal information” under state privacy laws.

It then proceeded to list those same categories as examples. The legal reason is straightforward.

The policy's specificity around types of “sensitive information” has to do with state privacy laws, like California's California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The latter, for instance, requires businesses to inform consumers when they collect “sensitive information,” which the law defines as including things like:

Of note, citizenship and immigration status were specifically added to the category of “sensitive personal information” when California Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB-947 into law on October 8, 2023. 

Because of the in-app alert timed to the deal's closure (a requirement because of the new legal entity), many people are now reading through TikTok's terms for the first time. Seeing this language and fearing the worst, they are posting to social media about their concerns and warning others; some are even threatening to delete their accounts.

But what TikTok's policy is actually saying is that, as part of operating its app, it may process sensitive information — especially if it's the subject of someone's video — and that it's agreeing to process that sensitive information “in accordance with applicable law.”

The policy even references the CCPA by name, as an example of the applicable laws TikTok is agreeing to. 

“TikTok is required under those laws to notify users in the privacy policy that the sensitive personal information is being collected, how it is being used, and with whom it is being shared,” explains Jennifer Daniels, a partner at the law firm Blank Rome, where she provides counsel on regulatory and general corporate law matters.

Her colleague, Philip Yannella, co-chair of Blank Rome's Privacy, Security, and Data Protection Practice, points out that TikTok likely decided to include this language in its privacy policy because of litigation concerns. For instance, he says that lately, he has seen several demands under the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) from plaintiffs' lawyers who alleged “the collection of racial, immigration, and ethnic data.”

A similar type of disclosure to TikTok's can be found in other social media apps, though some companies keep the explanations more high-level, while others, like TikTok, will list out the precise categories that are legally defined as “sensitive information” for additional clarity. 

Still, at least one lawyer consulted by TechCrunch noted that spelling out these specific sensitive details so precisely can actually make things less clear to the end users.

As a point of comparison, Meta's privacy policy gets fairly granular, too, though it doesn't specifically include “immigration status” as one of its examples of sensitive information:

Users on social media often share deeply personal topics, explains Ashlee Difuntorum, an associate at Kinsella Holley Iser Kump Steinsapir (KHIKS) and a business litigator with experience representing software and technology companies.

“TikTok is essentially saying that if you disclose something sensitive, that information becomes part of the content the platform technically ‘collects,'” she tells TechCrunch. “Policies like this often look alarming because they're written for regulators and litigators, not for ordinary consumers. That said, the wording can understandably strike users as intrusive when it's laid out so bluntly.”

 TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. 

Of course, sharing content on social media sites isn't without risk, particularly under authoritarian governments that target their own citizens. These apps collect gobs of data, and governments can enact laws to gain access to it. 

Ironically, the decision to move TikTok's U.S. operations to the U.S. under new ownership was due to this exact concern, but with China then seen as the potential threat.

Chinese laws require companies to assist with state intelligence and data security, including its 2017 National Intelligence Law and its 2021 Data Security Law. The fear among U.S. lawmakers was that TikTok's ownership by a Chinese entity, ByteDance, could put U.S. citizens at risk, either via surveillance or subtle changes to the app's algorithm designed to influence people or promote Chinese propaganda. 

Now, people in the U.S. are more worried about their own government's potential surveillance rather than China's.

Harvey, the high-flying legal AI startup, has acquired Hexus — a two-year-old startup that builds tools for creating product demos, videos, and guides — as the company continues its aggressive expansion amid fierce competition in the legal tech market.

Hexus founder and CEO Sakshi Pratap, who previously held engineering roles at Walmart, Oracle, and Google, tells TechCrunch that her San Francisco-based team has already joined Harvey, while the startup's India-based engineers will come onboard once Harvey establishes a Bangalore office. Pratap adds that she will lead an engineering team focused on accelerating Harvey's offerings for in-house legal departments.

“What we're bringing to Harvey is deep experience building enterprise AI tools in adjacent problem spaces,” Pratap said. “This expertise helps Harvey move faster in a market that's becoming increasingly competitive.”

Hexus had raised $1.6 million from Pear VC, Liquid 2 Ventures, and angel investors before the acquisition. While Pratap declined to share deal terms, she said the structure was aligned around “long-term team incentives.”

The acquisition comes as Harvey looks to cement its position as one of AI's hottest startups. The company confirmed last fall that it's now valued at $8 billion after raising $160 million, bringing its funding across 2025 to $760 million. Andreessen Horowitz led that newest round, joined by new investors T. Rowe Price and WndrCo, alongside existing backers Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Conviction, and angel investor Elad Gil. (It started the year with a $3 billion valuation after Sequoia led a $300 million Series D round in the company.)

Harvey now claims more than 1,000 clients across 60 countries, including a majority of the top 10 U.S. law firms.

When TechCrunch spoke with co-founder and CEO Winston Weinberg in November, he traced Harvey's origin story back to a cold email sent to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Weinberg, then a first-year associate at O'Melveny & Myers, and co-founder Gabe Pereyra, a researcher who worked at Google DeepMind and Meta and was Weinberg's roommate at the time, tested GPT-3 on landlord-tenant law questions from Reddit. When they showed the AI-generated answers to attorneys, two out of three said they'd send 86 of 100 responses with zero edits.

“That was the moment when we were like, wow, this entire industry can be transformed by this technology,” Weinberg said.

They emailed Altman on July 4, 2022, got on a call that same morning, and landed their first check from the OpenAI Startup Fund shortly after. According to Weinberg, the OpenAI Startup Fund remains Harvey's second-largest investor.

Apple's iPhone is gaining ground fast in India, shipping about 14 million units in 2025, based on market data shared exclusively with TechCrunch.

Yet the country's overall smartphone market stayed largely flat at around 152–153 million devices. That means that across the full-year of 2025, Apple's market share of shipments rose to a record 9%. This is up from 7% in 2024, Counterpoint Research data shows, making it the iPhone's strongest year yet in the world's second-largest smartphone market by volume.  

The gains were driven by the iPhone's product portfolio, growing aspirational demand and wider availability across sales channels, Counterpoint Research's director for devices and ecosystems, Tarun Pathak, said.

Apple has repeatedly pointed to India as a standout market in recent quarters, with CEO Tim Cook saying the company set an “all-time revenue record in India” on its last earnings call in October. CFO Kevan Parekh also said iPhone's active install base hit an all-time high in India and the company set a quarterly record for upgraders, highlighting Apple's push to expand its user base beyond just new buyers, though the company did not disclose detailed figures for India on the call.

Beyond shipments, Apple has been widening its footprint in India by ramping up local manufacturing and broadening its retail reach. Last month, the company opened its fifth Apple Store in the country — its first in Noida — as part of a broader retail expansion that began in 2023.

Apple is also sharpening its services pitch in India. Earlier this month, it introduced Apple Creator Studio — a subscription bundle of creative apps such as Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro — priced at ₹399 a month ($4.35) in India. That's around 66% cheaper than the $12.99 a month it charges in the U.S., underscoring how the company is tailoring pricing to deepen its reach in the country.

That strong iPhone year came against a market that has largely stopped growing. India is set to log its fourth straight year at about the same shipment level of 152 million units, Counterpoint estimates, with the October–December quarter down 8–10% year-over-year despite the festive season.

Longer replacement cycles, fewer feature phone users upgrading to smartphones, and the growing popularity of refurbished devices are among the key reasons the market has struggled to grow, Pathak told TechCrunch.

Even as overall shipments stagnated, India's premium segment continued to expand. Smartphones priced above ₹30,000 (around $327) grew 15% year-over-year in 2025 and accounted for a record 23% of total shipments — the highest share ever — according to Counterpoint.

That shift has helped brands with stronger premium portfolios, including Apple, gain ground even as the mass market slowed.

By volume, China's Vivo led India's smartphone market in 2025 with a 23% share of shipments, per Counterpoint, followed by Samsung at 15% and Xiaomi at 13%.

Apple remained outside India's top three by shipments despite its record year, underlining how the market is still dominated by mass-market Android brands even as premium devices take a growing share.

Counterpoint expects India's smartphone market to slip about 2% in 2026, warning that rising memory prices could squeeze demand in the sub-₹15,000 (under-$170) segment and force phone makers to cut cashback offers, trim specifications or raise prices. Even so, average selling prices are forecast to rise 5% in 2026 after a 9% increase in 2025, suggesting the premiumization trend is set to continue.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Yann LeCun's new venture, AMI Labs, has drawn intense attention since the AI scientist left Meta to found it. This week, the startup finally confirmed what it's building — and several key details have been hiding in plain sight.

On its newly launched website, the startup disclosed its plans to develop “world models” in order to “build intelligent systems that understand the real world.” The focus on world models was already hinted at by AMI's name, which stands for Advanced Machine Intelligence, but it has now officially joined the ranks of the hottest AI research startups.

Building foundational models that bridge AI and the real world has become one of the field's most exciting pursuits, attracting top scientists and deep-pocketed investors alike — product or no product.

World Labs, a direct rival founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, became a unicorn shortly after coming out of stealth. After launching its first product, Marble, which generates physically sound 3D worlds, World Labs is now reportedly in talks to raise fresh funding at a valuation of $5 billion. 

There's little doubt that VCs would be equally eager to invest in LeCun, adding credibility to rumors that AMI Labs might be raising funding at a $3.5 billion valuation. According to Bloomberg, VCs in talks with the startup include Cathay Innovation, Greycroft, and Hiro Capital, to which LeCun is an advisor. Other potential investors reportedly include 20VC, Bpifrance, Daphni, and HV Capital. 

Regardless of who writes the checks, investors may want to note an important detail: As LeCun has made clear, he is AMI's executive chairman, not its CEO. Instead, that role belongs to Alex LeBrun, previously co-founder and CEO at Nabla, a health AI startup with offices in Paris and New York.

LeBrun's transition from Nabla to AMI is part of a partnership announced last December by Nabla, which develops AI assistants for clinical care and to which LeCun has been an advisor. In exchange for “privileged access” to AMI's world models, Nabla's board supported LeBrun's shift from CEO to chief AI scientist and chairman, clearing the way for his new role.

As AMI Labs' CEO, LeBrun will be surrounded by familiar faces. After Facebook acquired his previous startup, Wit.ai, the serial entrepreneur and AI engineer worked under LeCun's leadership at Meta's AI research laboratory, FAIR. According to reports, the duo will also be joined by Laurent Solly, who stepped down as Meta's vice president for Europe last December.

The talent overlap between AMI and Meta likely won't stop there. LeCun told the MIT Technology Review that his former employer could well be AMI's first client. But he has also been publicly critical of some of Meta's strategic choices made under Mark Zuckerberg's direction. More broadly, the Review interprets AMI Labs as a contrarian bet against large language models (LLMs).

The limitations of LLMs that LeCun has pointed out include hallucinations, which are a serious concern in contexts like medicine, as LeBrun also knows firsthand. AMI Labs' CEO told Forbes that a big reason he took the role was the prospect of applying its world models to healthcare. But the startup will also target other high-stakes applied fields.

“AMI Labs will advance AI research and develop applications where reliability, controllability, and safety really matter, especially for industrial process control, automation, wearable devices, robotics, healthcare, and beyond,” it wrote in its mission statement. “We share one belief: real intelligence does not start in language. It starts in the world.”

Unlike generative approaches, which LeCun and his team see as poorly suited for unpredictable data such as sensor input, the startup promises that its AI systems will not only understand the real world, but also have persistent memory, the ability to reason and plan, and be controllable and safe.

The startup plans to license its technology to industry partners for real-life applications, but says it also plans to contribute to building the future of AI “with the global academic research community via open publications and open source.” LeCun said he plans to keep his professor position at NYU, where he teaches one class per year and supervises PhD and postdoctoral students.

This means that the French-born researcher will remain based in New York, but he told the MIT Technology Review that AMI Labs “is going to be a global company [that's] headquartered in Paris.” The news was welcomed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who expressed his pride that LeCun, who is also a Turing Prize winner, chose Paris. “We will do everything we can to ensure his success from France,” he said.

The startup will also have offices in Montreal, New York, and Singapore, but its decision to pick Paris for its headquarters will help consolidate Paris' reputation as an AI hub, where it will join the ranks of H, Mistral AI and several international labs, including FAIR. It's fitting, perhaps, that AMI is pronounced a-mee — like “ami” in French, which means “friend,” LeCun has pointed out.

We're in a unique moment for AI companies building their own foundation model. 

First, there is a whole generation of industry veterans who made their name at major tech companies and are now going solo. You also have legendary researchers with immense experience but ambiguous commercial aspirations. There's a clear chance that at least some of these new labs will become OpenAI-sized behemoths, but there's also room for them to putter around doing interesting research without worrying too much about commercialization.

The end result? It's getting hard to tell who is actually trying to make money. 

To make things simpler, I'm proposing a kind of sliding scale for any company making a foundation model. It's a five-level scale where it doesn't matter if you're actually making money – only if you're trying to. The idea here is to measure ambition, not success. 

Think of it in these terms: 

The big names are all at Level 5: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and so on. The scale gets more interesting with the new generation of labs launching now, with big dreams but ambitions that can be harder to read. 

Crucially, the people involved in these labs can generally choose whatever level they want. There's so much money in AI right now that no one is going to interrogate them for a business plan. Even if the lab is just a research project, investors will count themselves happy to be involved. If you aren't particularly motivated to become a billionaire, you might well live a happier life at Level 2 than at Level 5. 

The problems arise because it isn't always clear where an AI lab lands on the scale — and a lot of the AI industry's current drama comes from that confusion. Much of the anxiety over OpenAI's conversion from a non-profit came because the lab spent years at Level 1, then jumped to Level 5 almost overnight. On the other side, you might argue that Meta's early AI research was firmly at Level 2, when what the company really wanted was Level 4. 

With that in mind, here's a quick rundown of four of the biggest contemporary AI labs, and how they measure up on the scale. 

Humans& was the big AI news this week, and part of the inspiration for coming up with this whole scale. The founders have a compelling pitch for the next generation of AI models, with scaling laws giving way to an emphasis on communication and coordination tools.  

But for all the glowing press, Humans& has been coy about how that would translate into actual monetizable products. It seems it does want to build products; the team just won't commit to anything specific. The most they've said is that they will be building some kind of AI workplace tool, replacing products like Slack, Jira and Google Docs but also redefining how these other tools work at a fundamental level. Workplace software for a post-software workplace! 

It's my job to know what this stuff means, and I'm still pretty confused about that last part. But it is just specific enough that I think we can put them at Level 3. 

This is a very hard one to rate! Generally, if you have a former CTO and project lead for ChatGPT raising a $2 billion seed round, you have to assume there is a pretty specific roadmap. Mira Murati does not strike me as someone who jumps in without a plan, so coming into 2026, I would have felt good putting TML at Level 4. 

But then the last two weeks happened. The departure of CTO and co-founder Barret Zoph has gotten most of the headlines, due in part to the special circumstances involved. But at least five other employees left with Zoph, many citing concerns about the direction of the company. Just one year in, nearly half the executives on TML's founding team are no longer working there. One way to read events is that they thought they had a solid plan to become a world-class AI lab, only to find the plan wasn't as solid as they thought. Or in terms of the scale, they wanted a Level 4 lab but realized they were at Level 2 or 3. 

There still isn't quite enough evidence to justify a downgrade, but it's getting close. 

Fei-Fei Li is one of the most respected names in AI research, best known for establishing the ImageNet challenge that kickstarted contemporary deep learning techniques. She currently holds a Sequoia-endowed chair at Stanford, where she co-directs two different AI labs. I won't bore you by going through all the different honors and academy positions, but it's enough to say that if she wanted, she could spend the rest of her life just receiving awards and being told how great she is. Her book is pretty good too! 

So in 2024, when Li announced she had raised $230 million for a spatial AI company called World Labs, you might think we were operating at Level 2 or lower. 

But that was over a year ago, which is a long time in the AI world. Since then, World Labs has shipped both a full world-generating model and a commercialized product built on top of it. Over the same period, we've seen real signs of demand for world-modeling from both video game and special effects industries — and none of the major labs have built anything that can compete. The result looks an awful lot like a Level 4 company, perhaps soon to graduate to Level 5.

Founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, Safe Superintelligence (or SSI) seems like a classic example of a Level 1 startup. Sutskever has gone to great lengths to keep SSI insulated from commercial pressures, to the point of turning down an attempted acquisition from Meta. There are no product cycles and, aside from the still-baking superintelligent foundation model, there doesn't seem to be any product at all. With this pitch, he raised $3 billion! Sutskever has always been more interested in the science of AI than the business, and every indication is that this is a genuinely scientific project at heart.  

That said, the AI world moves fast — and it would be foolish to count SSI out of the commercial realm entirely. On his recent Dwarkesh appearance, Sutskever gave two reasons why SSI might pivot, either “if timelines turned out to be long, which they might” or because “there is a lot of value in the best and most powerful AI being out there impacting the world.” In other words, if the research either goes very well or very badly, we might see SSI jump up a few levels in a hurry.

The idea is that it's not directories that are just bags of files, but files occupy spatial locations in folder windows.

I recall you used to be able to flip some bit somewhere to allow you to Quit the Finder, but I assume that's disappeared inside the encrypted and signed partition where Apple keeps all the things us stupid users shouldn't be allowed to touch.But even then, you'd want more than just that, as when you tell the OS to ""Reveal"" a file or open a folder, that's the association I'd want to be able to change.Honestly I'd really prefer the Windows XP File Explorer to the pile of crap the Finder has turned into.

So of course people thought that when they changed jobs, cable companies, or whatever... they needed to create a new Apple ID with their new E-mail address. This was reinforced when Apple further stupidified their policy by requiring your ID to be a WORKING E-mail address (originally it didn't actually have to work).After the outcry over people's App Store and other purchases being scattered across multiple IDs, Apple finally publicly and huffily declared that they weren't going to fix the problem they created by letting people consolidate accounts.The moral: Don't force people to use E-mail addresses as user IDs. It's stupid on several levels.

reply

They somewhat changed that. It now is possible to move purchases between accounts. See https://support.apple.com/en-us/117294. Looks quite cumbersome to do, and will not apply to everybody (“If an Apple Account is only used for making purchases, those purchases can be migrated to a primary Apple Account to consolidate them.”, “This feature isn't available to users in India.”)

reply

I haven't transferred the purchases or anything either. The two Apple IDs have different purchases on them, and those on Family Sharing are able to access both.

reply

I use both for quite a few things. Which one is ""primary?""

reply

“At the time of migration, the Apple Account signed in for use with iCloud and most features on your iPhone or iPad will be referred to as the primary Apple Account.At the time of migration, the Apple Account signed in just for use with Media & Purchases will be referred to as the secondary Apple Account.”⇒ apparently you can be signed into multiple accounts at the same time ¿but I guess with only one account per feature?But as I said, that page is badly written. So, maybe I'm understanding it wrong.

reply

Yes... because of the mess Apple made, I am always signed into two accounts. My non-E-mail one for all purchases, and the E-mail one for iCloud.

reply

The real downside is if you have two fully active Apple IDs. Then things like calendars, photos, email, etc are still stuck on the other account until you export it. Which can be a pain since you have to sign out of your main account, sign into the old account and export, then sign back into the main account.

reply

I basically need two Apple IDs because switching the region for your App Store is very inconvenient if you have any subscriptions.In the end, I have separate Apple IDs for each country.

This belief is rampant amongst 90% of the general public. I had to spend an hour helping a friend last week who had created a new Cash App account to do their taxes, because they didn't prefer the old email address that was on their longstanding Cash App account. So now they have to keep 2 Cash App accounts forever. And to make things more fun, they're obsessed with phone numbers there, so adding the phone to the second account pulls it off the other account.Oh, and digression but I have to vent: their login process on the web is, in some order: an SMS to your phone, another numeric to your email, and your password. All in succession, on every login.

However, for your purpose of avoiding Apple's capricious BS, I probably wouldn't go that route since if their braindead fraud systems or braindead employees decide you're a threat actor they could definitely default to ""Ban account.

Is there any evidence of this happening with an actual legitimate gift card and bot one which was stolen or originally purchased via credit card fund.

reply

When Cyberpunk 2077 came out, my wife bought it with her credit card and gifted the game to me. It was fine at first. I even managed to play through the game. However when coming back to the game a few months later (to see all the bugfixes), it was gone. I contacted the (gog) and they said it was removed due to automatic fraud detection and that the balance had been paid back to the original credit card (my wife's card, she had obviously not noticed this in her bank statement).Point being automatic fraud detection systems can wipe out stuff you purchased even months after the fact (or in some cases lock your account)... It feels kafkaesque.

I don't dispute that GOG has the right, from a strictly legal standpoint, to revoke a license for any reason their terms of service allow, and that someone continuing to play a game after their license was revoked would be in breach of contract.  What I do dispute is that this is a correct, fair, or desirable state of affairs, especially when the license in question was received as a gift and believed in good faith by the recipient to have been acquired non-fraudulently.And in particular, if GOG wants the absolute and irrevocable right to prevent consumers from using products for which GOG has decided to revoke the licenses, they shouldn't advertise themselves as a DRM-free platform, nor claim that ""Here, you won't be locked out of titles you paid for, or constantly asked to prove you own them - this is DRM-free gaming."" -- advertising copy may not have the force of law, but courts tend to take a dim view of ad claims that are provably false.[0]: the list price of the Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition on GOG as of this writing (though it is currently on sale for 38% off)

For Apple to say ""Don't buy gift cards from our authorized retailers, or prepare to face incredibly harsh consequences due to fraud that you can't detect or predict"" while continuing to sell them through those channels is morally bankrupt and completely unacceptable.I have no doubt fraud is a big problem. It is for all gift cards. But this is a 3 trillion dollar company -- and they make minimum 30% of every gift card sold in pure profit. If they can't secure those channels without torpedoing innocent customers' entire digital lives, they need to drop that channel.

If unknowingly using a stolen gift card just meant you lost your money, nobody would be complaining about Apple's behavior here. The issue is that they didn't just lose their money, they also got their account locked, which locks up a lot of stuff completely unrelated to gift cards.

Our victim was the victim of the only theft that involved the gift card. Then Apple stole the person's whole digital life with no recourse because they are ham-fisted and don't care.

This is cognitive dissonance. If Apple reversed it due to their conscience, it's because they are pretty convinced this user is honest and Apple PR isn't (or didn't need to be) involved.If on the other hand, Apple has proof the user is not honest, then Apple PR took a huge hit for nothing by forcing Apple Support to unban them, when they could have said ""Because we have documented proof the user couldn't have bought this from a legitimate reseller, we cannot unban them.""

Needless to say, I have not bought a single Apple device since 2020, the M3 max I have is from my employer and I only use it when out of home.

reply

And talking about why I wanted a new Apple account... My old account was created with stupid security questions (like, What is your favorite dish) as a second factor, which I believe Apple has long deprecated. I forgot my answers and that blocked certain functionalities. Resetting the security questions requires answering the questions...

reply

I can't access anything without knowing exactly what I did wrong, presumably Apple never verified it when I created the account decades ago, but it's now part of the critical flow to log in.

There is no such thing as ""objective"" in this arena. It's all subjective, the best you can hope is to find an approach that the majority of your users subjectively prefer.

reply

I guess Apple should consider these user dissonances when designing UI (when users don't read or ignore button labels)

reply

If you click a button that says ""Change payment method"" it'll change the payment method.If you press the card on a ""which payment"" window, it'll use that card.Unfortunately objective truths are very boring.

In that type of window you'd expect clicking on any of the existing form fields would allow you to change that field. It would be wild if clicking on a credit card icon in the middle of a form submitted that form.Oh, look at that! Turns out this is subjective.

So in this case you find a button that looks like it changes the payment method (because in earlier versions it did and it's a common UI pattern) and don't even see the button below that acually does this.

So I got a newer one, from 2025. Fortunately, radio & media do work. But product managers wouldn't have been product managers without spoiling something. Somebody decided the alarm and night mode must work together in unison, and also they dropped the turn-off-for-30-min feature, and they decided to make night mode smart, that it doesn't turn on if the phone was active at the time. So, now you can get spam calls or sms make it ring loudly at night, because night mode didn't turn on, because you used the phone. Next time when you notice night mode should be on, but isn't, you turn it on. But now it's permanent -- till the end of the universe, unless you turn it off. And alarm clock won't ring, because deep in there, a  ""waking up alarm"" box is unchecked, that should have made it work despite the night mode. Did any human actually test it work on themselves?

Devs love the symmetry of their touch handling code and often have the finger-down, finger-moved, and finger-up callbacks from the system all call the same handleTouch function they wrote. As you can tell, however, the touch from the finger up callback is often better discarded or handled differently otherwise you get these sort of bugs

However, my biggest issue with mobile text selection is accidental scrolling or scrolling too fast/far while dragging on the screen to select longer text parts. This is especially annoying in landscape mode when there is just a tiny gap between the visible text and the touch keyboard. I don't know how to solve this, but it just makes the text editing process feel incredibly insecure/slippy and annoying for me.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9YPm0EghvU

Android stuff has been ahead of apple since like 2014. Apple is really good at optimizing the one thing that they use in advertising, while the rest of the stuff falls by the wayside. Was the exact same thing with Apple silicon and battery life.  Sure, your laptop battery lasts a while when all you do is browse web and watch movies, specifically because of dedicated hardware for that. My phone with a similar capacity battery bank does the same. Once you start actually supersizing the cpu, the battery life drops significantly.

I'm fairly sure I know what the problem is! It was restored from a backup taken on an iPhone X that had two physical SIM slots (Chinese version). The new phone now seems to think it has two physical SIM slots: it shows an IMEI2 in About, but any attempt to use the eSIM functionality just fails (scanning a code does ""nothing""; no ""add"" button is visible, etc.).If this was an Android phone, I'd root it and just fix the offending network configuration file. I believe it's possible to tamper with a backup of the phone to fix the issue, but this would mean a full backup+restore cycle and some specialized tooling to go mucking with the backup.I filed a Radar on it ages ago, but I'm assuming nobody ever picked it up.

I did successfully use a backup editor, iMazing, to exclude the telephony data from a backup in order to fix it, but it cost me $30 and hours (transferring my Signal data to a second device and back). For 99.999% of their customers this would require a total erase-install. All because Apple has an off-by-one error somewhere.

There's a strange logic (that I understand is not just at Apple) where if you ship a known bug, it becomes harder next release to fix it… because we already shipped the bug once (twice, etc.).Apple engineers care though. If they were allowed to (given time, priority), they would love to knock out some of their oldest and most annoying bugs. And I understand that from time to time a bug-fix-only OS release is planned… but things always come up. New hardware, ""AI""… who knows.Maybe someday we'll get another Snow Leopard (bug-fix-only OS release).

Then the planning is made for next years release and they plan for X features, which require Y time and Z engineers, and some mild hand-waving later a schedule is made, and gee would you look at that, there's no time anywhere for fixing existing bugs. But that's ok because big rewrite of subsystem is gonna ship next release and it'll probably make all the bugs invalid, right? Right? Well, it certainly won't have more bugs, right? Right? Oops…

reply

They keep doing them, but I wonder to what degree these rewrites are necessary, and whether your average Apple engineer is aware that they end up with more bugs and vulnerabilities than they started. Surely they've gotta know?

reply

Large-scale software is hard. So hard nobody's really managed to do it well. By large-scale I don't mean ""a lot of users"" or ""a large deployment""... I mean ""a lot of engineers"". Once the number of engineers gets large enough, they start making decisions that make the product worse, more bloated, more buggy, and no human is capable of keeping it in check, because the sheer amount of activity in the code is so large you can't possibly keep up with it. And the worst part is that orgs try to solve this by... hiring more engineers to wrangle the complexity. By this point you're already sunk, there's no going back.

I believe the power-button-to-snooze thing is meant as a usability boost for groggy people: the physical button may be easier to click than some random spot on the screen.

The AirDrop and Hotspot issues described are spot on. The success rate for these is like 40% to 65% (the latter if you're lucky). These features require doing a dance of airplane mode, disconnect from WiFi, go to Settings and fiddle with the toggles, etc. When it works, it's like magic. At other times, it's a big joke on “it just works”.Text selection and the trials to just move the cursor quickly and accurately: it's like Apple has no senior management that cares enough (looking at you, Craig Federighi), no QA (this is obvious truth to every user) and no money to spend on making things better (don't let the stock prices fool you). FWIW, I know of slower and fiddly ways to move the cursor somewhat (press space, hold and move or place finger on the text, hold and move).All these issues persist for years or decades because senior management does not care. I can't think of any other rational explanation.

Apple's strategy is actually to make people auto-upgrade to make their work of maintaining older OS/software cheaper and make people who don't have recent enough hardware suffer.It's funny that one argument for Apple was that you got updates for free. But in practice, Android doesn't need to upgrade the OS to access recent apps and ship security updates for old versions of Android. You just lose access to new OS functionalities, but it has been a while since there was much to care about.

At the end of the day, in most cases, it would be preferable to just connect the damn thing with a cable and send things that way. If you send a large file, it takes a while, and having to redo the process because of some bug kills any benefit from the convenience of not having to use a cable.

Simple, efficient, no need for any cloud, no need for internet/wireless connectivity, no need to wait for any syncing, it just works.

Taken to an extreme, I expect that Apple will evolve to have only one product, with minimal surface area.  A button you press that gives money to apple, in response you receive some sort of lovely bauble with no actual functionality.  The cost to apple to maintain this would be quite small (they could probably survive with 10 engineers focused mainly on site reliability) and given the historical pattern of Apple customers (I am one), would be highly profitable.

Whenever I would enter a supermarket without network access, Music would just stop streaming after one song, no buffering. Spotify handled it just fine.
Even the Spotify remote functionality is better and snappier than the godawful Music Remote. That is a separate app, because for some reason they can't integrate that functionality in the main app for their own hardware.Apple is really in free fall; I don't think any of the top dogs actually use their stuff or care about it.

Create an HTML email signature in TextEdit or some other rich text editor on macOS, copy it and paste it on iOS using Continuity Clipboard into the signature text field in iOS' Settings -> Apps -> Mail -> Signature text field, and pray that it works.When it does work, it ignores text size. Want your email signature to be in a smaller font size? Too bad.The only workaround I've found is to copy an email signature from another email account that miraculously did copy over successfully, copy it on iOS and paste that in to another's email signature field, and manually rewrite the whole thing.Of course, the HTML links aren't editable, and the Signature text fields don't enable the “Add Link” item to the hover tools menu when selecting text.Worst of all, even when the email signature is finally perfect, the Signature text field doesn't preview it properly. If text is pasted in at a smaller text size, the preview still shows it at the default size. The only way to accurately preview an email signature is to draft a new email and hope the email signature displays like it did originally in TextEdit.In short, never create a new HTML email signature on iOS. Create in on a Mac (source), copy it over the network with Continuity Clipboard, hope it works, and treat the iOS email signature fields (destination) as a never- or rarely-editable workspace.

I bought an iPhone13 mini looking forward for ""quality"", but after few years of usage I realized that the quality is exactly what I have lost:• Time-to-time when I open a contact, the ""Call"" button is disabled without any explanation. Surprisingly turning wifi and/or bluetooth and/or mobile data ON and then OFF again results in the ""Call"" button becoming re-enabled. Is the call function not an essential functionality of the phone to be dependent on such nonsense? Imagine you have an emergency and need to call real quick.
• Every time I open the ""Notes"" app it greets me with ""Mobile Data is Turned Off"" pop-up. Mobile data just to type some notes? Who do you have to send it to?
• DND logic so complicated and buggy that I started using the flight mode to be ""sure"" that nobody calls through.
• ""Settings"" icon keeps displaying the ""1"" badge in revenge for my refusal to set up my Face ID.Well, I thought, at least this thing is a very good camera (which it really is). As if reading my thoughts, it started recording my landscape videos as portrait which I didn't manage to fix, so now I have to rotate the recorded videos on my PC.

WTF happened to iOS text selection? It's a shitshow now. First Apple decided that the cursor shouldn't snap to the space between characters. WHY? Why would I want to start a selection in the middle of a character? Oh yeah: I never would, and can't anyway. So why does the cursor go there?Then there's the fact that if you press and hold and release, the ""select all"" option (and others) doesn't appear anymore. Try again. Try again. And then after the fifth? Seventh? try, suddenly you get the floating menu.And then there's the now-often-useless magnifying glass, which frequently appears offscreen or behind the stupid notch.And the window resizing. Ugh. It wasn't until what, the mid-2000s that you could resize an Apple window by anything other than THE LOWER-RIGHT CORNER. No other corners, and no edges. The sheer stupidity of this was galling.When Apple finally ""fixed"" that, they did so in typical Apple fashion: grudgingly. They refuse to put frames on windows, so there's no clear area in which the cursor should become the resizing cursor. Is it any wonder that the resizing behavior is flaky as hell? And now it's even worse.

Yes, they acknowledged the numbers are completely made up. But, even with a 100x or more increase in those estimates the point would still stand. Why undermine the argument with such wildly silly (and, as you say, insulting) estimates?

Total time value lost to text selection games sounds about right.When I just selected that figure, I had to select twice because double tapping “trillion” then grabbing a text selection endpoint never works the first time.

I think what's happening is that face ID doesn't activate until you stop swiping, where usually it would start when you look at the phone or pick it up? Presumably because you're going to be looking at the phone a lot when using maps.God I hate it so much. I didn't use apple maps for years because of it but then I switched to apple maps because of some egregious privacy violation by google maps that I can no longer remember.Also applies to other apps that work when your phone is locked like phone calls.

A couple of times a year it will just nuke all my open tabs (450-500) and present me with a delightful blank screen.

Also sometimes the back button will just freeze or not take you back. So I try hitting it again, it takes me 2 steps back in my history (this is fine), then I press forward and it takes me to the end of history, so I hit back again and it takes me 2 steps back. And the page I actually wanted to go back to is just gone from my history. I know there's a lot of whacky JS messing with history that happens on web apps, but it will often happen on HN when the article I clicked on is a plain text blog with minimal JS and definitely not altering the history state.Edit: This literally just happened to me after writing this comment, with the post about turso database. I clicked the HN comments, clicked the post link (to github), read for a bit and clicked back. And the comments page is just not in my history.

Safari iOS: Be on a page, tap hold a link, click Open in new tab, go to new tab. The Back button should be grayed out and isn't, and clicking it closes the tab.Chrome iOS: Be on a page, tap hold a link, click Open in new tab, go to new tab. Back button correctly grayed out as the tab has nowhere to go back to.

If you have a window with only one tab in it, and drag that tab to another window to merge them, the window disappears and they merge... right? Nope, if you look in your Windows menu, you now have a phantom window with no tabs in it that you have to reveal and close manually.Randomly when I go to close a tab it will say ""you have 2 tabs selected, do you want to close both"". I didn't even know selecting multiple tabs was a feature, so OK maybe I had held down shift while switching tabs at some point? Nope, switching tabs (to deselect any tabs) doesn't change it, it still thinks I have some phantom tab selected somewhere.These have both been there for years.

And there are even more macOS Safari bugs. One is that history search won't work; you'll can type in the search bar but it won't filter the list. At least a few years old. Another bug I've been getting for a few years is that sometimes I'll launch Safari and some tabs will be blanked out, often pinned tabs. No URL in the bar, no back button, the site is just gone and only a blank tab remains.Another one is text input. Type a long enough piece of text in a website's text box and eventually it'll get messed up, or your text will be partly duplicated, or the box will be half-broken and you need to copy your text, refresh the page and paste it back before continuing.Bookmarks sync is still an unreliable train wreck. Sometimes they'll be moved out of folders and into the bookmarks menu. Sometimes they're gone and you've lost them, which has never happened in any other browser.And of course, Safari is the only modern browser where I still get infrequent browser crashes (not tab crashes). Something rarer on Chrome and Firefox than a lottery win.

This one is one of my pet peeves even outside of Apple Pay. My personal opinion is that almost all iconography is just reinventing the wheel. We already have a widely-accepted iconographic vocabulary already understood by a billion people: Chinese characters. The fact that English speakers can't read it is immaterial, because English speakers already can't read the icons we're already using. Using Chinese iconography in all languages will dramatically increase the legibility of the icons we use in apps.(Or, we could just put regular text under the icon...)

Everyone sits on giant balls of mud and those who built those balls are long gone. Fixing any of this would mean wading through and fixing endless legacy code at the risk of introducing new bugs. Some of it has hardware and radio broadcasting quirks involved which probably narrows down the people capable to understand the problem to almost 0.And of those 0 people, no one gets promoted for fixing the incredibly buggy AirDrop. No one even knows how to replicate those bugs. Some iPhones in the wild sometimes stop being able to be found by other iPhones in the wild. Yikes. How do you even begin? Who's gonna write some debug code for a debug app for an iPhone in a lab and then runs back and forth with 50 other iPhones that also need to run debug code to finally get one in the state where it's unable to find or be found and then check diagnostics the communications hardware returns only to find out you need more diagnostic code.Sync issues? Yikes again. Who the fuck would want to touch a system where any new bug could mean the destruction of trillions of photos and the wrath of OVER A BILLION of users. Flaky connections, many clients, sync algorithms, space on device limits, quota in the cloud limit, offloading of images. Also, once again, how do you even reliably replicate this issue which sporadically happens and sporadically resolves?At scale and beyond critical mass, love and care and quality software are not rewarded. They are extra costs, just like human support agents.

Who's gonna write some debug code for a debug app for an iPhone in a lab and then runs back and forth with 50 other iPhones that also need to run debug code to finally get one in the state where it's unable to find or be found and then check diagnostics the communications hardware returns only to find out you need more diagnostic code.Sync issues? Yikes again. Who the fuck would want to touch a system where any new bug could mean the destruction of trillions of photos and the wrath of OVER A BILLION of users. Flaky connections, many clients, sync algorithms, space on device limits, quota in the cloud limit, offloading of images. Also, once again, how do you even reliably replicate this issue which sporadically happens and sporadically resolves?At scale and beyond critical mass, love and care and quality software are not rewarded. They are extra costs, just like human support agents.

Besides the multiplication, the 386 had quite a number of teething problems[1], including occasionally broken addressing modes, unrecoverable exceptions, virtual address resolution bugs around the 2G mark, etc...A while ago, there was also an article posted here that analyzed the inner workings of the Windows/386 loader[2]. Interestingly, Windows simply checks a pair of instruction (XBTS/IBTS) that early 386 steppings had, but was later removed, raising an invalid opcode exception instead.Raymond Chen also wrote a blog post describing a few workarounds that Windows 95 had implemented[3].[1] https://www.pcjs.org/documents/manuals/intel/80386/[2] https://virtuallyfun.com/2025/09/06/unauthorized-windows-386...[3] https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110112-00/?p=11...

Probably not; this point is well justified by both theory and practice. Supporting suitably larger operands is indeed what naturally comes following the increase of computation demands.One point I do differ from the author is that register width don't necessarily correlate with the size of address space. Even 8bit machines can address a large space by splitting apart the logical address and using multiple registers. Likewise, having a wide register does not imply the same address width.

That feels like a stretch :) Maybe it indeed ran on it, but Pentium was available when Windows 95 was released and it was probably far more likely to be sold along with such new Pentium multimedia machines, than someone getting it for their old 386. But Windows 3.11 was its exact match!

First, Linux was created FOR the 386. Linus Torvalds had one and wanted to unlock its power.As you say, Windows 3.0 is certainly no stretch.That leaves only Windows 95. The minimum spec at launch was a 386 with 4 MB of RAM. Realistically, you needed 8 MB to do anything.Here is an article from 1993 saying that manufactures are beginning to drop the 386 from their product lines. That is, this is when people stopped being able to buy 386 machines brand new.https://books.google.com/books/about/InfoWorld.html?id=2zsEA...The 486 was the dominant chip in 1993 but there were still a lot of 386 machines being sold to that point when.When Windows 95 shipped, people would certainly have been trying to run it on those machines.When Windows 95 was released, people famously lined up to buy it like they were getting tickets to a rock concert. It was not just sold with new hardware. Back then, it was normal for people to pay money to buy a new operating system to run on hardware they already owned.Of course Windows 95 certainly helped sell Pentiums. Pentium would have dominated new sales but a typical PC in service in 1995 would have been a 486 and there were still plenty of 386 machines in use.

In general, agents ""stand in the shoes"" of the principal for all actions the principal delegated to them (i.e., ""scope of agency""). So if Amy works for Global Corp and has the authority to sign legal documents on their behalf, the company is bound. Similarly, if I delegate power of attorney to someone to sign documents on my behalf, I'm bound to whatever those agreements are.The law doesn't distinguish between mechanical and personal agents. If you give an agent the power to do something on your behalf, and it does something on your behalf under your guidance, you're on the hook for whatever it does under that power. It's as though you did it yourself.

reply

If I were an attorney in court, I would argue that a ""mechanical or automatic agent"" cannot truly be a personal agent unless it can be trusted to do things only in line with that person's wishes and consent.If an LLM ""agent"" runs amok and does things without user consent and without reason or direction, how can the person be held responsible, except for saying that they never should've granted ""agency"" in the first place? Couldn't the LLM's corporate masters be held liable instead?

reply

So in a case like this, if your agent exceeded its authority, and you could prove it, you might not be bound.Keep in mind that an LLM is not an agent. Agents use LLMs, but are not LLMs themselves. If you only want your agent to be capable of doing limited actions, program or configure it that way.

The closest analogy we have, I guess, is the power of attorney. If a principal signs off on power of attorney to, e.g. take out a loan/mortgage to buy a thing on principal's behalf, that does not extend to taking any extra liabilities. Any extra liabilities signed off by the agent would be either rendered null or transferred to the agent in any court of law. There is extent to which agency is assigned.The core questions here are agency and liability boundaries. Are there any agency boundaries on the agent? If so, what's the extent? There are many future edge cases where these questions will arise. Licenses and patents are just the tip of an iceberg.

Many artists through the ages have learned to work in various mediums, like sculpture of materials, oil painting, watercolors, fresco or whatever. There are myriad ways to express your visual art using physical materials.Likewise, a girlfriend of mine was a college-educated artist, and she had some great output in all sorts of media, and had a great grasp of paints, and paper and canvas and what-have-you.But she was also an Amiga aficionado, and then worked on the PCs I had, and ultimately the item she wanted most in life was a Wacom Tablet. This tablet was a force-multiplier for her art, and allowed her some real creative freedom to work in digital mediums and create art with ease that was unheard-of for messy oil paintings or whatever on canvas in your garage (we actually lived in a converted garage anyway.)So, digital art was her saving grace, but also a significant leveler of playing fields. What would distinguish her original creativity from A.I.-generated stuff later on? Really not much. You could still make an oil or watercolor painting that is obviously hand-made. Forgeries of great artists have been perpetrated, but most of us can't explain, e.g. the Shroud of Turin anyway.So generative A.I. is competing in these digital mediums, and perhaps 3D-printing is competing in the realm of physical objects, but it's unfortunate for artists that their choices have narrowed so far, that they are practically required to work in digital media exclusively, and master those apps, and therefore, they compete with gen A.I. in the virtual realm. That's just how it's gonna be, until folks go back to sculpting marble and painting soup cans.

It's basically like GenAI, but running on protein substrate instead of silicon one.And even in the digital realm, artists already spent the last decade+ competing with equivalent ""factory art"", too. Advertising stands on art, and most of that isn't commissioned, it's rented or bought for cheap from stock art providers, and a lot of supply there comes from people and organizations who specialize in producing art for them. The OG slop art, before AI.EDIT: there's some irony here, in that people like to talk about how GenAI might (or might already be) start putting artists out of work. But I haven't seen anyone mention that the AI has already put slop creators out of work.

Optimising them for speed or manipulation does not change this, at least not from a technical perspective.

It's like a JPEG. Except instead of lossy compression on images that give you a pixel soup that only vaguely resembles the original if you're resource bound (and even modern SOTA models are when it comes to LLMs), instead you get stuff that looks more or less correct but just isn't.

An LLM chatbot is not like querying a database. Postgres doesn't have a human-like interface. Querying SQL is highly technical, when you get nonsensical results out of it (which is most often than not) you immediately suspect the JOIN you wrote or whatever. There's no ""confident vibe"" in results spat out by the DB engine.Interacting with a chat bot is highly non-technical. The chat bot seems to many people like a highly competent person-like robot that knows everything, and it knows it with a high degree of confidence too.So it makes sense to talk about ""hallucinations"", even though it's a flawed analogy.I think the mistake people make when interacting with LLMs is similar to what they do when they read/watch the news: ""well, they said so on the news, so it must be true.""

Any smart interviewer knows that you have to look at actual code of the contributions to confirm it was actually accepted and that it was a non-trivial change (e.g. not updating punctuation in the README or something).In my experience this is where the PR-spammers fall apart in interviews. When they proudly tell you they're a contributor to a dozen popular projects and you ask for direct links to their contributions, they start coming up with excuses for why they can't find them or their story changes.There are of course lazy interviewers who will see the resume line about having contributed to popular projects and take it as strong signal without second guessing.

An example I have of this is from high school where there were guys that were utterly shameless in asking girls for sex. The thing is it worked for them. Regardless of how many people turned them down they got enough of a hit rate it was an effective strategy. Simply put there was no other social mechanism that provided enough disincentive to stop them.And to take the position as devil's advocate, why should they feel shame? Shame is typically a moral construct of the culture you're raised in and what to be ashamed for can vary widely.For example, if your raised in the culture of Abrahamic religions it's very likely you're told to be ashamed for being gay. Whereas non-religious  upbringing is more likely to say why the hell would you be ashamed for being gay.TL:DR, shame is not an effective mechanism on the internet because you're dealing with far too many cultures that have wildly different views on shame, and any particular viewpoint on shame is apt to have millions to billions of people that don't believe the same.

I am seeing the doomed future of AI math: just received another set theory paper by a set theory amateur with an AI workflow and an interest in the continuum hypothesis.At first glance, the paper looks polished and advanced. It is beautifully typeset and contains many correct definitions and theorems, many of which I recognize from my own published work and in work by people I know to be expert. Between those correct bits, however, are sprinkled whole passages of claims and results with new technical jargon. One can't really tell at first, but upon looking into it, it seems to be meaningless nonsense. The author has evidently hoodwinked himself.We are all going to be suffering under this kind of garbage, which is not easily recognizable for the slop it is without effort. It is our regrettable fate.

I think this is interesting too. I've noticed the difference in dating/hook-up contexts. The people you're talking about also end up getting laid more but that group also has a very large intersection with sex pests and other shitty people. The thing they have in common though is that they just don't care what other people think about them. That leads some of them to be successful if they are otherwise good people... or to become borderline or actual crininals if not. I find it fascinating actually, like how does this difference come about and can it actually be changed or is it something we get early in life or from the genetic lottery.

The grift culture has changed that completely, now students face a lot of pressure to spam out PRs just to show they have contributed something.

i.e. imagine a change that is literally a small diff, that is easy to describe as a mere user and not a developer, and that requires quite a lot of deep understanding merely to submit as a PR (build the project! run the tests! write the template for the PR!).Really a lot of this stuff ends up being a kind of failure mode of various projects that we all fall into at some point where ""config"" is in the code and what could be a simple change and test required a lot of friction.Obviously not all submissions are going to be like this but I think I've tried a few little ones like that where I would normally just leave whatever annoyance I have alone but think ""hey maybe it's 10 min faff with AI and a PR"".The structure of the project incentives kind of creates this. Increasing cost to contribution is a valid strategy of course, but from a holistic project point of view it is not always a good one especially assuming you are not dealing with adversarial contributors but only slightly incompetent ones.

Shaming people for violating valid social norms is absolutely decent behaviour. It is the primary mechanism we have to establish social norms. When people do bad things that are harmful to the rest of society, shaming them is society's first-level corrective response to get them to stop doing bad things. If people continue to violate norms, then society's higher levels of corrective behaviour can involve things like establishing laws and fining or imprisoning people, but you don't want to start with that level of response. Although putting these LLM spammers in jail does sound awfully enticing to me in a petty way, it's probably not the most constructive way to handle the problem.The fact that shamelessness is taking over in some cultures is another problem altogether, and I don't know how you deal with that. Certain cultures have completely abdicated the ability to influence people's behaviour socially without resorting to heavy-handed intervention, and on the internet, this becomes everyone in the world's problem. I guess the answer is probably cultivation of spaces with strict moderation to bar shameless people from participating. The problem could be mitigated to some degree if a Github-like entity outright banned these people from their platform so they could not continue to harass open-source maintainers, but there is no platform like that. It unfortunately takes a lot of unrewarding work to maintain a curated social environment on the internet.

To demand public humiliation doesn't just put you on the same level as our medieval ancestors, who responded to violations of social norms with the pillory - it's actually even worse: the contemporary internet pillory never forgets.

reply

Shame is also not the same thing as ""public humiliation"". They are publicly humiliating themselves. Pointing out that what they publicly chose to do themselves is bad is in no way the same as coercing them into being humiliated, which is what ""public humiliation as a medieval punishment"" entails. For example, the medieval practice of dragging a woman through the streets nude in order to humiliate her is indeed abhorrent, but you can hardly complain if you march through the streets nude of your own volition, against other people's desires, and are then publicly shamed for it.

What negative experience do you think should instead be created for people breaking these rules?

reply

A permanent public internet pillory isn't just useless against the worst offenders, who are shameless anyway. It's also permanently damaging to those who are still learning societal norms.The Ghostty AI policy lacks any nuance in this regard. No consideration for the age or experience of the offender. No consideration for how serious the offense actually was.

Covers most of the points I'm sure many of us have experienced here while developing with AI. Most importantly, AI generated code does not substitute human thinking, testing, and clean up/rewrite.On that last point, whenever I've gotten Codex to generate a substantial feature, usually I've had to rewrite a lot of the code to make it more compact even if it is correct. Adding indirection where it does not make sense is a big issue I've noticed LLMs make.

It's one of those provisions that seem reasonable, but really have no justification. It's an attempt to allow something, while extracting a cost. If I am responsible for my code, and am considered the author in the PR, than you as the recipient don't have a greater interest to know than my own personal preference not to disclose. There's never been any other requirement to disclose anything of this nature before. We don't require engineers to attest to the operating system or the licensing of the tools they use, so materially outside your own purant interests, how does it matter?

reply

It is of course your responsibility, but the maintainer may also want to change their review approach when dealing with AI generated code. And currently, as the AI Usage Policy also states, because of bad actors sending pull requests without reviewing or taking the responsibility themselves, this acts as a filter to separate your PR which you have taken the responsibility for.

So then, what can we rely on to signal 'this was thoroughly supervised and reviewed and understood and tested?'  That's going to be hard and subjective.Personal reputations and track records are pedigrees and brands are going to become more important in the industry; and the meritocratic 'code talks no matter where you came from' ethos is at risk.

I've written _a lot_ of open source MIT licensed code, and I'm on the fence about that being part of the training data. I've published it as much for other people to use for learning purposes as I did for fun.I also build and sell closed source commercial JavaScript packages, and more than likely those have ended up in the training data as well. Obviously without consent. So this is why I feel strong about making this separation between code and media, from my perspective it all has the same problem.

What's the reason for this?Media is the most likely thing I'd consider using AI for as part of a contribution to an open source project.My code would be hand crafted by me. Any AI use would be similar to Google use: a way to search for examples and explanations if I'm unclear on something. Said examples and explanations would then be read, and after I understand what is going on I'd write my code.Any documentation I contributed would also be hand written.

It's illegal to commit fraud or murder, but if you do it and suffer no consequences (perhaps you even get pardoned by your president), does it matter that it was illegal?

Yet it happens all the time, especially from big players like Uber. Apple themselves have done it too. So if you're a bad actor and disrespectful to your users, does it matter that the rule exists?

Licenses determine whether a copyright lawsuit is likely to happen. Most entities won't sue you if they expect to lose. But they are not the only deciding factor. Some entities never sue, which means you don't have to follow their licenses.Sometimes they don't sue because they don't think they can prove you infringed copyright, even if you did. Even if AI is found to be copyright infringement in general, that won't mean every output is a copyright infringement of every input. Writing C code wouldn't be copyright infringement of Harry Potter. The entity suing you would still have to prove that you infringed.

They finally admitted it but said something to the effect they reviewed it and stood behind every line.The problem with AI writing is at least some people appear incapable of critically reviewing it. Writing something yourself eliminates this problem because it forces you to pick your words (there could be other problems of course).So the AI-blind will still submit slop under the policy but believe themselves to have reviewed it and “stand behind” it.

I work in a team of 5 great professionals, there hasn't been a single instance since Copilot launched in 2022 that anybody, in any single modification did not take full responsibility for what's been committed.I know we all use it, to different extent and usage, but the quality of what's produced hasn't dipped a single bit, I'd even argue it has improved because LLMs can find answers easier in complex codebases. We started putting `_vendor` directories with our main external dependencies as git subtrees, and it's super useful to find information about those directly in their source code and tests.It's really as simple. If your teammates are producing slop, that's a human and professional problem and these people should be fired. If you use the tool correctly, it can help you a lot finding information and connecting dots.Any person with a brain can clearly see the huge benefit of these tools, but also the great danger of not reviewing their output line by line and forfeiting the constant work of resolving design tensions.Of course, open source is a different beast. The people committing may not be professionals and have no real stakes so they get little to lose by producing slop whereas maintainers are already stretched in their time and attention.

Agree, slop isn't ""the tool is so easy to use I can't review the code I'm producing"", slop is the symptom of ""I don't care how it's done, as long as it looks correct"", and that's been a problem before LLMs too, the difference is how quickly you reach the ""slop"" state now, not that you have gate your codebase and reject shit code.As always, most problems in ""software programming"" isn't about software nor programming but everything around it, including communication and workflows. If your workflow allows people to not be responsible for what they produce, and if allows shitty code to get into production, then that's on you and your team, not on the tools that the individuals use.

Another idea is to simply promote the donation of AI credits instead of output tokens. It would be better to donate credits, not outputs, because people already working on the project would be better at prompting and steering AI outputs.

reply

In an ideal world sure, but I've seen the entire gamut from amateurs making surprising work to experts whose prompt history looks like a comedy of errors and gotchas. There's some ""skill"" I can't quite put my finger on when it comes to the way you must speak to an LLM vs another dev. There's more monkey-paw involved in the LLM process, in the sense that you get what you want, but do you want what you'll get?

Surely they are incapable of producing slop because they are just so much smarter than everyone else so the rules shouldn't apply to them, surely.

reply

Moreover this policy is strictly unenforceable because good AI use is indistinguishable from good manual coding. And sometimes even the reverse. I don't believe in coding policies where maintainers need to spot if AI is used or not. I believe in experienced maintainers that are able to tell if a change looks sensible or not.

Interesting requirement!

It's difficult to overstate the significance of NASA's upcoming Artemis 2 mission. For the first time in over 50 years, astronauts will fly by the Moon on the first crewed test of the rocket and spacecraft that will eventually enable humanity's long-awaited return to the lunar surface.

But Artemis 2 won't just test spaceflight systems and hardware. This mission will also put NASA's in-space science operations to the test. During their 10-day trip around the Moon, the crew will act as researchers, observing regions of the Moon's far side never before seen with the naked eye.

“I'm really excited about this test flight,” Jacob Richardson, deputy lunar science lead for Artemis 2, told Gizmodo. “There is a super special place in my heart for Artemis 2—for the crew that has completely leaned into being a part of our science team and for the science that we'll get out of this mission.”

The last time astronauts journeyed to the Moon was during NASA's Apollo program, which sent nine missions to the Moon between 1968 and 1972. All but one entered lunar orbit, and six landed astronauts on the surface.

NASA launched each of these missions to reach the Moon when the landing sites were lit by early morning sunlight, a time when surface temperatures were manageable and shadows could help guide lander navigation.

The downside of this approach was that large portions of the surface—especially parts on the far side—were shrouded in darkness, or at least too poorly illuminated for the Apollo astronauts to observe with the naked eye from orbit. Their view was also limited by their low orbital altitude, which was typically just 70 miles (110 kilometers) above the surface.

The Artemis 2 astronauts—NASA's Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and the Canadian Space Agency's Jeremy Hansen—will not encounter the same limitations. Their spacecraft, Orion, will fly by the Moon at a minimum distance of 4,300 miles (6,900 km). And if the mission launches within the February window, which currently appears possible, nearly the entire lunar far side will be fully illuminated.

“They're going to be the first humans to see virtually the entire far side disk in a single view,” Richardson said. From that vantage point, they'll be able to observe and compare surface features thousands of miles apart from each other—a perspective orbiters can't provide, he explained.

The crew will dedicate one day to observing the Moon's surface. Richardson and his colleagues on the lunar science team have provided them with extensive training on how to look for certain features, photograph or videotape them, and write detailed descriptions of what they see.

The astronauts won't have a precise idea of which far-side features they will be able to observe until launch, Richardson said. In the first few days of flight, he and his team will finalize a list of observation targets for the astronauts to prioritize.

These targets may include Mare Orientale, a massive impact basin that straddles the boundary between the Moon's near and far sides, according to Richardson. Humans have never directly laid eyes on the far-side portion of this mare before. As the youngest and best-preserved multi-ring impact basin on the lunar surface, Orientale is a natural laboratory for investigating the Moon's impact history and how ringed craters form.

The Artemis 2 astronauts could also get to observe one of the most mysterious features of the lunar surface: the South Pole-Aitken Basin. This far-side impact crater is the Moon's largest, stretching more than 1,550 miles (2,500 km) across. Scientists believe it is also among the oldest, but its exact age remains elusive.

“We know that it's this massive event that rocked the Moon. We know that similar events have happened across the entire solar system. So, any observations they make of that are going to really add to our understanding of this really interesting southern area of the Moon,” Richardson said.

But the crew's primary objectives will be to observe color and albedo variation within the illuminated portions of the far side and look for impact flashes—bursts of light emitted when meteoroids strike the lunar surface—within the unilluminated portions, Richardson said.

This mission will offer an unprecedented view of the Moon's most enigmatic terrain, giving scientists on Earth fresh insight into its history and the forces that continue to shape our closest celestial neighbor.

“My hope is that with the Artemis missions, we as scientists today—in 2026—end up looking kind of like fools, and that the Artemis missions create so much opportunity for discovery that we're able to rewrite the textbooks,” Richardson said.

U.S.-based crypto exchange giant Coinbase has established an independent advisory board to evaluate and provide guidance on the threat quantum computing may pose to the cryptography used in blockchain networks. This issue has become increasingly discussed among notable financial leaders, such as Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio and VanEck CEO Jan van Eck, as it is thought to be preventing further institutional investment in crypto.

Since blockchain networks use cryptography to empower each user to have full autonomy over their digital assets on an individual basis, a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) would effectively make these systems unworkable, as anyone with such a CRQC would be able to spend from any address. Of course, the cryptography used in these systems and the traditional financial sector can theoretically also be upgraded to be quantum-resistant.

In terms of specific activities, the new advisory board, officially known as the Coinbase Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain, will publish papers assessing threat levels, issue recommendations to institutions and developers, and respond to new breakthroughs in the quantum computing field as they arise. Board members include Director of the Quantum Information Center at the University of Texas at Austin, Scott Aaronson, and Co-Director of the Stanford Center for Blockchain Research, Dan Boneh.

Last year, new developments in quantum computing from the likes of Google, with its Willow chip, reignited excitement around the prospect of real progress in this emerging technology. Various technical organizations and institutions, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and IBM, have outlined the mid-2030s as a time when fears over CRQCs will become more practical and real. In fact, many tech giants, such as Google and Amazon, have already implemented changes to prepare for what has increasingly become known as Q-Day.

One of the reasons those in the crypto space are interested in being particularly proactive when it comes to quantum preparedness—outside the fact that everything will break if a CRQC appears without being sufficiently prepared—is that decentralized systems tend to be more difficult to upgrade than centralized tech companies that have lead decision makers with the ability to have the final say on changes. Due to this longer timeframe associated with crypto network upgrades, it makes sense to start working on this issue before it is anywhere near an obvious, imminent threat.

quantum resilience is a clear priority for ethereum (and solana, and, and). bitcoin devs still pretending ""no one technical"" is concerned about quantum? https://t.co/8XmcuY2u9w pic.twitter.com/uh6hrLTTr2

— nic carter (@nic_carter) January 19, 2026



Of course, it's also true that crypto has become increasingly indistinguishable from traditional, centralized fintech. Blockchain networks are now being centrally operated by traditional fintech firms like Stripe and stablecoin issuers like Circle, as it has become clearer over time that mainstream userbases are more interested in dollar-compatible tokens than more volatile, crypto-native assets like bitcoin and ether. So, from this perspective, the vast majority of the crypto market would likely be able to upgrade to deal with the quantum threat in a timely manner.

On the other hand, Bitcoin itself still maintains a high degree of decentralization in its development process, which has made it extremely difficult to implement changes at the protocol level. The last improvement that altered the base protocol rules was Taproot, which was activated in 2021. The argument that Bitcoin will likely be slower to adopt changes than other networks has merit, as there could be heated disputes over specifics such as whether old, seemingly lost coins should be frozen.

Of course, there are several quantum computing startups that are hopeful old coins will not be frozen, as they'd like a chance to crack the keys holding around half a trillion dollars (depending on the day) worth of bitcoin treasure.

Bitcoin developers also see a hastily added upgrade for quantum computing as a potential security vulnerability and generally reject fear-based protocol developments outside of extreme circumstances. For now, there are some Bitcoin developers working on the issue, including a draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), and according to longtime cypherpunk and Blockstream CEO Adam Back, the correct approach isn't fear but readiness for the worst potential outcome.

Security camera company Ring has launched a new public tool to help people determine if a given video has been edited in some way, including with generative AI technology. And while the tool has some limitations, it's a step in the right direction that all video platforms should be working on to help us determine what's real in the AI age.

Users can visit the Ring Verify landing page and upload any Ring video that they're wondering about. The company describes its system like a “security seal on a package.” If even a second has been edited out or it's been cropped, the “seal breaks,” as it were.

“Ring Verify works for all Ring videos, no matter which Ring device recorded them,” the company said in a blog post announcing the program. “There's nothing to set up—it's automatically included with every video that was downloaded from December 2025 moving forward. Whether you're receiving footage from a neighbor, reviewing a video for a claim, or checking that a shared video is the real deal, you can now verify it's authentic Ring footage that hasn't been tampered with.”

A spokesperson for Ring told Gizmodo that the feature, “was built using C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) protocol, which aims to prove the content authentically came from a given source (Ring), and does operate using a metadata signature.” That signature only works to tell whether something is definitively authentic, and users can't necessarily call anything that isn't verified “fake.” But it's a helpful way to quickly check if a video shared with you has been tampered with.

As the Verge points out, this new tool doesn't really help with the most common potential use case. If you're wondering whether that home security camera footage you're seeing on TikTok or Instagram is real, this isn't going to tell you that. And that's a shame. Because security camera footage is some of the most difficult AI-generated footage to parse when it comes to authenticity.

The common fisheye warp of a security camera or the nighttime pixelation that's expected from home cameras is often used to hide the telltale signs that a given video has been manipulated. But if you upload a video you found on TikTok or Instagram it's likely to have been edited in some way (either by length or aspect ratio) which will mean the Verify tool will tell you it's been altered. However, those alterations don't necessarily mean that it's AI.

Google has a digital watermark program called SynthID that recently became accessible to all users on Gemini. Uploading an image to Gemini, it will be able to tell you whether the image was created using Google's AI generator tools. But, again, the capabilities there are limited. Just because it's missing the invisible watermark doesn't mean that it's “real.” It just means Google didn't help create it.

These tools are admittedly imperfect, but at least it's something for the time being. Because AI generated images are getting scary good. And everyone now has to be on their toes. AI fakes aren't going away anytime soon. And you really can't blindly believe anything you see on the internet anymore.

BitLocker isn't as safe as you think it is. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The FBI served a search warrant to Microsoft in early 2025 to recover the encryption keys on three laptops, with the company complying to allow the agency to access the data on the devices that it otherwise would have been unable to read. According to Forbes, Microsoft spokesperson Charles Chamberlayne said that it receives around 20 requests for BitLocker keys annually, but most of them fail because the user did not store their recovery key in the cloud.

Although there have been many requests through the years, with one Microsoft engineer even claiming that the U.S. government approached him way back in 2013 to install a backdoor in the encryption system (which he declined), this is the first recorded instance where the tech company complied and resulted in a breakthrough for the government.

BitLocker is Microsoft's built-in drive encryption system to protect Windows 11 users. And while it's mostly designed to prevent unauthorized access to a drive's contents, it has also experienced some bugs that can cause a significant loss of data, especially if you forget your encryption key. Nevertheless, Microsoft backs up your BitLocker keys online by default, making it more convenient for users to unlock their drives for situations like this. However, this also makes them vulnerable to valid government requests — not just from the U.S., but from other governments, as well, with less than stellar reputations, especially in human rights.

“While key recovery offers convenience, it also carries a risk of unwanted access,” Chamberlayne told Forbes. “So, Microsoft believes customers are in the best position to decide… how to manage their keys.” Americal Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) surveillance and cybersecurity counsel Jennifer Granick also said, “Remote storage of decryption keys can be quite dangerous.”

Apple offers a similar encryption system to Microsoft's BitLocker with FileVault and Passwords, while Meta also keeps encrypted backups of WhatsApp data. Both companies allow users to keep backup keys for these systems online, but they're also kept in an encrypted file. So, even if a government agency requests a copy of the stored key, neither Apple nor the concerned agency can unlock it without the proper key. Furthermore, Forbes notes that neither Apple nor Meta is known to have acquiesced to a request for an encryption key.

Bag of rocks is starting to become a classic.

Just a few days ago, we covered back-to-back GPU cases from Reddit, one positive and one negative, breaking the pessimistic cycle often associated with these stories. Today, we return to scheduled programming with yet another scam-swap incident: a customer failed to receive what they ordered. Specifically, a Redditor received a bunch of rocks and a towel in lieu of an MSI Suprim RTX 5090, one of the best graphics cards, which is worth at least $3,000 as per our GPU 2026 price tracker.

The victim wrote in r/pcmasterrace, detailing how they'd ordered an RTX 5090 from Amazon Resale, which means the GPU was repackaged and sold, but got sediment instead. Technically, you could use this to make silicon that eventually becomes a GPU die, but unless you're a multi-billion-dollar vertically integrated production line, you're stuck with just rocks.

Unlike most other stories where the card is brought brand-new from Amazon, the open-box nature of this unit complicates things. The post says the box's seal was barely intact, and we can see an LPN label, which means it was a previous return. So, this is a classic switcheroo: someone bought and actually received the real thing, swapped it for rocks to match the weight, and returned it to Amazon, which didn't bother checking what was inside.

The returned item was added to the resale inventory, and u/Dazzling_Course8755 was the unfortunate soul who bought it. What's interesting is that this seems to be the fourth time this has happened to OP, according to their own caption, which really raises questions about the motives here. It's strange that someone who's been wronged three times already would try their luck yet again.

Anyhow, our victim recorded the whole unboxing on their phone after missing a chance to unbox it in front of the driver. As long as the case is legit, this should be a pretty easy return and refund with Amazon. Funny enough, a very similar story unfolded last month when someone received a large brick instead of the RTX 5080 they ordered, which later led to an investigation.

The PLA just introduced a new weapon in the drone arms race. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) just demonstrated its latest drone swarm tech on state TV, showing a single soldier controlling 200 units. According to the South China Morning Post, the drones are launched from the Swarm I land vehicle, A.K.A the High Mobility Swarm Weapon System, which can simultaneously launch 48 fixed-wing drones that work together. Each unit can then autonomously communicate with each other, allowing the entire swarm to fly in precise formation and divide tasks among themselves, like conducting multi-target reconnaissance and strike operations, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said in the report.

“Each drone is equipped with an intelligent algorithm,” National University of Defence Technology's School of Intelligent Science research fellow Xiang Xiaojia said to CCTV. “Through interconnection and autonomous negotiation, they can form a powerful, collaborative intelligent swarm.” Aside from that, the drones combat electromagnetic interference using an autonomous anti-jamming algorithm, allowing them to continue operating even without contact from an operator. “Even a single person can control a swarm of more than 200 fixed-wing drones launched simultaneously from multiple vehicles,” the state broadcaster said.

The PLA first showed off its drone swarm capability at the 2021 Zhuhai air show with the Swarm I, which is reportedly capable of wide-area reconnaissance and can saturate multiple targets simultaneously. A second, more improved version was released at the same event in 2024, with the Swarm II getting a higher top speed of 100 kph (62 mph) and an endurance of more than an hour. It also gained the ability to carry multiple payloads, including reconnaissance pods, munitions, and relay communication devices. Aside from this, China's first “drone carrier” amphibious assault ship has begun sea trials in late 2025, which could give it additional capabilities to launch drone strikes well away from its borders and hit relatively distant targets.

China isn't the only country developing its own drone system — both Russia and Ukraine have extensively used drones in the conflict that began in 2022, while the U.S. Army is using 3D printing to build and repair drones on-site. As with any new weapon system, nations are also developing countermeasures against them. Some defense startups in the United States are working on an AI drone killer jet to intercept them in the air, while the U.S. military is testing microwave and laser systems that will take down multiple drones in a single shot. The Royal Navy is also equipping a destroyer with the experimental DragonFire laser system, designed to shoot down enemy drones at just $13 per shot.

Another thrift store miracle


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Looking for an unbeatable deal on used PC hardware? A trip to your local thrift store might be worth it. That's precisely what one Reddit user discovered after stumbling upon an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT at their local Goodwill for just $4.99. This is one of the many thrift-store PC scores we've seen recently and quite a good one considering the RX 5700 XT, which used to be one of the best graphics cards, is still capable of reliable 1080p and even 1440p gaming. Custom models are selling for over $500, according to our GPU 2026 price tracker.

According to u/12kdaysinthefire, who scored the ASRock-branded Radeon RX 5700 XT, the card was allegedly modified by its previous owner, with the thermal paste and pads replaced by copper cooling blocks. The new owner restored the card by salvaging thermal pads from an older GPU, applying fresh thermal paste, and reassembling the cooler. After the fix, the GPU worked without any issues. This shows that sometimes thrift-store hardware needs a bit of basic maintenance to function again.

The AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT launched back in 2019, based on AMD's first-generation RDNA (Navi) architecture. Built on a 7nm process, the RX 5700 XT came with 8GB of GDDR6 memory on a 256-bit bus, 2,560 stream processors, 160 texture units, and 64 ROPs. Positioned as a strong option for 1080p and 1440p gaming, the GPU debuted with a $399 MSRP and often outperformed Nvidia's RTX 2060 Super in traditional rasterized workloads, though it lacked hardware-accelerated ray tracing.

Thrift store finds like this highlight a pattern we've seen over the past year or so: capable GPUs end up at remarkably low prices simply because they are either untested or poorly labeled. In a similar case, a lucky gamer found an Nvidia RTX 3060 12GB for just $4.99, suggesting that older but still functional hardware can end up in donation piles. With many thrift stores lacking the time or expertise to evaluate PC components, working hardware can easily be mistaken for scrap.

That said, hunting for PC parts at a thrift store always comes with some risk, since there's no guarantee the hardware will work. But this RX 5700 XT shows that older graphics cards can often be revived with basic maintenance and some PC hardware knowledge. For budget gamers or tinkerers willing to take a chance, places like Goodwill can still hide some surprisingly good deals.

Apparently, you have to pay more if you want a new graphics card from Zotac.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Multiple Reddit users report that Zotac has seemingly raised prices across the board for some of its best graphics cards. One Reddit user said on r/pcgaming that prices for various Zotac RTX 5090s jumped by at least $500, while one Redditor claimed on r/buildapcsales that the company increased MSRPs by $200 or more. We checked the pricing history of several Zotac GPUs on PC Part Picker and the Wayback Machine, and compared it with our GPU 2026 price tracker. Although we didn't see the claimed $200 price jump on all graphics cards from the AIB partner, the company did increase the MSRP on several of its GPU models.

The company hasn't released an official statement about the reported price increases, but it follows the trend of rising GPU costs driven by the ongoing memory shortage. We've started hearing reports of GPU rationing in Germany and Japan at the turn of the year, with stores not receiving deliveries of GPUs with 16GB of VRAM or more. So, it's just natural for these graphics cards to become expensive, according to the law of supply and demand. More than that, there were even reports that Nvidia has ended its OPP pricing-support scheme, which allowed AIB partners to sell some graphics card models at MSRP, meaning the supply of these affordable options will likely dry up sooner rather than later.

However, the news of price increases was made worse by one Redditor's report saying that their Zotac GPU order was canceled on the eve of the price increase, with the company blaming it on a system error. Unfortunately, the user hasn't provided an update on whether they've reached out to Zotac or whether the company is taking steps to rectify the situation. The same issue happened to Corsair when it cancelled several $240 48GB DDR5 orders due to a pricing error, resulting in a PR nightmare for the company. Nevertheless, it did offer a 40% off coupon for future RAM orders for affected shoppers.

Another issue like this happened to Corsair at around the same time, when a gamer ordered a $3,499 pre-built PC on New Year's Day, only to find it was canceled the following day and the computer's price was hiked to $4,299. Thankfully, a Corsair representative noticed their post and made it right for that particular user by sending them a coupon that allowed them to purchase the same computer at its original sale price. Hopefully, Zotac also looks into this issue and finds a way to resolve it for the gamer and make everyone happy.

Sensitization to an increasing number of cat or dog allergen molecules was associated with a higher prevalence of asthma symptoms upon pet exposure.

""Sensitization to an increasing number of pet specific allergen molecules was associated with an increased risk of having asthma or rhinoconjunctivitis upon cat and dog exposure. This was especially true for sensitization to lipocalins,” the authors wrote. 

Anna Winberg , PhD, with Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden , was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on January 15, 2026, in International Archives of Allergy and Immunology.

This study was limited by its reliance on self ‑ reported symptoms and by the small numbers of participants sensitized to some individual allergen molecules, which reduced the power for subgroup analyses.

This study was financially supported by the Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation, the Swedish Foundation for Health Care Sciences and Allergy Research, the Swedish Asthma and Allergy Foundation, a regional agreement between Umeå University and Västerbotten County Council, the VISARE NORR fund: Northern County Councils Regional Federation, and Norrbotten County Council. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

A research team led by Professor Yuan Li at Nanjing Medical University published a research paper entitled ""A Cigarette Compound-Induced Tumor Microenvironment Promotes Sorafenib Resistance in Hepatocellular Carcinoma via the 14-3-3η-Modified Tumor-Associated Proteome"" in the Chinese Medical Journal. This work provides valuable insights into the role of smoking in HCC progression and drug resistance, offering potential therapeutic targets for overcoming sorafenib resistance.

The study began with an analysis of clinical follow-up data from HCC patients, revealing that smokers exhibited significantly poorer survival outcomes compared to non-smokers. Building on this finding, a sorafenib-resistant HCC cell model induced by cigarette smoking extract (CSE) was established. These results indicate that cigarette compound exposure continuously activates 14-3-3η via epigenetic accumulation of DNA demethylation, and that, the expression level/promoter methylation degree of 14-3-3η influenced the efficacy of sorafenib. Sorafenib plays a pluripotent role mainly by regulating the phosphorylation of multiple-targeted tyrosine kinases and mitigating angiogenesis. By integrating findings from phospho-antibody and angiogenesis antibody arrays, the authors revealed that 14-3-3η activates the B-Raf/ERK signaling pathway and regulates a cascade of downstream factors.

This activation enhances anti-apoptotic mechanisms, accelerates drug efflux, and promotes neo-angiogenesis, and these three critical processes synergistically contribute to the development of sorafenib resistance in HCC. Finally, in a subcutaneous tumour xenograft model using nude mice, authors further investigated the expression levels of the aforementioned key molecules and evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of arsenic trioxide (ATO). The results demonstrated that ATO monotherapy significantly suppressed 14-3-3η and its downstream targets, while also inhibiting angiogenesis and promoting apoptosis. Notably, the combination of ATO and sorafenib exhibited a synergistic effect, leading to an even more pronounced suppression of tumor progression.

In this study, we systematically elucidated the key molecular mechanisms underlying sorafenib resistance in HCC induced by chronic smoking exposure, as well as the associated regulatory biological processes. Furthermore, we explored the potential therapeutic effects of traditional Chinese medicine components targeting these critical pathways. The findings not only deepen the theoretical understanding of drug resistance mechanisms in HCC but also provide a robust scientific foundation and practical guidance for optimizing strategies to prevent and control malignant tumors. Additionally, this research opens new avenues for the clinical prevention and treatment of HCC, offering promising applications for future therapeutic interventions.

Bacterial infections (BIs) are common and severe complications in patients with liver cirrhosis, but global data are limited. Here, we aimed to evaluate the global prevalence, temporal changes, and associated mortality risk of BIs in liver cirrhosis.

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for eligible studies published without language restrictions until 11 August 2025. A random-effects model was used for meta-analyses, meta-regression by study year, and pooling adjusted hazard ratios.

Fifty-nine studies, including 1,191,421 patients with cirrhosis, were analyzed. The pooled prevalence of BIs (33 studies) was 35.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 29.2–41.4). The prevalence of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp. was 3.8% (95% CI: 2.5–5.2) and 1.5% (95% CI: 0.8–2.6), respectively. The pooled prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria was 6.8% (95% CI: 4.0–11.3). The most common BI sites were the gastrointestinal tract, ascites fluid, and urinary tract. The highest prevalence of BIs was reported in Europe (38.2%; 95% CI: 24.8–53.6), followed by South America (37.5%; 95% CI: 29.7–46.1) and Asia (22.8%; 95% CI: 16.3–30.9). Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure showed the highest prevalence of BIs (44.2%; 95% CI: 29.7–59.8). A modest increasing trend in BIs prevalence was observed over time. BIs were associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with cirrhosis (adjusted hazard ratios 2.22, 95% CI 1.33–3.71).

BIs are common in patients with liver cirrhosis and show a modest upward trend over time, with the highest burdens observed in ACLF and notable regional variation. Gastrointestinal infections, SBP and UTI predominate, gram-negative organisms are more frequent than gram-positive organisms, and MDR pathogens are significant. Importantly, infections are associated with a higher mortality, underscoring the need for improved diagnostic approaches and standardized research frameworks to deliver clearer guidance for the clinical management of patients with liver cirrhosis.

Announcing a new article publication for Zoonoses journal. Mosquito-borne orthoflaviviruses are maintained in cycles involving mosquito and vertebrate hosts. ZIKV persists in nature in a transmission cycle involving NHPs and also infects humans. Its recent emergence in Brazil has indicated the importance of surveying this virus in Brazilian sylvatic environments. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of flavivirus in free-living neotropical primates in Southern Brazil and to characterize the detected strains. Histopathological and molecular evidence is presented that shows free-ranging Alouatta guariba in Southern Brazil were infected by ZIKV closely related to African lineage MR766 (prototype strain, East African).

Eleven NHPs were RT-PCR positive for ZIKV. High throughput sequencing revealed 99.3% identity to ZIKV MR766, 98.7% identity to ZIKV strain ArD157995 (West African), 89.7% identity to ZIKV P6-740 (Asian strain), and a 216-nucleotide deletion in the NS3 coding region. Isolation attempts resulted in low viral titers, which were insufficient for further experiments.

The main lesions in affected NHPs were microcephaly, palatoschisis, calcifications in the neuropil, and discrete inflammatory infiltrates in several tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated viral antigen positivity in one placenta.

Repeated detection of an African-lineage ZIKV in the same season over three consecutive years in the Americas in NHPs suggested more than one introduction of ZIKV into the Americas.

A new expert consensus made available online on 10 October 2025 and published in Volume 5, Issue 4 of the journal Intelligent Medicine on 1 November 2025, sets out a structured framework to assess large language models (LLMs) before they are introduced into clinical workflows. The guidance responds to the rapid uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for diagnostic support, medical documentation, and patient communication, and the corresponding need for consistent evaluation of safety, effectiveness, and fairness.

The consensus formalizes retrospective evaluation-testing fully trained models on real or simulated clinical data in specific care contexts, without further modifying the models-to verify performance, ethical compliance, and operational readiness prior to deployment.

Developed in line with World Health Organization guideline methods and registered on the Practice Guideline Registration for Transparency (PREPARE) platform (ID: PREPARE-2025CN503), the consensus draws on literature review, Delphi procedures, and multidisciplinary expert deliberation. In the final round, 35 experts achieved agreement on six recommendations.

The consensus also defines six key LLM capability domains for assessment: medical knowledge question and answer; complex medical language understanding; diagnosis and treatment recommendation; medical documentation generation; multi-turn dialogue; and multimodal dialogue.

Emphasizing essential safeguards for patient data protection, bias mitigation, and the need for AI outputs to remain clinically explainable, the authors of the consensus are positioned to support the advancement of safer, more reliable, and ethically governed LLM applications within healthcare systems globally.

The World Health Organization (WHO) Member States this week advanced their negotiations on the Pathogen Access and Benefit‑Sharing (PABS) system in a resumed session of the Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) on the WHO Pandemic Agreement. The PABS system is a core element of the agreement adopted by the World Health Assembly (WHA) in May 2025.

During the session held on 20–22 January 2026, Member States continued text‑based negotiations on outstanding issues in the draft annex and exchanged views aimed at narrowing differences and identifying areas of convergence.

""I am encouraged by the progress we have made in several areas, with signs of emerging consensus for some parts of the Pathogen Access and Benefit‑Sharing system,"" said IGWG Bureau co‑chair Ambassador Tovar da Silva Nunes, of Brazil. ""As we look ahead to the fifth session, the focus will be on the outstanding, complex issues. The resumed session has helped us gain a clearer picture of where we stand.""

Established by the WHA, the IGWG is tasked, as a priority, with drafting and negotiating the PABS system, which is intended to enable safe, transparent and accountable sharing of pathogens with pandemic potential and their genetic sequence information, alongside the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use, including vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.

The resumed session was held following a request by Member States to extend the fourth meeting of the IGWG, which convened in December 2025.

""Member States have engaged in constructive discussions this week,"" said IGWG Bureau co-chair Mr Matthew Harpur, of the United Kingdom. ""As we make progress towards the May deadline, I am encouraged by their willingness to work together and bridge differences to deliver an effective Pathogen Access and Benefit‑Sharing system.""

Further meetings of the IGWG are scheduled in the coming months as Member States continue their negotiations.

A strong Pathogen Access and Benefit‑Sharing system will be a cornerstone of a safer and more equitable world. I thank countries for their commitment to multilateral solutions.""

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General

The outcome of IGWG's work will be submitted to the Seventy‑ninth World Health Assembly in May 2026 for its consideration.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Ultra-thin nanotechnology enables safe wireless stimulation for retinal degeneration","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260123/Ultra-thin-nanotechnology-enables-safe-wireless-stimulation-for-retinal-degeneration.aspx","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 04:20:00 GMT","

An international research team led by Prof. Dr. Sedat Nizamoğlu from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Koç University has developed a next-generation, safe, and wireless stimulation technology for retinal degenerative diseases that cause vision loss. The study was published in Science Advances, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals.

Retinal degenerative disorders affect millions of people worldwide and currently have no curative treatment. Existing retinal implants, however, face significant clinical limitations due to their bulky structures, complex electronic components, or the need for high-intensity visible light. To overcome these challenges, researchers at Koç University set out to develop an ultra-thin, biocompatible system capable of directly converting light into biological electrical signals.

To achieve this, the team designed a photovoltaic nano-assembly combining zinc oxide nanowire arrays with silver-bismuth-sulfide nanocrystals. This structure enables the conversion of near-infrared light, which penetrates tissue more deeply and safely than visible light, into precisely controlled electrical stimulation without causing damage to ocular tissue. Importantly, this process operates at low light intensities that remain well below established ocular safety limits and does so using a fully wireless, ultra-thin architecture.

The performance of the system was evaluated using retinal models from rats with vision loss. Experiments demonstrated strong, repeatable, and temporally precise responses in retinal neurons. In addition, comprehensive analyses of cell viability, biocompatibility, and long-term stability showed that the structure did not induce cellular stress or toxicity and is suitable for prolonged use. The negligible temperature increase observed during operation further highlights the safety advantages of the approach.What distinguishes this technology from existing retinal implants is its ultra-thin active layer, its use of safer near-infrared light instead of visible light, and its completely wireless design that eliminates the need for external cables or electronic components. These features make the platform a strong candidate not only for visual prostheses but also for broader neuromodulation applications targeting electrically excitable tissues such as the brain, heart, and muscles.

Commenting on the study, Prof. Dr. Sedat Nizamoğlu said: ""This study demonstrates that a nanotechnological retinal implant approach could potentially restore vision in the future for individuals who have lost visual function due to macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. Inorganic nanocrystals, which received the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, are highly promising for retinal prosthesis technology when implemented using functionally optimized nanoarchitectures. Operating with near-infrared light, this nanoscale system offers a significant alternative to existing approaches in terms of performance. Our findings open new avenues not only for visual prosthetics but also for a wide range of biomedical applications that interact with the nervous system.""

This work, carried out at Koç University, once again underscores the university's interdisciplinary research environment and its commitment to high-impact scientific innovation, while paving the way for the development of safer and more effective future treatments for individuals living with vision loss.

The U.S. women's national team will begin its 2026 schedule without the reigning U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year.

Rose Lavelle, who won the prize for the first time last week, will miss the team's friendlies against Paraguay on Saturday, Jan. 24 and against Chile three days later.

USWNT head coach Emma Hayes named an all-NWSL roster for the two matches in California, which aren't on a FIFA date and therefore won't feature any of the team's European-based players.

Lavelle is based in the NWSL, but the 30-year-old midfielder won't be available for the USWNT along with all of her Gotham FC teammates.

Gotham is currently in Europe preparing for the inaugural edition of the FIFA Women's Champions Cup, which features the champions of all six continental confederations.

Lavelle and her teammates qualified as champions of the 2024–25 Concacaf W Champions Cup, which they won in May by defeating Tigres in the final.

Gotham is set to face Brazilian side Corinthians in the semifinal on Wednesday, Jan. 28 at the Gtech Community Stadium in London.

The winner will face the winner of the other semifinal between UEFA Champions League winner Arsenal and Moroccan side AS FAR, with the final set for Sunday, Feb. 1 at the Emirates Stadium in London.

In addition to Lavelle, other likely USWNT call-ups such as Emily Sonnett, Lilly Reale and Jaedyn Shaw will also be with Gotham FC for the Women's Champions Cup.

Gotham will begin the NWSL regular season on March 14 with a match against Boston Legacy FC.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

 CARSON, Ca. -- The U.S women's national team will play its first game of the year, and winger Trinity Rodman is back in the mix following an MCL Sprain and with a brand new historic club contract. 

Head coach Emma Hayes selected a 26-player roster for the annual January camp, and this year's edition will include two games. The USWNT will face Paraguay on Saturday and close out camp with a game against Chile on Tuesday. While a large portion of the group is less experienced and has fewer camps, there are a few players who were part of Hayes' gold medal-winning squad during the 2024 Paris Olympics, including Trinity Rodman. 

Rodman entered USWNT camps without a club affiliation as contract negotiations were ongoing, but she recently signed a new record-setting contract on Thursday.

Here's how to watch the game:

Manager Emma Hayes quickly quelled any doubts on whether or not Rodman would play after a long time away from the national team. The head coach unveiled that Rodman will captain the team during their first match against Paraguay, a conversation she had with the winger as they mapped out training camps and evaluated her progress. 

""I spoke with Trin at the beginning of camp to tell her she'd be the captain in the first game if she'd come through training to start,"" Hayes explained.

 ""We spoke about the expectations of those things in front of the group and all the little details that we were looking for. One of the things that was spoken about is when there is an absence of so many caps and so much leadership here. How are you transferring those values and those customs a little bit around our culture? So that we can steer everybody in the direction that we want? I've also had the same conversation with Claire Hutton. I've had the same conversation with Emily Sams. I think those three in particular have been given more leadership responsibilities by me this week.""

The annual January camp typically serves as the starting point for the USWNT cycle, and this year will include the 2026 Concacaf W Championship, the tournament that serves as qualification for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. Head coach Emma Hayes has been transparent about the unique winter camp and how it will be utilized, as it falls outside of an official international window. 

""Every camp is equally important. I always approach things like it's the day before a World Cup final, and every game should be played with that same intention, no matter the starting lineup,"" Hayes said.

""Yes, we have a much different group than we would ordinarily have, but what a great development opportunity for so many of them. Not all of them, I think, will compete to be part of the group that qualifies for 2027, but I've said it countless times, my job is to prepare players, not just for a single tournament, but to line up successive competitive teams, and some of these players, I think that we'll see on show could be stars of 2031 as well as some that will push into 2028, so, I think we have to be mindful of that.""

The January camp game will also feature a retirement celebration for Christen Press. The long-time former USWNT forward recently announced her retirement and will be honored in her home state when the team faces Paraguay. The formal retirement ceremony for the two-time World Cup champion is an opportunity for the younger players to integrate with older generations.

""When I think of Christen Press and how well traveled her career was, I think she had to do that in the backdrop of maybe being a little bit harder to make those choices as a U.S. women's national team player, whereas I think in this day and age, there is more freedom to move, or more opportunity too that comes with that, because the game has grown. So I think, I think Christen Press is somebody who pioneered in some regards to play abroad, to go and do different things,"" said Hayes.

""She was one of the most threatening players in the world ... I was always a big fan of her play. So, really delighted to honor her. I know I shouldn't say this, but I'm one of the biggest fans of the U.S. women's national team, even though I'm the coach of this team. So whomever it is, being celebrated I feel like I get the chance to honor that and celebrate that as well.""

Following a historic new contract, Trinity Rodman will take the pitch with the U.S women's national team on Saturday against Paraguay, wearing the captain's armband. It's just another milestone for her to check off in a very busy week for the biggest star in NWSL. 

Rodman is a rare thing in sports, she's a bonified no joke cultural celebrity. Part of Rodman's appeal  is her effortless ability to set and contribute to global trends. She's keyed in on what is happening off the pitch in fashion and pop culture, while thrilling sports audiences whenever on the field. She's easily able to connect with young fans and kids and can often be found on the sidelines, even participating in TikTok videos with teammates or supporters. 

Electrifying, athletic, dynamic, and energetic are just some of the different types of ways Rodman's appeal has been described. But now, she's showing another level of maturity that hasn't typically been expressed since turning pro five years ago. It's something that often comes with time, maybe even larger contracts, and is showcased in different ways. For Rodman, it's owning her moment and recognizing its significance in the bigger picture of women's soccer's growth. 

""I think it's an opportunity for me, obviously amazing that I could do it and be making this type of money. It's life-changing,"" Rodman said on her new contract. 

Even with a deal inching toward the finish line ahead of national team camps, she still carried the weight of making a contract decision while preparing to return to international play for the first time since April 2025.

""I think as it progressed a little bit, it was inching closer and closer to kind of the decision I wanted to make, but there was still so much happening with the [Players Association] and the back and forth, so you can't be too sure. But I try to stay in the present moment. And coming into camp, it was weird reading unattached, but I was very focused on first camp back, a leadership role, lots of new faces, and just coming in and doing my job.

""But outside of that, it's to inspire and to kind of push the standard for the entire league. I don't want to be the only player who's able to get this. I think we all work so hard, and we're all improving our game. But most importantly, I think the work that we do with the youth, showing that, while also showing our personalities off the field, because that brings in more people [to the game].""

Maturity and leadership can't be measured in data. It's typically more of a calling, and sometimes people need guidance in embracing the two. U.S. national team Emma Hayes noted the evolved shift in maturity during the unprecedented contract negotiations. 

""I think Trin has been clear on what she wanted. The conversations her and I probably had is that she does care deeply about the impact of the game beyond herself. She does appreciate being a role model for the sport, and she wants to do that in America. And she wants to elevate the NWSL, as do all the players, and she recognizes that being in the spotlight comes with that,"" Hayes said on Rodman's new deal.

""But I think you see with the maturity of and handling of the press [Thursday], I haven't told her this yet. I was like, 'You know what? You're really growing up,' and I'm always proud of that. So I think being settled for any player really matters. And I think having that clarity now, now it's about okay, how do you accomplish your next set of goals, whatever they are, and can focus on that rather than the conversation around her contract situation.""

As the national team prepared for the January friendlies, head coach Emma Hayes spoke with Rodman about taking on the captaincy during the camp in general, before ultimately awarding her the armband for the match against Paraguay. Due to the unique circumstances of the unofficial window, several players, including team captain Lindsey Heaps and vice-captain Naomi Girma, were unavailable for selection due to club commitments in Europe. 

Hayes also held conversations with defender Emily Sams and 20-year-old midfielder Claire Hutton about stepping into leadership roles throughout the camps. But Rodman leads the current roster with the most appearances (47) and goals (11) of anyone in camp. 

""I mean, it's like a weird situation,"" she joked.  ""I haven't been at camp for almost a year, so I have to kind of relearn everything that I missed, which has been an overload. But I don't know. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling happy. Very blessed to be in this situation and to be captain, and to have that arm band is an honor in itself. 

""We're missing a lot of leadership roles on the team right now in this camp, but I'm just trying to do my best at kind of connecting all of the players, because there's a lack of connection, with the lack of play time with each other, and these lineups have been mixed up so much over the past year.""

Though she's not quite ready to refer to herself as a ""veteran,"" mostly due to her age, Rodman is the most capped player currently in the January camps, and she was tasked with taking on more of a leadership role by manager Emma Hayes during the team's winter gathering. 

""Emma was just kind of telling me to connect with the players, have those conversations. If you see somebody is kind of overwhelmed or struggling to just give attention to that and kind of relate, which I can, because I still get really nervous, and even for tomorrow, I'm nervous because it's been almost a year [since playing with USWNT]. I think there's just overall a lot of connection and to try to acknowledge that as much as I can.""

Rodman's quick to distance herself from former team captains out of respect, but as a player who had to look to others for her own lessons, the winger understands that the qualities people look for in leadership are often different. She's taking a leadership approach that's authentic to her while paying homage to the history of team captaincy. 

""I think just continuing to keep and raise the standard of the national team. If it's on the field, just moving quickly between drills, communicating in between 11 to elevens. If it's off the field, in the meal rooms, just being respectful to everybody that's around, just simple stuff. For me, the captains that have been on this team, well, I can't even put myself in the same category, because I have so much to learn and so much to improve on, but I'm just trying to learn from them and continue that legacy of theirs as well.""

Trinity Rodman has become the most recognizable face of the NWSL in recent years, especially after the retirements of former USWNT legends Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, and Christen Press, among others. Like them, she's looking ahead to the next phase of her career and wants to get involved more with youth in the community as her profile continues to rise.

Being in the spotlight sometimes brings unwanted attention, especially when navigating career lows. Though Rodman is hesitant to consider herself in the same category as past USWNT leadership, former stewards have faith in her ability. 

Rodman's decision to stay and play in the NWSL with the Washington Spirit, despite enticing offers from top European clubs, is a culturally significant moment in itself. Though many players dream of playing overseas for the experience, Rodman's new contract challenges the notion that playing in Europe shouldn't define success in isolation. As a vibrant face of the league, her decision to stay will influence other players, but also attract core soccer fans and a broader audience.

Only a few days after signing a record $2 million a year deal with the Washington Spirit, Trinity Rodman on Saturday will take the reins on the pitch.

When the U.S. women's national team takes the field against Paraguay at Dignity Health Park in Carson, Calif. at 5:30 p.m., Rodman will lead the way – as captain of the squad.

It will be the first time that Rodman, who is coming back from back and knee injuries.

“I spoke with Trin at the beginning of camp to tell her she'd be the captain in the first game if she'd come through training to start,” USWNT head coach Emma Hayes said on Friday.

“We spoke about the expectations of those things in front of the group and all the little details that we were looking for. One of the things that was spoken about is when there is an absence of so many caps and so much leadership here. How are you transferring those values and those customs a little bit around our culture? So that we can steer everybody in the direction that we want? I've also had the same conversation with Claire Hutton. I've had the same conversation with Emily Sams. I think those three in particular have been given more leadership responsibilities by me this week.”

Rodman, who hasn't played with the national side since April, accepted her latest challenge with open arms. With 47 caps, she is the most experienced player on the team during the January camp window.

“We have a lot of key leadership players, not in camp this time, but for me, it's just kind of connecting with a lot of players, because we're all around the same age now, which is crazy,” she said in the mixed zone. “But having the experience that I do, but also understanding the nervousness and the feelings of, kind of like first couple camps and big games and coming up on a World Cup year, like everybody's trying to fight for a spot. But also knowing that you have to stay calm and that, like you're going to mess up, you're going to make mistakes, and everybody's in the same position.”

Rodman, 23, who has accrued 11 goals with the national side, the last time in a 2-0 victory over Brazil on April 5.

“It's been a while watching to get back out there and put one in the back of the net,” she said. “I mean, haven't really thought about scoring yet. I'm just really excited to be back representing the U.S. again. More responsibility this time. I'm just happy to be out there with the girls and just healthy.

“Scoring would be nice have a little celebration, maybe not the back celebration, but something different.”

The USWNT will have another captain for Tuesday night's game against Chile in Santa Barbara, Calif.

New Zealand's Auckland FC are one of eight teams involved in the seven-nation OFC Professional League Cameron Spencer/Getty Images

Last weekend, a new international league kicked off.

Eight clubs from seven nations across Oceania — the vast geographic region comprised of more than 10,000 islands and 14 countries, including Australia and New Zealand — are competing in the inaugural OFC Professional League.

The competition is the first properly cross-border league in the sport, designed to incorporate club sides from microstates into a professional competitive structure and provide them with a pathway to major tournaments. Its creation is a landmark moment in the game which may provide an insight into its future, with the possibility of further cross-border leagues and a potential foreshadowing of continent-wide league tournaments globally.

Lambert Maltock, the president of the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC), said the new league “will change the landscape of football in Oceania, forever”. But its impact may stretch beyond the part of the world it calls home.

The OFC Professional League contains two clubs from New Zealand and one each from Australia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Tahiti and Vanuatu. The OFC wants to incorporate a team from Hawaii, which, as a U.S. state, falls under the remit of Concacaf (the federation for North and Central America and the Caribbean) and does not have a professional football structure.

The new venture is the only professional league structure in the OFC — the Australia-based A-League is also professional, but Australian sides at club and international level switched to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 2006.

The first phase consists of each team playing its seven opponents twice over five ‘circuits', the first of which is being hosted in New Zealand, before later ‘circuits' in Papua New Guinea, Australia, the Solomon Islands and Fiji.

After 14 rounds of matches, the second phase will begin with the teams split into two groups: a leaders' play-off section, consisting of the top four sides (they will compete for three semi-final berths), and a challengers' play-off pool — the four remaining teams, with the final last-four spot up for grabs. Each side will play their three opponents once at this stage.

The semi-finals and final will be single-leg matches. All games in the second phase, including the semi-finals and final, will be played in New Zealand, and each team is guaranteed a minimum of 17 games per season.



The winners of the league will represent Oceania at the FIFA Intercontinental Cup (the new name for the annual version of the Club World Cup) later this year, as well as at the next now four-yearly Club World Cup, set for 2029.

South Melbourne, who last month won the second-division Australian Championship title, cannot qualify for those FIFA tournaments because, as detailed above, Australia is now part of the AFC. Should they win the OFC Professional League, the competition's spot would go to its runners-up.

Auckland FC, a New Zealand club founded in 2024 to play in the A-League, will field an age-restricted team as part of the conditions of their entry. They can qualify for those FIFA tournaments, due to New Zealand being part of the OFC.

Auckland City (not to be confused with Auckland FC), who represented Oceania in last year's Club World Cup in the United States, are not fully professional. This led to concerns their participation in the tournament would create a competitive imbalance as they faced some of the giants of the global game. They were paid an entry fee of $3.58million (£2.67m at the current rate) by FIFA, world football's governing body and the event's organiser.

This was significantly lower than any of the other 31 clubs in the tournament, with each side's fee calculated on “ranking based on sporting and commercial criteria”. This variation followed concerns that the huge amounts on offer would further widen financial inequalities across the sport and warp domestic leagues.

While Auckland's part-timers lost 10-0 to Germany's Bayern Munich and 6-0 to Benfica of Portugal, their 1-1 draw against Boca Juniors, one of Argentina's biggest clubs and six-time champions of South America, earned them an additional $1million — the fee for drawing a match in the group stage. A victory would have been double that sum.

In March 2023, FIFA president Gianni Infantino pledged support from his organisation for the concept of an Oceania league.

“The proposals are a win-win for the development of all forms of the game across the region,” Infantino said, as per oceaniafootball.com. “I once again pledge FIFA's full support to help our friends and colleagues in Oceania to make this proposal become a reality.”

The league's matches will be broadcast on the FIFA+ platform,

This past October, the Fiji Football Association reported quotes from its president Rajesh Patel that the OFC Professional League would be funded by a four-year, $20million agreement with Saudi Arabia's tourism authority. “We are thankful for this investment, which makes professional football a reality in our region,” Patel said at the launch of Bula FC, his country's representatives in the league.

No official confirmation of this investment has been made by the OFC, though.

Its initial league presentation was made in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital, at the World Football Summit in December 2024.

The OFC Professional League is the only truly cross-border soccer league, but there are multiple examples of clubs playing in leagues of nations other than their own.

Canadian sides Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps and CF Montreal all play in Major League Soccer, which otherwise consists of teams from the United States. This arrangement allows greater growth potential, more income, stronger competition and a higher platform for these clubs than the Canadian Premier League (CPL). MLS is motivated by greater club diversity and exposure to the Canadian market.

Auckland FC and fellow New Zealanders Wellington Phoenix play in Australia's A-League, with similar motivations for the clubs and league as in MLS.

In the United Kingdom, five Welsh clubs have remained in the English system throughout their existence: Cardiff City, Swansea City, Newport County, Wrexham and Merthyr Tydfil. Colwyn Bay decided in 2019 to join the Welsh system after dropping down the English pyramid. No Welsh football league system existed when those clubs were formed, hence their places in the English pyramid.

Similarly, all pro clubs in Liechtenstein play in the Swiss football system, as Liechtenstein has no professionally-organised league of its own. Other microstate clubs are incorporated into neighbouring leagues: Monaco are part of the French setup, FC Andorra play in the Spanish one and San Marino Calcio are in the Italian structure.

Derry City, from the Northern Irish city of Derry, play in the Republic of Ireland's League of Ireland. The club moved away from the Northern Irish league due to security concerns related to The Troubles — an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland that lasted for about 30 years from the late 1960s to 1998 — that saw police ask them to play their home matches in Coleraine, 30 miles away. Since 1985, Derry City have played in the League of Ireland.

A unification of the leagues in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has recently been promoted by Kieran Lucid, an Irish tech entrepreneur based in Belfast.

The arguments for all such league unifications are similar: smaller competitions are being left behind the game's bigger nations because of less lucrative TV deals, smaller markets, less potential for growth, and a limited range of opponents.

These ideas all face similar challenges too: participating clubs would lose access to a top division, the number of available qualification spots for the three competitions run by UEFA, European football's governing body (a key source of revenue for some of these leagues) would halve, travel costs would increase for clubs and away fans, and any novelty factor is likely to dissipate.

Other challenges are likely to emerge, too. The premise of the leagues is that a certain number of representative clubs from each nation would be present in the top tier, calculated on population size. Yet that balance may see teams avoid relegation, or being denied promotions earned on the pitch, so these ratios were maintained.

For Ireland, too, a political argument exists that may provide an additional challenge. The island was partitioned in 1921, with Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland becoming an independent nation.

But what about elsewhere?

In 2021, it was widely reported that Belgium's Pro League clubs had voted unanimously to merge with their Dutch neighbours to form a “BeNeLiga”. The two European nations share close cultural and socio-economic ties, with league unification becoming a topic of discussion at several points but there have not yet been similar agreements in the Netherlands. For many of its smaller clubs, they are unlikely to volunteer to lose lucrative matches against Dutch football's big three: Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord.

Elsewhere, Latvian league president Maksims Krivunecs has promoted the idea of a Baltic League which would combine teams from his country with Lithuanian and Estonian sides. The three nations have a combined population of around six million, with Latvia the highest ranked in UEFA's league coefficients at 39th. Krivunecs is quoted by BBC Sport this month as saying that a combined league with Estonia and Lithuania is a “necessity”.

His proposal would maintain each of the three domestic leagues but would halve their number of games, with the leading teams from each nation then entering a combined competition for the second half of each season. Krivunecs believes this proposal would maintain the individual national champions, and thus continued entrance into UEFA competition for the clubs concerned, while creating additional prize money and sponsorship opportunities from a combined league.

The true gap in European football is between west and east, with each of the top eight domestic leagues all in the west. No Eastern European club has reached the European Cup/Champions League final since Crvena Zvezda's victory in 1991. That preceded the Balkan Wars and the breakup of Yugoslavia into seven successor states: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo.

Those nations continue to directly compete in basketball's ABA League, with mooted reports of a possible merger in football, but without any official talks at league level. Any such move is unlikely, due to security concerns.

Swift Hesperange, a club from Luxembourg, claims that certain UEFA statutes and those of the Luxembourg Football Federation (FLF) are in breach of European Union law. They are legally challenging these regulations and essentially are presenting a case for cross-border leagues spanning multiple nations.

In 2021, FIFA president Infantino suggested Mexico and the U.S. should team up for a league “that could quite well be the best in the world”. With teams from Canada already represented in MLS, this could be the basis of a Concacaf League, such as the one which has just commenced in Oceania.

In November 2019, Infantino travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo to celebrate the 80th birthday of Tout Puissant Mazembe, one of the biggest and most successful clubs in Africa.

“We have to take the 20 best African clubs and put them in an African league,” Infantino told reporters during that visit. “Such a league could make at least $200million (£164m at today's rates) in revenue, which would put it among the top 10 in the world.”

In 2021, plans for the African Super League — which it was initially called — were approved by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), African football's governing body.

In August of the next year, it was announced that the league would involve 24 teams from 16 countries (it was never clarified how the 24 would qualify/be selected). These would be split into three regional groups — north, central west and south east — of eight, who would play each other home and away, with a promotion-relegation system. There would be 197 matches overall, and the league was due to run from August 2023 through to the following May.

Infantino said the project would be a “world first” and a “game-changer”.

Before its launch, however, the competition's name was changed to the African Football League and it was scaled back to an eight-team knockout format for its inaugural season. Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa beat Morocco's Wydad AC in the final, with clubs from DR Congo, Nigeria, Tunisia, Angola, Tanzania and Egypt also involved.

A statement from CAF in August 2023 read: “The inaugural AFL is a precursor to the fully-fledged AFL competition, which will feature the 24 highest-ranked football clubs on the African continent and will commence during the 2024-2025 football season.”

The competition did not return for 2024–25, however, and no longer appears on CAF's competition list.

In April 2021, a plan to create a 20-team, closed-shop European Super League (ESL) fell apart following a substantial backlash from supporters. Of the 12 founding members, nine pulled out swiftly following its launch. Another, Juventus, said in 2023 that they had withdrawn from the proposal, leaving just Barcelona and Real Madrid attached to the project.

In December 2023, A22 — the Madrid-based management company working on behalf of the ESL — announced a change of proposals, to 64 clubs competing in three divisions. Relegation and promotion would be possible between those tiers, with the potential for 20 teams to qualify for the league each season via their domestic results. TV coverage would also be free for fans. It did not, however, reveal how sides would access this revised competition.

The ESL's plans had changed again by December 2024, with a proposed four-tier format, comprising 96 clubs, with teams qualifying via their domestic leagues. The project was repackaged as the Unify League, which would be divided into four sections — Star, Gold, Blue and Union — with 16 teams each in the first two, and 32 in both of the others.

Last November, A22 wrote to UEFA demanding pre-authorisation of its Unify League concept “within eight weeks”. The competition would, in theory, challenge UEFA's Champions League, Europa League and Conference League system, rather than nations' domestic leagues.

Yet the OFC Professional League has not only removed international borders for the concept of league competition but crosses the jurisdictions of multiple continental governing bodies.

It may provide the blueprint for the sport's evolution in the coming decade.

The president of Bundesliga club FC St. Pauli, Oke Gottlich, has called for a serious discussion about boycotting the 2026 FIFA World Cup due to recent actions by U.S. President Donald Trump. 

Gottlich, who also serves as a vice-president of the German Football Federation, said the current political climate warrants a deeper look at whether the global football spectacle should proceed as planned in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

In an interview with German media, Gottlich made clear that the idea of a boycott should not be dismissed lightly. 

“The time has come [to] seriously consider and discuss this,” Gottlich said. “What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s? By my reckoning, the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.”

Gottlich's comments reflect broader unease among some football fans and officials about the political environment surrounding the hosts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Reports indicate that political tensions in the United States have already contributed to protests and even ticket cancellations linked to politics and safety concerns, with thousands of fans withdrawing from ticket plans in recent months amid a hashtag-driven boycott movement.

Gottlich also voiced deeper concerns about how sport intersects with societal values, and he challenged both football administrators and political leaders to clarify where “taboos and boundaries” should lie. 

“As organizations and society, we're forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries and how to defend values. Taboos are an essential part of our stance,” he continued. 

“Is a taboo crossed when someone threatens? Is a taboo crossed when someone attacks? When people die? I would like to know from Donald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from Bernd Neuendorf and Gianni Infantino,” Gottlich concluded.

The broader context includes political actions by Trump that critics argue could affect perceptions of the World Cup host nation and fan participation.

Political rhetoric about safety and internal U.S. policy has at times spilled into discussions about match locations and travel, prompting debates over how politicised events should be when international sport is meant to unify fans from across the world.

Despite Gottlich's call for debate, resistance to a boycott is expected among many football leaders, and the prospect of full withdrawal from the tournament remains uncertain as the global game prepares for its biggest event in 2026.

Bournemouth president of football operations Tiago Pinto claimed Real Madrid summer signing Dean Huijsen is the “only center back” that can win the Ballon d'Or one day. 

After a breakout season with the Cherries, Huijsen's stock rose so spectacularly that Los Blancos paid a record-breaking £50 million ($67.2 million) for the Spain international ahead of the 2025–26 season. The 20-year-old became the most expensive defender in club history. 

Huijsen had a bright start in a white shirt at the Club World Cup and in the early stages under former boss Xabi Alonso, but his form took a dive in October and he has yet to fully return to the level needed to play at Real Madrid. 

Still, Pinto backs the former Bournemouth standout to reach extraordinary heights as he continues to grow and evolve his game. “I'll give you a headline: For me, he's the only center back who can win the Ballon d'Or. That's what I think of Dean Huijsen,” he told MARCA.

“He plays with his right foot, with his left ... He's tall, he scores goals and he has spectacular technique. I insist, for me, of the players I know, he's the only central defender who can win the Ballon d'Or.”

Huijsen made the move to the Spanish capital with lofty expectations, not just because of his price tag, but also because of his five-year contract. Real Madrid put their faith in the 20-year-old to one day become the new leader of their defense. 

After all, Antonio Rüdiger is 32 years old and in the final six months of his contract. David Alaba is a year older and also expected to leave the club this summer. Éder Militão will therefore be the only veteran center back left at the Bernabéu, and the 28-year-old's extensive injury history makes him an unreliable figure at the back.    

The pathway for Huijsen to rise and eventually assume full control of the team's backline is clear, and he could bring a silkiness on the ball that his current fellow center backs and even club legends like Sergio Ramos never had. Yet his confidence at the minute is lacking.

“I've had quite a few injuries lately and I finally feel physically fit,” Huijsen told Movistar+ after Real Madrid's 6–1 rout over Monaco. “I've been playing injured for two or three months, unable to sprint properly. I'm happy to feel good because the level I was playing at wasn't my best.”

Huijsen returned from injury in the Spanish Super Cup final against Barcelona, and was the worst defender on the pitch. One week later against Levante, new boss Álvaro Arbeloa pulled him 60 minutes into the game after several head-scratching, nervy decisions. 

The center back then put in a sublime showing against Monaco, looking more and more like the player Real Madrid signed over the summer. 

It has no doubt been a whirlwind seven months for Huijsen, who signed with Real Madrid in May and then made his debut one month later at the Club World Cup. Since then, the Spaniard has amassed 26 appearances in a white shirt, played in his first Clásico and Madrid derby, suffered nagging injuries and then saw the club swap Alonso for Arbeloa on the touchline.

Perhaps there have been more growing pains than expected, both on and off the pitch, for Huijsen in his move from the Premier League to La Liga, but Pinto has all the confidence in the exciting talent. 

“You can't expect them to ‘devour' Real Madrid in six months. They're a huge club. They have to learn and develop other things,” Pinto said.

Huijsen has the chance to make up for his shaky start at Real Madrid by putting in a solid second half of the season. The team is only one point off Barcelona atop the La Liga standings and currently sit third in the Champions League table with one match left to play. 

With so many injuries hindering Los Blancos' defense, Arbeloa needs Huijsen to take his game to the next level if the Spanish giants want to contend for trophies.

""One-person companies"": How FIFA is using influencers to drown out traditional media -  The Bridge Chronicle

As the countdown to the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico intensifies, FIFA has signalled a radical shift in its broadcast philosophy. By inkling a major partnership with TikTok, the world governing body is moving beyond traditional television to embrace the ""creator economy,"" granting digital influencers unprecedented behind-the-scenes access to the 104-match tournament.

Join our WhatsApp Channel to Stay Updated!

FIFA's partnership aims to generate an ""avalanche of posts"" by providing online personalities with front-row seats, archive footage, and match highlights. This follows a successful blueprint set by DAZN during the FIFA Club World Cup, where a network of 50 creators drove over 500,000 fans to their streaming service.

Authenticity: Creators are viewed as more ""trustworthy"" by the 16-to-34 demographic compared to traditional anchors.

Productivity: Known as ""one-person companies,"" these influencers perform, shoot, edit, and post with a speed that legacy media cannot match.

Control: Unlike independent journalists, creators often operate within a media environment where the demands of the ""client"" (FIFA) come first.

One of the most controversial aspects of the influencer model is its ability to shape public perception. By using a roster of hand-picked creators, FIFA can steer the global conversation away from ""problematic"" topics and toward pure enthusiasm.

A notable example cited is DAZN's use of creator Emily Austin to interview Donald Trump; rather than a hard-hitting journalistic inquiry, the segment served to celebrate the tournament's success and flatter both the host nation and FIFA.

The transition is not without friction. In the US, Fox holds the rights that TikTok would need to ""sublicense"" to show certain footage. Similarly, in the UK, the BBC and ITV maintain a joint hold on digital and linear broadcasts.

Whether these traditional broadcasters will allow TikTok creators to ""disrupt"" their exclusive territory remains the primary roadblock to FIFA's total digital domination.

                    FIFA paid $1 billion among 32 teams in the men's 2025 Club World Cup. 
                                      

FIFA will pay $2.3 million in prize money to the club that wins the first Women's Champions Cup at Arsenal's stadium next week.

The total fund detailed on Friday (January 23, 2026) by FIFA will share $3.9 million among the six continental champions. The final stages in London are a warmup for a planned full Women's Club World Cup in 2028.

European champion Arsenal will play ASFAR of Morocco after Gotham from the United States plays Corinthians of Brazil in back-to-back semifinals on Wednesday (January 28, 2026) at the home of Premier League club Brentford. The final at Arsenal's stadium on February 1 will follow a third-place game at the same venue.

The champion gets $2.3 million and the beaten finalist $1 million, with $200,000 paid to each of the losing semi-finalists.

Two continental champions already eliminated in earlier rounds — Auckland United from Oceania and Wuhan Chegu Jiangda representing Asia — each get $100,000.

“The prize money is a clear statement of the belief in women's club football and the players, teams and competitions driving its continued rise,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafström said in a statement. Arsenal got more than 1.5 million euros ($1.8 million) in prize money for winning the UEFA Women's Champions League last season.

FIFA paid $1 billion among 32 teams in the men's 2025 Club World Cup. That tournament in the United States was backed by Saudi Arabian money to ensure influential European clubs got the prize money they sought to agree to take part.

Three years on from his seismic arrival at Chelsea after one of the most dramatic transfer sagas in recent memory, Enzo Fernandez is facing an uncertain future at Stamford Bridge. Supposedly growing disillusioned with life under BlueCo, the midfielder has been linked with some of Europe's biggest clubs - and his current employers are said to be willing to do business.

It's unclear who or what the driver is behind the speculation, with the player reportedly 'considering his options' having recently changed agents, while it's claimed Chelsea are 'open to selling' if the price is right. But there is no smoke without fire.

This unwanted noise comes almost exactly three years since Fernandez joined the Blues in a blockbuster £107 million ($131m) move from Benfica. In truth, we have only recently started to see the Argentine at his best, but if the rumours are to be believed, he won't be hanging around much longer.

A fan favourite and one of the faces of BlueCo's 'project' at Stamford Bridge, the club's unpopular owners will me making another serious transfer misstep if they cash in on the World Cup winner during the summer.

Fernandez's time at Chelsea has been a slow burn, but three years on from his arrival, it feels as though we are beginning to witness a player entering his peak years. Enzo Maresca's arrival as head coach in the summer of 2024 seemed to propel his game to another level, while Moises Caicedo's form at the base of midfield has freed him up to assert himself further up the pitch.

Having racked up a combined 26 goals and assists last term, albeit those numbers are padded by the Conference League, Fernandez has struck eight times and laid on four more from the middle of the park this time around, and we're only in January. That figure doesn't include his four Club World Cup contributions, either.

But his eye for goal and creativity are not even his greatest attributes, with his tireless running, intensity and leadership qualities, as he often dons the captain's armband, all absolutely vital to a young squad that is so often criticised for lacking nous and experience. It is rare that he is not among the Blues' top performers. 

Crucially, Fernandez has been a near ever-present, too, in a team that has had more than its fair share of injury problems; the Argentine has missed just one Premier League match so far, and that is despite struggling with chronic knee pain. It is little surprise that, according to The Athletic, he is considered to be the player who improved the most under Maresca by those within the walls of Stamford Bridge.

Speaking in an interview with Koora Break in November, Fernandez alluded to his strong relationship with Maresca and his coaching staff, saying: ""I went through an incredible process here at the club with many changes, and well, today I feel very good with a group of people who are my team-mates, with whom I share every day, with the coaching staff. The truth is that I feel very happy today.""

The concern now will be whether the Italian tactician's sudden and acrimonious exit from Stamford Bridge will have changed things. The head coach was dismissed on New Year's Day in the wake of an outburst against the club's hierarchy and the breakdown of his relationship with the board behind the scenes.

Fernandez shared a heartfelt farewell message to Maresca on social media in the aftermath, writing: ""Mister, thank you for everything shared and experienced during this stage, I learned a lot and I value every advice and experience. We won two titles together that I will never forget. Much success to you and hopefully our paths will cross again in the future.""

Two weeks later, reports emerged in France claiming that the midfielder was 'considering his future' in west London as a result of the decision to part ways with Maresca, with the suggestion that he is growing disillusioned by the managerial churn at Chelsea; Maresca's replacement, Liam Rosenior, is the seventh manager he has worked under in just three years if you include interims Bruno Saltor, Frank Lampard and Calum McFarlane.

According to L'Equipe, it is Paris Saint-Germain who are keen to capitalise on Fernandez's purported disenchantment with the way Chelsea are being run, earmarking him as a long-term target as the Champions League winners look to build a more competitive squad having fallen below their lofty standards so far this season.

Fernandez has long been linked with La Liga giants Real Madrid, too, but that speculation seems to be gaining more momentum as Los Blancos face up to the possibility of having to overhaul parts of their squad in what could become a transitional period following Xabi Alonso's sacking. The midfielder has previously admitted to ""always"" playing as Real on video game EA FC.

However, all of this is caveated by the fact that Fernandez still has a massive six years to run on his contract with the Blues, and because his current employers overpaid massively to sign him in 2023 for £107m, he will command a fee that would surely need to be north of that, which feels likely to price Madrid out of the equation. Whether PSG see fit to go that high for someone who wouldn't necessarily start among a group of midfielders that features Vitinha, Joao Neves and Fabian Ruiz remains to be seen.

It is worth noting that the 25-year-old did switch representatives recently - often a sign that a player is weighing up his future - and has conspicuously signed with the agency owned by his compatriot and former PSG player, Javier Pastore.

For what it's worth, new Chelsea head coach Rosenior has been outspoken in his desire to keep one of the club's most influential figures. Addressing the speculation surrounding his player, the 41-year-old said: ""It means nothing to me. When you're a world-class player, an outstanding player, there's always going to be speculation that you can't control. He's been outstanding in the time I've worked with him.

""He's even surprised me in a good way in terms of what he did on Saturday - to be ill and cover the ground that he did, the way that he's trained and the way that he's performed. He's a Chelsea player. He's very important to me. And I think we're going to have a really, really good, hopefully winning relationship moving forward in the short term and the long term.""

Rosenior added: ""I think Enzo, because he's got an extreme skillset; technically he's outstanding and he covers ground well, he finishes, he scores goals, he arrives late in the box, he arrives well in the box. A player of his level can do many different things. I need to find out what the chemistry is like around his position, not just him but for all the players. I don't say players are one position, I've always used players in different roles. I will do that with Enzo because he's an outstanding player.""

However, Rosenior's position on Fernandez may well be undermined by those above him in the Stamford Bridge food chain. It has been reported that Chelsea are in fact willing to sell one of their prized assets, with Enzo not among a group of players - presumably including Caicedo and Cole Palmer - who are considered to be off limits when it comes to transfer offers.

The implication is that, should a bid arrive that is close to their valuation, the Blues would surprisingly be open to doing business. Bearing in mind the eye-watering fee that Fernandez arrived for three years ago, it would surely take an astronomical figure to really pique Chelsea's interest, but it seems an exit isn't out of the question.

This is the BlueCo model, after all: buying young, high-potential players, developing them, inherently increasing their market value and eventually selling them for a profit. This would just be the most extreme example of it, and it is not a deal that would go down well amid bubbling disgruntlement among the fanbase over the way the club is being run.

Selling Fernandez at this stage of Chelsea's transition would be the latest in a string of grave missteps in the transfer market by BlueCo. Having been there since almost the very start of their stewardship, the Argentine is one of the faces of their so-called 'project' - something he has demonstrated that he is heavily invested in.

""I think last season was the first year in which we've really seen what the Chelsea project is about, having seen only a few moments of potential on the pitch in recent years,"" he said in a recent interview with Ben Jacobs. ""We aren't settling for that as we want to keep competing at the highest level and fighting for the Premier League and Champions League, so I think we're on the right path.""

Indeed, despite the chaos that has unfolded around him, Fernandez had bought in even before he signed with the club. ""When Chelsea came in for me, I had no doubts,"" he continued. ""I wanted to make the move up, in sporting terms, to the Premier League. I wanted to come to Chelsea at all costs and didn't want to let the opportunity pass me by. Everyone knows that and thank God it worked out. I'm here now and I'm very happy.""

Though Maresca's exit has brought more uncertainty, there is no doubt that Chelsea stand within reach of tangible, consistent success once again, if they play their cards right. But what kind of message does selling one of your star players to exactly the kind of elite club they want to be competing with send? This is not the way for Chelsea to take that next step.","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com', 'title': 'FOX Sports'}","soccer"

				Calls grow to weaponize football as the U.S. president escalates tensions with Europe.			

A senior German football executive has urged Europe to consider boycotting the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating rhetoric over Greenland and broader foreign policy moves spark unease across the continent.

Oke Göttlich, president of Bundesliga club St. Pauli and a vice president of the German Football Association, said in an interview with German media that the time had come to “seriously consider and discuss” a boycott, comparing the current moment to the Cold War-era Olympic boycotts of the 1980s. 

“What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s?” Göttlich told the Hamburger Morgenpost. “By my reckoning, the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.”

Göttlich also took aim at FIFA President Gianni Infantino — widely seen as a close ally of Trump — accusing football's leadership of applying double standards.

“Qatar was too political for everyone, and now we're completely apolitical?” he said. “That really, really bothers me.”

His comments add momentum to a growing debate in Europe over whether global sport can remain insulated from politics as Trump ramps up pressure on allies — from threats surrounding Greenland to U.S. military action in Venezuela — while treating the World Cup as a major soft-power trophy of his second term.

Not all governments are receptive. France's sports minister said this week there was “no desire” in Paris to boycott the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, arguing that sport should remain separate from politics.

Still, several European football leaders have already shown a willingness to wade into political disputes. The president of Norway's football federation, Lise Klaveness, has repeatedly criticized human rights issues tied to major tournaments, while Ireland's football association pushed to exclude Israel from international competition before the Gaza peace agreement last year.

Göttlich also dismissed concerns that a boycott would unfairly punish players, including St. Pauli's international stars.

“The life of a professional player is not worth more than the lives of countless people in various regions who are being directly or indirectly attacked or threatened by the World Cup host,” he said.

The 2026 World Cup is just months away as the United States — alongside Canada and Mexico — is preparing to host soccer's foremost competition. However, German soccer federation executive Oke Göttlich is calling for talks about a boycott amidst U.S. President Donald Trump's recent actions.

Trump as stirred some outrage in Europe recently with his insistence on acquiring Greenland, a territory currently owned by Denmark. Trump has further strained relations with Europe as well by threatening to impose tariffs on eight European nations in his effort to pursue Greenland.

""I really wonder when the time will be to think and talk about this [a boycott] concretely,"" Göttlich told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper. ""For me, that time has definitely come.""

The United States is scheduled to host 78 of the World Cup's 104 total matches. Here's how Göttlich's comments could impact the upcoming tournament:

Not currently.

French sport minister Marina Ferrari said earlier this week that they were not considering a boycott, but did not rule the possibility out entirely if the situation with Greenland escalates. ""At the moment we are speaking, there is no desire from the ministry to boycott this major, much-anticipated competition,"" Ferrari commented on Tuesday. ""That said, I am not prejudging what might happen.""

There has been a boycott of the World Cup before. In 1980, the United States boycotted the Olympics in the Soviet Union after the country invaded Afghanistan.

Göttlich claimed, ""By my reckoning the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.""

The Germans were also displeased about 2022 World Cup host Qatar.

""Qatar was too political for everyone and now we're completely apolitical? That's something that really, really, really bothers me."" He continued, ""As organizations and society, we're forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries, and how to defend values.""

The 2026 World Cup is set to begin on June 11 with two Group A matches. Mexico will take on South Africa at 3 p.m. ET, and South Korea's opponent has yet to be determined for their 10 p.m. match.

The United States' first game will be on June 12, a match against Paraguay that is set to start at 9 p.m. ET.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup set to kick off in just under five months, the Department of State has officially launched the FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System (FIFA PASS) – a new program designed to expedite visa interviews for international ticket holders while maintaining national security standards.

Announced in November 2025 during a high-profile White House event featuring President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and FIFA President Gianni Infantino, FIFA PASS is meant to represent a proactive step to handle the massive influx of visitors expected for the games – as well as somewhat of a partnership between America's leaders and the tournament's organizers.

The visa system allows those who have purchased tickets directly from FIFA to opt in and schedule their own prioritized visa appointments ahead of the tournament's June 11 start date, helping to avoid last-minute bottlenecks at U.S. embassies and consulates.

“This will be a once in a lifetime opportunity to showcase the beauty and the greatness of America. And we can't wait to welcome soccer fans from all over the globe,” Trump wrote in a press release announcing the guidelines for the visa program.

According to those guidelines, applicants must demonstrate that they qualify for a nonimmigrant visa, intend to comply with all U.S. laws, and plan to leave the U.S. after the tournament ends on July 19.

Scheduling an interview does not guarantee visa approval; every applicant will undergo thorough security vetting and background checks before being allowed into the United States.

The visa strategy comes after FIFA reported record-breaking ticket sales, as previously reported by The Dallas Express, and now anticipates that 5 to 10 million international visitors will flock to host cities across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

To improve the processing capacity for all these football fans, the State Department is deploying hundreds of additional staff members to handle these applications.

A state department press release reads, “The United States Department of State is surging over 450 extra staffers to consulates around the world to make sure that we can continue to decrease these appointment times. And we've already created an additional 300,000 additional visas, and that number is projected to be in the millions by early next year, and hopefully by tournament time even more.”

While a recent pause on immigrant visa issuances was announced on January 14, State Department officials have clarified that it does not affect nonimmigrant categories such as those for tourists and World Cup attendees. For fans from visa-waiver countries, the Electronic System for Travel Authorization remains an option, hopefully further simplifying the entry process for “low-risk” travelers.","{'href': 'https://www.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

The president of Bundesliga club FC St. Pauli, Oke Gottlich, has called for a serious discussion about boycotting the 2026 FIFA World Cup due to recent actions by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Gottlich, who also serves as a vice-president of the German Football Federation, said the current political climate warrants a deeper look at whether the global football spectacle should proceed as planned in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

In an interview with German media, Gottlich made clear that the idea of a boycott should not be dismissed lightly.

“The time has come [to] seriously consider and discuss this,” Gottlich said. “What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s? By my reckoning, the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.”

Gottlich's comments reflect broader unease among some football fans and officials about the political environment surrounding the hosts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Reports indicate that political tensions in the United States have already contributed to protests and even ticket cancellations linked to politics and safety concerns, with thousands of fans withdrawing from ticket plans in recent months amid a hashtag-driven boycott movement.

Gottlich also voiced deeper concerns about how sport intersects with societal values, and he challenged both football administrators and political leaders to clarify where “taboos and boundaries” should lie.

“As organizations and society, we're forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries and how to defend values. Taboos are an essential part of our stance,” he continued.

“Is a taboo crossed when someone threatens? Is a taboo crossed when someone attacks? When people die? I would like to know from Donald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from Bernd Neuendorf and Gianni Infantino,” Gottlich concluded.

The broader context includes political actions by Trump that critics argue could affect perceptions of the World Cup host nation and fan participation.

Political rhetoric about safety and internal U.S. policy has at times spilled into discussions about match locations and travel, prompting debates over how politicised events should be when international sport is meant to unify fans from across the world.

Despite Gottlich's call for debate, resistance to a boycott is expected among many football leaders, and the prospect of full withdrawal from the tournament remains uncertain as the global game prepares for its biggest event in 2026.

A German Football Association (DFB) official has said it is time to consider a boycott of the 2026 World Cup in the wake of United States President Donald Trump's actions.

The US will host world football's showpiece event this summer, along with Canada and Mexico.

President Trump caused outrage among European leaders earlier this month by threatening to acquire Greenland, which is controlled by Denmark. 

The 79-year-old threatened to impose tariffs on eight European countries - including Germany - who opposed his plan. 

Trump has since rowed back on that threat, but tensions between European leaders and the US government remain high. 

""I really wonder when the time will be to think and talk about this [a boycott] concretely,"" Oke Gottlich, a DFB vice-president, told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper.

""For me, that time has definitely come.""

Of the 104 matches at this summer's World Cup, 78 will be held in the US. 

The French government said it is not currently in favour of a boycott, while the Danish Football Association said it is ""aware of the current sensitive situation"". 

Denmark will aim to qualify for the tournament via play-offs.

In making his argument, Gottlich referenced a US-led boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games following the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. 

""What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s?"" said Gottlich, who is also the president of Bundesliga club St Pauli.

""By my reckoning the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.""

Germany were involved in a row with Fifa at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar when world football's governing body threatened players with a booking for wearing the OneLove armband during games.

The captains of seven European nations were set to wear the armband to promote diversity and inclusion.

Instead, Fifa brought forward its own 'No Discrimination' campaign, which had been due to start from the quarter-finals, and captains were permitted to wear a No Discrimination armband for the duration of the tournament.

Germany players covered their mouths during the team photograph before their World Cup opener against Japan ""to convey the message that Fifa is silencing"" teams, said the country's then-manager Hansi Flick. 

""Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position,"" said DFB at the time.

Gottlich added: ""Qatar was too political for everyone and now we're completely apolitical? That's something that really, really, really bothers me.

""As organisations and society, we're forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries, and how to defend values. 

""Taboos are an essential part of our stance. Is a taboo crossed when someone threatens? Is a taboo crossed when someone attacks? When people die?

""I would like to know from Donald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from [DFB president] Bernd Neuendorf and [Fifa president] Gianni Infantino.""

Partnership with tech giant speaks to push to engage younger fans but also has wider strategic goals in mind

In this World Cup year, Fifa has come out of the blocks quickly. In the past few weeks any number of initiatives have been announced or activated, from a data partnership with Opta to facilitate more betting, to the Fifa Pass for speeding up visa applications for the US this summer, to the unveiling of the official Lego World Cup trophy. Among the ever-expanding list is an intriguing deal with TikTok, a partnership that will give digital creators front-row seats at the 104-match tournament.

In Fifa language its partnership with the short-form video platform will make “the most inclusive event in football history … even more accessible”. According to TikTok's global head of content, James Stafford, it will bring fans “closer to the action in ways they can't get anywhere else”. It plans to do so by granting an unspecified number of online personalities behind-the-scenes access, giving them archive and highlights footage to use in their content and, in return, requesting an avalanche of posts that will make the World Cup inescapable for TikTok users.

In choosing TikTok as its preferred platform Fifa is catching up with the times. The use of creators, also known as influencers, is increasingly essential for any consumer business. The NFL has integrated creators (quick definition: online personalities who make their living from posting on social media) into coverage of the Super Bowl since the turn of the decade. But the full possibilities of the creator economy are only beginning to be explored by sports organisations.

Last summer the streaming company Dazn built its own creator network for Fifa's Club World Cup. It enlisted as many as 50 creators to post videos that built excitement around the event, be they behind-the-scenes tours, interviews with players and coaches or stunts such as racing to see who could make it to the Chelsea v Palmeiras game on time.

“It was a new tournament and we wanted to hit every lever we possibly could to generate awareness in as many places as possible, particularly with a younger audience,” says Joe Caporoso, the president of Team Whistle, a Dazn-owned company that specialises in digital strategy. “We searched through people who had strong organic followings on places like Instagram and TikTok, and who had a history of a high volume of posting consistency around not just the sport of soccer, but also the culture of it. We wanted to make sure we had people and creators who spoke authentically and were not shy about showing everything that goes on around the game.”

From there, Caporoso's team laid out a campaign that defined the amount of content creators were expected to generate. A group of editors and content programmers made sure each post was optimised for maximum exposure and liaised with creators to make sure no potential talking point or key moment was missed. Dazn and Whistle tracked the performance of each post, monitored the traffic that went back to Dazn's coverage, and discussed the outcomes with TikTok.

This is a degree of oversight materially higher than that of, say, the BBC over Gary Lineker at the last European Championship. It gives a clue to one reason why creators are coming to the fore in sports coverage. Not only are they generally younger, part of a demographic sports leaders are anxious to attract, not only are they trusted by their audience due to a perceived authenticity, but creators are comfortable working in a media environment where the demands of the client come first. Their productivity can be off the charts. They perform, they shoot, they edit, they strike promotional deals, they post regularly and often. They are, in Caporoso's words, “one-person companies”.

TikTok says the Club World Cup creator platform drove more than 500,000 fans to Dazn's service and that 90% of fans take “at least one off-platform action” after viewing sports content on their app. Fifa says its creator platform is designed for similar purposes, such as directing new viewers to its match coverage, but it could perform other functions too. It could be a new revenue stream, for example, with Fifa taking a cut from the advertising revenue generated on TikTok through the deal. It could be a way of expanding the reach of sponsorship deals Fifa has elsewhere. It establishes a relationship with a tech giant who may yet be tempted into paying for broadcast rights more broadly. Finally, the new platform could also provide a means for shaping the way the World Cup is talked about.

Instead of allowing the post-match debate or attention between matchdays to be channeled by media companies, a creator platform deal keeps sports organisers in the conversation. “It's a way for them to become a partner and to have their say, a bit of their say, in how their material is presented on second screens,” says François Godard of the media research company Enders Analysis. Creators offer the possibility of drumming up enthusiasm should interest begin to wane, but also keeping discussion away from topics that might be problematic. When Dazn secured an interview with Donald Trump before the Club World Cup final, it asked Emily Austin, from its roster of creators, to conduct it. A Maga enthusiast and marketer of Trump Derangement Syndrome merchandise, she flattered the US president and Fifa while celebrating the success of the tournament.

Creators present an efficient and effective way of reaching audiences with a defined message. Godard, however, is sceptical of how useful they might be in driving audience growth for sport. “In our data, we see that the viewership of traditional TV by the 16-to-34 age group has collapsed over the past 10 years, but not in sports,” he says. “That's because sports is unique. It's live, and there's no alternative.”

Reports in the US have suggested the picture is complicated somewhat by traditional broadcasters having acquired the rights Fifa wants to share with influencers. According to the publication Puck, TikTok would need a sublicensing deal with the broadcaster Fox, an arrangement yet to be struck. In the UK the BBC and ITV jointly hold rights to linear and digital broadcasts. The BBC said it would not comment on rights negotiations.

Godard believes that instead the platform is a play to develop new places where Fifa may ultimately sell its rights, even as it extends the offering on its Fifa+ broadcast platform (thanks to a new deal with Dazn). Whatever the outcome, it may be just that creators have the power to disrupt the media environment that has made Fifa decide to embrace them.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Team USA soccer player DeJuan Jones and MLS player Dominique Badji spoke to Fox News Digital about the upcoming World Cup, their hope to spread world peace through their sport and the debate over renaming soccer to football in America.

A German soccer federation executive committee member has advocated for the consideration of the nation boycotting the upcoming FIFA World Cup in response to recent actions by President Donald Trump.

Oke Göttlich, president of Bundesliga club St. Pauli and one of the German federation's 10 vice presidents, told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper in an interview Friday ""the time has come"" to ""seriously consider and discuss this."" 

Göttlich compared the situation to the 1980 Moscow Olympics, which was boycotted by several nations led by the U.S. in response to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.

""What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s? By my reckoning, the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion,"" Göttlich said.

Göttlich went on to reference the political conversations about the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and called out FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who is considered a close ally of Trump.

""Qatar was too political for everyone, and now we're completely apolitical? That's something that really, really, really bothers me,"" Göttlich added. 

""As organizations and society, we're forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries and how to defend values. Taboos are an essential part of our stance. Is a taboo crossed when someone threatens? Is a taboo crossed when someone attacks? When people die? I would like to know from Donald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from Bernd Neuendorf and Gianni Infantino.""

Göttlich also dismissed the suggestion a boycott would hurt St. Pauli's national team players, Australia's Jackson Irvine and Connor Metcalfe, and Japan's Joel Chima Fujita.

""The life of a professional player is not worth more than the lives of countless people in various regions who are being directly or indirectly attacked or threatened by the World Cup host,"" he said.

France's sports minister addressed questions about whether the country would consider boycotting the 2026 FIFA World Cup in response to the recent ""framework"" deal the U.S. reached for control of part of Greenland. 

French Minister of Sports, Youth and Community Life Marina Ferrari told reporters this week the country has ""no desire"" to skip the World Cup, which takes place in North America this year.

""As it stands now, there is no desire from the ministry for a boycott of this great competition,"" Ferrari said. ""Now, I will not anticipate what could happen, but I have also heard voices raised from certain political blocs. I am one who believes in keeping sport separate [from politics]. The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport.""

Far-left French politician Éric Coquerel has called for the U.S. to be stripped of World Cup hosting rights and has suggested a boycott by France.

""Seriously, one imagines going to play the World Cup in a country who attacks its ‘neighbours,' threatens to invade Greenland and rides roughshod over international law?"" Coquerel told reporters.

Trump announced on Truth Social Wednesday that the framework for a deal has been reached for the U.S. to gain control of parts of Greenland.

""Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,"" he wrote.

""This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations,"" Trump wrote in the post. ""Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st. Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland.""

Despite similar calls for sanctions in response to Trump's foreign policy, the U.S. has not been penalized by any major sports bodies for its recent intervention in Venezuela either. 

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has responded to calls to exclude the U.S. and its athletes from the upcoming Winter Olympics over the intervention in Venezuela. The committee ruled out any penalty on the U.S.

""As a global organization, the IOC has to manage a complex reality. The IOC has to deal with the current political context and the latest developments in the world,"" the IOC said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. 

""The ability to bring athletes together, no matter where they come from, is fundamental to the future of values-based, truly global sport, which can give hope to the world. For this reason, the IOC cannot involve itself directly in political matters or conflicts between countries, as these fall outside our remit. This is the realm of politics.""

The men's national teams of both France and Colombia are set to arrive in the D.C. area this spring to play in a 'friendly' exhibition match.

Two of the world's top international soccer teams are coming to the Washington, D.C. area this spring to play an exhibition match ahead of the official start of the 2026 FIFA World Cup tournament this summer!

Those teams, France and Colombia, will be playing at Northwest Stadium in March, giving Washingtonians a chance to view a world-class international soccer match in-person, since the DMV area was not selected to host any matches during the World Cup tournament.

Leading up to the match, France's international squad is ranked the #3 team by FIFA's rankings, and Colombia is ranked #13.

The matchup is considered part of the “Road to 26” series being conducted by FIFA, which features other similar ‘friendly' games being held in Florida and Massachusetts.

The exhibition match between France and Colombia is set to take place at Northwest Stadium on Sunday, March 29th, at 3:00 pm.

The excellent timing makes it a perfect weekend plan, giving anyone interested in attending the opportunity to do.

While a lot of the seats for this match have already sold out, there are still some fantastic seats available throughout the stadium, with prices ranging from around $110, perfect for casual fans, up to around $800 for premium spots, ideal spots if you're a passionate fan of either France or Colombia.

You can even score a seat near the teams' benches if you're interested for as little as $255!

No, this match will have no impact on either team's standings in the 2026 FIFA World Cup; however, the match is considered a ‘tune-up' given its close date to the start of the tournament, which means that the confidence of a win here could mean a lot heading into this summer!

Additionally, the last time these two teams played was in a similar exhibition match in 2018; in that match, the Colombian team was able to score three unanswered goals in a major comeback win, claiming a 3-2 victory over France.

Jason McAteer has revealed how his long-running feud with former Republic of Ireland team-mate Roy Keane was put to bed in a cafe last year. The pair shared a number of battles in the Premier League during the late 1990s and 2000s, with Keane's Manchester United often getting the better of McAteer, who played for Liverpool before a later stint with Sunderland. Now, the latter has revealed how their disagreement came to a surprising end thanks to the help of Jamie Carragher.

The duo's feud began at the 2002 World Cup, when Keane infamously left the Republic of Ireland squad before the start of the tournament after falling out with manager Mick McCarthy.

The former United midfielder was disappointed with his country's training facilities and nutrition plans and left, with McAteer backing the head coach at the time. Keane later claimed in his autobiography that McAteer was ""too fond of himself for my liking, more interested in hair gel and nightclubs than winning football matches"".

The pair soon met in a 1-1 Premier League draw between United and Sunderland in August 2002, battling throughout the game before Keane was sent off after an altercation with McAteer, who claimed he knew which ""buttons to press"" to make the current Sky Sports pundit lose his head.

Keane and McAteer have been enemies in the 20 years since that falling out, often taking pot-shots at each other in the media.

Speaking in a new quiz programme named 'Call Yourself A Fan', McAteer recalled how they came to blows.

He said: ""We didn't speak for 20 years and went backwards and forwards in the media, he'd hammer me so I'd hammer him, he'd give me some stick so I'd give him some stick.

""We had a fight during Sunderland versus Man Utd and he ended up getting sent off. His book had just come out, he had hammered me in his book and started giving me some on the pitch, so I just told him to just shut up and said, 'put it in your book, kn*bhead'.

""With a minute to go he's just gone in with an elbow and got a red card, and we didn't speak for the next 20 years.""

However, it seems the pair have made up to some degree, with former Liverpool defender Carragher apparently playing a key role, though it seems there may still be a bit of ill-feeling left in the relationship.

McAteer added: ""About six months ago I was in a cafe where I live with my missus, and he [Keane] was in there with his family. I went round the corner, and he left after about 20 minutes. I went to get the bill and the waiter came over and went, 'He's paid your bill'.

""I got dead emotional as I thought, had I wasted 20 years? Because he's actually alright, you know.

""So I rang Jamie Carragher and said, 'Soft a*se has paid my bill in a restaurant, can I have his number?', and he said he'd better ask him first. ""Two hours later, Carra rang me back and said, 'Roy said he accepts the thank you, but you can f*ck off, you're not having his phone number!'.""

While the hatchet may have been somewhat buried, whether the pair will be spotted sharing punditry duties or a cup of tea together in the future remains to be seen.

Keane is still as confrontational as ever, recently taking a shot at Michael Carrick's wife for having a ""big mouth"" after the former England international took over as United's interim manager following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.

McAteer, meanwhile, remains present in the media as punditry figure, appearing on platforms like talkSPORT, LFCTV and beIN Sports. He retired from professional football in 2007, having also played for Bolton Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers and Tranmere Rovers alongside his spells with Liverpool and Sunderland. The 54-year-old made 52 appearances for Ireland, scoring three goals.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cole Palmer is believed to be 'untouchable' amid reports that the attacker is homesick and is hoping to leave Chelsea. A boyhood Manchester United fan, Palmer has been linked with a move to Old Trafford and a return to Manchester having left City for the Blues in 2023. Since making the move to Stamford Bridge, he has gone on to become a key player for the west London side.

During his time in the capital, Palmer has scored 41 league goals and laid on an additional 19 assists to establish himself as one of Chelsea's key figures. Recent reports, though, suggest that he is homesick, which has caught the attention of boyhood club Manchester United. However, according to The Telegraph, the 23-year-old is 'untouchable', and the club won't entertain any transfer offers amid confidence that he will see out the decade with the Blues at the very least.

This discontent has not been communicated by the attacker, either, while Blues boss Liam Rosenior insists that Palmer is 'very happy' at the club. Asked about the player during Friday's pre-Crystal Palace press conference, the Chelsea head coach said: ""I've had numerous conversations with Cole and he seems very, very happy to be here. He is very, very happy to be here.

""He's a huge part of our plans in the long term. He's an outstanding player. Every player goes through difficult moments in their careers in terms of injury. I don't think it's any reflection on his qualities. He's an outstanding footballer.""

Palmer has endured a difficult third season at Chelsea owing to a problematic groin issue that saw the attacker miss the 1-0 Champions League win over Pafos in midweek. The England star has managed just 12 league appearances, and 10 starts, this season, with Rosenior adding: ""My job and the club's job is to get him in a place where he can consistently perform at the level that he wants to. And there was frustration in the Brentford game, not because he wasn't happy here, just because he couldn't perform. He was in pain. He couldn't perform to the level he wanted to do for the club.

""He's a great kid and he's an outstanding player, but we have to make sure that we look after him in the right way. That's why I didn't involve him in the last game.""

Chelsea are looking to add bodies to the squad in the final knockings of the transfer window, and have been linked with a move for Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet. The Premier League side have reportedly agreed personal terms with the 20-year-old, but are still negotiating a fee with the French side for the defender.

In addition, Chelsea are in the market for a central midfielder following Dario Essugo's latest setback. Essugo move to Chelsea over the summer, but has been restricted to just three Club World Cup appearances. And with Romeo Lavia struggling to keep fit, the Belgian last featuring for the club in November, the Blues are reportedly interested in Douglas Luiz, the Brazilian currently on loan at Nottingham Forest from Juventus.

Yet despite Essugo and Lavia's fitness concerns, Rosenior is adamant he is happy with his current central midfield options. He said: ""In terms of my midfield options you've got Enzo [Fernandez], Moi [Caicedo], Andrey Santos, Reece James. It's not bad.

""I've been really clear on this. I don't want to bring in players that don't enhance the group or the chemistry that we're building. So we have to be very selective at this stage of the season. If we do bring in the right player in a certain position, they have to have a clear impact on the team.""

Chelsea made it three wins from four under Rosenior with a late 1-0 victory over Pafos in midweek, a result that leaves the west London side in the top eight of the Champions League league phase ahead of the final round of European fixtures next week.

And next up for the Blues is a short trip across the capital as they take on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. The Eagles, who sold Marc Guehi to Manchester City in the week, are on a poor run of form having failed to win in 10 - a streak that includes an embarrassing FA Cup third-round defeat to National League North side Macclesfield.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester United have conceded that midfield target Elliot Anderson favours a summer switch to rivals Manchester City. The Nottingham Forest star has caught the attention of the Premier League pair having shone for the Tricky Trees this season. Forest are adamant that Anderson won't leave the City Ground in January and are expected to demand £100 million ($136m) to cash in on their prized asset later this year.

Anderson has thrived for Forest this season, and his performances have attracted interest from the Manchester giants. While Chelsea have also been credited with an interest in the 23-year-old, the midfielder is expected to be at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war between United and City this summer.

Both sides are looking to revamp their respective midfields in the off-season, with United drawing up a three-man shortlist in their quest to strengthen in a key area this summer. Carlos Baleba, who was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford last year, features, so too do England pair Adam Wharton and Anderson.

City, too, are expected to dip into the market to bolster in the middle of the park amid concerns over Rodri's long-term fitness. The Ballon d'Or winner suffered a serious ACL injury in City's 2-2 draw with Arsenal in September 2024 and a series of issues has seen the Spain international restricted to just six league starts for the Cityzens this season.

And while both sides are keen on Anderson, a report in the i Paper states that United believe they know which team the former Newcastle man will move to at the end of the season.

""There is a growing belief Anderson would snub United for a move to rivals Manchester City,"" the report states. The news will come as a blow to United, who are expected to undergone a huge midfield revamp in the off-season.

Casemiro and United on Thursday confirmed that the Brazilian will leave the club once his current contract expires at the end of the season. ""Casemiro will leave Manchester United this summer, upon the expiry of his contract,"" a statement on United's official website read in the week. ""The legendary midfielder has enjoyed four seasons at the club, playing 146 games and scoring 21 goals to date.""

Casemiro, meanwhile, added: ""I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life."" There are also concerns over Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte's futures at Old Trafford, with the former subject to interest from Al-Hilal last summer.

The Saudi Pro League side made a lucrative offer for the United captain, who rebuffed interest from the Middle East to stay at Old Trafford. However, United are keen to hold talks with Fernandes ahead of the World Cup to determine whether the midfielder wishes to remain in Manchester.

Ugarte has also been linked with a January exit, with Dutch giants Ajax reportedly keen on signing the Uruguayan on loan for the rest of the season.

While Casemiro will leave in the summer, and question marks remain over the future of Fernandes and Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo is expected to sign a new deal with United. The England international's current contract expires in 2027, though United have the option to extend that by a further year.

The 20-year-old was heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford this month after he fell out of favour under former boss Ruben Amorim. However, Amorim's exit at the start of January has provided Mainoo with a route back into the first team.

Mainoo started his first league game of the season last weekend as United beat rivals City 2-0 at Old Trafford. Second-half strikes from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu saw United claim all the spoils in the Manchester derby, though Michael Carrick's side should have won by more. Indeed, United saw three goals ruled out for offside and struck the woodwork twice in a commanding display on home turf.

While United will have been buoyed by their win over City last week, the Cityzens are enduring a tough start to 2026. Pep Guardiola has overseen just two wins this calendar year, one of which was 10-1 victory over lower-league side Exeter in the FA Cup.

And City fell to a shock 3-1 loss to Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League on Tuesday night. Guardiola will hope to oversee a return to winning ways in Saturday's visit of the Premier League's bottom club Wolves.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Pep Guardiola has dropped Erling Haaland from the starting line-up for Manchester City's Premier League game against Wolves amid a run of eight games without scoring from open play. Haaland had started all 22 of City's previous league games, scoring 20 goals. But he last hit the net against Brighton from the penalty spot in early January and has not scored in open play since December.

Haaland has not been left out of a City line-up since starting on the bench against Bayer Leverkusen on November 25 while he has not sat out an entire game since City's Carabao Cup tie at Swansea on October 29. And Guardiola admitted last week following the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Newcastle that Haaland was ""exhausted"". The Norwegian hitman badly under-performed during City's resounding 2-0 defeat at Manchester United and missed several chances in the shock 3-1 defeat at Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League on Tuesday. And Guardiola has finally taken action by leaving his top scorer out against Wolves, who are bottom of the Premier League table.

Guardiola explained to Sky Sports why he had left Haaland out:  ""There are a lot of games. I want to, a little bit, clean his mind, his body. And yeah, the selection is always because I believe that for today it is the best.""

Haaland spoke openly about his poor form and City's recent downturn in results following the defeat in Norway. He said: ""I don't have the answers. I take full responsibility of not being able to score the goals I should do. I just apologize to everyone; every single Man City supporter and every single supporter that traveled today, because in the end it's embarrassing.

""Bodo they played some incredible football and in the end it's deserved. Honestly, I don't know what to say because I don't have the answers, and what I can say is sorry.""

City's latest signing Marc Guehi made his debut for the club against Wolves following his arrival from Crystal Palace for £20m. He will partner Abdukodir Khusanov and will be expected to be bring some much-needed leadership and experience to a City defence that has been ravaged by injuries to John Stones, Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias.

Guehi explained how it felt to join Guardiola's side. He said: ""This move feels like the culmination of all the hard work I have put into my career. I am now at the best club in England and part of an unbelievable squad of players. It feels good to be able to say that. I want to grow as a player and a person, and I know at this club that's going to happen.  

""I love football – it has given me so much for so long – and to be able to continue my development at Manchester City is a really special moment for me and my family. I absolutely cannot wait to get started now. I want to meet my teammates, train hard, understand what the manager expects of me and then show the City fans what I can do.""

Michael Carrick's first game back in charge of Manchester United was a euphoric occasion, with his side's dominant win over Manchester City bringing a smile to every person present at Old Trafford. Well, almost every person. Benjamin Sesko did not get on the pitch during the 2-0 win, raising questions about his place in Carrick's thoughts and his team for the rest of the season.

Sesko has had a difficult spell since joining as the club's biggest signing of the summer following his $100m move from RB Leipzig, struggling to adapt to the pace of the Premier League and then being forced out injured for a month. He was just starting to find form under caretaker coach Darren Fletcher, scoring three times in the games against Burnley and Brighton. 

But instead of being asked to take the next step in the derby, he was dropped from the starting lineup as Carrick preferred Bryan Mbeumo to play as a centre-forward rather than out wide as he did under Ruben Amorim and for most of his time at Brentford. And when Mbeumo came off, Carrick turned to Matheus Cunha rather than the Slovenian. 

It did not say much for the new coach's confidence in Sesko. However, Carrick's careful treatment of the striker suggests a big change from the way Amorim handled him and could be the key to getting the most out of him...

While it would have been natural for Carrick to salute his top-performing players after the derby such as Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes, instead he sought out Sesko at full-time, putting his around the player. He seemed to be telling the striker not to worry, that he would soon get to form part of this project and be involved in other resounding wins at Old Trafford soon enough.

And when it was put to Carrick that Sesko was not able to build on the momentum he had gained in the previous two games, the coach was quick to set the record straight. ""I don't think it's losing momentum,"" he said. ""It was a team for last week to go into the game in a certain way. I think he's in a good place Ben, he's trained really well. Obviously, we're working with him and trying to improve him as much as possible. 

""I've been really impressed with the way he's trained, his finishing and the way he's gone about it. I don't see it as anything else other than pushing on and using what he's just done over the last month or so as a stepping stone and being here for a long time.""

Although we will have to wait until the line-ups drop for Sunday's visit to Arsenal to find out if he was telling the truth, Carrick was keen to point out that he picked the team he did against City to suit the opponent, lifting Sesko's hopes of starting at the Emirates Stadium or getting a decent chunk of minutes off the bench. 

""It's just variety in terms of the strengths [of each player]. I think, Bryan, I gave him a bit of a free role in many ways in a partnership with Bruno last week, to drift and to fill different spaces. Ben's very good at playing on the last line and running behind and I think we've seen that in recent weeks, he's done great to get his goal so he's in a good place. 

""Matheus came on through the middle and made a big difference for us in terms of carrying the game into the later stages and creating the second goal, so we've got good options through there and we just felt, last week, that was the way to go and, thankfully, it paid off for us.""

In his first press conference since returning as United coach last week, Carrick said that improving individual players was among his main objectives and something he would use to measure whether or not his time in charge would be a success. He explained: ""I think a big part of what I really enjoy is improving individuals and, in the end, I think if you improve the individuals, we create a better team.""

And if there is a player he needs to help improve more than anyone else, it is Sesko. The Slovenian has had a lot of hype around him since he was a teenager. Indeed, United were interested in signing him when he was 16 before he opted to join RB Salzburg instead. His Salzburg connections led to inevitable comparisons with Erling Haaland, who also moved from the Austrian top flight to the Bundesliga. 

But Sesko's career has not witnessed the lightning-quick progression of the Norwegian superstar, with him doing well at RB Leipzig but not exactly setting the league on fire, posting 14 goals in his first season and 13 in his second. Haaland, by contrast, scored 13 times in half a season with Borussia Dortmund, banging in 27 in his first full campaign and then 22 in his last, which was interrupted by injuries.

Sesko's lack of Premier League experience and underwhelming goal numbers led to some concern that he was not much of an upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund and those fears were realised in his first few weeks, as the striker was met with the twin realities of how tough the Premier League is for new strikers and with how big the spotlight is at United.

Amorim seemed wary of that and was reluctant to play him too early. He didn't start him against Arsenal or Fulham and although he got 90 minutes against Grimsby, eyebrows were raised when it emerged he was the team's 10th penalty taker in the shootout, behind every player except Andre Onana. Sesko was again a substitute for the next game against Burnley, with Amorim revealing he had suffered from cramp after the Grimsby game and suggesting it would have been a risk to start him.

Sesko scored for the first time against Brentford and followed it up with a goal against Sunderland the following week. But in his next match against Liverpool he was back on the bench. He returned to the starting line-up against Brighton and Nottingham Forest, struggling in particular in the latter game and receiving fierce criticism from Gary Neville.

""He's miles off it compared to the other forwards United brought in, like Cunha and Mbeumo,"" Neville said. ""He looks awkward; his touch was off a few times when balls went over the top. For €80m (£73.7m), yes, he's young and still settling, but you want to see something more.""

Amorim sought to defend Sesko when speaking about him a few days later but instead, in his typical, brutally honest way, he sounded like he too was criticising the player. He said: ""When I started training with Ben, he had more potential than I was thinking. He's going to struggle, and we need to understand how he likes to play, and also to put in our ideas.

""He has no experience here, and then the first impact when everyone says that you are so good, you are the next big thing – and you hear about that with Sesko – and then you come to one club that is the hardest club.

""If you don't perform every week, you are going to hear a lot of things from club legends, from pundits, from the media - and sometimes they are right. Of course, nobody likes to hear, but he struggled a little bit, and that is a fact. So, let's embrace that. Ben is a young kid, a control freak. He wants to control everything - and he's not going to control everything.""

Amorim's tough love approach with Sesko did not really yield results, although he had the misfortune to injure his knee in his very next game against Tottenham. 

He started four games in a row when he returned but failed to score and Amorim's tactics, asking him to hold the ball up and flick it on for his fellow forwards, did not seem to help. 

He missed a slew of good chances in Amorim's final game at Leeds and by the end looked on a completely different page to his team-mates. Fletcher made a point of talking to the striker in detail about his movement before the next game against Burnley and it paid dividends, with Sesko scoring twice and having eight shots. Carrick needs to follow a similar strategy, focusing on how to get the best out of the striker and play to his strengths rather than trying to crowbar him into a certain system.

Despite not playing Sesko in his first match, Carrick has made it clear that the striker will be a big part of his plans moving forward. Only time will tell whether it pays off, but he has already shown a more personal touch than his predecessor.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Arsenal were imperious at Chelsea in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off as second-half goals from Beth Mead and Mariona Caldentey saw the Gunners claim a 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge. They moved to within one point of their capital rivals in the Women's Super League table as Renee Slegers' side returned to north London with a huge three points in tow.

Arsenal started brightly at Stamford Bridge as both Katie McCabe and Alessia Russo saw efforts saved and blocked, as the Gunners sought to race into an early lead. However, Chelsea rode out the storm, and came close to going ahead as Sam Kerr and Wieke Kaptein flashed headers wide of the visitors' goal.

Stina Blackstenius failed to hit the target from close range, and should really have done better with her header on the stroke of half-time as the two sides went in level at the break. The Gunners started the second period strongly and were duly rewarded for their dominance with the opening goal 10 minutes after the restart, as Mead slotted past England team-mate Hannah Hampton having been played in well by Russo.

Chelsea came close to an immediate response through Alyssa Thompson, who pulled her low effort wide of the far post. Arsenal, though, were two goals to the good on the hour mark as Mead turned provider to pick out Caldentey in space in the Chelsea box. The Spaniard showed great composure to work the ball onto her right and tuck past Hampton with a fine finish.

Arsenal huffed and puffed to bag a third as both Blackstenius and Russo saw efforts blocked. Chelsea did end the game strongly but were unable to make their late dominance count as they fell to a rare home defeat.

GOAL rates Arsenal's players from Stamford Bridge...

Anneke Borbe (7/10):

Comfortably dealt with a long-range Lucy Bronze shot shortly before the break. A late cross claim summed up a commendable showing between the sticks.

Emily Fox (7/10):

Lofted a teasing cross into the box early in the second half that her team-mates failed to get on the end of. Forced Hampton into action with 15 minutes to play.

Lotte Wubben-Moy (6/10):

Pulled out of position and beaten too easily by Sandy Baltimore, whose cross to the back post was a little too high.

Steph Catley (6/10):

Made a couple of vital blocks in a solid if unspectacular showing.

Katie McCabe (7/10):

Chanced her luck early on but was denied by Hannah Hampton. Pushed forward well down the left before late withdrawal.

Kim Little (7/10):

Another commanding performance in the middle of the park.

Mariona Caldentey (8/10):

Showed great composure to double Arsenal's advantage on the hour mark with a well taken hit.

Beth Mead (9/10):

Made a crucial clearance following a Chelsea corner but was clattered by Millie Bright in the process midway through the first half, which seemed to kick the winger into gear. Played a perfect cross for Blackstenius shortly before half-time, though the Arsenal striker headed wide from six yards out. Broke the deadlock with a well-taken finish, then turned provider for Caldentey's first and Arsenal's second. Withdrawn with 20 minutes to go.

Alessia Russo (7/10):

Followed up an early McCabe effort but her shot was blocked off the line. Played the assist for Mead's opener.

Caitlin Foord (5/10):

Put in an anonymous performance from the left flank. Failed to track the run of Cuthbert, who, fortunately for Arsenal, failed to hit the target with a free header.

Stina Blackstenius (7/10):

Should have at least hit the target having headed a Mead cross wide from close range on the stroke of half-time. Saw an effort palmed away by Hampton with 10 minutes to play.

Victoria Pelova (6/10):

Replaced Mead for the final 20 minutes.

Smilla Holmberg (6/10):

Did enough to help see out the win.

Laia Codina (N/A):

Came on for Fox for the final knockings.

Taylor Hinds (N/A):

Subbed on for McCabe with two minutes to play.

Renee Slegers (8/10):

Arsenal rode their luck on occasion, but Slegers ultimately got her team selection and tactics spot on at Chelsea.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Jannik Sinner faced a massive test of his title defence Saturday at the Australian Open, but found a way to survive cramp, heat and Eliot Spizzirri 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 inside Rod Laver Arena for a place in the fourth round.

""Very happy for today. Obviously next match, let's see what's coming,"" said Sinner, who will next face fellow Italian Luciano Darderi. ""[We have] practised only once, so it's not a lot. But very happy to have at least one Italian for sure in the quarters again in a Grand Slam. It's great.""

Sinner Survives 😮‍💨

The two-time defending champion defeats Spizzirri 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to return to the round of 16.@janniksin | @australianopen | #AO26 pic.twitter.com/bICuIfPwJ6

With the match tied at one set all, Spizzirri broke for a 3-1 lead in the third set while Sinner clearly struggled with cramp, barely able to push up to serve or move. But the Australian Open Heat Stress Scale hit a 5, leading to a suspension of play for officials to close the roof.

After less than a 10-minute break, play resumed, but that short suspension proved critical. When play resumed, Sinner bounced back from the ropes and was able to claw to a three-hour, 45-minute victory.

“It was hot today. Started to cramp a little bit in the third set, which then after time it went slowly away. I know my body slightly better now with a bit of experience also, trying to handle certain situations a bit better,” Sinner said. “Got lucky today. At the point when they closed the roof, it takes a little bit time. Tried to loosen up a little bit. It helped. Changed a bit also the way of how to play certain points. That helped me today, for sure.”





The former college tennis star at the University of Texas, Spizzirri was competing in the third round of a major for the first time and had never previously played in the Australian Open main draw. This was his first match against a Top-10 opponent.

For much of the match, the 24-year-old did not show any nerves. Spizzirri went blow for blow from the baseline with the four-time major champion, playing fearless tennis.

Sinner was far from perfect, making 51 unforced errors according to Infosys Stats. But he hit 56 winners, with his best often coming at the most critical moments

Spizzirri only converted six of his 16 break chances in the match, while Sinner won eight of his 11 break points. Spizzirri was just one of six in the third set, which helped Sinner battle through cramp to regain the advantage.

After the third set, players received a 10-minute break because of the tournament's heat rule. Even then, Spizzirri continued to fight, taking a 3-1 lead in the fourth set.

But Sinner showed his class and composure to set a fourth-round encounter against fellow Italian Luciano Darderi. Their clash will be the first in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Darderi earlier in the day beat 2023 Australian Open semi-finalist Karen Khachanov 7-6(5), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. The Italian had never advanced past the second round of a major before last year's US Open, but made the third round at Flushing Meadows and now the fourth round at Melbourne Park.

The 23-year-old also beat Cristian Garin and Sebastian Baez earlier in the tournament. Darderi was 9-29 on hard courts entering the Australian Open.

In other action, eighth seed Ben Shelton won his third consecutive match in straight sets to reach the fourth round. The American downed Shanghai champion Valentin Vacherot 6-4, 6-4, 7-6(5), having defeated Ugo Humbert and Dane Sweeney earlier this week.

Shelton has produced his best level in Melbourne in recent years. Last year, the 23-year-old enjoyed a run to the semi-finals, when eventual champion Sinner stopped him. The lefty will next meet Casper Ruud after the Norwegian defeated Marin Cilic 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5. Cilic earned his 599th tour-level win earlier this week, equalling Goran Ivanisevic for the most wins by a Croatian. Ruud leads Shelton 2-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, with this their first meeting at a major.

Vacherot was competing in the main draw at a major for just the second time. The Monegasque star surged into the Top 40 last season after he won the title in Shanghai as a qualifier.

Italian tennis enjoyed another landmark day at the Australian Open on Saturday. Jannik Sinner, Lorenzo Musetti and Luciano Darderi all advanced to the fourth round in Melbourne, making it the first time in history that three Italian men have reached that stage at the tournament.

Musetti led the way, advancing to the last 16 at the Australian Open for the first time in his career after moving past Tomas Machac 5–7, 6–4, 6–2, 5–7, 6–2 in a four-hour, 27-minute battle. The world No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings will next face Taylor Fritz or Stan Wawrinka for a place in the quarter-finals.

""I feel pretty proud to be part of this trio that we have in the fourth round here at the Australian Open,"" Musetti said. ""It's my first time, so I'm really, really happy. I'm proud of the win today.""

Luciano Darderi also earned an early win on Saturday, defeating 15th seed Karen Khachanov to reach the fourth round at a major for the first time. The 22nd seed will next meet two-time defending champion Sinner after the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings beat Eliot Spizzirri in four brutal sets on Rod Laver Arena. Sinner made history in Melbourne in 2024 when he became the first Italian man to win the Australian Open.
On eight previous occasions, two Italian men had advanced to the fourth round at the hard-court major, most recently last year when eventual champion Sinner was joined by Lorenzo Sonego. Across all majors, this marks just the eighth time in history, and only the third in the Open Era, that three Italians have made the fourth round, with the most recent instance coming at Wimbledon last season.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Learner Tien: Why 'the sky is the limit' for the American star","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/tien-australian-open-2026-feature","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:40:01 GMT","

Learner Tien entered qualifying at the 2025 Australian Open as the No. 121 player in the PIF ATP Rankings and still relatively under the radar. In his first-round qualifying match, the lefty needed to survive a second-set tie-break against Gregoire Barrere to avoid losing in straight sets at his first major outside the US Open.

Two weeks later, Tien was very much a known commodity at Melbourne Park, having reached the fourth round of the main draw with the highlight being a scintillating five-set performance against former World No. 1 Daniil Medvedev in the second round.

Tien had already won three ATP Challengers to reach his ranking. But puzzling Medvedev, known for stymying most players on the ATP Tour, was the biggest moment of his young career. A year earlier, Medvedev had been a set away from lifting the trophy Down Under, and suddenly he was flummoxed by a 19-year-old lefty standing 5'11”.

Was it unexpected at the time? Sure. But 52 weeks later, Tien is in an entirely new position. The reigning Next Gen ATP Finals champion is 5-4 against Top-10 opposition and three weeks removed from a career-high No. 26 in the world. The Medvedev victory was clearly no fluke. In fact, the 20-year-old will have a chance to upset Medvedev once more Sunday on the very same court where he completed his stunner at 2:54 a.m.

“Much different circumstances this year than last year. A year later, I think I'm a lot more mature as a person and a player,” Tien told ATPTour.com. “I think just being on my own a lot more for the past year I've become a lot more independent and I think I've just gotten more used to the life, traveling more on my own and I think because of that I've grown a lot as a person as much as I have as a player.”

With players like Tien and Joao Fonseca taking the ATP Tour by storm at such an early age, it is easy to forget how young they really are. Tien is still a 20-year-old who would have been in college at the University of Southern California, where he played for one semester, had he not turned professional early. He would have been in class with his friends and living the life of a typical college student.

Instead, Tien is traveling the world entertaining millions of fans and battling throughout the year against the biggest stars in the sport.

“I think gradually I've started to accept that this is my life and hopefully this will be my life for years to come,” Tien said. “It's been gradual, I've been getting used to it. I wouldn't say that I woke up one morning and I suddenly felt like this is my life and everything was integrated into my life. But I think gradually over the past year I've come to terms with this [being] the new normal and I've accepted that.”





The “new normal” on the court really began in Melbourne. Tien's fourth-round showing was simply a sign of things to come. The only difference is that the lefty now carries lessons learned from his first full season on the ATP Tour, especially after bringing former World No. 2 Michael Chang onto his team in the middle of last season.

“I think I'm better all around. I wouldn't say I'm playing drastically differently,” Tien said. “I would like to think I'm a bit less of a pusher now, maybe. I think the year's worth of experience has been good for me and I think I've obviously improved a lot, but I wouldn't say I'm a totally different player.”

One of the reasons Tien was so comfortable competing against such high-level players early in his career is that he has been around top players for much of his tennis life. When the American conducted his post-match media interviews Friday, one of his stops was at ESPN, where former World No. 11 Sam Querrey was at the desk.

Producers rolled old footage of a young Tien hitting balls with Querrey. Learner would be around Querrey and Steve Johnson in Carson from before he was a teen. 

“Sam and I started hitting with him maybe when he was 12 or 13, and he'd always just be either on one side or in a corner,” Johnson said. “Even at that age you could just tell that there was something different because our ball didn't affect him the way it would most 12, 13 years old kids. His timing was incredible.” 

Johnson raved about Tien as a person. Yes, the former World No. 21 was — and still is — very impressed by his physical tennis skills. But he was more in awe of how Tien carried himself around professionals at such a young age.

“He always just seemed to be enjoying the moment when he was out there even at Carson at a young age. There were a lot of times where it probably wasn't that fun for him as just a young kid doing whatever Sam and I needed him to do,” Johnson said. “But we could tell there was something different about the way he struck the ball, his movement and just his demeanour. He always was quiet, but positive, never negative and would just take whatever you gave him and would give it back most of the time with interest.” 

By the time Tien was 15 or 16 years old, he began playing baseline points with Johnson and Querrey, longtime pros who were still competing at the top of the sport.

“It all almost felt relatively 50-50 at that point. That's how good he was,” Johnson recalled. “We got the serve involved and that was going to be a little tough for him at that age, but that just comes with the territory. 

“He was such a good striker of the tennis ball and can't wait to see what he has in the future. He's already accomplished so much in his young career and the sky is the limit, especially with Michael [Chang] on the bag. Now he's just going to leave no stone unturned. His work ethic is incredible. I watch him work and every time I see him — he comes by LA every couple months — I watch him practise and play, and something impresses me every time he's back that he just continually gets better and better.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Tommy Paul & Paige Lorenze launch foundation: 'We need to be giving back'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/paul-australian-open-2026-foundation-feature","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 10:16:12 GMT","

Tommy Paul is making his way through the Australian Open draw, advancing to the fourth round at Melbourne Park for the third time in four years. But the American is leaving his mark off the court, too.

Paul and fiancee Paige Lorenze recently announced the creation of the Kids Outdoors Foundation, which creates opportunities for kids without the financial means to play sports to do so.

“Our goal is to encourage kids to get outdoors and play sports,” Paul told ATPTour.com. “The more programmes and kids we are able to support the better.”





Paul has been a fixture towards the top of the ATP Tour for years, reaching No. 8 in the PIF ATP Rankings last year. Lorenze is now a content creator, but she used to be a competitive downhill ski racer and now enjoys horseback riding. They want to ensure kids have the same opportunities they have.

“I think it's super important, especially for people like me and Paige,” Paul said. “Sports have put us in the position that we're in right now. We need to be giving back and I'm excited to start doing this and really getting it going, especially in South Florida and Eastern North Carolina, where I came from. 

“There's not too much tennis really going on there. So anything I can do to really push that forward and bring it back is exciting.”

The Kids Outdoors Foundation will fund pre-existing programmes that give kids access to sports with high financial barriers, like tennis, skiing and horseback riding and also create new opportunities. The goal is to fund nonprofit organisations that are already doing great work for kids in the community to help increase their impact.

Paul did not compete after last year's US Open due to a foot injury. That period away from the court helped the American turn his attention to how he could give back.

“I would say it's something that I've wanted do for a while,” Paul said. “The break that I had — the amount of time that I had off —  provided us with the time needed to get it up and running.”

Paul will take on World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz Sunday for a place in the quarter-finals. The Spaniard leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 5-2.

“It's always an interesting matchup. Always a great challenge playing Carlos. He can really do anything on the court. Lightning fast. He's like the standard that everyone's trying to catch up to right now,” Paul said in a press conference after his third-round match in Melbourne.  “But you've got to go into that with excitement, be ready to face that, be ready to bring your best level, believe in yourself.

“That's something that I bring to the table every time I play Carlos. I believe I can win every time I go out there. Without that, you're going out there with no purpose.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Sinner on cramp scare at Australian Open: 'I got lucky'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-reaction-australian-open-2026-saturday","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 08:14:26 GMT","

Jannik Sinner admitted he “got lucky” after cramping threatened to derail his four-set comeback win over American Eliot Spizzirri on Saturday at the Australian Open.

The extreme heat policy and a timely roof closure helped the two-time defending champion reset and push through to the fourth round in Melbourne. Sinner began to cramp early at one set all, just as play was suspended and the roof was closed — a pause that proved pivotal in swinging momentum back his way.

“I got lucky today,” Sinner said in his post-match press conference. “At the point when they closed the roof, it took a little bit of time. I tried to loosen up a little bit. It helped... I also changed the way of playing certain points. That helped me today, for sure.”

Sinner spent around 10 minutes off court while the roof was closing. Although he was not permitted to receive treatment, he used the break to stretch and bring his body temperature down.

“​You cannot have treatment in that time, so I was stretching,” said Sinner, the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. “I laid down for five minutes, trying to loosen up the muscles. It worked really well. Trying to get the body temperature a bit down. That's it. There are not many things you can do. Time passed quite fast, but it helped me, for sure.”

It is not the first time cramp has tested Sinner's resilience. He was forced to retire in the third round of his Shanghai title defence against Tallon Griekspoor in October last year, before battling through similar issues just weeks later in a gruelling three-set win over Alexander Zverev in the Vienna final.

Sinner believes there is not always a clear explanation when these moments arise.

“I feel like sometimes there are no real explanations,” Sinner said. “For example, last night I didn't sleep the way I wanted to. The quality of sleep was not perfect… Maybe it was this; maybe not. Regardless of that, I try to be in the best possible shape every day [with] recovery, everything going in the right direction. It can happen.

“I know my body a little bit better now. I hope that it goes away slowly, which was the case. Today, the rule helped me. I also had 10 minutes after the third set. So I tried to have a good balance.”





The win was reminiscent of Sinner's fourth-round victory over Holger Rune at Melbourne Park last year, when he also had to manage physical discomfort en route to the title.

Asked about his “luck” in navigating these situations, Sinner — who is aiming to become just the second man in the Open Era after Novak Djokovic to win three consecutive Australian Open titles — pointed instead to preparation and mindset.

“I'm someone who tries to put tennis in the highest priority,” said Sinner. “I know that I've been doing that for years now. In the back of my mind I know how much I work. I feel well prepared even if some problems could happen potentially on the court.

“Of course, there are going to be days where you don't find a way. It's not that everything is going your way. But with a positive mindset, for sure more positive things can happen. If you are in a court thinking in a negative way, most likely more negative things can come towards you. I try to stay calm even in a moment like this.”

After navigating a tricky test, Sinner booked his place in the fourth round for the fifth consecutive year. He will next face fellow Italian Luciano Darderi in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

Amanda Anisimova battled Peyton Stearns and the heat on Saturday afternoon in Melbourne and conquered both, winning 6-1, 6-4 in 1 hour and 11 minutes to reach her second straight Australian Open fourth round.

For the second consecutive year, Amanda Anisimova is through to the Australian Open fourth round, this time after defeating compatriot Peyton Stearns 6-1, 6-4 at Margaret Court Arena.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

On what was expected to be one of the hottest days of the tournament, the World No. 4 made sure she wouldn't be in the sun for long, wrapping up the win in 1 hour and 11 minutes on Saturday afternoon.

Besides, the heat wasn't anything a Florida kid isn't used to.

""Just staying hydrated the day before, the day of is really important. Ice baths,"" Anisimova said to press. ""We always try and prepare as best as we can. I think the only difference is really with the water and also on the court using the ice.

""We don't really get super long breaks. I felt like I was really rushed today trying to just fit everything in on each changeover. It's just important to keep fueling and also staying calm, to not spend my energy on emotions andstuff like that.""

It's the fourth time Anisimova has reached the Round of 16 Melbourne, and she got there by beating Stearns for the first time on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. She has yet to drop a set this week and never appeared in real danger of doing so here, despite a late charge from Stearns.

Anisimova saved a break point in the opening game before breaking Stearns for a 2-0 lead shortly after. She then added another break to go ahead 5-1 before serving out the set in a little over half an hour.

Just when it looked like she would cruise to victory with a 5-2 lead in the second set, Stearns fought off a match point and broke for the second time in three games. After narrowing the gap to 5-4 and saving another match point, the former University of Texas standout finally succumbed to a forehand winner that sent Anisimova to the fourth round.

""I was just really trying to stay focused, try and do the things that I wanted to do, focus on my serve,"" Anisimova said. ""I made quite a few mistakes when I was up 5-2. Yeah, I was just trying to regroup, do what I could to close it out, because obviously playing her, it wasn't going to be easy.""

Here's some takeaways from her straight-sets win:

Hit me with your best shot: While Anisimova's backhand often gets the spotlight, her forehand delivered many of her finer moments on Saturday -- including the match-point winner.

But it was to be outdone by one she hit earlier in the match. Already up a break in the second set, she ripped a forehand right down the line and by the outstretched arms of Stearns to set up triple break point.

Stearns managed to save the first, but not the second as Anisimova broke for a 4-1 lead.

Stat of the match: One could look at Anisimova's serving numbers and find plenty to catch their eye. But it was the heat that dictated much of the play, so much so that across more than 100 points, not a single rally reached nine shots.

With temperatures hovering around 95 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the match and expected to climb past 100 later in the day, both players kept points short and took risks.

In the end, Anisimova was the more aggressive of the two. Her 30 unforced errors more than doubled Stearns' 14, but she also produced 14 winners to Stearns' six, including the one that mattered most: the last one.

What's next: As a result, Anisimova moves into the fourth round, where she'll face Wang Xinyu, whom she has never faced.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","At 41, Zvonareva finds room for one more chapter at the Australian Open","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4438903/motivated-by-passion-not-pressure-zvonarevas-comeback-story","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 13:02:43 GMT","

Vera Zvonareva, 41, is making a comeback to the sport. While competing in both singles and doubles, she plans to prioritize doubles. Happy to be back on the tour, the former World No. 2 values the competition and joy of the game at this stage of her career.

A pair of 40-year-olds -- one in the women's draw and one in the men's -- have been in the spotlight during the first week of the 2026 Australian Open. Venus Williams, 45, became the oldest woman to compete in the singles main draw at the season-opening Grand Slam. On the men's side, Stan Wawrinka became the first player aged 40 or over to reach the third round at a major since Ken Rosewall at the 1978 Australian Open.

But another veteran in her early 40s is also competing at Melbourne Park and remains alive on the middle Sunday of the main draw.

Forty-one-year-old Vera Zvonareva made a low-key comeback at the ITF W100 in Dubai in December, marking her first professional tournament since June 2024. Like Williams and Wawrinka, Zvonareva has played on the sport's biggest stages against its biggest names. She peaked at No. 2 in the singles rankings in 2010 -- the same year she finished runner-up at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.

Though Zvonareva never won a Grand Slam singles title, she owns plenty of major silverware. She has won three women's doubles and two mixed doubles titles at the majors, most recently capturing the 2020 U.S. Open women's doubles crown.

But after returning from surgery that forced her to stop competing in 2024, Zvonareva is taking things as they come.

""There was always a question if my body can handle it or not,"" Zvonareva told the wtatennis.com from Melbourne. ""I had another surgery in 2024, that's why I stopped. I still enjoy hitting the ball. I was coaching a little bit and if my body allowed, I wanted to try to play a little bit.

""As long as I'm still enjoying it, that's the most important thing. I do enjoy playing matches myself and for now, my body does allow me to compete so I'm happy to be back on tour. I had a protected ranking and that obviously helps because I can get into some tournaments and play against a lot of new girls on tour. But at the same time, there's still a lot of girls that I played with before and I'm enjoying the competition.""

The lack of a defined timetable or long-term plan has kept things simple for the 12-time WTA singles title winner.

""I think I was never in a rush,"" she said. ""I was taking my time and enjoying my time off the tour as well. I was thinking maybe I will come back, maybe not. But then as soon as the opportunity came up, I tried. I'm still trying. I don't know how long I can compete, but like I said, as long as my body allows me to do so I want to be competing and playing.""

During her time away from the tour, Zvonareva explored coaching. While she is unsure whether that path will feature in her future once she stops playing, she believes the experience has helped her own game.

""I'm enjoying coaching as well. It's a bit different and obviously I still need to build my experience in that, but I've had a good amount of time to explore coaching and with different levels of players. I think it also helps me to be a better player as well, because you're a bit on the other side and you see things differently. I can kind of tell myself certain things when I'm on the court, not just as a player, but as a coach and that's very interesting.""

Since her comeback, Zvonareva has reached the singles and doubles finals at the ITF W100 Dubai in December and the doubles final at the WTA 125K in Canberra earlier this month. The former World No. 2 plans to continue mixing it up, though she acknowledges doubles is likely to be her priority at this stage of her career.

""Wherever I can, I play some singles because I'm enjoying it,"" she said. ""And my doubles ranking is much higher. So that allows me to play bigger tournaments. So I'll try to manage both a little bit. But I think doubles is my priority at this stage of my career.""

Reaching one singles and two doubles finals in her first three tournaments back has boosted Zvonareva's confidence and reinforced her belief that she can still compete at this level.

""Definitely that helped me a lot to get back in the game and to realize that I still have the level,"" Zvonareva said. ""Obviously, I need to work hard to maintain it, but I still have the level to play. The most important thing for me was to be on the court to experience those tough situations and to understand that I'm still enjoying competing. That was the most important thing. And I think I've done really well just taking it one tournament at a time.""

Melbourne holds happy memories for the 2008 Beijing Olympics bronze medalist. She won the women's doubles title here in 2012 and reached the singles semifinals in 2009 and 2011. Back at the Australian Open for the first time since 2022, Zvonareva -- partnering Japan's Ena Shibahara -- is through to the third round of the women's doubles event. The pair defeated 10th seeds Diana Shnaider and Liudmila Samsonova in the first round and local wild cards Taylah Preston and Lizette Cabrera in the second.

""I always loved playing in Australia and I've had some great results here in the past,"" Zvonareva said. ""I'm enjoying this moment. It's a bit windy, but it's part of the game, but I'm enjoying my time.""

Novak Djokovic continued to move smoothly through this year's Australian Open draw on Saturday night, recording his third consecutive straight-set victory of the tournament with a 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4) triumph over Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp.And with that triumph, he extended one record and broke another.First of all, it was Djokovic's 400th career win at a Grand Slam event, extending his record for most career wins at the majors for a man in tennis history. He's actually held that record since 2024, when he surpassed Roger Federer's previous mark of 369.But second of all, and perhaps more importantly, Djokovic also secured his 70th career appearance in the round of 16 of a major, breaking the record for most career appearances in the round of 16 at a major for a man in tennis history, surpassing Federer's 69.

Going into Saturday night, this was a bit of a danger match—not only had Van de Zandschulp won the pair's last meeting, at Indian Wells last year, but he's no stranger to upsets at Grand Slams, having stunned Carlos Alcaraz at the US Open two years ago.And after Djokovic moved ahead two sets to love, that dangerous streak started showing, as the big-hitting Dutchman broke early in the third set for a 3-1 lead—and, after getting broken back, he later held two set points in that set, in Djokovic's 5-6 service game.But like he's done so many times in the past, Djokovic got going when the going got tough, hanging on in that service game and finally putting Van de Zandschulp away in the tie-break.He improved to 18-0 in his career in third-round matches at the Australian Open with Saturday night's victory, too.Awaiting the 11-time champion in Melbourne in the next round will be the winner of No. 16 seed Jakub Mensik and unseeded American Ethan Quinn, who also played their third round on Saturday night.

MELBOURNE, Australia—Players don't often hear “Congratulations” in a post-loss press conference but after Eliot Spizzirri's effort on Rod Laver Arena, it was certainly appropriate.The former college standout from the University of Texas gave world No. 2 Jannik Sinner all he could handle a grueling third round on Saturday, taking the first set and leading by a break in the third before the two-time defending champion rallied from a bout of cramps to survive, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.“You could say it's lucky, but he's also very experienced and handled it, you know, pretty well, I would say,” Spizzirri said when told of Sinner's post-match assessment.The 24-year-old, who only played one Top 20 player before Sinner, let out a wry smile when the Laver roof closed when he broke for 3-1 in the third, the tournament's Extreme Heat Policy kicking in in the middle of the previous game, but felt physically strong throughout the three hour, 45-minute encounter.

“I thought that it was an opportunity to showcase my physicality,” Spizzirri said of his pre-match mentality.“I was talking to a couple of people in the locker room that I did my preseason with, and this heat's nothing compared to what we deal with in Florida and what I went and trained in in Austin, even New York in the summers with the humidity.“I played a match in China last year.

Q. On a tennis level, how do you feel about your game? Going toe-to-toe with the two-time defending champion, Sinner, for four sets out there, how encouraging is that for you as a sign of what you can be at this level?ELIOT SPIZZIRRI: Yeah, definitely encouraging. I never played, you know, especially in a formal match, a player of his caliber. To kind of feel out my game and go toe-to-toe with him, yeah, it felt good. It definitely gives me some confidence to keep going. I have some areas that I definitely need to work on, I think, and maybe that were a little bit exposed. I knew that coming in.He's one of the best players in the world, so he's going to kind of make you feel where your weaknesses are more than other guys and exploit them. Yeah, I definitely felt like I'll hopefully learn a lot from this match but also take some confidence from it.Unseeded in Melbourne, he began he week by stunning No. 28 seed Joao Fonseca in four sets and shook of a lost two-set lead over Wu Yibing to secure a career-best Grand Slam finish. While he didn't beat Sinner on Saturday, a “congratulations” on a breakthrough week, indeed.

Williams have announced that they will not appear at the upcoming Barcelona Shakedown as they pursue ""maximum car performance"".

Williams have announced that they will not take part in the upcoming Barcelona Shakedown, explaining that they are pursuing ""maximum car performance"" for 2026.

The shakedown, which will see teams get the opportunity to run their new challengers for three days over January 26-30 at the Circuit Barcelona-Catalunya, offers more track time in addition to the usual pre-season testing in Bahrain to help with the transition to the adjusted regulations.

While Williams will not make an appearance, they will carry out their own private testing ahead of the first official test in Bahrain, taking place on February 11-13.

In an official statement, the team said: ""Atlassian Williams F1 Team has taken the decision not to participate in next week's shakedown test in Barcelona following delays in the FW48 programme as we continue to push for maximum car performance.

""The team will instead conduct a series of tests including a VTT [Virtual Track Testing] programme next week with the 2026 car to prepare for the first official test in Bahrain and the first race of the season in Melbourne.

""We are looking forward to getting on track in the coming weeks and want to thank all our fans for your continued support – there is a lot to look forward to together in 2026.""

First look at Ferrari's 2026 car

Racing Bulls have signed the former Aston Martin technical chief to bolster their ranks.

Racing Bulls have announced the appointment of experienced aerodynamicist Dan Fallows as their new Technical Director, adding to the squad's technical leadership group.

When he arrives in April, Fallows will report into Chief Technical Officer, Tim Goss, and “take responsibility for the overall technical direction of the team, working across design, aerodynamics and performance”.

Fallows joins Racing Bulls after previous Technical Director Jody Egginton vacated his position to become Engineering Director at Red Bull Advanced Technologies in early 2025.

It marks the latest move in an F1 career that began with Jaguar Racing in the early 2000s, before stints at Red Bull and most recently Aston Martin – the Briton stepping down as their Technical Director at the end of the 2024 season.

“I'm very pleased to be joining VCARB at an exciting time for the team,” said Fallows in a press release issued by Racing Bulls on Friday.

“There is a clear vision and strong technical ambition, and I'm looking forward to working closely with Tim and the wider engineering group to help drive performance and continue building the team for the future.”

Alan Permane, Racing Bulls' Team Principal, said: “Dan has a wealth of experience, and his technical understanding and leadership will be a real asset to the team as we continue to develop and push forward competitively. We're delighted to welcome him to VCARB.”

Racing Bulls head into the 2026 season with a revised driver line-up, as F2 race winner Arvid Lindblad joins incumbent Liam Lawson – the pair already experiencing the new VCARB 03 in a shakedown at Imola earlier this week.

First look at Ferrari's 2026 car

George Russell and Kimi Antonelli returned to the track in the new-look Mercedes W17 at Silverstone.

1 / 6

Mercedes' 2026 car made its on-track debut at Silverstone at the hands of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli, completing its first laps of the year as part of a filming day.

The Brackley outfit recently revealed a revised livery featuring their trademark black and silver colour scheme for this season, in which every team will battle to capitalise on the sweeping regulation changes.

Their unchanged driver line-up clocked nearly 200km of mileage in typically damp conditions at the British circuit on 22 January to kickstart their pre-season preparation, with the squad joining the other 10 teams for the shakedown in Barcelona next week.

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director, said: “We have had a sensible first day of
running with the W17 at Silverstone. As with any shakedown, the focus is on ensuring
everything operates safely and reliably.

""We were able to get through our allotted mileage, with both George and Kimi getting to experience the 2026 car on track for the first time. That is testament to the hard work of everyone at Brackley and Brixworth.

""Our attention now turns to Barcelona where we will look to build on today's running and add to our understanding of the W17.”

Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc got an initial taste of Ferrari's 2026 car on Friday.

1 / 7

Ferrari have completed the very first laps with their new F1 challenger, the SF-26.

Shortly after the design was presented to the world on Friday, Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc got behind the wheel at the team's very own Fiorano test track – next to their Maranello headquarters in Italy.

Classed as a demonstration day, Ferrari's running was limited to just 15 kilometres, meaning only brief stints on track for the continuing team mates.

Nonetheless, that sent the passionate group of Tifosi gathered around the circuit wild, with plenty of support being shown before Ferrari head to next week's Barcelona Shakedown.

Check out a gallery of the SF-26 in action at the top of the page.

From porn to LGBTQ visibility and various other empowered marginalized voices, David Shadrack Smith's Sundance entry covers a tumultuous chapter of media.


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	In describing the free-for-all world of New York City's Manhattan Cable Television, the official Sundance description of David Shadrack Smith's Public Access uses the word “chaos.”


	“Chaos” or “chaotic” are words used multiple times in the documentary by people who worked within this unprecedented media experiment forced on the cable company by the city.







	
	
		
					Public Access		
	


The Bottom Line

	
	A chaotic formal approach sometimes upstages strong material.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (U.S. Documentary Competition)Director: David Shadrack Smith

								1 hour 46 minutes			






	They're also words that appear repeatedly in my notes on the 107-minute film.


Public Access is a chaotic film, which may actually be putting it generously. Putting it less generously would be to say that Public Access is a mess, a jumble of chronology, a hodge-podge of two-thirds developed ideas, a mish-mash of remarkable footage and worthy insights often upstaged by questionable aesthetic and storytelling strategies.

	Movies
			



	
		
					'Leviticus' Review: A Sad, Frightening Conversion-Therapy Horror From Australia		
			









	Of course, if Smith's (Taste the Nation With Padma Lakshmi) goal was making a film that simulated the experience, and possibly the headache, of freebasing 50 years of public access programming with limited structure and negligible guidance, then Public Access actually succeeds entirely.




			Related Video		







Public Access is an exclusively archival documentary, delivered with voiceover narration (no onscreen talking heads) courtesy of many of the staffers at Manhattan Cable Television, which launched in 1971 with the goal of nothing less than democratizing a medium that was still dominated primarily by three broadcast networks. (PBS formally debuted in 1970, taking over for various “educational” stations, but that's a different documentary.)

	











	Overseen by Charlotte Schiff-Jones, a Time Inc. executive and self-described “First Amendment lunatic,” public access was, for some at least, an opportunity to empower underrepresented communities and to expand the formal confines of television.


	It was a high-minded endeavor — which you'll know because all of the participating voices from the channel's early days speak in cult-y jargon like they were, either now or at the time, fresh out of their first college media studies course, which they may well have been.


	“The media was clearly part of the problem and there was no alternative to it. So the alternative was to take the power back and change that formula of the control of television,” says Steven Lawrence, whose job was to interface with the public.


	Speakers are introduced in freeze frames on a recreated TV screen and then only occasionally throughout, so that in the first 20 minutes, the documentary's voice is an enthusiastic and passionate hive mind. Little bits of information are provided on the logistics of the channel — how people got shows, the technological leap that came when they realized they could broadcast live, the one show (Glenn O'Brien's TV Party) on which Jean-Michel Basquiat would simply hang out and fiddle with the onscreen text.


	“It made for this sorta clusterfuck of ideas,” says Debbie Harry, a regular guest on TV Party. And yes, “clusterfuck of ideas” would be another good description of Public Access.


	There are early vignettes briefly focused on shows like TV Party and the free-form call-in show Grube Tube that illustrated some realization of the channel's aspirations, but then the channel and the documentary get distracted by the shiny object that is porn. Longer vignettes discuss Midnight Blue and creator (and fellow First Amendment lunatic) Al Goldstein, with enough nudity and adult content that Public Access will only be limitedly useful as a teaching tool and with enough nudity and adult content that the show and its creator became a free speech crusader. Of more substance is the segment dedicated to Lou Maletta, his gay pornography-driven Men and Films program, and the way that public access' Channel J was able to serve as a vital resource in the early days of the AIDS epidemic.

	











	Occasionally there's flow to the vignettes: One can question, for example, whether Goldstein and his version of free speech were a positive realization of public access' aspirations, but if that led to Maletta and regular reporting from Richard Berkowitz on topics the mainstream media wouldn't touch, then it was worth it.


	Occasionally, the vignettes just pop up with nothing resembling internal logic or continuity. Did the filmmakers realize that the focus on programming was exclusively white, so why not dedicate five minutes to Earl Chin and the reggae-focused Rockers TV? That serves an an excuse, then, to talk about the rise of MTV, and, for far too long, Jake Fogelnest and Squirt TV, which should make most viewers immediately make the leap to YouTube and TikTok as a logical extension of public access' populist smorgasbord.


	In a way, this is where Public Access is most successful. Yes, the footage is wacky and wild — credit to archival producer Anne-Marcelle Ngabirano — but questionably edited leaps from archival footage that is, itself, already questionably edited only go so far. The documentary demands active participation from viewers able to see how what happened with public access — its journey from noble aspirations to more sordid reality — was mirrored later in the early days of cable and then the early days of the Internet and then the early days of social media.


	Technological trends repeat themselves. Best laid plans oft go astray, causing noisy trash to frequently upstage noisy quality. There are good and righteous thoughts in Public Access and I think the points it wants to make get through if you work at it, but man the journey to get there is chaotic.

Director Poh Si Teng followed a trio of doctors who performed surgeries at the Nasser Medical Complex while the war raged on, risking their lives to save others.


							By 

	Jordan Mintzer



	It's hard to make a documentary about the war in Gaza that does not feel overtly political. And yet director Poh Si Teng's unflinching new exposé, American Doctor, is first and foremost a humanitarian story — one in which medicine and moral decency take precedence over partisanship.


	Which isn't to say that this very hands-on look at three American physicians volunteering in Gaza isn't also a political statement. By its very existence — and in what it reveals about the IDF's killing, maiming and wounding of Palestinian civilians over the past few years — the film is a condemnation both of Netanyahu's far-right war machine and the U.S. government's steadfast support of it.

					American Doctor		
	


The Bottom Line

	
	Filled with courage and chaos.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (U.S. Documentary Competition)Cast: Dr. Thaer Ahmad, Dr. Mark Perlmutter, Dr. Feroze SidhwaDirector: Poh Si Teng

								1 hour 33 minutes			






	But what makes American Doctor stand out is how it eschews the bigger picture to focus primarily on the practical, and often hard-to-watch, reality of surgeons trying to save lives in the operating room. When children are brought into the ER after surviving a bombing, their suffering is unbearable to witness no matter what side of the Israel-Palestinian conflict you find yourself on.




			Related Video		







	The trio of doctors featured in Teng's movie not only deal with such atrocities firsthand as physicians; they speak about them candidly in interviews, describing what they've seen and the dire working conditions they face. (One of them has to smuggle basic supplies like scrubs and antibiotics in his luggage since the IDF won't allow them into the combat zone.) The doctors' efforts involve both medical interventions and relaying information to the outside world, because Israel has barred foreign journalists from Gaza since October 2023.

	











	All three physicians have distinct skill sets and hail from widely different backgrounds. Dr. Feroze Sidhwa is a trauma surgeon from California whose Zoroastrian parents emigrated to the U.S. from Pakistan. The North Carolina-based Dr. Mark Perlmutter is a Jewish orthopedic surgeon who hardly conceals his contempt for the current Israeli regime (he lashes out at them as “chicken fuckers,” which must be a Southern thing). And Dr. Thaer Ahmad is a Palestinian-American ER specialist who speaks with a hefty Chicago accent as he gives public talks about his experience.


	What they have in common is volunteering their services and expertise in Gaza, which is no small feat when you consider how their own lives were at stake. Teng shows us not one but two scenes of the facility where they work — the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis — getting blasted by IDF missiles. In the second, an initial attack on the hospital is followed by several more bombs that obliterate a crew of Palestinian Red Crescent workers trying to save the wounded.


	“As Surgeons, We Have Never Seen Such Cruelty Like Israel's Genocide in Gaza,” is the title of an op-ed piece Sidhwa and Perlmutter pen together, and American Doctor does not spare the viewer some of that cruelty. We see bloodied, unconscious children being carted into the operating room, where some of them are saved and some aren't. (And even when they are saved, their limbs are sometimes amputated.) One 15-year-old boy survives a bombing, only to be “incinerated” (these are Sidhwa's words) when the Nasser complex takes a direct hit from a missile.

	











	There is nothing to do but watch these scenes in horror and disgust. Thankfully, Teng also spends some time with the doctors when they're off-duty and palling around with their Palestinian colleagues, revealing a M.A.S.H.-like camaraderie among combat physicians who have been through the worst. Other sequences show the trio of volunteers back home in the U.S., where they give more interviews, spend time with their loved ones and prep for their return to Gaza.


	These scenes emphasize the “American” part of the film's title, and Teng smartly frames her film from that viewpoint. The doctors know their actions will have little impact on Israeli policy — a policy that includes making it incredibly difficult for them to enter Gaza and do their jobs. (After volunteering there in 2024, Ahmad is denied access and remains grounded in neighboring Jordan.) But the trio does try to make an impact on policy back home, including paying a visit to the Hart Senate Office Building in Washington for meetings during which they mostly receive lip service.


	One of the most frustrating things in American Doctor is to see the U.S. government doing little to quell the devastation and suffering it shares a responsability in. Despite the doctors' multiple efforts to push America to “achieve its moral potential,” as Sidhwa states at one point, the bombs and missles — supplied in large part by the U.S. military — keep raining down and the kids keep on dying. By the time the movie ends, Gaza is in ruins and too many lives have been lost.

	











	Like the courageous men she chronicles, Teng faces these realities with an impressive level of sangfroid, filming with a steady hand and never shying away from some truly shocking images. Her one misstep is at the very end of the film, when she inserts a montage of explosions, corpses and destruction that's meant to jar us awake, but hardly feels necessary considering all we've seen.


	It's perhaps too obvious and blatantly political, whereas what makes American Doctor so powerful is the way it reveals the shared humanity of physicians and patients in the face of death.

This Sundance-bowing film about cursed teenagers takes a solemn, eerie look at homophobia and repression in a small town. 


							By 

	Richard Lawson



	While the happy and only barely tortured gay romance of Heated Rivalry sweeps the nation, nay the world, it might be instructive, if depressing, to remind ourselves that there are many young queer people who have a much harder time realizing their desires. The new film Leviticus, from director Adrian Chiarella, is a solemn and frightening acknowledgment of that reality, albeit one allegorized into supernatural horror. 


	The film takes place in a dreary town in Victoria, Australia, a drab industrial backwater whose people — or, at least some of whom — flock to religion to give their lives the brightness of hope and higher purpose. Teenager Niam (Joe Bird) has just moved to town with his mum (a deceptively sinister Mia Wasikowska) but already yearns to escape it. He finds some deliverance, of the emotional kind anyway, in a classmate, Ryan (Stacy Clausen), a handsome ruffian with whom Niam shares a special bond. They have found love, or at least affectionate lust, in a hopeless place, just as many kids have done before them, since time immemorial.

The Bottom Line

	
	A stylish, urgent allegory.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (Midnight) Cast: Joe Bird, Stacy Clausen, Mia WasikowskaDirector and writer: Adrian Chiarella

								1 hour 26 minutes			






	Chief on the film's mind is what happens when the relative innocence of that blush of first infatuation — neither boy seems particularly troubled by his proclivity — is spoiled by outside forces, like family and the church. As a hardcore religious right gains traction around the globe, Leviticus challenges the notion, made too easy to accept by the Heartstoppers and Love, Simons of the world, that coming out isn't really such a big deal anymore. It is still — perhaps increasingly so, in this moment of backslide — monumental and dangerous for plenty of young people, often plunging their lives into horror.

	











	Chiarella is particularly interested in the abuses of conversion therapy, which hideously imagines that something innate can be excised or, at least, wholly ignored. It is a form of torture, one whose effects can cause lingering and sometimes fatal harm. Such trauma is made manifest in Leviticus, in which these afflicted kids are stalked by a sinister force that, cruelly and perversely, takes the form of the person they most want in the world.


	It's a grim and clever conceit, even if its rules don't always make total sense. What the device does most effectively is force the audience to think about the real-world analog of these characters' psychic (and physical) pain: the many young people who have been told that their sexual and romantic desire will destroy them, that a fundamental human attraction is something they must flee from in mortal terror. How heartbreaking, and how vile, that any adult claiming compassion would seek to imbue a child with that extreme allergy to their own self. 


Leviticus has a enough gore and jumpy moments to qualify it as a proper horror film. But its true scariness is of the forlorn kind, as Naim and Ryan grow distrustful of each other, not sure if the needful, seductive person they see before them is real or a menacing specter who means to kill them. That doleful eeriness is the film's best asset, adding a tragic queer love story to the template of youth-curse films like It Follows and Talk to Me. Both Bird and Clausen play this mounting nightmare with the appropriate ache and desperation, elevating the emotional tenor of Chiarella's sad, frequently bleak film. Sure, Clausen is pretty enough that one wonders why he doesn't just monetize his Instagram and flee to Sydney, but otherwise both he and Bird appropriately register as two small-towners trapped in a toxic community, starkly rendered in Chiarella's drab austerity. 

	











	Though his metaphors are awfully on the nose, Chiarella convincingly insists on their power. He has made his argumentative trick work quite well, even if the movie's messaging sometimes crosses into the obvious or didactic. And anyway, maybe we are at a time, yet again, when such simple lessons bear repeating, when it is not lame or dated to highlight the terrible violations of the most basic kind of homophobia. 


	There is also, perhaps, a slightly radical suggestion teased out toward the end of Chiarella's film, one that harkens back to so many narratives of the past: Those stories told of uncles and sons and countless others who fled their oppression in search of something they knew to be true and decent, waiting for them in distant, glittering cities. Leviticus has the sturdy nerve and conviction to plainly state that sometimes home and family are irredeemable and worth abandoning. It is not so concerned with changing hearts and minds, but with saving lives.

Slated for a late January release by A24, Aidan Zamiri's satire of a cultural phenomenon also features Alexander Skarsgard, Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant and Hailey Benton Gates.


							By 

	Richard Lawson



	Those of us who somehow missed out on “Brat Summer” — busy having other, less exciting seasons of our own, I guess — might turn to the new film The Moment in search of a vicarious, retroactive thrill. A mockumentary about pop idol Charli xcx navigating the period between the release of her watershed 2024 album, Brat, and its subsequent world tour, The Moment would ideally offer both a very recent nostalgia trip for those who were swept up in that cultural epoch, and a whirlwind, behind-the-scenes catch-up for the rest of us. 


	But writer-director Aidan Zamiri's film instead takes place in the months between Brat's two public lives. It offers a backstage glimpse of what might have been as Charli attempted to process her brief, shining moment as queen of the zeitgeist and began wondering when enough might be enough, when it would be time to move on to a new era (I think other musicians are allowed to use that term). The Moment is not a concert film about the tour. Nor is it an account of the mad, hot months preceding it, during which the album and its pithy, party-girl ethos came to define a strange, ragged, ultimately doomed hope that particularly gripped America as it finally staggered out of a pandemic and hurtled toward a do-or-die election. (Turns out we died.)

Release date: Friday, Jan. 30Cast: Charli xcx, Alexander Skarsgard, Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Hailey Benton GatesDirector: Aidan ZamiriWriters: Aidan Zamiri, Bertie Brandes

								1 hour 43 minutes			






	It's a comedy, mostly, a satire of the vagaries of stardom and branding, populated by cool people and shot in choppy, wandering, shaky-cam vérité. I had naively anticipated more of an explainer on Brat's whole deal — a sort of thesis breakdown of the phenomenon's evolution and philosophy. But the film, co-written by Bertie Brandes, assumes its audience is already well-versed in all that. Which makes me perhaps the wrong person to review the movie; you maybe have to be fully on board with the Charli xcx circus to really appreciate what a movie about it is trying to do. 

	











	For the more casual viewer, The Moment is entertaining enough, for a while. The film's opening stretch whizzes along as Charli — a natural, engaging actor — is dragged from one banal, vaguely embarrassing meeting or negotiation to another, sketchy vignettes usually punctuated at their close by Charli putting on her dark sunglasses and retreating back inward. Zamiri aims to send up the crass monetization of a cultural boom, turning up the film's absurdity knob to highlight the very real ways in which record labels and other corporate interests attach themselves vampirically to artistic success.


	The Charli of the movie is made to hawk a Brat-branded credit card, demographically targeted at the young, queer and presumably financially unsteady people who make up the core (or, one pillar) of her fanbase. It's a wacky invention, though credible enough in these times of limitless monetization. The movie seems keen to the now-ancient and passé concept of selling out, though not terribly interested in actually reviving or adopting Gen X's principled superstition against it. It is ultimately apathetic in the face of corporate creep, which is treated as an annoying, amusing inevitability that can be managed with compromise and compartmentalization; Charli goes along with it, while also distancing herself from it. 


	Beyond the credit card, The Moment locates most of its zany humor in the presence of a hacky, inexplicably successful director played by Alexander Skarsgard, hired by Rosanna Arquette's blithe record executive to shoot the film version of Charli's impending tour. This vain dope wants to toss out all the good ideas that Charli and her steadfast creative partner, played by Hailey Benton Gates, have come up with for the show, looking to replace their carefully refined aesthetics with stupidly ornate stuntery. Some of these interludes of creative clash are funny, but the joke runs dry fairly quickly. 

	











	As it plods into its second and third acts, The Moment seems at cross purposes with itself. Is this a biting farce about the vacuities of celebrity industry? Or is it an earnest reflection on what it was to live at the center of this good-natured but still highly pressurized mania? Zamiri and Charli ultimately choose the latter pose, which tilts the film into self-serious indulgence. Like many a real music documentary, The Moment eventually treads into the realm of hagiography. 


	I wish that it instead went harder on the spoofy stuff, that it added ever more antic comedy as it rollicked along. But The Moment is too self-conscious to really commit to such silliness. The filmmakers do still want this project to be cool, after all, and to communicate that the Brat phenomenon really was quite a big deal. I've no doubt it was. But it's also well in the past by now. Trends like it are too fleeting to support the kind of mythology that The Moment tries to graft onto it. 


	Mileage will vary, of course. Those devoted to the Charli cause will no doubt get more out of the film than an out-of-touch oldster like myself ever could. But the film probably should have endeavored to be more broadly accessible and entertaining if it wanted to be anything more than a fandom's supplemental material. At the end of the movie, it's all too easy to shrug one's shoulders and dismiss it with a resigned, “Guess you had to be there.”

BAFTA-winning TV director Molly Manners' debut feature stars Galaxie Clear and Marni Duggan as teenage BFFs who give themselves the assignment of falling in love.


							By 

	Richard Lawson



	Two boarding school students try to academically approach matters of the heart with messy results in Extra Geography, a prickly, bittersweet, only occasionally convincing coming-of-age film. Directed by BAFTA-winning television director Molly Manners, making her feature debut, with a script by playwright Miriam Battye, Extra Geography trades in offbeat tones quite recognizable to festival audiences since the 1990s. 


	Newcomers Marni Duggan and Galaxie Clear (what names!) play Flic and Minna, two year 10-ers (sort of the equivalent of freshmen in the U.S.) at a posh school in the English countryside. They're inseparable, bonded by their shared Type-A ambition. They've got plans for Oxbridge and are hungry to add various accomplishments and experiences to their life CVs, thus making them more ideal candidates for acceptance. They excel at lacrosse, are brilliant in chemistry and seem well on their way to becoming stars of the school.

The Bottom Line

	
	Girls interrupted by love, sex and Shakespeare.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (World Cinema Dramatic Competition)Cast: Marni Duggan, Galaxie Clear, Alice Englert, Aoife RiddellDirector: Molly MannersWriter: Miriam Battye

								1 hour 34 minutes			






	But all that engineering has not really allowed for another significant facet of teenage life, one far less controllable than studies and sport. An upcoming production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, to be done in conjunction with a nearby boys' school (real boys!!), inspires the girls to teach themselves a lesson about love. All the blithery stuff in the play seems frivolous and silly to these focused, serious young adults, but they figure they should at least know what all of that emotion feels like in order to be better-rounded people — worldly, as they call it. So they make a plan, as if one can make a plan for such things, to fall in love. 

	











	Only, they don't target any of the gangly lads set to be in the play. They focus instead on their 30-something geography teacher, Miss Delavigne (Alice Englert), an unassuming frump who is wholly ignorant of the girls' weird game. No fuss is made about the fact that this will be a same-sex love affair, though Flic perhaps seems more invested in that aspect than does Minna, whose eyes have wandered over to the handsome boy playing Oberon in the play. 


	The film traces that sad and perhaps inevitable divergence, a relatable trajectory for anyone who came to realize in their school days that they were a bit different from their peers, even from a best friend. Extra Geography isn't exactly a coming-out story, but it is about the tumult caused when the varied jumble of sex and desire and self-consciousness enters the adolescent ecosystem. Flic's jealousy over Minna's swifter evolution in these matters is sharply rendered, all its squirming need and embarrassment and confusion. Why do boys have to ruin everything? 


	Though it is addressing raw, sometimes pathetic matters of humanity, Extra Geography does so in arch, presentational style. Its visuals and dialogue occasionally bring to mind Wes Anderson, particularly his early film Rushmore, for obvious reasons. I appreciate that Manners and Battye are trying to add some extra flair to what is otherwise a fairly conventional growing-pains narrative, but too often Extra Geography seems located outside any map of the real world. It's a bit like the British streaming series Sex Education in that way, a show that undermined its frank inquest by drowning itself in hyper-colored aesthetics. Extra Geography doesn't take things quite that far, but Manners' technique is awfully, er, mannered, her carefully composed shots sapping the film of its realness. 

	











	But the true problem might lie in the dialogue. While Battye has written for the screen before, most notably on Succession, her writing here suggests a playwright struggling to work within the confines of the medium. On stage, the stilted cadence of her script might have been better absorbed and tempered by the volume of a theater. Too often in Extra Geography, Flic and Minna seem more like personality types made manifest than actual people, which is tricky for young first-time film actors to try to smooth out into naturalness. 


	That said, the film does find a surer, more organic tone the longer it goes, building toward a glumly credible resolution that thoughtfully colors all that we've just watched. At its best, Extra Geography is a wistful look at the crucibles of young adulthood, at two people forming and re-forming into shapes that may no longer be compatible with one another. That's a rather timeless story, and indeed Extra Geography does not make any attempts to situate itself in any particular period (there's nary a smartphone to be found in the whole film). 


	I wish, though, that the movie was animated by more of the messy idiosyncrasy of life, the errancy and strangeness that can't be so precisely storyboarded or plotted out. I felt that spark most keenly not in the tale of Flic and Minna, but in their cruelly dismissed classmate, Phoebe, who pines for the girls' friendship but is rudely rebuffed. As played by the perspicacious young performer Aoife Riddell, Phoebe is perhaps the realest part of the whole picture, a sweet and desperate and boy-crazy kid bouncing with eagerness and nerves. Whenever she exited the frame, I wanted Manners to follow after her. I have a hunch that unlike Flic and Minna's familiar journey, Phoebe's would be endlessly surprising.

The former musical duo, which produced some of the biggest hits of the 2000s, is headed to court over accusations of unpaid royalties and ""self-dealing.""


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Pharrell Williams is facing a lawsuit from his former Neptunes partner Chad Hugo, who claims his longtime friend has cut him out of their company and owes him as much as $1 million from an N.E.R.D. album.


	Before Pharrell became a solo superstar, he and Hugo formed a prolific songwriting duo for years, producing massive hits like Nelly's “Hot in Herre,” Snoop Dogg's “Drop It Like It's Hot,” Gwen Stefani's “Hollaback Girl” and Justin Timberlake's “Rock Your Body.” They also formed two-thirds of N.E.R.D., a hip-hop/rock band that enjoyed its own run of hit albums in the 2000s and 2010s.

	But in a strongly-worded lawsuit filed Friday (Jan. 23), Hugo accuses Williams — his friend since their Virginia childhoods — of committing a wide range of legal wrongdoing against his former partner.


	“Williams engaged in self-dealing, concealed material information, and … diverted revenues owed to plaintiff,” writes Hugo's attorney, Brent J. Lehman of the law firm Munck Wilson Mandala. “Such willful, fraudulent, and malicious conduct warrants the imposition of punitive damages.”


	Friday's lawsuit, obtained and first reported by Billboard, isn't the first legal battle between the two collaborators. Back in 2024, Hugo filed another action accusing Pharrell of “fraudulently” seeking sole control over the “Neptunes” name; that dispute remains pending at a federal trademark tribunal.


	But the new case broadens the fight significantly, with Hugo accusing Williams of withholding royalties and refusing to hand over documents that would help Hugo figure out how much he's owed — part of what his lawyers call a “systemic denial” of his rights as a partner. In one passage, Hugo's lawyers say he's potentially owed up to $1 million in damages from the 2017 N.E.R.D. album No One Ever Really Dies alone.


	“Plaintiff has not received his appropriate share of royalties in connection with The Neptunes and N.E.R.D.'s album sales and released music, as well as distributions from touring income, and various merchandising deals,” Lehman writes.


	A spokesperson for Pharrell did not immediately return a request for comment on Friday.


	Hugo and Pharrell were still working together between 2020 and 2022, when The Neptunes produced music for artists like Megan Thee Stallion, Rosalía and A$AP Ferg. As recently as 2022, shortly before the duo were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Hugo told Billboard that he had recently been in the recording studio “with my fellow Neptune, comrade Pharrell Williams.”


	But under the surface, conflict was allegedly brewing. Hugo's lawyers say he made repeated efforts starting in 2021 to get Pharrell to hand over “monthly statements, books and records, and royalty statements” as required by their operating agreement. In August 2021, Hugo's attorneys started sending Williams demand letters seeking financial disclosures, doing so repeatedly over the last four years. But they say he largely ignored them, only offering “limited” and “incomplete” documents.


	“Defendant Williams' persistent failure to provide [financial records] constitutes a breach of the operating agreement,” Hugo's lawyers say. “Plaintiff has been deprived of the transparency necessary to evaluate buyout proposals, confirm the calculation and categorization of distributions owed to him … and assess revenues.”


	Amid that growing tension, Hugo filed his trademark case in March 2024, claiming that Pharrell and his company were improperly trying to unilaterally register trademarks for their shared Neptunes name. As first reported by Billboard, Hugo claimed that their partnership required them to share the name rights: “Applicant has committed fraud in securing the trademarks and acted in bad faith,” he alleged.


	At the time, Pharrell's reps downplayed the dispute, saying they had repeatedly offered to involve Hugo and had always intended both men to “share in ownership” of the name. In a September 2024 interview, however, the star confirmed that he and Hugo were no longer on speaking terms: “I love him, and I always wish him the absolute best, and I'm very grateful for our time together.”


	In the new lawsuit, Hugo's attorneys say the dispute has only continued to grow — and that their client is owed substantial money. They say they've seen no revenue at all since September 2023 from an N.E.R.D. merchandising partnership, for instance, and they claim they're owed “at least $325,000-$575,000” from No One Ever, with “potential damages” over the album “exceeding $750k-$1M.”


	As recently as last month, Hugo's lawyers say, Pharrell's attorneys “promised to produce documents” about the company's finances. But they claim that ultimately “no documents were ever produced” to resolve the situation: “Notably, defendant Williams' counsel admitted having difficulty accessing the documents but acknowledged that such documents exist.”


	In technical legal terms, the lawsuit accuses Williams of breaching his fiduciary duty, seeks an accounting of the royalties for both the Neptunes and N.E.R.D., and asks for a declaratory judgment clarifying their rights under the operating agreement.


	“After years of obfuscation by Pharrell and his team, Mr. Hugo had no choice but to seek substantial compensation and accountability in court,” said Lehman, the producer's attorney, in an emailed statement to Billboard. “We look forward to presenting the evidence and obtaining the full relief the law provides.”

While we're expecting loads of new tracks from the group's upcoming ARIRANG album, these are the super hits we're hoping to hear when the guys hit stadiums around the globe.


													By
												

	Jeff Benjamin



BTS‘ forthcoming Arirang World Tour is arriving as a truly historic live trek for the pop royalty that is the Bangtan Boys — and it requires a monumental setlist to accompany it.


	Originally announced with 79 shows across 34 regions in five continents, the tour has already grown in its initial size with two additional U.S. dates added in both Tampa, Florida, and Stanford, California, as the first tickets went on sale this week. The group will things kick off in Goyang, South Korea, on April 9, 2026, and continue throughout 2027 with additional cities said to soon be announced in Japan, the Middle East and beyond.


	The Arirang World Tour marks BTS' first live concert series since the Permission to Dance on Stage tour that held mini-residencies in Seoul, Los Angeles and Las Vegas in 2021 and 2022 with 22 songs in the main setlist and three songs in the encore. During the period where members handled their individual mandatory military services, BTS members Suga, J-Hope and Jin managed to embark on their own solo tours. Suga embarked on his D-Day Tour across North America and Asia in 2023 before his military enlistment, while J-Hope and Jin both went on their own solo treks post-military service in 2025.


	To make the Arirang World Tour as special as possible, we've crafted our dream setlist that respects BTS' career arc, solo spotlights of the members who weren't able to head out on their solo tours and stadium-sized singalongs with 23 songs in the main set and four in the encore to ensure this is officially the biggest and greatest BTS show to date. 


Album: You Never Walk Alone (2016)


	BTS have spoken about both the excitement as well as the anxiety they're feeling with this long-awaited comeback to the music industry. Beyond the anthemic hip-hop production that opens the song, “Not Today” lets the group come together and make a direct declaration: they are back with a vengeance. Leader RM can shout his opening intro lines like a direct command to ARMY: “All the underdogs in the world: A day may come when we lose/ But it is not today, today we fight!”


	It's a perfect mantra to reintroduce themselves on the stage to anyone who counted them out or thought BTS wouldn't come back stronger than ever. 


Album: Love Yourself: Answer (2018)


	Continuing the rollout of the red carpet, the regal mix of Korean instruments and brass that opens in 2018's “IDOL” extends the epic nature of BTS' stage return. Another track opened by RM, we can imagine him shouting, “You can call me artist/ You can call me idol!” and pausing to give the audience a chance to fully welcome the guys back, standing before them as fully developed artists and idols, before delivering the celebratory track in full.


Album: Wings (2016)


	A crowd-pleaser that keeps the energy and impressive stage performances of the first two songs with one of BTS' early breakout global hits — that's also turning 10 years old this year.


Albums: FACE (2023) / MUSE (2024)


	During the BTS hiatus, fans did get a chance to see Jin, Suga and J-Hope live on their own tours where they brought their solo releases to life. While the remaining four members haven't gotten their chance for solo tours — yet! — we think giving RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook their own solo sections that fit inside BTS' Arirang World Tour is fair and a special way to celebrate what these individuals also accomplished on stage.


	Seamlessly connecting with the darker dance-pop theme set by “Blood, Sweat & Tears,” Jimin taking the spotlight to perform a medley featuring his historic Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Like Crazy,” as well as his 2024 Top 40 pop hit “Who,” will be a nice change of musical pace while still keeping the energy high.


Album: Love Yourself: Tear (2018)


	Bookending Jimin's solo section with two of BTS' darker-but-beloved singles, “Blood, Sweat & Tears” and “Fake Love,” feels the most appropriate as songs where the multifaceted vocalist shines and match his musical aesthetic to make the concert as seamless as possible.


Album: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt.1 (2015)


	“I Need U” comes as the audience is fully settling into the show. The track is a special one to ARMY as BTS' commercial breakthrough single in Korea and was named one of the defining songs of the previous decade by Billboard and the BBC. This song could be more of a celebratory, nostalgic moment rather than one where the boys need to go all-in on the choreography.


Album: Proof (2022)


	One of the new songs off anthology project Proof released after the group's Permission to Dance on Stage tour wrapped, “Run BTS” received only one major live performance at their “Yet to Come” concert in Busan, South Korea, but is wholly deserving of a setlist spot. The track throws back to the guys' earlier, rowdier hip-hop styles while also representing the mature artists BTS are today.


Album: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt.1 (2015)


	While “I Need U” was BTS' commercial breakthrough from 2015 mini album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt.1, its follow-up single “Dope” felt like the track that truly hooked international fans and began BTS' exponential global growth. “Dope” has become a go-to favorite in BTS concerts with the track being the group's most-performed song in concert, according to LiveNation's Setlist.fm. At this point, “Dope” is a must-have.


Albums: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt.2 (2015) / 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013) / O!RUL8,2? (2013) / O!RUL8,2? (2013) / Unreleased (2018)


	Following “Run BTS” and “Dope,” it would be a dream to hear a full-fledged medley of singles and fan-favorite tracks of BTS' most hip-hop-leaning material. From their earliest singles like “N.O” and “We Are Bulletproof Pt.2” to RM, Suga and j-hope's still-unreleased “Ddaeng,” we can imagine huge smiles on the guys' faces as they run through these nostalgic smashes.


Albums: Right Place, Wrong Person (2024) / Indigo (2022)


	It makes stylistic sense to move from a hip-hop medley to RM's solo section, with his multi-genre approach to his solo career able to shift the concert's direction in whatever style he chooses. While the Right Place, Wrong Person single has an upbeat sound that will transition well from the medley, the introspective and melancholy lyrics in “LOST!” nicely connect to another RM solo single like “Wildflower” to draw a true distinction between the RM who leads BTS and the solo artist while still fitting well into the overarching storyline in the setlist.


Album: Map of the Soul: 7 (2020)


	With RM's “Wildflower” setting the sentimental mood, “Black Swan” is the perfect next track as one of BTS' more brooding releases while also standing as one of the group's best stage performances.


Album: Proof (2022)


	While “Black Swan” speaks to the inner questions and worries BTS had about their careers, “Born Singer” serves as a declaration of identity and a belief in oneself. While the song was only officially remastered and released on Proof in 2022, the reinterpretation of J. Cole's “Born Sinner” was first shared on BTS' SoundCloud in 2013 in the days after their official debut on the K-pop scene. The song feels like another comforting reminder to fans that BTS is still the same passionate artists who began this incredible journey nearly 13 years ago.


Albums: Map of the Soul: 7 (2020)/The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016)


	“ON” opened the Permission to Dance on Stage with the epic, militaristic march of the Map of the Soul: 7  single kicking off BTS' biggest live spectacle to date, followed by one of their most famous choreographies with “Burning Up (Fire).” While that run only hit select cities in Los Angeles, Seoul and Las Vegas, bringing a shortened version of “ON” as a lead-in to the blazing “Fire” choreo feels like a way for BTS to honor these two massive performance-driven songs and not feel like they need to outdo or rehash any previous feats. 


Albums: Layover (2023) / Layover (2023) / FRI(END)S (2024)


	After “ON” and “Burning Up (Fire),” the BTS boys — and the audience — will all deserve a little break. That's why it's the right time for V to come on for his solo section, as this will likely require a bit of maneuvering on the stage. As evidenced from the storytelling and stage props he imbedded into past performances of solo songs like “Singularity” during the Love Yourself world tours, Mr. Kim Taehyung ensures the little details take his performances to the next level and we imagine he could make BTS' stadium stages feel like intimate jazz shows to perform Layover standouts like “Slow Dancing” and “Love Me Again.”


	V can continue the intimate vibes while also slightly kicking the energy back up with his 2024 single “FRI(END)S,” fully getting the stadiums worked up by shouting along the massive final choruses.


Albums: Coldplay‘s Music of the Spheres (2021) / The Astronaut (2022) / Map of the Soul: PERSONA (2019)


	The V vibes can be seamlessly transitioned into BTS' spacey Billboard Hot 100 No. 1, “My Universe,” featuring their friends Coldplay, which has a calming yet exhilarating sound that will quickly have audiences around the world shouting along to the affirming chorus.


	And if it's a little awkward for BTS to take the full song on their own without Chris and the gang, we're going to suggest mashing up “My Universe” with a bit of Jin's Coldplay-assisted single “The Astronaut” and another celestial stunner in “Mikrokosmos,” both euphoric songs that BTS can dedicate to the fans for another intimate moment with ARMY.


Albums: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016) / Love Yourself: Answer (2018)


	Throughout BTS' discography, several songs serve as counterparts to previously released tracks. While there is “Boy in Luv” and “Boy With Luv” as well as “N.O” and “ON,” one of the most famous and beloved among fans would be 2018's “I'm Fine,” acting as an answer to “Save Me” from 2016. The latter single came paired with an intense choreography that's another fan-favorite stage performance with “I'm Fine” making its live debut during the Permission to Dance on Stage tour.


	Bringing these two songs together in a new mash-up honors the connectivity of BTS' body of work.


Album: BE (2020)


	At this point of the concert, it's time to really unleash and have some good ole fun, right? “Dynamite” is the crossover, disco-pop smash that uplifted millions through the pandemic and feels like the perfect moment to take things in a lighter direction.


Album: GOLDEN (2023)


	“Dynamite” spotlighting one of BTS' most famous English tracks marks a perfect moment for Jung Kook to deliver his smash crossover singles including the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 “Seven” and excellent soul-pop performance of “Standing Next to You.”


	The two tracks together show his range as a vocalist with “Standing Next to You” delivering the kind of classic stage performance that will impress audiences of all ages. Maybe even Usher can join him on stage at a show and give us a hint of what that Super Bowl Halftime Show performance could have looked like. 


Album: Butter / Permission to Dance (2021)


	With JK already setting the feel-good vibes after ending his solo section with “Standing Next to You,” BTS segueing to “Butter” makes the most sense to keep the audience groove going with this Billboard Hot No. 1 hit.


Album: Love Yourself: Her (2017)


	Let's keep the good vibes going with another crowdpleaser with “DNA,” the group's first song to enter the Billboard Hot 100 and was a key single to help BTS reach new overseas audiences.


Album: Map of the Soul: PERSONA (2019)


	With the concert winding down, “Boy With Luv” is another feel-good superhit that will keep the joyous atmosphere alive. The 2019 Halsey-assisted track is another song that signifies BTS' growth, serving as the self-actualized answer to 2014's razor-edged “Boy in Luv,” and will bring smiles to both the band and the audience.


Albums: Various


	Even before The Eras Tour, BTS was delivering surprise live medleys since 2018's Love Yourself World Tour. While Taylor Swift made each Eras night special with an unexpected mash-up, BTS can continue this tradition by delivering performances of two to four B-sides each night, making sure each ARMY has a unique concert experience and leaving fans wondering which song they'll get on their night. 


	While there will inevitably be some title track singles that don't make the setlist, we'd love for the guys to focus on deep cuts here, especially songs that the group has never performed yet. Can we please get “Louder Than Bombs,” “Paradise,” “Don't Leave Me,” “Heartbeat,” or “Could You Turn Off Your Cell Phone”?


Album: Proof (2022)


	With the concert closing before an inevitable encore, “Yet to Come” is the right song to close the main section of the concert. After the guys went through their biggest hits, they still promise that the “best moment is yet to come,” a message that will leave ARMY tingling as they wait for the lights to come back on for the encore.


Album: Take Two (2023)


	The last single released as BTS fully paused group promotions during their military enlistments, “Take Two” can make its live debut on the Arirang World Tour at the concert with its calming production welcoming the group back to the stage as they sing the perfect-for-an-encore opening lyrics, asking the audience, “Will you stay?” (And of course ARMY will be there)


Album: Love Yourself: Her (2017)


	Once we're fully back with “Take Two,” it's time to get rowdy on stage just one more time. “MIC Drop” is a BTS anthem and will let the guys deliver another upbeat banger to ensure the crowd has spent (nearly) all its energy as the show winds down.


Album: Map of the Soul: 7 (2020)


	While we could have gone with several of BTS' different comfort anthems as the penultimate performance (“Life Goes On” and “Epilogue: Young Forever” would all be fine choices), there is something so moving about Map of the Soul: 7's “We Are Bulletproof : The Eternal” that we feel the show will end on a transcendental note if we heard the song's closing choral chants sung in stadiums around the world. 


	Of course, the sentimental lyrics act as one last specific message to ARMY with the final lyrics, “Yeah, we are not seven with you” showing how much greater BTS is in the presence of their fans.


Album: You Never Walk Alone (2017)


	We had to end things with this perennial hit that has become one of BTS' most special signature songs and that truly ends the concert on a hopeful note that brighter, warmer days are never too far away. Even if concertgoers are sad the show is ending, the “Spring Day” song itself is like a warm hug, leaving the listener comforted. We can imagine flower-petal-like confetti falling throughout “Spring Day,” glittering throughout the stadium, and truly ending the concert in a beautiful, unforgettable moment.

	It's the end of an era! More than a year after brat summer took the world by storm, this winter is all about Charli XCX in Park City, Utah, as she sheds that pop icon persona for an onscreen pivot.


	As the Sundance Institute prepares to uproot its 45-year film festival next year, the 3x Grammy winner headlined a double-feature on Friday at the Eccles Theatre, where the world premieres of Gregg Araki's directorial return, I Want Your Sex, and writer-director Aidan Zamiri's feature debut, The Moment, both took place, both featuring memorable performances from Charli.


	“Right now, unlike the me in [The Moment], I am sort of really wanting brat to stop,” she said, eliciting laughs from the crowd at the mockumentary's debut. “And actually really pivot as far away from it as possible. And that's not because I don't love it, it's just because I think for all of us as artists, you wanna challenge yourself.”

	In I Want Your Sex, Araki's first feature in a decade, Charli struts her comedic chops as Minerva, a character the director described as the “bitchy American girlfriend” of Cooper Hoffman's Elliot, who takes a job as artist Erika Tracy's (Olivia Wilde) sexual muse. Murder and questionable power dynamics ensue on this star-studded sex romp.


	Noting that Charli is actually in three movies at this year's festival, including Cathy Yan's The Gallerist, and that Wilde is also headlining her own double-feature with The Invite, which she starred in and directed, Araki raved on the red carpet, “This is like the Charli XCX, Olivia Sundance, and we're all just happy to be here.”

	Immediately following I Want Your Sex, Charli debuted her onscreen opus in director Aidan Zamiri's The Moment. A meta mockumentary about a rising star embarking on her first arena tour, the film explores Charli's meteoric success through a hyper-pop comedy about the absurd nature of fame and the struggle to maintain her sense of identity and creative freedom.


	“Obviously, this film is about the end of brat summer,” noted Zamiri after the screening. “But hopefully, everyone can in some way find how it relates to them and the terror of letting something go.”


	Fans don't have to look far for the similarities in Charli the character and Charli the real-life pop star, who took a day off from her nonstop brat tour to join Araki's talented young ensemble, which includes Mason Gooding and Chase Sui Wonders, as well as a roster of some familiar Araki collaborators.


	“She came to set right after performing at some stadium. It was incredible, it was so fantastic,” recalled Hoffman of filming with Charli. “And she did this whole long, incredible show, and then showed up and killed it. She plays my girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex with me, and she's hilarious.”


	With The Gallerist making its premiere on Saturday, it's been a busy year for Charli, who in addition to wrapping up her brat tour, delivered standout performances in films like Julia Jackman's 100 Nights of Hero, Pete Ohs' Erupcja and Romain Gavras' Sacrifice. If the reception at Sundance is any indicator, Charli will have no problem adding “movie star” to her extensive resume.


	Charli explained that as an artist, “you wanna totally switch the kind of creative soup you're in and go and live in a different bowl for a while, and just feel enriched by that. And I think that's how I feel about the projects I'm taking on in film. I really just want to work with these incredible directors, like Aidan, Gregg Araki, Cathy Yan, who I feel like I can just live completely different lives with.”

	As Hollywood processes this year's Oscar snubs and surprises, Kirsten Dunst is prepared to write in one overlooked performance.


	Following Thursday's Academy Award nominations announcement, the actress shared a meme from her husband's Bugonia co-star Stavros Halkias in support of Plemons' performance in the Yorgos Lanthimos-helmed film.


	“Me to everyone who didn't nominate Jesse Plemons for best actor tho,” wrote Halkias with a selfie featuring a sticker of a hand holding a gun at the camera.


	Plemons was previously nominated for Best Actor in a Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy at the 83rd Golden Globe Awards earlier this month, but the award ultimately went to Timothée Chalamet for his performance in Marty Supreme.

	











	In 2022, Plemons received his first Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor in The Power of the Dog, the Netflix film that also got Dunst nominated for the first time in the Best Supporting Actress category.

	Sex, money and murder: Gregg Araki knows what people want, and it's been a long time since he last gave it to them, in 2015's racy doomsday cult comedy Kaboom. Premiering at Sundance for the 11th time, Araki used his pulpit there to pay tribute to the late Robert Redford for his foresight in establishing a creative outlet for minorities and outsider artists, a safe space that established him as cinema's punk poet laureate of Generation X. By contrast, I Want Your Sex, in no way connected to the George Michael song of the same name, is his outreach to Generation Z, a campy, ridiculous, raunchy comedy that riffs on the age gap, and wonderful odd-couple chemistry, between his two leads. Imagine if Babygirl had been fun and — assuming you have a high tolerance for smut — this one's for you.

	In some ways, it is Araki's gender-reversed Sunset Boulevard; in the opening scenes, a scantily clad young man named Elliot (Cooper Hoffman) finds his lover Erika (Olivia Wilde) floating upside down, naked, in her pool. Elliot has a bloody nose, a mouth smeared with lipstick and is wearing a frilly pink bra and pants. How did he get there? Araki flashes back a tongue-in-cheek nine-and-a-half weeks to show us, alternating key moments from Elliot's life with deadpan police interrogation scenes, where Elliot is questioned by officers played, with Araki's undeniable casting brilliance, by Margaret Cho and Johnny Knoxville.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Erika, we learn, is a provocative artist whose sexually explicit work lines her gallery, a place staffed by pretentious freaks and fashion casualties who make Elliot stand out a mile with his quite astonishingly style-averse attitude to clothing. By contrast, Erika is a vamp, a woman whose wardrobe encompasses high fashion and BDSM — maybe this is what makes Erika choose him to be her assistant, just as her icy, dominatrix cool appeals to the refreshingly artless Elliot. 

	











	Wilde nails Erika's appeal from her first introduction, a smart, beautiful woman who knows exactly what she's doing (“You know I hate criticism,” she tells her office manager, “especially when it's accurate”). Elliot, meanwhile, is in awe of her rep, telling his best friend Apple (Chase Sui Wonders), in hushed tones, that Erika was rumored to have “f*cked Vincent Gallo at the New York premiere of The Brown Bunny when she was 18,” one of many good jokes aimed at Araki's peers.


	“Do you have a girlfriend?” Erika asks Elliot, knowing that she shouldn't ask, and guaranteeing that she would “never say anything that inappropriate,” directly after saying it. Elliot sees the way this is going and immediately signs up for a strings-free sexual affair in which she never misses a chance to mock and humiliate this zillennial's contemporaries as “whiney, repressed weaklings”. To add to Elliot's woes, he feels his prudish girlfriend Minerva (Charlie XCX, cast amusingly against type), is forcing him to cheat, and her feeble faked orgasms suggest the singer has an untapped talent for comedy.


	The art world is an easy target for satire, but Araki doesn't seem too bothered by that and neither should he, since sexually explicit art has never really gone out of style, and neither has the argument about style over content ever been won — “Contemporary art is a scam, you know that, right?” Erika lectures Elliot, right before she spends $20k on a painting shows the word “F*ck” scrawled in white on a black background. In Araki's film, art isn't something to be taken seriously, and something that's been wonderful to see in his films over the years is the way he takes a similar approach to sexuality, making films that are a broad church in terms of straight, gay and the fluidity in between.


	Though vanilla sex is the bogeyman here, I Want Your Sex does — surprisingly — stand more than a cat in hell's chance of crossing over to discerning straight audiences, especially as Elliot's adventures in S&M take him into increasingly surreal, Candide-like scenarios, like his encounter with a Frenchwoman that Erika sends him to seduce, and the cringe-inducing attempt at a threesome that nails the awkwardness that must often happen when people try to make their fantasies become real life. Forget the ball-gags, the dildos, and the vagina made of bubblegum, I Want Your Sex is surprisingly relatable at its core: Ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with?

	As Charli XCX debuts her hotly-anticipated film The Moment at Sundance Film Festival, the Aidan Zamiri-helmed mockumentary is finally marking the end of an era, more than a year after brat summer. The pic repped something of a Charli XCX double-feature tonight following the Gregg Araki-directed I Want Your Sex at the Eccles Theatre here in Park City, UT.


	Playing a fictionalized version of herself, A24's The Moment follows Charli as a pop star embarking on her first arena tour amid the massive success of her new album, which breeds a monster that the artist can no longer control as she continues to question whether to let the suits milk brat summer for all it's worth or end the party on her terms.“It's all cringe,” she and her team agree early in the film of the ongoing bratmania, which she struggles to let go of in her journey with stardom.Charli delivers a heightened, dynamic performance as a young woman grappling with the absurdity of fame and the loss of her creative freedom, something only protected by her trusted friend and tour creative director Collette (Hailey Gates).Their creative harmony and Charli's mental wellbeing are threatened when her label brings in toxic concert film director Johannes (Alexander Skarsgård), a role that seems custom fit for the Swedish actor, who takes up all the oxygen in the room with an effortless chauvinism.

	Torn between her creative freedom and her global success, Charli (the actress) gives the most powerful performance of her young onscreen career as Charli (the musician), showing off her range with plenty of unhinged comedic winks to the fans, as well as an endearing vulnerability of an artist and human struggling with her identity.A star-studded roster features some ‘It' girls of years gone by, including Rosanna Arquette, Kylie Jenner, Rachel Sennott and Julia Fox. The ensemble also includes Isaac Powell, Rish Shah, Kate Berlant and cameos galore.A time capsule of 2024, that brief moment of optimism in which the world was painted brat green, Charli opted for this meta satire, as opposed to churning out another concert film into the world. What fans got instead of the oversaturated music doc genre the film so deliciously satirizes, is a spiritual sequel to Spice World (1997) as a psychological thriller, and I don't think any of them will complain.Longtime collaborator A.G. Cook provided the music for The Moment, including the recently released singles ‘Dread' and ‘Offscreen', adding an emotional tinge to Charli's already visceral music.Having conceived the idea for The Moment as an outlet for her experience with fame while on her own brat tour, Zamiri and co-writer Bertie Brandes brought Charli's vision to life with a heartfelt peek behind the curtain of one of today's biggest stars.Producers are Charli XCX and David Hinojosa.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Nicola Peltz insisted Victoria Beckham be kept in the dark during wedding ‘s--tshow': lawsuit","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/23/celebrity-news/nicola-peltz-insisted-victoria-beckham-be-kept-in-the-dark-during-wedding-s-tshow-lawsuit/","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 03:33:00 GMT","

After Brooklyn Beckham's disastrous wedding to Nicola Peltz, a lawsuit brought by fired wedding planners exposed the Peltz clan's apparent rift with Victoria Beckham. 

According to documents in the 2023 lawsuit over the model's Florida nuptials in April 2022, the Beckham family had their guest list “fully organized with all contact information fully revised and nearly ready to go,” while the Peltz family list was incomplete and missing addresses. 

“Nicola continued sending text messages in a [group chat] adding and removing certain guests — making the task of creating a comprehensive and complete guest list a moving target,” the docs stated. 

Meanwhile, the Peltz clan — including Nicola's billionaire dad, Nelson, and mom, Claudia — seemed concerned with making sure the Beckhams weren't aware of any issues.

“Both Claudia and Nicola had insisted that Victoria Beckham could not know about any internal mistakes regarding the ongoing planning of her son's wedding, including any errors with the guest list,” the lawsuit read. 

Wedding planners Nicole Braghin and Arianna Grijalba of Plan Design Events (PDE), who were brought into the wedding just six weeks before the event and cut loose nine days later, claimed breach of contract in the countersuit — Nelson claimed in a previous lawsuit that they refused to return a deposit of $159,000. 

Nelson — whom Braghin and Grijalba labeled a “billionaire bully” in the docs — was frustrated enough to threaten to “cancel the wedding,” which he labelled a “s–t show,” they claimed. 

“Claudia begged Nelson not to cancel the wedding because it would ‘destroy Nicola's career,'” the docs claimed. 

Nelson — who alleged in his own lawsuit that the planners offered “no services of value” and “justifiably” wanted a refund, called the countersuit a “good old-fashioned shakedown” in documents of his own. 

The wedding planners asked for “even more money for services that Defendants did not provide,” the docs obtained by Page Six in March 2023 alleged. 

Lawyers for the billionaire also accused the planners of “shamefully” attempting to “falsely portray Nicola in an extremely negative light to entice the media and hopefully pressure Mr. Peltz to dismiss his well-founded claims,” the docs read. 

Braghin told the Daily Mail at the time, “We love what we do and we're good at it” and claimed Nicola texted them, “You're killing it!” a day prior to their firing.

Amid the drama, the couple's previous wedding planner, Preston Bailey, offered a different view of Nicola, whom he called “great,” and her family.

Bailey was hired in April 2021 and resigned on March 1, 2022, telling Page Six at the time that he had “overcommitted.” 

“I couldn't deliver to the quality I was used to,” he said. “I have the best to say about the Peltzes and Nicola. There wasn't any bad blood.” Of the Peltz family, he said, “They are lovely people. These people are important to me.” 

Brooklyn and Nicola ultimately settled the lawsuits in September 2023. “The parties believe that this contract dispute between Nelson Peltz and Plan Design should be resolved on the terms agreed,” Grijalba and Nicole Braghin told People in a statement. 

“As part of the settlement, PDE will make a donation in the name of Nicola and Brooklyn to the CARE Ukraine Crisis Fund.”

“PDE wishes Nicola and Brooklyn Peltz Beckham happiness and a fruitful life together,” the statement concluded, with the outlet reporting that both lawsuits were “dismissed with prejudice.” 

Brooklyn made headlines on Monday when he released a lengthy Instagram statement blasting Victoria and David for allegedly controlling “narratives in the press about our family” and stating that he does not “want to reconcile” with his family. 

He also accused his fashion designer mom of cancelling “making Nicola's [wedding] dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress” and “hijacking” his first dance with his new wife before dancing “very inappropriately on me in front of everyone.”

“I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life,” the aspiring chef added. 

A guest at the nuptials previously told Page Six that the family feud came to a head when Marc Anthony, who performed at the celebration, summoned Brooklyn to dance with Victoria, “the most beautiful woman in the room,” and Nicola was hurt.

They told Page Six that Victoria “got up on stage and wrapped her arms around Brooklyn” and “nuzzled into his neck.” 

“She took that moment from Nicola, that is the God's truth,” they added, noting that the bride “ran out crying.” 

“The Beckhams' side of the room was cheering and the Peltz side was quiet,” they alleged.

A$AP Rocky and Rihanna “spice things up” while raising their three kids by carving out time some alone time.

“You got to spice it up. You got to still date. You got to still be friends. We roll [music] dice. We play cards,” the rapper said during Wednesday's episode of the “Ebro Show.”

“Like, she a cheater,” he quipped. “We be playing crazy eights. I love that girl to death, man. You know, word. We got to keep the funk going cuz if not, what we doing then?”

The couple — who have been dating since 2020 — welcomed their first son, RZA, in May 2022, followed by Riot, in August 2023 and daughter, Rocki, in September 2025.

Rocky and Rihanna, both 37, have made it clear that they prioritize their romance as they have been spotted on several date nights since welcoming their third child. 

The musicians wore matching fur coats for a romantic date night in Paris in November and spotted wearing coordinated leather looks for another date night a few weeks later in Santa Monica.

The loved-up pair even sparked marriage rumors in October when the “Praise the Lord” rapper referred to himself as Rihanna's “husband” in an interview with Perfect Magazine.

“Being a father and a partner and a loving husband in my family is what makes me really, really happy,” he said.

Rocky was asked if he was ready to be a husband in an interview with Elle published in September, to which he replied, “How you know I'm not already a husband?”

Despite, playing coy, he did give more insight into his life at home with the Fenty Beauty founder and their children. 

“We don't talk too much about work, because we deal with that all day, every day,” he explained.

“When you come home, it's about family,” he continued. “It's about your relationship. It's about your household. It ain't about all that other s–t.”

But the couple might have even less alone time as Rihanna hinted that she's ready for baby number four earlier this month.

She left an agreeing comment “Love Island” alum Montana Brown's post where she debated on getting “hot and sexy or get pregnant in 2026.”

“Wait! So I'm not crazy then? Bet!” the nine-time Grammy winner wrote.

Victoria Beckham reportedly “feels betrayed” by her son Brooklyn's shocking accusations against her and her husband, David.

“Victoria feels betrayed because she's done everything she can to make [Brooklyn and his wife, Nicola Peltz] feel welcome and love Nicola like another daughter,” a source told The Mirror in a report published on Saturday.

Victoria has also worked hard to protect Brooklyn from stories in the past that “did not always paint him in the best of lights,” the insider added.

“But she feels it's been thrown back in her face. She would normally do anything to avoid a family fallout, but she thinks they're both being unreasonable.”

A rep for David and Victoria did not immediately respond to Page Six's requests for comment.

Earlier this week, Brooklyn, 26, shook the internet when he took to his Instagram Story to upload a bombshell statement about his ongoing family feud, telling his followers that he does “not want to reconcile with [his] family.”

While giving his list of reasons why he'd rather remain estranged, he accused his parents of trying to “ruin” his relationship with Peltz, 31, “since before [their] wedding” in April 2022.

“Weeks before our big day, my parents repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name, which would have affected me, my wife, and our future children,” Brooklyn claimed.

“They were adamant on me signing before my wedding date because then the terms of the deal would be initiated. My holdout affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since.”

Tensions ultimately rose to a peak just before the wedding, as Victoria, 51, — who reportedly “couldn't stand” Peltz for some time — allegedly “cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour.”

During the wedding, things took a turn for the worse when Victoria allegedly “hijacked” the newlyweds' first dance and proceeded to dance “very inappropriately” on her son, leaving him “uncomfortable” and “humiliated.”

Victoria and David, 50, have not publicly commented on their son's bombshell allegations against them. 

Though, Victoria was said to have been left “completely heartbroken” by her son's request for privacy for his and Nicola's “future family.” 

According to the Mirror, the line was reportedly meant to be seen as a dig at the former Spice Girl who told Vogue in 2024 she was “excited” to potentially become a grandmother.

Brooklyn Beckham has parents David and Victoria Beckham “devastated, worried and concerned” in the wake of his bombshell statement — and fearful of the control they believe his wife's family has over him, Page Six is told. 

The 26-year-old signed an iron-clad pre-nuptial agreement before his 2022 wedding that means he would get “absolutely nothing” from his billionaire heiress wife Nicola Peltz, 31, in the event of a split, multiple sources confirm. 

Their $16 million Beverly Hills home was paid for out of Nicola's trust fund — set up by her investor father Nelson Peltz, who's worth an estimated $1.2 billion — meaning Brooklyn would not be entitled to any share of the property.

“Brooklyn's not entitled to any of Nicola's assets,” a Hollywood source in the know told Page Six. “So the further he gets away from his family, where does that leave him in the wake of any split?

“At this point, the Peltzes are running things,” the Hollywood source alleged, “and you have a family that is devastated, worried and concerned for their son, brother and grandson.”

But the young couple seemed closer than ever as they were caught by paparazzi, hands entwined while walking their dog at sunset in Malibu, Calif., on Wednesday — two days after Brooklyn made the shocking announcement that he wanted nothing to do with his family.

“Brooklyn's not worried about anything,” said a source familiar with the situation. “The Peltzes have treated him like their own son.”

The hot-sauce entrepreneur lashed out at his parents, former soccer star David, 50, and Spice Girl-turned-fashion designer Victoria, 51, in an astonishing six-page diatribe on Instagram, insisting he does not want to reconcile after a year of estrangement and accusing them of “constantly disrespect[ing]” his wife.

It's been a wild week of headlines for the family, after Brooklyn accused his mom of dancing “inappropriately” with her son at his wedding and of leaving Nicola struggling to find a new wedding dress designer “at the 11th hour.”

But as the dust begins to settle, the question remains: What happens now to the scion of one of the world's most tabloid-ready families?

Rumors have abounded for the past year or so that Brooklyn clashed with his parents over a bid to use the Beckham name in his business endeavors.

And indeed, he alleged in his statement that his parents had attempted to “bribe” him into “signing away the rights” to his name.

“They were adamant on me signing before my wedding date because then the terms of the deal would be initiated,” he wrote. “My holdout affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since.”

However, Page Six is told that this is “willful misrepresentation of fact” and that David and Victoria asked their son to sign a document that would have protected his name once David signed a big deal with Authentic Brands Group three years ago. (The company now co-owns the Beckhams' intellectual property.)

They reportedly wanted Brooklyn to sign a waiver that was, in essence, a protective “co-existence” document — meaning he would not be infringing on his own name.

“By this time, he was already in with the Peltzes,” said another source familiar with the matter. “But Brooklyn is working commercially every day and he's effectively been given the waiver [to use his name] anyway. Of course he's never been sued [by Authentic Brands], which proves this is all nonsense.”

It was reported this week that Victoria trademarked all four of her children's names — Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper Beckham — with the UK's Intellectual Property Office, covering branded products like clothing, toys and beauty.

She trademarked Brooklyn's name in 2016, and, Page Six is told, Brooklyn took over the trademark when he turned 18. He also pays to update it annually.

“Brooklyn and his brothers, who are now all over the age of 18, own their trademarks, and Brooklyn manages his with his own team,” said the source. “David and Victoria registered their kids' names as trademarks to protect them for the future.”

But Brooklyn has already faced a legal row over his name — just not because of his parents. Last year, he clashed with the German beer brand Beck's last year when he attempted to launch a burger restaurant called Beck's Buns in the US, as part of his Buster Sauce Inc., Page Six can reveal.

Brooklyn's trademark application requested the use of the name Beck's in the US on everything from sauces and clothing to kitchenware and beers. 

The brewery, formal name Brauerei Beck and Co, lodged an objection with the US Patent and Trademark Office. They also wanted to veto Brooklyn using the name Beck's for other phrases and potential products, including Becks Master Brew.

Brooklyn has since amended his trademark application to remove classifications relating to beer, distilled spirits, wine and mirin (a Japanese liquor), but is pressing ahead with the burger business.

As we previously reported, Brooklyn is close with his father-in-law, Nelson Peltz, the billionaire owner of the burger chain Wendy's, among other companies.

The Beckhams have an estimated fortune of 500 million UK pounds ($678 million), according to the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List.

David's wealth is largely derived from his 26% stake — now valued at around $312 million —  in Inter Miami CF, which has been boosted by the arrival of Lionel Messi. He also has lucrative long-term deals with Adidas, Tudor, and a 10-year partnership with the Qatar tourism board.

Victoria's wealth is driven by her luxury fashion label, Victoria Beckham Ltd, and Victoria Beckham Beauty, which have seen significant growth. The fashion brand is estimated to be worth £375m, with the Beckhams holding a 35% stake.

Although the Beckhams have accumulated a massive fortune, it's dwarfed by the Peltz family's, which is estimated at $1.2 billion.

While the Beckhams live in the UK full-time, David plans to be based in the US this summer for the World Cup, potentially bringing him closer to his estranged son. Sources say he would love to work things out.

On Tuesday, David joined Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan on CNBC's Squawk Box in Davos. During a chat about social media, he said, “Children are allowed to make mistakes. That is how they learn. That is what I try to teach my kids.”

But for now, Brooklyn plans to steer clear from his family.

“The parents did awful stuff to Brooklyn and Nicola and they kept doing it,” a Brooklyn insider insisted. “He just had enough.”

Nicola Peltz and Victoria Beckham had issues with each other prior to the wedding drama cited by Brooklyn in his recent social media rant. 

“They can't stand each other and don't talk,” a source close to the family told Page Six in August 2022, noting that trouble was already “brewing” prior to their April 2022 Florida nuptials. 

“The build-up to the wedding was horrendous,” they added. 

The source further claimed that Peltz, 31, didn't want Victoria “to be any part of the planning, and she wouldn't clue Victoria in on anything. Communication was minimal.”

The insider claimed there had been “non-stop petty drama” that was coming between the aspiring chef, 26, and his parents David, 50, and Victoria Beckham, 51. 

At the time, the source claimed the former soccer star and fashion designer hadn't “spoken to [Brooklyn] for months.” 

Adding fuel to the fire, Brooklyn also shared a sultry cover of British magazine Tatler — dubbing his model wife “The New Mrs. Beckham” for their August 2022 issue.

The insiders hinted that perhaps the “Bates Motel” actress experienced jealousy over the former Spice Girl's various successes, especially as she attempted to emerge from her shadow for her own nuptials. 

Reps for Victoria, Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz did not immediately return Page Six's request for comment on Friday.

The Beckham family feud came to a head on Monday, when the aspiring chef took to Instagram Stories with a six-page rant directed at David and Victoria. 

Among their offenses, he claimed, were cancelling “making Nicola's [wedding] dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress,” and controlling “narratives in the press about our family.” 

Brooklyn also accused his mother of “hijacking” his first dance with Peltz before dancing “very inappropriately on me in front of everyone.”

He added, “I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life.”

A guest at the soirée previously told Page Six that after Marc Anthony, who performed at the wedding, invited “the most beautiful woman in the room” to the stage, Victoria “got up on stage and wrapped her arms around Brooklyn” and “nuzzled into his neck.” 

“She was dancing with him very inappropriately,” they told us, adding, “She took that moment from Nicola, that is the God's truth.”

However, a butler who also attended the nuptials told the Sun on Friday that Nicola — who reportedly was enraged that Victoria was called up as the “most beautiful woman in the room” for the first dance — issued an ultimatum to her new husband.

“After the wedding Nicola was resolute to Brooklyn — you need to choose me or your mother,” the butler claimed. “Nicola is the problem and the reason Brooklyn and his parents don't talk,” he added. 

In any case, Brooklyn appears to be dedicated to supporting his model wife amid the strife. 

“I do not want to reconcile with my family,” he wrote in his headline-making statement. “I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","C'mon, let Sam Raimi finally make a Batman","https://www.avclub.com/sam-raimi-make-a-batman","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 02:27:03 GMT","

It can be weird to think about this, in the wake of the rise, and then the sort of listless, still-pretty-profitable dead man's float of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but superhero movies were once passion projects, of the sort pushed for largely by Hollywood weirdos who'd managed to get hold of some measure of unexpected clout. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies weren't quite as individualistic as, say, Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, but they still showed off both Raimi's passion for the character, and his taste for stylistic flair; even his middling Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, made 20 years later, and from within the well-polished Marvel machine, was able to smuggle some of that old-school Raimi feel into itself at its margins.

All of which leads us to ask a simple question: Dear Hollywood, won't you let Sam Raimi make a Batman?

This plea courtesy of an interview Raimi gave to Movieweb this week, attached to his new thriller Send Help. The Evil Dead mastermind was asked what other superhero movie brands he'd like to tackle, and he was not shy about laying out a wishlist that we can't help but imagine he was hoping might get forwarded to James Gunn's desk over at DC Studios:

I love Batman. I tried to make a Batman film. I couldn't get the rights. I love The Shadow. I also couldn't get the rights to that one. But, um, Superman's always been one of my favorites. Yeah, there's a tremendous amount of DC characters that I love, and it would just take the writers to come up with an original story based on their character, that's true to the character and part of their real universe, not something that disappoints the fans, but something that's based on the fans love of the character and brings out the best moment of those characters and their proper conflicts, or the right challenges for the right hero. If it was a story that had a real journey for that particular individual. Then I'd love to make the movie.

Superman is, of course, pretty busy at the moment, and we're not sure Hollywood is necessarily beating down the door to get another Shadow movie made. But the last time Hollywood passed on a Raimi Bat-pitch, we ended up with the entertaining, but also extremely divisive, Joel Schumacher movies; what's the worst thing that happens this time if you finally let Raimi take a crack at the Dark Knight, James?

Now that the seal has been broken when it comes to established American comedians appearing as contestants on long-running British chaos exposition Taskmaster—courtesy of first Jason Mantzoukas, who kicked the door open last year, and then Kumail Nanjiani, who's about to gingerly step through the wreckage—the panel show's creators are getting a bit more vocal when it comes to dream-casting their series. Specifically, creator Alex Horne and host Greg Davies gave an interview to Parade this week—timed to a current American tour, which has included guest appearances from folks like John Oliver and Seth Meyers—in which they listed some very big names that are on their wishlist for future seasons.

“We've talked about this,” Horne revealed when asked about “dream contestants from America,” noting that his knowledge of the American comedy pool is less detailed than the British, one for obvious reasons. “But I've always said Sarah Silverman or Ali Wong or Conan O'Brien. Mike Birbiglia I really like. We like the idea of having a higher status coming down to our level. So any of these people would be very fun.” Added Davies: “It's fun to see people who normally run the show come onto our show. Like Conan, because he's such a brilliant presence, and he's central to everything he appears on. It would be funny to see him have to stick to the rules. That would be amazing. And obviously, we're huge fans of his.”

Now, do we think there is a universe in which Conan O'Brien subjects himself to the sort of indignities that tend to crop up on Taskmaster, a series in which both lateral thinking and a game willingness to follow through on bad ideas is a key survival skill? Not really—but we would have said the same thing about him filming a cameo for a video game where you play a post-apocalyptic package delivery man, or making a reality show about annoying people in Iceland, so who are we to try to predict that particular, very distinctive mind?

For the curious, Davies and Horne were also un-shy about breaking down the differences between their existing American guests, with Horne noting that Nanjiani differed from Mantzoukas in that “He didn't destroy everything. And he was very polite. Just as funny, but in a very different way. But he felt like he had Hollywood energy when he walked in the room… In the best way. He's just sort of a star.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","5 To Watch: Episodes with made-up holidays","https://www.avclub.com/5-to-watch-tv-episodes-with-made-up-holidays","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 13:04:38 GMT","

In 5 To Watch, five writers from The A.V. Club look at the latest streaming TV arrivals, each making the case for a favored episode. Alternately, they can offer up recommendations inspired by a theme. The reasons for their picks might differ, but they can all agree that each episode is a must-watch. In this installment, they dig into outings with made-up holidays.  

Now that we're well past the holidays—and in that oft-cold stretch between Martin Luther King Jr. Day this month and Groundhog Day and Valentine's Day next—let's turn to the (mostly) made-up celebrations from classic TV comedies to keep us warm and festive. Prepare for a day that “started in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the Irish,” a boozy brunch for girlfriends, the return of Leap Dave Williams, and more onscreen merriment.  



The Simpsons‘ Whacking Day may be rooted in real-life traditions, but no actual town could possibly match the wild-eyed fervor of Springfield (no, not even one in Texas). This season-four episode, proposed by George Meyer and written by John Swartzwelder, is a classic example of the mob mentality that so often grips the town's citizens. Bart's expulsion from Springfield Elementary sparks a newfound interest in learning, which leads him to uncover the real origins of Whacking Day, which was actually “started in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the Irish.” He teams up with Lisa and Barry White to stop the snake-killing orgy, but not before the townspeople have already wreaked moderate levels of destruction. It was far from the only time Springfieldians would get swept up in a moment—the very next episode sees everyone turn on Marge, then unleash somewhat higher levels of destruction—but “Whacking Day” remains one of the show's shrewdest send-ups of going along to get along. The episode also boasts some of the funniest moments in the show's history, including Homer's appeal to Lisa: “Maybe if I'm part of that mob, I can help steer it in wise directions.” [Danette Chavez]



Tucked deep in The Kids In The Hall‘s final stretch of episodes, the Kids pull off what is generally considered anathema to sketch comedy: an ending to one of the show's longest-running and least explicable bits, Bellini. The sight of Hall writer Paul Bellini in a towel was a regular occurrence on the show, providing a button to a sketch in need of an ending. In “Bellini Day,” the Kids bring the runner to its rightful conclusion and make Bellini a Christlike figure. Thousands of years after people stopped believing in God, Bellini Day replaces Christmas in a sketch that captures the non-sequitur, unhurried nature of Bellini. As the future family crowds around the Bellini tree, with the youngest (played by Bruce McCulloch) clamoring for gifts, the father (portrayed by Mark McKinney) teaches him the meaning of Bellini Day by laying out the strange and somehow extremely Bellini-esque traditions, including “caroling disco tunes of Earth” and partaking of Bellini's favorite beverage, buttermilk, in commemoration of the day Bellini was killed by an asteroid. In the end, the family learns the true meaning of Bellini Day by finding beauty in the banal and slow-moving before poking a hologram of the half-naked prophet. [Matt Schimkowitz]



“Stop crying and fight your father.” Those uncheerful words, from a dad (Jerry Stiller's Frank Costanza) to his very adult son (Jason Alexander's George), get at but one key ingredient of Festivus, the holiday the former “created” after becoming fed up with the commercialism of Christmas. Aside from the “feats of strength,” the invention also includes a look back on the disappointments of the year dubbed “the airing of grievances” (which would become the title of Titus Andronicus' debut LP and is introduced by Frank like so: “I got a lotta problems with you people, and now you're going to hear about it!”) and, of course, an aluminum pole. (“It requires no decoration—I find tinsel distracting,” per its founder.) Festivus actually dates back to the mid-1960s and was introduced to the world–or rather, his wife and kids—by the father of Dan O'Keefe, who would go on to write this episode with Barry‘s Alec Berg and The League‘s Jeff Schaffer, with at least one major difference: “The real symbol of the holiday was a clock that my dad put in a bag and nailed to the wall every year,” the scribe, who called the ritual “a sort of a family disgrace,” said during an interview on CNN. “I don't know why; I don't know what it means; he would never tell me. He would always say, ‘That's not for you to know.'” [Tim Lowery] 



It doesn't matter if Galentine's Day was ever a thing in anyone's world before February 11, 2010, because for all intents and purposes, this holiday was invented by Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler). Parks And Recreation's overenthusiastic protagonist established an unforgettable, fun way to celebrate female friendships, slotting February 13 as an ideal day for it because—in her own words—“hos before bros, uteruses before duderuses.” In “Galentine's Day,” Leslie spends time with her closest gal pals, enjoying brunch, booze, and banter. As always, she also gives the most thoughtful gifts. The Michael Schur-penned ep has gone on to spawn real-world celebrations, complete with merch, greeting cards, and whatnot. Dudes may come and go, but as Leslie continues, “Ovaries before brovaries.” [Saloni Gajjar] 



30 Rock obviously can't take credit for inventing the concept of Leap Day—February 29 has been observed since the 1750s, and Modern Family also aired a Leap Day episode in 2012—but it can lay a definite claim to inventing its lore. In short, it's a bonus day that comes every four years, an opportunity to try things or take chances that you may not otherwise. In the season-six episode, 30 Rock imagines a world in which Leap Day is celebrated like St. Patrick's Day or even Christmas, with a color scheme (blue and yellow), traditions, and songs. The installment also christens the gilled Leap Dave Williams as a reluctant, Santa Clause-esque figurehead for the holiday. (Jim Carrey and pseudo-holiday aficionado Andie MacDowell star in the in-universe movie that marathons on the USA Network.) What's more, the day also gives Tracy Jordan an opportunity to feed the homeless before his $50,000 Benihana gift card expires at the end of February and Jack Donaghy one to misinterpret the lesson of A Christmas Carol. So, in many ways, it was a regular day at this office. [Drew Gillis]

Former “American Idol” contestant Nutsa Buzaladze kicks off 2026 with a “New Year, New Me” vibe.

The 28-year-old singer took to Instagram last week to show off her “Beverly Hills glow-up,” crediting celebrity surgeon Dr. Deepak Dugar.

Buzaladze shared a video taken in her car, giving fans a before-and-after look at her transformation.

“Beverly Hills glow-up,” the singer captioned her post. “Closed rhinoplasty with Dr. Dugar @deepakdugarmd and I'm already feeling incredible 4 days post-op. NEW YEAR, NEW ME.”

Dugar is a board-certified surgeon in Beverly Hills, famous for his signature “Scarless Nose” jobs, per The Daily Mail. Some of his celebrity clients include “Vanderpump Rules” alum Dayna Kathan, adult star Mia Khalifa, as well as Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen's daughter, Sami Sheen.

In another post, Buzaladze expressed how happy she is with the results of her nose job. Sharing a close-up selfie, she wrote on her Instagram Stories, “Unbelievable. And this is only after a week [after] my surgery. Can you guys believe it?”

After her full recovery, the “American Idol” alum treated herself to a shopping spree, marking the new chapter of her life.

“This new chapter of my life is starting today, so I decided to celebrate that and go shopping,” she said in a video shared on Thursday, January 22. She also captioned the post with, “Bought my nose some presents.” 

Meanwhile, fans flooded the comments section with reactions to Buzaladze's new look.

One fan wrote, “You were beautiful even before the surgery, and you are beautiful even now.”

Someone added, “You have always been a beauty,” while another chimed in, “Truly a perfect result.”

Buzaladze appeared on “American Idol” Season 21 in 2023. She traveled 17 hours from Dubai to audition, and performed a powerful rendition of “Lady Marmalade.”

Her high-energy performance landed her in the Top 12. Unfortunately, she failed to secure a spot in the Top 10.

Buzaladze's stint on “American Idol” was one of the most memorable ones due to her clash with fellow contestant Carina DeAngelo. She ended up issuing an apology to judge Katy Perry.

Aside from “American Idol,” Buzaladze also represented Georgia at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2024. She also appeared on “Georgia's Got Talent,” “The Voice of Turkey,” and the Georgian version of “Dancing With the Stars.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Anthony Anderson Confirms New Relationship 2 Years After Divorce","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/anthony-anderson-confirms-dating-rocsi-diaz/","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:23:32 GMT","

Anthony Anderson is stepping into a new chapter, and he is no longer dodging questions about it. The actor and comedian has confirmed he is dating again, marking his first public romance since finalizing his divorce in 2023. The reveal came through a mix of red carpet candor, daytime TV pressure and recent public appearances that have fueled speculation about his connection to TV host and radio personality Rocsi Diaz.

After years of keeping his personal life private, Anderson's recent comments signal a clear shift as he acknowledges that he has moved on and is no longer single.

Anderson found himself squirming during a Jan. 23 appearance on “The View,” where the cohosts wasted no time pressing him about his love life. Per TV Insider, the conversation quickly turned personal after the hosts brought up reports that Anderson had been spotted with Diaz at Netflix's Golden Globes afterparty earlier this month.

At first, Anderson leaned into humor, deflecting with jokes and playful discomfort as the questions kept coming. Sunny Hostin, in particular, pushed for clarity, prompting Anderson to eventually offer a carefully worded response. He explained that he and Diaz have been friends for more than 20 years and suggested that their long history is what makes their connection meaningful.

Laughing, Anderson referred to Diaz as his “lady friend,” while making it clear he was not interested in oversharing on live television. “That is my lady friend,” he said, joking that he was not about to get himself in trouble once he left the show. While he stopped short of labeling the relationship outright, the comment marked one of his most direct acknowledgments yet.

Just days earlier, Anderson had already confirmed his relationship status on his own terms. At the premiere for Netflix's “Star Search” on Jan. 21, the 55-year-old actor shut down any talk of being an eligible bachelor. “I'm no longer a bachelor,” he told the outlet, adding that his girlfriend attended the live show with him and that they enjoyed the night together, according to People.

The confirmation comes more than two years after Anderson finalized his divorce from ex-wife Alvina Stewart in late 2023. The former couple, who share two children, Kyra and Nathan, married in 1999 after meeting in college and experienced a long, complicated relationship that included a brief reconciliation before ultimately parting ways.

Earlier this month, TMZ reported that Anderson and Diaz fueled dating rumors when they were photographed leaving Netflix's Golden Globes afterparty together in Beverly Hills. According to TMZ, the pair walked hand in hand outside Wolfgang Puck's Spago, and when asked if they were dating, Anderson described Diaz as “my date for the evening.” He also noted that they have known each other for nearly two decades, dating back to his guest appearances on “106 & Park” during Diaz's time as a host.

While Anderson has not gone into further detail or formally introduced Diaz as his girlfriend, his recent comments make one thing clear. As he put it himself, he is no longer a bachelor.

Yup. Another 13%er always screaming about injustice or 13% crap, hooks up with a non 13%er.  Non 13% women who lay down with these types are garbage.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Bill O'Reilly Hopeful as He Reveals Health Battle: ‘Fight the Good Fight'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/bill-oreilly-health-stomach-issue-hospital/","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 04:53:42 GMT","

Bill O'Reilly, 76, revealed on his personal blog that he's currently dealing with health struggles and is being treated in the hospital. 

As he remains hopeful, the former news anchor expressed his intention to return to his “No Spin News” podcast as soon as he can after having to put the show on pause because of his declining health.

“Hey No Spin Nation. Sorry I am dealing with a malady,” O'Reilly shared on Jan. 20. “We have great doctors so we'll fight the good fight. Doesn't affect my fingers so will update you on me, news cycle, and anything major. Hopefully, back in the saddle shortly.”

The news buff updated his blog on Friday, Jan. 23, with a positive outlook on his condition despite keeping the actual diagnosis confidential.

“Greetings, No Spin Nation! Your tour guide is okay and recovering from some stomach stuff,” he said. “Amazing good wishes have arrived here in New York City, and it's hard to describe my gratitude.”

O'Reilly continued with a quick-witted joke about wanting to escape the hospital, writing, “I am planning a jail break out of the medical facility where there are more than a few Concierge Members.”

Although he has been hospitalized for at least three days, the podcaster explained how he's already writing the blueprint for his next “No Spin News” episode. “Working on the first broadcast back because there's nothing else to do here except watch hysterical local TV news coverage about snow generated by global warming,” he said.

In a Facebook post shared by Newsmax, over 8,000 fans of O'Reilly expressed their support for him in the comments, with many sending their prayers.

“Hoping your health issues resolve quickly. We need to keep hearing your voice!” wrote one.

“Praying for a complete recovery without any complications as you fight the good fight,” said another.

“You can beat this,” a third fan strongly suggested.

O'Reilly launched his podcast in April 2017 after a long run as host of the “O'Reilly Factor.” He also has a large presence in the book industry, with many of his works having become New York Times bestsellers. Some of his bestsellers include “Killing the SS: The Hunt for the Worst War Criminals in History,” “Killing England: The Brutal Struggle for American Independence” and “Confronting Evil: Assessing the Worst of the Worst.”



God Bless you and watch over you. I am a poor retiree trying to help his children with the aftermath of the Bidenomics. I could not understand how the German people could have done what they did in WW2, but now after seeing what is happening in our country it is easier to understand. A friend once told me that America can't be beaten from the outside but could from the inside, only true,real Americans are going to survive. We don't stand alone, one nation under God along with our forefathers!

I've disagreed with you in almost everything, Bill.  But I hold you in deep esteem.  Your voice encompasses a dedication to what you believe, (and I don't) but it is genuine, truthful and in the spirit of democracy.
Here's one of my faves- “So we cannot, cannot wage war for any other reason than to protect the homeland.”
I wish the best of healing to you and  to America.

To become a beloved star on Hallmark Channel, actors know they've got to nail those all-important kissing scenes, but it's not as easy as it looks. In EntertainmentNow's KISS & TELL series, Hallmark's biggest stars give us the scoop on the most memorable on-set smooches of their careers. 

With nearly 20 Hallmark rom-coms and mysteries to her name, Rhiannon Fish has locked lips with lots of Hallmark hunks, from swoonworthy scenes with Tyler Hynes in 2023's “A Picture of Her” to mountainside kisses with Alec Santos in 2025's “A Machu Picchu Proposal.” Though she may technically be an old pro at this, Fish told EntertainmentNow every kiss feels like a high-pressure situation for her — and that the most embarrassing one happened mere months ago. 

Fish, 34, has been acting since she was a kid, beginning with the Australian series “Neighbours” more than two decades ago. Recalling her first onscreen kiss, she told EntertainmentNow she was “terrified.” 

“I was in my teens, and it was for, like, a soap opera in Australia,” she said. “I hadn't even kissed that many boys in real life at that point, maybe two? And it was not that much, I can assure you. So to then go ahead and do it on camera, it was just beyond nerve-wracking.” 

But all these years later, Fish said that kissing scenes are still “always a little bit nerve-wracking, explaining, “You never really know what to expect. And there is a degree of pressure. Like, I know we are making Hallmark movies. We all know what that means, but still, the audience works for that kiss. We're going to drag it out, usually, till the very end. So you want to give them, you know, what they paid for, so to speak.”

Despite many years of kissing Hallmark hunks, Fish told EntertainmentNow that her most nerve-wracking onscreen kiss came mere months ago, while she was filming the 2025 holiday movie “The Christmas Cup” with “When Calls The Heart” star Ben Rosenbaum.

Fish laughed, “I have had directors step in and say, ‘That was a little bit too much kissing, Rhiannon. Let's dial that back.' I'm like, ‘No worries, I've taken the note, thank you. I am mortified that you had to say that, but no worries.'” 

She continued, “So, when Ben and I did our most recent movie together, I'd never had this (happen) before. We did the take, we kissed, and the director came in and was like, ‘Wow, that was like watching two friends being forced to kiss.'” 

Shrinking with embarrassment, she continued, “It was bad! And it's not like you can sort of then workshop it. We just then had to blindly go into the next take and be like, ‘Whatever we did, don't do that again!' So I will be honest with you, that kissing experience was by far the most nerve-wracking I have ever had.” 

Joking that the footage needs to be destroyed, Fish said, “I honestly hope nobody ever sees it! It was obviously terrible.”

One must-have Fish said she always has on hand is Listerine, to ensure that at least her breath isn't embarrassing. But even that has backfired on her, she laughed, admitting, “It's to the point where I've had different people on the set be like, ‘Why can I smell Listerine?' because it's so strong. I'm like, ‘Oh, hi, that's just me!'” 

When Fish and Hynes teamed up for “A Picture of Her” in 2023, she hilariously shared in media interviews that she did not mind one bit having to kiss the Hallmark hunk, who has an army of fans that went wild over those smooches. 

Nearly three years later, Fish said those remain her most memorable Hallmark kisses, adorably telling EntertainmentNow, “I will never shy away from expressing my crush on Tyler Hynes. I get it, I get it, I get it. I see you guys, and I'm with you guys. And in my movie with Tyler, we got to do several kisses, and they were all memorable.” 

Hallmark pushed the envelope a bit with “A Picture of Her,” allowing kisses that were a bit steamier than the norm — a decision that Fish said was intentional for her and Hynes. 

“Tyler often looks at, like, the bigger picture — where can we possibly grow and evolve the network?” she explained. “He doesn't just show up to do what's at hand. He's thinking much bigger picture. We had a discussion, and I believe this was Tyler's call … for the first kiss. He was like, ‘I want you to kiss me.' So often it is the guy, you know, grabbing the girl's face and kissing her, which is lovely, and there will always be a place for that. But I think when you have the opportunity, within Hallmark's guidelines, to do things that may be a little out of the box, I think it is always really fun and exciting for anybody watching.” 

Could fans get to see the duo together again? Fish told EntertainmentNow said she'd just been talking with Hynes that same day about the possibility of another movie, noting, “Obviously I can't say anything, but I know that both he and I are definitely working towards that. I should be so lucky. I would love nothing more than to work with Tyler again.”

 

What do you except, they were dating in real life.  They had plenty of practicing.

This movie is for sure one of my all time favorites and yes it was about the wonderful kissing! WOW!! This girl gets it!!

Purity, impurity, and the laws and rituals designed to manage the boundary between them — these are the cornerstone concerns of the Book of Leviticus, the third book of the Old Testament. The themes are refracted through a crooked prism in “Leviticus,” the Australian writer/director Adrian Chiarella's phenomenally entertaining horror debut that plays like an episode of “Heated Rivalry” ghoulishly crossed with “It Follows.”

The film opens with a menacing overture: A young woman, working late at a public pool, seems to recognize someone rinsing off in the shower, but there's nobody there. “What are you doing here?” she asks the open air. She enters the shower beside the disembodied presence and begins moaning as if in the throes of a sexual encounter. But the sounds turn to screams when she is suddenly struck and slammed to the ground — all by an assailant only she can see.

 








Related Stories ‘Mum, I'm Alien Pregnant' Review: A Sweet Kiwi Gross-Out Comedy Coated in Extra-Terrestrial Goo ‘Public Access' Review: A Serviceable Primer of Free-Speech Television Fails to Capture Its Bizarre Spirit 

From here, the movie pivots to Naim (Joe Bird), an Australian teenager who has just moved to a new suburb. We meet Naim while he's hanging out with a new classmate, Ryan (Stacy Clausen), killing time inside an abandoned mill on the edge of town. In the cavernous, warehouse-like space, the boys turn into physical exhibitionists, showing off for one another by hoisting heavy chunks of scrap metal and flinging them across the ruin. The contest soon gives way to aggression, with the high schoolers shoving each other, then wrestling.

 










But behind the toughness is something more tender. Chiarella is hyper-attuned to the ways that men not only shield emotion through machismo, but also couch affection in physical force. Tussling on the ground of the mill, the boys pause once Ryan has Naim in a pinned position. Ryan grins down, then kisses him. Stunned, Naim pulls away before grabbing Ryan's head to kiss him back.

So begins a tale of ill-fated teenage love complicated by the fact that the boys live in an exceptionally repressed religious community. We soon learn that Naim's grief-stricken single mother (Mia Wasikowska) moved them to the town so they could join its local Christian parish, an almost cultishly conservative group to which Ryan and his family also belong. It's clear that in this insular social world, homosexuality is considered a sin. But as long as the boys can keep their romance private — they even speak about it in code, asking one another if they've ever “been to the mill” before, rather than asking if they've been with other boys — their affair is safe.

The security doesn't last long. Soon, Naim happens upon Ryan alone with the pastor's son (Jeremy Blewitt), hurling stones at one another before collapsing into each other's arms to make out. Dazed and distressed, Naim sprints to the pastor's house, where he impulsively reports what he saw.

 










This is where the movie's horror genre kicks into high gear, with the aggrieved pastor enlisting a deliverance healer to rid his son and Ryan of their demons. At first, the ceremony — performed publicly before the entire parish — seems like a hoax. But as the healer grows graver, invoking notions of lust, desire, and indecency, the boys undergo a kind of exorcism. While Naim and the others watch on in horror, the boys gasp for air and tumble to the floor, writhing as foam bubbles out of their mouths.

You may be able to guess where this is all going — which is to say, directly into “It Follows” terrain. Whoever undergoes the deliverance ceremony is thereafter haunted by a shape-shifting menace invisible to everyone but the person being pursued. But unlike that cinematic predecessor, in which the pursuer took the form of a variety of strangers, here, the stalker invariably appears as the victim's crush. Call it internalized homophobia incarnate.

The remaining scenes draw on familiar teenage horror tropes, with flecks of fresh insight. Horror fans are familiar with the experience of, “I see someone I know, but it's not really them” — it's a primal horror conceit, dovetailing with stories about doppelgängers and changelings, possession and the uncanny familiar more generally. In “Leviticus,” we find the phenomenon of the false loved one, a trope that similarly appears in horror classics like “The Exorcist” and “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” and more recent films like “Us” and “Talk to Me” (the latter of which also stars Bird).

 










“They want us to be scared of each other,” Ryan tells Naim in a rare moment of insight, referring to the Church parishioners' goal of making the lovers distrust one another. For once, both Naim and Ryan have undergone the deliverance ceremony — Naim is subjected to it soon after — neither can know when they're actually seeing one another versus when they're being baited by the violent being. The deliverance healer, in his conservative brutality, has succeeded in making the boys instinctively flee from the person they love and desire the most.

As in many horror films of this type, plot holes start to form. The menace only appears when the victims are “alone” — but how alone are we talking? Does someone in the next room count? How about someone a few meters away? There isn't much consistency to the rule, nor much logic to the fact that bystanders seem to turn a blind eye as the boys are continually brutalized. But by attaching the familiar concepts to queer themes — for instance, suggesting that peers assume that the now-outed gay boys, who periodically show up bruised and bloody, are being targeted by homophobic bullies — the movie grounds the eeriness in real-world affliction.

“Leviticus” is not a perfect horror film; its ending feels abrupt, and some side plots feel unfinished. Wasikowska, doing her best with a thin character, feels particularly overlooked. But the film's moody atmosphere — including a soundtrack full of clanks and bangs — makes it an enjoyably disquieting ride.

 










“Leviticus” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

At this point, filmmaker Beth de Araújo is two for two. Not just in terms of the quality of her films — impeccably crafted fever dreams of very different stripes and horrifyingly similar themes — but in how these films make the viewer feel. 

More concisely: with her “Soft & Quiet” and “Josephine,” de Araújo remains undefeated when it comes to making stunning films that I will both heartily recommend and never, ever watch again.

The word that comes to mind when watching a de Araújo feature is heartsick. That applies to the feeling bestowed on both the audience and her characters (the good guys and the bad guys). While her first film, the unrelenting “Soft & Quiet,” was cleverly designed to appear as if it was shot in a single real-time take, her sophomore feature is more about the steady accumulation of dread. The heroines of “Soft & Quiet” recognize what they are dealing with almost immediately (the force of the evil that is bent on destroying them is what's surprises most), but the star at the center of “Josephine” is not just wounded by the sickness that suddenly infiltrates her young life, but her complete lack of understanding about what is happening to her and why.

In both films, it's not just bad deeds that upends everyday lives, it's real evil, actual monsters, perversions that don't only show up in a movie screen. That's true terror.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Based loosely on an experience de Araújo, who both wrote and directed the film, experienced as a child, “Josephine” initially lulls us into a false sense of safety. It's early morning in San Francisco, and fledgling soccer star Josephine (Mason Reeves, riveting in her first role) is getting ready for a run with her devoted dad Damien (Channing Tatum, bringing incredible girl-dad energy to the role). It's something the pair do every Sunday morning: get up early to watch Premier League football, run through a woodsy neighboring park, and kick the ball around. 

For her second film, de Araújo leans less on clever camera tricks, though she and cinematographer Greta Zozula occasionally put us in Josephine's own perspective, shooting as if we are looking through the eight-year-old's eyes. As with “Soft & Quiet,” the gimmick works, grounding us in Josephine's world and immersing us, if briefly, in what the world looks like from her vantage. Jo-Jo, as her dad calls her, is plucky and fun and filled with energy, so when she briefly zips ahead of her dad while on their run through Golden Gate Park, it just seems like everyday high-jinks.

But when the path forks (about as heavy-handed a metaphor as de Araújo will ever employ), Josephine goes to the left, while Damien goes to the right. What she finds there will forever alter the course of her life, and set “Josephine” off on a heart-wrenching journey with no easy answers. Curious and watchful, Josephine ducks behind a tree when she sees a woman (Syra McCarthy) running into a public bathroom at the bottom of a scrubby hill, and she sinks even further down when a young man (a bone-chilling Philip Ettinger) follows the unknown woman into the tiny building.

 










De Araújo's approach to portraying on-screen violence only furthers that heartsick feeling: straightforward, unsparing, and absolutely devoid of any possibility of being compared to “torture porn.” What we see, what Josephine sees, is something no person should ever witness or experience. And that's the root of the film's power: how do we talk about things that we should not have words for? 

When Damien arrives on the scene, it kicks off what will become one of Tatum's best performances yet, a deep-feeling and heartbreaking exploration of layers of emotional unease. Damien does everything “right,” ensuring both Josephine and the woman are safe, chasing after the assailant, calling the cops, a neat little checklist of “how to handle an emergency.” And yet, the damage has already been done. There will be more to come.

Even when Josephine begins to seek out answers to what she's seen (snatching her mom's phone to search “raip,” reeling at what she discovers), it's impossible to make sense of everything. There are things to fear she never even know existed, and the deep-seated powerlessness that overtakes her causes her to act out in chilling and increasingly volatile ways. Her parents' reactions don't help: her exceedingly calm mother Claire (Gemma Chan, thrilling as a character just barely holding it together) wants her to see a therapist now, her more action-oriented dad is eager to put her into self-defense classes. The mixed messages both give off (to say nothing of their own barely concealed terror) do little to help Josephine, who soon becomes someone almost entirely different than the care-free kid she just was.

 










She also picks up a new friend: Ettinger begins to appear to her, a literal haunting figure, never saying a word, yet barging into nearly every moment of Josephine's already upended life. It's the sort of choice another filmmaker fight fill tricksy or silly, but that de Araújo delivers with the maximum of impact. And that we, like Josephine and only Josephine, can see him only furthers our immersion into her world. It almost goes beyond empathy.

Josephine's steadily unfolding breakdown is only compounded by the arrival of yet another situation no eight-year-old should ever have to encounter: handling the messy investigation of the crime itself. How she might help (or not) drives one more wedge between Josephine and her parents, who all have a different take on what the “right” thing to do is.

If these questions sound heady and heavy, they are, but de Araújo's masterful ability to interrogate tension on every level keeps the film clipping along, each turn both a surprise and an inevitability. The monsters are here, they are real, and they're coming.

“Josephine” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Konami's “Silent Hill 2” is an exceptional, even historic work of horror media. But you wouldn't know that judging by the video game's baffling new film adaptation from Cineverse and Iconic Events. A nasty, claustrophobic display of staggering creative ineptitude — a dark fantasy packed with as many incomplete ideas as it has tired genre cliches — “Return to Silent Hill” squanders the rare opportunity to translate one of PlayStation's most psychologically sophisticated worlds into box-office fuel. 

Directed by Christophe Gans, this ill-conceived reboot marks the French filmmaker's return to the beloved horror franchise nearly two decades after adapting the original “Silent Hill” game with mixed results in 2006. Trapped in the same artistic era but chasing even worse market instincts now, the result is a deeper failure that reflects industry regression on several levels. Gans and his distributors demonstrate little understanding of what made the source material endure (“Silent Hill 2” was popular enough to inspire an acclaimed remake that just hit consoles in 2024), while simultaneously failing to speak the basic language of cinema that moviegoers who don't know this IP might have received better.

Collapsing under the weight of its own confusion, “Return to Silent Hill” is still perversely fascinating to watch at points. Gans' long-gestating comeback manifests as a relic that's less an artifact of the gruesome Konami franchise itself than it is a random cultural scrap, ripped from a time when Hollywood mistook aesthetic fidelity and blind aggrandizement for understanding video games and their audience. 

 










Here, the director (who has not helmed a feature film of any kind since 2014) eagerly embraces the foggy surrealism that once made “Silent Hill” feel so interactive and immersive. At the same time, Gans discards the psychological and spatial logic that gave meaning to the original telling's dream-like sense of disorientation. What remains is a hollow exercise in subculture recognition and revival: a melodramatic maze that swaps exhausting exposition for emotional resonance and familiar iconography for real fear. 

Where the original video games allowed players to drift uneasily between reality and delusion, “Return to Silent Hill” aggressively literalizes the tumultuous inner world of hero James Sunderland (Jeremy Irvine). The film opens not on a grieving widower inexplicably wandering into an abandoned town that evoke a long-lost memory, but with jarring flashbacks that introduce the ethereal, deceased Mary Crane (Hannah Emily Anderson) through a slew of ill-fitting dramatic beats that play like gameplay cutscenes you'd rather watch at twice the speed on Twitch or YouTube.

Visually fragmented and structurally superfluous, those interstitial moments over-explain the couple's tragic origin and demise, often in the same breath. Rather than trusting viewers to sit inside the ambiguity that made the “Silent Hill” games addictive in the first place, Gans constructs a clumsy heist-adjacent saga that feels like a half-baked apology for the trouble. Snapping backward and forward in time, piling muddy lore and shaky logistics on top of poorly established, even insincere stakes, this maddening saga is paradoxically overconfident and underdeveloped — lacking mystery and momentum.

 










That flattening effect extends to Silent Hill as a recognizable location, too. In the games, the ghost town operates as an ever-mutating mindspace. It's responsive, symbolic, and deeply personal for the unlucky souls who are stranded there. But “Return to Silent Hill” presents a sometimes-fixed environment that's governed by vague supernatural rules and loud, complex mythology. Essential puzzle pieces become thoughtless set ornaments in the movie, and the occult themes and clues that made the moral unease of “Silent Hill 2” a worthwhile meditation for gamers are reduced to incoherent messy gestures in theaters. 

Plot holes abound not because the film's narrative is so meticulous as to be opaque, but because consequences barely exist in this flummoxing, lawless script (co-written by Gans, Sandra Vo-Anh, and Will Schneider). Violence occurs when violent acts are expected, and monsters arrive because they must. But struggling to maintain the pulse that Gans had a better handle on years ago, “Return to Silent Hill” loses the passion that made the director and his earlier characters worthy of so much empathy. 

Rather than beginning as an ordinary man whose traumatic repression curdles into lived horror, the new film introduces James as a cartoonishly detached widower. He's the walking outline of a washed-up, featureless, drunk background character — delivering a one-note performance that's a remarkable let-down coming from the actor once hand-picked by Steven Spielberg for “War Horse.” As an especially wooden James, Irvine moves through Silent Hill not as a victim unraveling but as an irritated participant weathering a string of weird, disjointed trials. James' repeated cries, calling Mary's name into the desolate landscape, land like an inhuman malfunction and distort this abstraction of grief even further. 

 










The creatures' execution fares no better. Pyramid Head, a leather-wearing torturer and arguably the series' most popular image, is inexplicably stripped of his built-in tension through congested staging that makes the villain appear mammoth but oddly insecure. Gans could have allowed the hulking, evil character to register as an oppressive, scene-stealing presence, but opts to force Pyramid Head into crowded frames with other monsters who, even at their best designed, frequently detract from the paltry terror and register as annoying visual noise. Even the infamous “Silent Hill” nurses suffer that fate, rushed through the action in a swarm that resembles the insects plastering the rest of this too-busy film. 

Afraid to stew in the authenticity of his own self-made nightmare, Gans can't conjure dread by reanimating disconnected details. Yes, some filmmakers could get by using less emotion and showing more loyalty to the source material. But vexing, fan-favorite character Maria (also Hannah Emily Anderson) underscores the tonal divide that makes “Return to Silent Hill” feel like truly bad zombified art. With Maria rocking a dated, pink skirt and a brutally dumb butterfly tattoo, the definitive “Silent Hill” cool girl is presented as not just an aughts native but damning evidence the entire series lacks taste. 

 










Visibly out-of-place against an otherwise muted color palette, Maria's original character design from 2001 was subtly recontextualized for the video game remake two years ago. But in “Return to Silent Hill,” she arrives as a total anachronism — seemingly freed from the confines of the off-grid, anime-forward  costuming hellscape she and Blumhouse's Terminator-inspired “M3GAN 2.0” must have come from. Maria's scenes ultimately provoke laughter, not discomfort, and her arc devolves into accidental self-parody. The same can be said of the agitated and puke-covered Eddie (Pearse Egan), who more than any other “Silent Hill 2” victim resurrected for this atrocious reboot acts like he was better off dead. 

Gans' handling of ambience, once an obvious strength, has eroded as well. “Return to Silent Hill” is full of needless digital debris and the impact of all that CGI is as empty as any brainless superhero movie. Practical effects are scarce, and the game's notorious array of Cronenberg-like antagonists have been mostly drained of their trademark physicality. Too often, set pieces and characters that should be crushing look like clutter, and even the sound design betrays a core misunderstanding of how horror movies fundamentally work. Japanese composer Akira Yamaoka's iconic score returns in fragments, but it's deprived of the purposeful repetition that made it a mental anchor in the games. Silence, which could salvage entire sequences of the movie, is rarely allowed to exist — let alone take full hold of the viewer.

 










This shortcoming of craft from Gans feels predictable looking at his limited track record as a director. But it feeds into a larger failure for video game adaptations across film and TV. “Return to Silent Hill” seems unsure whether it's a clever, trauma-focused, prestige horror movie — or a goofy, otherworldly theater experience that's intentionally unintelligible. What remains is an incongruously passive and intense ride that feels eerily algorithmic throughout. Kicking off 2026, the release's timing only stands to sharpen fan disappointment. Horror thrives when filmmakers commit to clarity of purpose, whether through originality (see “Weapons”) or confident reinvention (“28 Years Later: The Bone Temple”). Even crowd-pleasing adaptations like “Five Nights at Freddy's” succeed by understanding their niche audiences and leaning into ultra-specific tones. “Return to Silent Hill” does neither and ends up looking like slop. 

Cineverse's decision to quietly release the reboot with limited promotional fanfare suggests an awareness of the movie's flaws — but also a failure of stewardship. This was a chance to sell movie tickets to adult gamers who earnestly appreciate a smart horror universe, and the miscalculation that instead gave us a project we're better off forgetting was avoidable, theoretically. Even still, Gans appears to have made the same type of film he would have 20 years ago, preserving the shape of “Silent Hill” before brutally stripping away the relevance another filmmaker might have been able to do justice.

 










In the long view, “Return to Silent Hill” is unlikely to earn the same generous reconsideration from gamers as Gans' far more lovable 2006 film. Instead, this reboot might be misremembered as a direct-to-video curio — or rediscovered as a bad cult object destined to give some idiot cinephile alcohol poisoning. (If you're ever streaming this at home, responsibly take a drink whenever James says, “What?” or “WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?!“) For now, it's a cautionary tale: chilling proof that borrowing legendary video game symbolism without comparable skill remains the surest way to alienate a fanbase, on or off the console.

From Cineverse and Iconic Events, “Return to Silent Hill” is now in theaters.

More than any other film that comes to mind, Rafael Manuel's “Filipiñana” taps into something that I've always found inherently sinister about golf courses: Sprawling gardens of solipsism that invite players to compete against themselves (and offer masters of the universe an ideal environment to affirm their status as they broker deals with each other between holes), they're so elegantly imposed upon the land that it's easy to forget that something else was ever there in the first place. The process evokes an uncanny kind of double terraformation — 150 acres of earth mulched into a more peaceful and better-manicured version of itself where people can forget how weird it is to see random sandpits and perfect circles of grass.

Obliviating the past is always a happy byproduct of gentrification, but with golf courses that always seems to be a more deliberate part of the agenda. It's no wonder Americans love them so much, or that we've left them behind as a parting gift for some of the countries we've colonized. Not “here's something to remember us by” so much as “here's something to help you forget what it was like before we got there.” 

 










I don't know how many golf courses there were in the Philippines when America relinquished control over it in 1946, but today there are between 30 and 40 in the vicinity of Manila alone. One of them, the Luisita Golf Course and Country Club, was built over a former sugar plantation where 14 striking workers were massacred in 2004. Manuel is vague about the history of the fictional Alabang Country Club where his languidly unnerving “Filipiñana” takes place (though the backstory of club president Dr. Palanca does eventually snap into focus), but the director shoots the place with a Haneke-like remove that makes every member, caddie, and Chinese tourist feel like they're conspiring to bury an awful secret of some kind. 

The only potential exception is 17-year-old Isabel (Jorrybell Agoto), who's recently moved to the big city from the northern region of Ilokos and found a job as Alabang's newest tee girl. I feel like most people wouldn't be comfortable playing at a place where underpaid teenage girls — dressed like flight attendants in PanAm-inspired turquoise uniforms — are forced to sit inches away from their backswing between strokes, but the patriarchal culture at Dr. Palanca's takes pleasure in the many different ways that golf allows the rich to lord over the working class. The members don't care about the game (most of them cheat without thinking), but they love that it requires so much labor for them to enjoy. They love that it allows them to make sport of their country's enduringly colonialist spirit. 

 










The sly and needling “Filipiñana” invites us to see Alabang from several different points of view, if only so that we can feel them all sludging together under the brutal Manilan heat. We enter the club as a group of disembodied foreign tourists, bemused by the band of blind musicians who welcome every new guests, and the rhythmic way that everyone on the driving range swings their clubs in perfect sync (Manuel cites Jacques Tati as a major influence, but the comic interludes have a satirical lightness more reminiscent of “L.A. Story” than “Playtime”). We also experience it through the eyes of a privileged, light-skinned, and unyieldingly skeptical expat named Clara (Carmen Castellanos), whose fatcat uncle is desperate for her to move back from New York. She talks to the caddies with respect, and is clearly repulsed by everything the club represents, but can't quite bring herself to voice her concerns. 

And then there's young Isabel, the closest thing we have to a protagonist, who's a bit more determined to get to the root of her disquiet. More composed than Lucrecia Martel's “La Ciénaga” but similarly determined to weaponize its languidness, Manuel's narcotized film spends the brunt of its time following the not so naive Ilokan girl as she watches Alabang sweat out its sins. She pokes at the mangos that fall on the course, spies on Dr. Palanca as he canoodles with his personal caddie in the shade, and stares at the imported pine trees that are planted around the fairways. Every time one of them dies, another is simply planted where it stood; the golf club doesn't have a past, and if not for its heat, it wouldn't have a sense of place either, as Filipiñana slyly positions globalism as an act of forgetting unto itself. (One final but unavoidable point of reference: the work of Jia Zhangke, who joined this movie as an executive producer in the weeks before its Sundance premiere.)

 










Eventually, Isabel is tasked with returning a misplaced golf club to Dr. Palanca, which spurs her closer into the belly of the beast, and closer to the source of her nagging unrest. Her quest isn't slow so much as thoroughly narcotized, as Manuel is less interested in generating drama or suspense than he is in crystallizing the air of inaction that allows Alabang to be such a lucid — and lethargic — display of colonial torpor at work. Every 4:3 shot is framed to maximize the social verticality of the club, and every sequence is edited to evoke the indolent energy of a hot car on a hot summer's day. No one has the lifeforce required to fight back against the structural violence that keeps this place humming. No one has the fire left over to tell off the pervy receptionist, or to complain when they get hit in the face by a ball from the driving range, or to nominate someone besides Dr. Palanca in the club's upcoming election. Everyone at the club chooses to be as blind as its band of musicians. 

In that light, the fact that Manuel's satire operates with all the subtlety of a Ruben Östlund film could be argued as more of a feature than a bug, as “Filipiñana” takes pains to leverage the obviousness of its scenario against the inaction that it inspires. As viewers, however, that friction isn't quite enough to sustain our attention, and it isn't until the climactic scene that Isabel's story distills a sense of urgency from the nebulous atmosphere that surrounds it — that the political finally assumes personal weight. It's too little too late for a film that internalizes its characters' struggle to speak up for the past, but “Filipiñana” at least saves its finest stroke for last, as the most crucial moments of its story unfold while the closing credits blithely scroll by, the final moments of Manuel's feature debut acutely subverting the grammar of Western cinema to literalize Isabel's relationship to her own erasure. 

 










“Filipiñana” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

With a title like “Mum, I'm Alien Pregnant,” subtlety was never an option. In fact, given its title, it's surprising that there are any moments of sweetness or real human connection in this gross-out body horror-comedy (because what else could a movie called “Mum, I'm Alien Pregnant” be?). But they are there, almost drowning in a flood of disturbingly colored sexual fluids, jiggly alien fetal goop, and frothy vomit the color of a Frost Blue Gatorade. 

The debut feature from New Zealand filmmaking duo Thunderlips (a.k.a. Sean Wallace and Jordan Mark Windsor) is part of a tradition of horror films fixated on the grotesque transformative aspects of pregnancy. This includes classics like “Alien” and “The Brood,” although the movie that “Mum, I'm Alien Pregnant” resembles most is the 1983 Hong Kong exploitation film “Seeding of a Ghost,” in which an entire extended family is terrorized by the tentacled creature that literally explodes from a pregnant woman's womb.

“Mum, I'm Alien Pregnant” lightly pokes at the concepts of consent and bodily autonomy, both through the method by which the titular pregnancy is achieved — alien sperm is much more powerful than its human equivalent — and the frustrating road blocks Mary (Hannah Lynch) faces in trying to get this thing out of her already. Half-alien baby daddy Boo (Arlo Green) isn't exempt from medical malpractice either, as demonstrated by the grossly overbearing treatment he receives when he arrives at the hospital to corroborate Mary's story.

 










These themes are played with the same level of seriousness as the rest of the film — which is to say, little to none. But the comedy is knowing enough not to come across as offensive. (A joke about weight limits on morning-after pills, for example, is a credit to the film's male writers and directors, two very nice-sounding boys who say that the film was inspired by watching their female partners give birth.) Most of the time, however, it's just juvenile, with a dash of the dry, self-deprecating wit that Kiwi comedy is known for. 

One phrase we get to hear a lot in that charming New Zealand accent is “weird penis,” as Boo's unusual genitals are responsible for this mess. As the story begins, Mary and Boo are neighbors, unemployed millennial layabouts who rarely leave their rooms. Dressed in dirty sweats and basketball shorts, they're embarrassments to their single mothers Cynthia (Yvette Parsons) and Ann (Jackie Van Beek), who are equal parts devoted and desperate for their kids to grow up. 

One day during a venting session, Ann lets slip that Boo is the product of an alien abduction, and has certain “deformities” that make it impossible for him to date. The oversharing Cynthia immediately passes this information on to her daughter, leading to a meet-cute in the laundry room that quickly escalates into Mary becoming, well, alien pregnant. What Mary's actually doing on her phone all day and night is watching tentacle porn, and the prospect of seeing an exotic member in real life is too exciting to pass up, even if things are moving way too fast. Like, “conception to birth within the span of a few days” fast. 

 










Over the course of the film, viewers get a good look at Boo's “weird penis,” which resembles a vaginal seed pod positioned above a pair of radishes with sperm tails. A more tasteful and/or lower-budgeted project might have made viewers use their imaginations, but “Mum, I'm Alien Pregnant” is well-funded enough to have key anatomical pieces fabricated out of silicone. These imaginative prosthetics also include the adorable alien baby itself, as well as a gigantic glowing “birthing pod” topped with orange eggs like extraterrestrial salmon roe. These stand out amid the otherwise adequate effects, which simply get the spurting, spewing job done. 

Disappointingly, the alien elements don't reach full Screaming Mad George surrealism until the end of the movie, relying a bit too much on blue goo and screaming along the way. Of course, any amount of blue goo and screaming will be too much for many viewers, and only those who are thoroughly inoculated to outrageousness will be able to pick up on nuances in the film's tone. Pay attention, however, and the connection between Mary and Boo becomes more tender as their dilemma deepens, as does the relationship between Mary and her well-meaning, if totally embarrassing, mom. 

The film's working-class setting and thrift-shop costuming are also endearing, particularly when it comes to the character of Cynthia. Costume designer Lissy Turner drapes Parsons in flowy layers and embroidered velvet, conveying everything the audience needs to know about this woman and her kooky, open-minded beliefs. Cynthia wants Mary to keep the baby, but respects her daughter's decision; Lynch's determined performance is an asset here, as Mary makes clear that, no matter how sticky or sweaty or swollen she gets, no one is going to force her to raise an alien infant against her will. 

 










It all builds to a snorter of a punchline that isn't particularly deep, but is satisfying. At the end, all that's left is a question: Is it worse to be alien pregnant, or the regular human kind?

The title read like a joke: How could the Durutti Column return if they were never here? Only plugged-in fans of the Manchester scene or the British music press might have remembered the band's initial incarnation, and even then they might have needed their memory jogged. But what scanned like sardonic pomposity was actually a reflection of the regard in which the Duruttis were held by their label. From the very start, Factory intended the Durutti Column to be load-bearing. The band was assembled by label co-founders Alan Erasmus and Tony Wilson, who envisioned the Duruttis as a sort of psychedelic post-punk act: their own world-historical rock group in the mold of Malcolm McLaren's Sex Pistols or Andy Warhol's Velvets. The Durutti Column led the label's first showcase in May 1978. They were slotted after Joy Division on the label's first release, 1979's A Factory Sample. And after Joy Division's debut Unknown Pleasures inflamed the UK music press, it was the Durutti Column who were tasked with making Factory's second-ever LP. That the Durutti Column no longer existed was only a minor complication.

They hadn't survived their first recording session. Wilson had sacked their singer and replaced him with an aspiring actor who turned up in full punk gear. This new singer recited turgid poetry over his new bandmates' compositions, which erred towards brittle reggae and boogie. The whole mess was dutifully tracked by a contracted producer named Martin “Zero” Hannett. Three Duruttis quit: In the Factory Sample packaging, the departing members were credited alongside their end dates, “as if victims of a purge,” noted Factory biographer James Nice. The only original member left was lead guitarist Vini Reilly. He and the actor played a few live dates to excoriating reviews; disillusioned, Reilly quit. In poor mental and physical health, he broke off contact with Factory, moved into his girlfriend's house, and started working the late shift at a gas station.

One day, Tony Wilson dropped by. Though the Durutti Column had been a disaster, Wilson was fascinated by the guitarist, who admired punk's willfulness even though his own musical taste tended toward jazz, blues, and the classical tradition. Wilson persuaded Reilly to return to the studio; from then on, the Durutti Column would be Vini's alone. Still, Wilson remained the mastermind: He sent Reilly back to Hannett, newly celebrated for his transformative work on Unknown Pleasures. But Hannett no longer seemed interested in playing the auteur, largely ignoring Reilly to tinker with drum machines instead. After a couple days of parallel play, Reilly pulled out of the project. He was floored when Factory sent him a test pressing: The label scraped together enough material for an album, and they would issue it with as much savvy as anything else in their burgeoning catalog.

But nothing else in the catalog sounded like The Return of the Durutti Column, recently reissued with a slew of studio and home demos, live performances, and recordings from Vini's pre-Durutti years. In a modernist era of abrasion and velocity—the now and the next, chasing each other at warp speed—Reilly offered a work of radical non-provocation. The dominant sound is his meditative fingerpicking: rippling and crystalline, like a river in winter. No poetry this time, not even singing. “I don't mind stuff being rubbish—all my albums are rubbish—but at least they're my rubbish,” Reilly said in 2008. “But the Factory Sample wasn't even me.” Return, however, was the ideal introduction to Reilly: a selection of flow-state guitar compositions that sounds perfectly centered, in part because it feels equally removed from everything happening around it. Compared to his Mancunian peers, whose output conjured images of decaying industrial plants and mutant discos, this new Durutti Column suggested the domestic.

That's not to say that Return of the Durutti Column is a purely homey listen, though it frequently is. There are two songs named for girlfriends, and one dedicated to his father. The very first sound on the album is Hannett's synthesized bird tweets, and while Reilly makes liberal use of delay, the effect is cozy rather than cavernous. On the tracks without accompaniment—the richly melodic “Beginning,” the aptly titled “Sketch for Winter”—he sounds like he's tracing ice castles on a frosty windowpane. A different set of hands might have turned these compositions into exercises: maybe a post-punk gloss on ECM austerity, or Windham Hill sentimentality. But Reilly's stores of technical, stylistic, and emotional dexterity made for a document that was as beautiful as it was cerebral.

Return's spare arrangements and short runtime (a tick over a half-hour) belie how much ground it covers. Even in his stillest moments, Reilly hums with the restlessness of a jazz explorer. The plucked chime that opens “Katherine” suggests a pastoral Popol Vuh, an idea he carefully draws out until—with the deceptive ease of a magician shuffling a deck—he drops one hand to a slow blues crawl, while the other digs out a high-velocity, surprisingly funky gutbucket solo. A brief proggy passage shuttles him back to the beginning.

“Katherine” is followed by the brilliant “Conduct,” which is the closest the Durutti Column gets here to post-punk's spirit of grandiose despair. Initially, everything's daybreak: For two minutes, Reilly homes in on a three-note theme so sweet you can almost hear Hannett's birdies again. Then he's knocked back by a cymbal wash from Toby Tomanov (the drummer in Reilly's first band, the Nosebleeds, and later the drummer for Screamadelica-era Primal Scream). The temperature plunges; Reilly's trills harden into an Old World dirge. When the intro re-emerges, it sounds hardened by the experience: The trip back has become a hero's journey. Tomanov appears on two other tracks, both jazzy workouts. “Untitled” is a post-punk thwack at “Take Five,” while “Jazz” sees Reilly—whose life was changed as a child after acquiring an LP by the Brazilian guitar duo Los Indios Tabajaras—incorporate some picado into his soloing.

As pleasurable as it is to hear Reilly craft industrial-grade fusion with a human drummer, Hannett's rhythmic contributions loom larger in Return's legend. On Unknown Pleasures, the producer had taken Joy Division's dense goth-punk sound into a frozen field and detonated it. With this new Durutti incarnation offering so much space, Hannett was content to work the edges. His programming on “Katherine” is an almost subliminal scratch: the sound of socks on carpet. On “Requiem for My Father”—a gorgeous spiraling galaxy of fluid fingerpicking and flamenco accents—the producer adds a four-on-the-floor thump that purrs like an old cat. Given more time and material, it's quite possible that Zero would have left a bigger stamp on things. As it stands, his modest instrumental contributions ground Reilly's virtuosity, and the homespun nature of his drum tracks anticipates vast swathes of bedroom pop and downtempo—if not lo-fi beats to study to.

Still, Hannett's beatmaker moonlighting isn't a patch on his production. Whether it's the baroque solo workout of “Collette” or the ecstatic trebly strut of “Sketch for Summer,” Zero renders The Return of the Durutti Column in three full dimensions. Even Reilly's hazier moments have an astounding immediacy. Factory saw Hannett as being so crucial to the Durutti project that they credited him as a band member (playing “switches”) on the label of the record. Some early editions of the album were even bundled with a Hannett single. “The First Aspect of the Same Thing” is static synth modulation, and “The Second Aspect of the Same Thing” drags guitar chords slowly through the ocean. It's mellow machine music that may have been more fashionable (at the time, at least) than Reilly's brand of ambience, even if it's far less vigorous.

The reissue replaces the “Aspects” from the original tracklist with the far better pair, “Lips That Would Kiss” and ”Madeleine.” Released in the fall of 1980, the Hannett-produced single inches toward dream-pop. Engineer/musician Eric Random is credited with the rhythm box programming both here and on the collection of unreleased demos, which are more like a series of alternate takes. These new textures don't bring any major revelations: With the added syncopation, Reilly plays less fluidly, more rhythmically. But they further validate Hannett's—and Wilson's—vision for the Durutti Column, and they suggest what a fuller collaboration might have sounded like. (If you want to glimpse down a darker path, try “Won't Look Out” from Reilly's brief late-'70s stint in Gammer & His Familiars, which constructs an entire prog-folk ballad from what would become the middle section of “Conduct.”)

Still, the interplay isn't the source of The Return of the Durutti Column's magic, as wonderful as those moments can be. What sets Return apart is its perfect self-containment. The media-savvy label with world-beating aspirations, the producer with the mad-scientist rep, the frail guitarist given a second chance at stardom with his own project: Together, somehow, they made an album that sounds like a room that sounds like the world. Neither he nor the Duruttis ever became household names, though in the decades to come, Reilly's lucid dreaminess would be heard in everything from Windy & Carl to Dean McPhee to Nobuo Uematsu. Reilly would arrange and perform on Morrissey's solo debut, make major contributions to the Balearic sound, and become John Frusciante's guitar god. But for all his contributions to the dialogue of pop, the gorgeous internal monologue of The Return of the Durutti Column still produces a unique echo.

When it comes to CW's Supernatural, few TV series can rival its popularity and devoted fanbase, and even fewer within the same genre. However, Netflix's upcoming dark supernatural series may be the closest any show has come to recapturing the hype of Supernatural's early seasons.

Announced in November 2025, Wednesday creators Al Gough and Miles Millar are developing a character-driven adult animated series at Netflix based on BOOM! Comics' Grim by Stephanie Phillips. While details about the project remain scarce, it's confirmed that the series will blend supernatural, fantasy, and horror elements.

Like the comic, it follows Jessica Harrow, a newly recruited Reaper tasked with guiding souls to the afterlife. Supernatural fans will also be pleased to know there are some distinct similarities between this Netflix original and the CW series.

Grim and Supernatural coincidentally share a core premise: a protagonist forced to step into the role of the very person they are searching for. Supernatural fans will remember that Season 1 centers on Dean pulling Sam back into monster hunting after their father goes missing on a hunt. Grim follows a similar narrative thread.

In Grim, Jessica becomes a Reaper, but unlike her fellow Reapers, she has no memory of her death or her life before it. To uncover the truth, she must search for the original Grim Reaper, who has mysteriously vanished. Beyond this shared premise, there's another element that may strongly appeal to Supernatural fans.

Anyone who made it through Season 11 of Supernatural will remember Billie, the powerful reaper who ultimately becomes the new Death. So if you loved Billie, were fascinated by the show's reaper lore, and wished it had been explored further, Grim may be the perfect fit. With familiar themes like these, Grim has the potential to feel like a true spiritual successor to Supernatural.

Grim #1-25 from BOOM! Studios is now available!

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is no different from past games in the franchise in that it has numerous different puzzles to overcome. Whether it's using your various new abilities or simply jump puzzles, there's a slew of ways the developers have incorporated environmental puzzles into the action-adventure title.

While the Ice Belt portion of the campaign is relatively straightforward, there is one section that poses a blockage for some. This is, of course, the TK Code breaking where a giant snowflake-looking barrier is stopping you from proceeding. Thankfully, the solution isn't too difficult to overcome, provided you know what to look for.

Some people just can't take the heat, but that's why you need this nifty upgrade for Samus's newest suit.

Throughout the frigid Ice Belt portion of the campaign, you will come across a couple of pathways that are sealed. Whenever you go into your scanner mode, you are able to interact with the puzzle-based aspect in order to unseal it, but initially it won't work.

This is primarily because you are missing not only components that make it whole, but the actual shape that's required to complete it. Each puzzle is different and requires the player to go through the environment and find the correct solution for each puzzle.

The first TK Code to break is located in the Bio-labs on the first basement floor. You will come across various rooms in this area that have life pods for strange alien-like creatures inside, and some of them hold the key you are looking for.

You will be able to pass the barrier without finding the two TK Codes first, but thankfully we know exactly where they are.

The first one can be found in one of the rooms in the Bio-labs. From the blocked pathway, turn around 180 degrees and move forward until you reach an intersection. Head to the right and enter the first door on the right.

There are three life pods lined up in this room. Scan the middle one to reveal a piece of the puzzle that you will first need to rotate around to make whole.

Exit out the door, you enter to get the first code and turn left. Head down the hallway, past the intersection until you reach the first door on your left. Enter here and there will be a large terminal in the middle and a pathway for you to Morph and enter the next area.

Stay in this room and at the back left of the room (facing the main terminal when entering), there will be a pod you can open. Use your Psychic Lasso to open it (you may need to go to the other side of it) and scan the pod on the left to retrieve the code.

All you need to do now is go back to the snowflake-looking blockage, and it will not only fill in the two fragments you've collected but reveal the correct shape you need to draw.

The second Psychic Lock can be found shortly after the Bio-labs in the Medical Bay. As soon as you enter the area, it will be immediately on your left, but unlike the Bio-labs, this will require four TK Codes instead of two.

After smashing through the glass in the same general vicinity, the Psychic Lock Unit is located, take the furthest door to the right. There will be a small vent on the wall that you can use a Morphed Psychic Bomb to destroy.

Zip through this small entrance until you reach the other side. On the wall to your immediate right will be three capsules. Scan the middle one to find the first fragment.

After using your Fire Shot to de-ice a crane, one of the observation pods will be placed back down. Opening it will reveal a frozen creature, and upon scanning it, it will reveal that the Griever specimen also has the TK Code.

Progressing a little more through the area, you'll eventually come upon what looks like an operating table. In the back, you can interact with the terminal to activate the Balsallae System, which looks like an automated examiner that's attached to the ceiling. Scanning it will reveal the third fragment.

Last but not least, you'll come across a room with three cryopods located on each side of you. At the end of the hallway, you'll see a monitoring room that's locked. You'll be able to enter it from the side using your Morph ability.

Inside, to the upper right of the main terminal, there will be a frozen monitor. Use your Fire Shot on it and then your Psychic Lasso to pull it down. Scan the monitor to reveal the last fragment you needed to unlock your path.

All you need to do now is return to the Psychic Lock at the beginning of the Medical Bay, insert the four codes and draw the shape you have decoded.

The ball of doom, fight Xelios in the Volt Forge and get your wings.

Nearly eight decades after his reported death, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose remains one of modern India's greatest enigmas. Conflicting accounts, missing evidence and official secrecy continue to fuel debates over his final fate. 

Here's an explainer on his life and key moments: 

From Indian Civil Service to Congress President 

Subhas Chandra Bose was one of India's most charismatic nationalist leaders, born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa. He cleared the Indian Civil Service examination but resigned to join the freedom struggle and later served as Congress president in 1938 and 1939.  

What was the Indian National Army? 

Bose founded and led the Indian National Army (INA) during World War II. After escaping British surveillance in 1941, he reached Japanese-controlled Southeast Asia in 1943 and led military campaigns against British forces in Burma and northeast India.  

What is the official version of Netaji's death? 

According to official accounts, Bose died on August 18, 1945, from severe burns after his overloaded aircraft crashed shortly after take-off from Taihoku airfield in Taipei. His ashes were later placed at Tokyo's Renkoji Temple.

Living with Trump's Imperium


Why do conspiracy theories persist? 

Skepticism stems from the absence of a conclusively identified body, contradictory eyewitness accounts and long-standing government secrecy around classified files. Together, these gaps have sustained alternative theories for decades.  

What is the Gumnami Baba theory? 

One of the most enduring theories links Netaji to Gumnami Baba, a reclusive ascetic who lived in Faizabad until 1985. Supporters claim documents, photographs and personal items found after his death suggest he was Bose living in disguise.  

Did Netaji survive and live in Soviet Russia? 

Another theory claims Bose survived and was taken to the Soviet Union, possibly detained by Stalin as a political asset. Russian authorities, however, have consistently denied any records of Bose being in Soviet custody.  

What is the Japanese conspiracy theory? 

This hypothesis suggests Bose died in Japanese-controlled territory and that the plane crash narrative was fabricated to avoid diplomatic fallout, with both Tokyo and New Delhi allegedly suppressing the truth.  

How is Pranab Mukherjee linked to these claims? 

Journalist Anuj Dhar's book India's Biggest Cover-up alleges that Pranab Mukherjee, as External Affairs Minister, opposed declassifying Netaji-related files. Mukherjee did not publicly respond in detail to these allegations.  

How many official inquiries examined Netaji's death? 

Three major commissions investigated the case. The Shah Nawaz Committee (1956) and the Khosla Commission (1970) upheld the plane crash theory, while the Mukherjee Commission took a different view.  

What did the Mukherjee Commission conclude? 

In 2005, the Mukherjee Commission concluded that Bose did not die in the 1945 plane crash. The government rejected its findings and reaffirmed the official version of events.  

What changed after the declassification of files in 2016? 

While several Netaji-related files were made public, researchers argue key documents remain classified. The disclosures failed to settle the mystery, ensuring Bose's fate remains unresolved.

Our nose is right in front of us. So why don't we normally notice it?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Close one eye, and focus straight ahead, without moving your eyes. You'll notice a fleshy blur in your peripheral vision — your nose. It's there every waking moment, yet you're hardly ever aware of it. So why can't we see our noses, even though they're literally right in front of us?

""You can see your nose,"" said Michael Webster, a vision scientist and co-director of the neuroscience program at the University of Nevada, Reno. We're just not aware of it most of the time.

The main reason our noses don't take up space in our vision comes down to a somewhat startling fact: We don't see the world as it is but rather as a model our brains have constructed to help us survive.

""Vision is actually a prediction about what you think the world is,"" Webster said. ""You want to be aware of, 'How does the world differ?' 'What are the surprises and errors and the things that I didn't predict?' Normally, you're not aware of your nose because you already know about it and you just don't want to be aware of it. … It's a big disadvantage to waste some of your energy attending to that.""

This makes sense from a survival perspective; constantly processing unchanging features, like your nose, would be a waste of limited mental resources when you need to detect threats, find food or navigate your environment. In fact, your brain cancels out all sorts of information about your own body to help you perceive the outside world.

 




Sign up for our weekly Life's Little Mysteries newsletter to get the latest mysteries before they appear online.

Take your eyes' blood vessels, for example. The photoreceptors that collect light from the outside world are located in the back of the eye, behind a tangle of blood vessels.

""It's like you're sitting up in a tree of dead branches and you're actually seeing the world through all these dead branches,"" Webster said.

Your brain usually cancels that out, but there are ways to make your eye's blood vessels appear so your conscious mind can see them. If you've ever had an eye exam, you might have noticed dark squiggles in your vision when the optometrist passed a light across your eye. Those are the shadows cast by your eyes' blood vessels.

Your brain doesn't just cancel out unwanted information — sometimes it creates information from scratch. Take your blind spot: the blank region in your vision that corresponds to where the optic nerve leaves the eye. Your blind spot is about 5 degrees wide, or more than twice the size of the full moon's appearance in the sky. Yet we usually aren't aware of this huge gap in our vision.

""We're actually filling in that information,"" Webster said. ""Instead of seeing the absence, we've got clues from what's around the blind spot telling us, 'OK, if I'm looking at a white piece of paper, it's very likely that the part that's in the blind spot is also white.'""

It's even easier to perceive your nose — in fact, you might be hyperaware of it right now simply because you're thinking about it.

"" If you actually are consciously trying to see something, then you do become aware of it,"" Webster said.

—Why does water squirt out of your eye if you blow your nose really hard?

—Why do dogs have cold noses?

—Why do smells trigger strong memories?

Our ""disappearing"" noses reveal something profound about how we experience reality: Our vision isn't like a camera recording what's really there; it's more akin to an artist creating a model of the world that's most useful to us.

Webster took this idea even further. We may not perceive reality at all. ""Even this model itself is really just the information that you need to get by. It's not really telling you what the reality of the world is.""

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Zina Malas, 24, who lives in Beirut. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

When I visited Canada as a 5-year-old, it was the dream.

I was born and raised in Lebanon, and grew up fearing I'd get kidnapped in the streets or a random bomb would fall on me. After war broke out in 2006, our family moved to Canada to escape.

I loved it. There were nice parks, and ""exotic"" activities like ice skating.

After a few months, my family went back to Lebanon, where I did my undergrad.

In 2022, at 21, I moved to Canada alone.

Three years in, I had struggled to find a job or save money, and began feeling very depressed, so I moved back to Lebanon.

I'd still advise others to try relocating abroad, but living in Canada just didn't work for me.

Living in Lebanon was a struggle. I felt like I'd lost my youth and was desperate to leave, even if I had to work a minimum wage job.

My time spent studying media and communication at the American University of Beirut was disrupted by a national revolution that started in fall 2019, COVID, and the Beirut explosion in August 2020.

I already had friends in Montreal and Canadian citizenship through one of my parents, so I headed to Canada and gave myself three months to find a job.

Even though my Montreal friends warned me that finding a job wouldn't be easy, I didn't think it would be that hard.

They were right. It was absolutely horrendous.

In Lebanon, where I had some jobs during my studies, I experienced less competition for work. I was used to sending my application to a potential employer, DM'ing the company on Instagram, and having an interview the next day. But in Canada, I applied for roles across marketing, social media, and business development, which I felt I had the skills for, but didn't land any. 

Some recruiters told me I didn't have the right experience. I'm not sure if it was because my experience was Lebanese or not Canadian, but it felt like people were treating me like I had no professional history.

I also struggled to understand interviewers who spoke Québécois French, a dialect used in Montreal. I went to a French school in Lebanon, so I'm fluent, but I couldn't for the life of me understand this particular accent, which lost me opportunities.

After applying for what I'd estimate were at least 200 jobs, I connected with a Lebanese HR rep who saw my résumé and gave me the chance to interview for a content manager role. After roughly three months of searching, it became my first job in Canada.

I stayed at the company for 1.5 years, and then moved into tech sales at a different company for a few months.

In Lebanon, the work culture was generally less formal. I could show up late to work in a random outfit and no one would say anything. We could have disorganized files and communicate with team members over Whatsapp. It was friendly and laid-back.

In Canada, things were more organized. I knew exactly what my tasks were, and was given proper equipment. I remember being shocked when I was given a MacBook and phone number for work.

My compensation in Canada was good compared with what I could make in Lebanon. I had a nice life, a nice apartment, and ate well. But with the cost of rent, bills, and groceries, I feel like I wasn't saving much, and was basically living paycheck to paycheck. It's one of the reasons I left.

Another reason was how hard it was to meet new people, and my mental health suffered as a result. Canadian culture is highly individualistic, which is hugely different to the Middle East. In Lebanon, if I go out with one friend to a restaurant, I'll end up meeting 10 new people. If I tried to talk to people in Canada while I was out, conversations would end abruptly. If my roommate didn't have friends, with whom I was thankfully able to have a lot of fun, I probably would have been completely alone.

I imagined I'd meet so many new people and have the time of my life, but my expectations weren't met. Plus, I couldn't deal with the cold weather.

In September 2025, I went home.

I'm currently running my own company, Tawlé Consultancy, which helps businesses in the MENA region who are declining or feel stuck. I started it in Canada, but working on it from the West felt weird, as though I was righteously telling people what to do from a distance. Now, I can sit with people, help them come up with new ideas, and feel like I'm making a valuable impact.

I've noticed many people my age in Lebanon are also trying to build their own thing. Our generation has been through a lot, and we're trying to figure things out and establish ourselves. When I go to coffee shops, I see so many founders around me. It's very inspiring.

Being in a stable country like Canada eased my mind, as I wasn't worried about my physical safety, and it helped me deal with the trauma I experienced in Lebanon.

But I'm happier living in Lebanon. I've realized I'm too Lebanese to live anywhere else.

Some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people traveled to Switzerland this week, to attend the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos.

That meant some of the world's fanciest aircraft descended on nearby airports, too.

Business Insider has been tracking the private jets and government aircraft that arrived there this week.

On Monday alone, there were around 160 private jet arrivals from over 40 countries spread across five continents.

The majority appeared to land at Zurich Airport, which is 75 miles from Davos. In a press release, the airport said it expected more than 1,000 extra takeoffs and landings due to the WEF.

Others landed at Friedrichshafen, over the border with Germany, or St Gallen, also near Lake Constance.

From Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 to Air Force One, here's some of the most impressive aircraft.

On Monday, 31 of the 157 private jet arrivals were Gulfstream G650s.

Throughout the week in Switzerland, data from JetSpy showed such planes belonging to: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Blackstone, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase.

Gulfstream jets are known for their large, circular windows, which give high-flyers great views.

Business jets can be configured in different ways depending on what the customer wants. Sometimes, they have double beds and an on-board shower.

It's more likely that a billionaire flying solo would choose that, whereas a company would probably prefer more seats.

These are pretty rare to see since they're so spacious compared to other business jets. A Boeing Business Jet version of the 737 Max costs about $100 million.

Flight-tracking data showed a private 737 that flew from Dubai to Zurich on Sunday. Another one from Dubai went to Friedrichshafen, a lakeside German city just over the Swiss border, on Tuesday.

Some governments also use the 737 to transport political leaders. In Switzerland this week, flight-tracking data showed such planes belonging to the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands.

Due to its size, the Boeing 737 business jet is even more customizable than Gulfstream or Bombardier aircraft.

Sometimes they are laid out like a typical airliner, with six seats abreast. But there is room for all sorts of amenities, too.

Business Insider toured one in 2024, which had an on-board bar, two double bedrooms, and two showers.

The first Gulfstream G800 was only delivered last August, so they're still relatively rare to see. It costs about $70 million to buy one.

A handful of them flew into Swiss airports this week. JetSpy data shows they included ones owned by Visa, Qualcomm, and Pfizer.

It's big enough to have room for four living areas on board. Passengers also shouldn't feel as fatigued as flying commercial, because the G800's cabin pressure makes it feel like the altitude is 2,480 feet. On the newest airliners, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the cabin altitude is more like 6,000 feet.

According to data from JetSpy, the above jet is owned by Robert F. Smith, the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners. The private equity firm's logo is on the tail.

Flight-tracking data shows this Global 7500 flew from Atlanta to Zurich, about 75 miles from Davos, last Saturday.

JetSpy data showed that other Bombardier plans that landed in Switzerland this week include ones owned by: Avram Glazer, the Manchester United co-owner; Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East; and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.

This is the interior of a Global 7500 owned by VistaJet, a private charter firm that operates the most such jets. Several of its planes touched down in Switzerland during the week of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.

Emmanuel Macron appeared to arrive in Davos on Tuesday. That morning, two French government jets — a Dassault Falcon 7X and a smaller Falcon 900 — flew to Zurich from an air base near Paris.

However, it appears he left before Trump's speech.

Even the president couldn't help compliment Macron's eyewear, which spawned plenty of memes and jokes online. ""Those beautiful sunglasses,"" Trump said. ""What the hell happened?""

Macron has worn them in public in recent days due to an eye problem.

A Dassault Falcon 8X arrived in Zurich from Scottsdale, Arizona, on Tuesday, flight-tracking data showed.

It costs about $60 million to buy a new one, or $14,000 an hour to charter.

More popular than the Falcon 8X in Switzerland this week was the smaller Falcon 2000 jet.

Trump was supposed to fly to Zurich aboard the usual presidential jet, a Boeing VC-25A. It's a militarized version of the Boeing 747 airliner.

However, 30 minutes into his journey, the plane U-turned and went back to Joint Base Andrews. He instead flew on a Boeing C-32A. It's not quite as fancy and is usually used as the Vice President's Air Force Two. Any plane carrying the president is designated as Air Force One while he is on it.

This week served as a reminder of Trump's impatience with Boeing over delays in building the new Air Force One.

His press secretary took the opportunity to mention the 747 that he was gifted by Qatar. That plane is currently undergoing modifications and refitting by the Air Force.

The Sikorsky VH-60N White Hawk flew in a convoy of at least five helicopters. They took about 40 minutes to fly from Zurich Airport to Davos on Wednesday.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has had a busy start to the year.

He flew on a military version of the Airbus A330. It first arrived in Beijing on January 14, flew to Doha a few days later, and then to Zurich on Monday.

Carney won plenty of attention for his speech in Davos about the change in world politics since Trump's election. ""We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,"" he said.

The above Azerbaijani private jet landed in Zurich on Tuesday.

The Argentine government's Boeing 757 jet, registered as ""ARG-01,"" arrived in Zurich on Tuesday.

Flight-tracking data showed it departed Buenos Aires on Monday evening, then stopped in the Canary Islands, before heading to Switzerland. The journey took about 15 hours.

Jeremy Cerza, a 45-year-old retail investor, admits he isn't that experienced in markets, but even he knows metals stole the show in 2025.

Gold and silver were among the best-performing investments last year— and should the S&P 500 drop more than 1% for five days in a row, Cerza says he's jumping into the rally, with a plan to yank money out of the US stocks and plough around $20,000 into precious metals.

While he's concerned about a bubble, his faith in the Trump administration and the US economy is shaky enough that he thinks the risk will be worth the reward. He said if Trump keeps up his aggressive rhetoric on Greenland, he'd likely pull money from domestic markets.

""There's too much volatility in US markets currently, in my opinion,"" Cerza added.

A lot of investors felt that way in 2025, with more people squirreling away money into gold and silver as concerns about inflation, tariffs, and the strength of the US economy dominated the conversation and talk of ""Sell America"" took off.

That only picked up steam in the second half of the year, with more investors jumping into metals as prices went parabolic. The result? A FOMO-driven, meme-like rally that's taken many investors by surprise — and is leaving some worried that the flight to safety may itself be a bubble.

It's hard to look at charts of gold and silver and not see the outline of a market mania. Gold finished last year with its best run since 1979, and has soared 73% since the start of 2025.

That doesn't hold a candle to silver's increase. The metal is up 194% since the beginning of 2025, also notching its best annual performance in decades.

On average, retail investors poured a net $15 million into gold and a net $7 million into silver investments each day last year, according to data from VandaTrack Research.

Chatter about gold and silver has also been strong online. SwaggyStocks, an analytics platform that tracks mentions of investments on r/WallStreetBets, found that the SPDR Gold Shares ETF was the third most talked-about investment on the subreddit last year. The iShares Silver Trust ETF was among the top 20 most-talked about investments, according to data it shared with Business Insider.

Bilaal Dhalech, one retail investor, said he began buying gold and silver during the pandemic, but has invested more aggressively in recent years to hedge against inflation and ""excessive money printing.""

Dhalech said he had around $10,000 in physical gold and silver and $11,000 invested in gold ETFs. His ETF holdings have gained 30%, according to screenshots of his brokerage account Business Insider reviewed.

""I was shocked to see a conservative investment like gold and silver explode. Almost like meme coins,"" Dhalech said of the rally in 2025. ""It's scary to see this much enthusiasm.""

Jesse Gaddis, a public relations professional who works with precious metals companies, said he had been tracking gold for years, back when Donald Trump talked about gold on an episode of The Apprentice.

He finally began purchasing metals during the pandemic, after his client, a CEO of a precious metals firm, encouraged him to do so. He told Business Insider he had around $20,000 in physical gold and silver and around $15,000 invested in gold and silver ETFs as of last week.

""I'll be thinking about The Apprentice episode where I was like, 'Damn, I could have had it at $400,'"" he said of gold's price at the time. ""That FOMO comes out.""

When the investments rocketed higher in 2025, Gaddis says he wasn't surprised. He sees gold and silver as a form of ""wealth preservation"" and acknowledges that ""Sell America"" is one reason so many investors jumped into metals.

Bullion Exchanges, a gold and precious metals retailer based in New York, says interest in gold and silver has been so hot that the firm doubled its clientele in 2025.

At its Diamond District location in Manhattan, a line of 10 to 20 people consistently forms outside the doors at all hours of the day. Many of them are buying metals for the first time, Eric Gozenput, the CEO, told Business Insider.

""It's been the wild, wild West the last three months,"" Gozenput said, speculating the firm could have grown 200% were it not for the store's limited capacity and shortages of some metals, like silver.

The craze for metals comes in two flavors.

On the one hand, many investors seem to be influenced by prominent gold bugs, who have been more vocal about the virtues of owning metals as tariffs and inflation have become bigger threats, Gozenput said. He said he believes many clients have been learning about trends like the debasement trade, which says the US dollar and dollar-denominated investments will weaken as debts pile up and fiat currency is devalued.

On the other hand, the strength of the ""Sell America"" trade has drummed up FOMO, as metals enjoy a rally that would make many meme stocks blush.

""I would say it's a combination of both people have FOMO as well as realizing they're not properly insured with their financial future and investments if they have zero physical precious metals exposure,"" he said.

Jeffrey Christian, a commodities expert and the managing director at CPM Group, said he believed ""Sell America"" fueled most of gold's and silver's rally through the end of last summer.

Then, gold prices shot up last August as the Fed signaled it would continue lowering interest rates. At that point, he believes the speculative trade kicked into high gear.

""That started this, what you call FOMO,"" he said, noting that his clients who were more ""traditional"" metals investors began to pull back as prices rocketed higher.

Concern that the rally has run too far is growing.

Christian said he believed gold could drop as much as 9% and silver could drop as much as 31% if the hype wanes.

Dhalech said he didn't believe the metals would crash, though he wouldn't be surprised to see a 10% correction in gold and silver in the near term.

This past week, Gaddis sold around half of his silver and gold ETFs to take some profits. Business Insider verified his current holdings with screenshots of his brokerage account.

""It's a nice slow ride up, but it's a quick elevator down,"" he said of a potential correction, adding he knew it would be harder for him to get rid of his physical metals.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katarina Polonska, a relationship scientist and coach who will be inheriting her childhood home in Slovakia. Vancouver-based Polonska, 36, said the home needs a lot of work, and it may not be worth managing renovations from abroad. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

I'm going to be inheriting my childhood home where I was born. I love it, and it's very precious to me. But I don't have any right to it yet.

It's mostly used as a family holiday home, but ultimately when my mother passes, it's going to be given to me.

My mother owns it, and there's no plan to sell it — the value of the home isn't very high, in fairness. It's a two-bedroom, one-bathroom. It's not worth much at all; maybe $80,000 CAD. I don't think the money would go very far in Canada.

Also, selling it would require a lot of renovations. It's very old school and needs a lot of TLC, and my mother doesn't live in Slovakia, she lives in England. So from her perspective, she's thinking, ""Why would I invest 30,000 or 50,000 euros (about $35,245 or $58,742) in a property that I go to a few times a year max? What's the point?""

She also knows it would to be really complicated to sell it from abroad, having to navigate viewings and trusting realtors and all of this stuff.

The reality is, I'm going to own this foreign property when she passes.

My husband is also waiting to inherit. His mother inherited a property in Barbados from her parents, though she never lived in Barbados.

His mother had to wait to take over the Barbados property, and by the time she took it over, it had declined a little bit and there are always complications with it.

I've actually never seen it myself, but I know that there's a lot of work to be done with the house. But his mother has been holding onto it saying, ""You can inherit it and you and Kat can enjoy it.""

But he's like, ""We don't go to Barbados enough."" It's just more hassle having to manage and protect a property when you're not physically in the country.

I think from my perspective, because I'm naive about it, I'm like, keep it, it'd be really nice to have it. But his argument is that the place isn't in the area of Barbados that I would necessarily want to go to.

He's really wary. He doesn't want to be managing the property and he would rather sell it and then distribute the money within his family.

So we both know that there's going to be this new responsibility on our heads and, candidly, I think life is difficult enough as it is.

I'm not going to rent the Slovakia home out because it's from, like, the 1980s. It's not been renovated. It's ancient; the wallpaper's faded.

While Slovakia is kind of an up-and-coming country from a tourism perspective, I don't think anyone would want to stay in this place as an Airbnb unless it was literally advertised as a historical relic: ""Come stay in this ancient old-school apartment!""

My husband and I have talked about how we're probably going to have to renovate it. We know that at some point, we're probably going to have to take a couple of months to be there physically to renovate it. But when is that going to happen? We both work, and getting to Slovakia is like a 20-hour journey from here.

I think, more realistically, we could just keep the place and treat it as a little getaway to escape to. There is really lovely nature nearby and I don't have any other properties, so there is merit psychologically to knowing that there is a place that's home, even if it is halfway across the world.

When it comes to inheriting property, I think there needs to be more dialogue between the parent and the child of, ""What do you actually want to do?""

I think a lot of parents have this assumption that leaving a kid the property is the ultimate goal; we've made it, we've paid off the mortgage, we have this home, and now the kid gets it. Those days are kind of gone.

We don't live in a world where everyone grows up and lives in the same town or city as their parents. We live in a really global economy. People are moving, people are more transient, and the world has become smaller. It's also become a lot more expensive, and home ownership isn't what it used to be.

Parents need to recognize that the world we're in is very different, and Millennials are not an anxious generation for no reason. We have a lot of stresses. It makes more sense to have a dialogue with your kid around what they want.

I wish parents would ask, ""What do you want? Where are you at with your life, and what kind of inheritance makes sense?""

Is it, in fact, a lump sum of cash, because maybe you're a busy entrepreneur and you don't have time to sell? Maybe you actually would prefer the parent to sell, which is annoying for the parents, but maybe the kid would prefer that.

Thank you for the inheritance — that's very generous. But I think quite a lot of kids would probably say it's not worth it. Either enjoy the money, mom and dad, or cash out, downsize, and just give us a down payment or something.

Live Updates


• Deadly shooting: A Minneapolis man was shot and killed by federal agents today, according to city officials. The man is believed to be a US citizen, police said.
    


            • DHS says agents defended themselves: The Department of Homeland Security said the man had a handgun and approached Border Patrol officers during a targeted operation. He “violently resisted” when officers tried to disarm him, and an agent shot him in self-defense, according to DHS.
    


            • State and local outcry: Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said videos show masked agents “pummeling one of our constituents and shooting him to death,” and he denounced the “impunity” of federal agents operating in the city. Gov. Tim Walz called on President Donald Trump to pull ICE out of Minneapolis and allow Minnesota to lead an investigation into the shooting.
    


            • Days of protest: This marks the third shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis this month, including the high-profile case of Renee Good, and comes amid days of mass protests over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities.
    


            Video shows a dumpster set ablaze in the street as tensions continue near the federal law enforcement shooting scene, CNN affiliate WCCO reports.
    


            State troopers and other law enforcement officers surrounded the fire, which is still burning, while using fire extinguishers to put it out.
    


            Authorities continue to deploy additional crowd-control measures as the situation remains volatile, with streets still crowded and chaotic.
    


            In Minnesota, citizens must have a permit to legally carry a handgun in public, according to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.
    


            The permit doesn't require the weapon to be concealed and it also serves as a permit to purchase a firearm, meaning holders don't need a separate purchase permit. Once issued, the permit is valid for five years and can be renewed.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is urging federal officials to allow the state to take the lead in investigating the Saturday shooting that killed a 37-year-old US citizen during anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis, Walz said in a post on X.



            “I told the White House the state must lead the investigation,” Walz said.
    


            He stressed state investigators should be allowed to “secure justice” and asked the public to remain peaceful and give authorities space to work.
    


            Walz also emphasized the state has sufficient personnel to ensure public safety and warned federal agents must not obstruct the state's efforts to manage the scene.
    


            Community members have taken to the street near the scene of the deadly shooting in Minneapolis. Federal officers have deployed tear gas to disperse crowds at the scene.
    


            Saturday morning's fatal shooting is the third shooting by federal agents in the city, which has seen numerous protests and demonstrations in response to the shooting and federal immigration crackdown.
    


            Amid ongoing protests and a heavy federal law enforcement presence in south Minneapolis, Police Chief Brian O'Hara described the scene as “incredibly volatile” during a Saturday news conference.
    


            He said the department has set up a command post and is coordinating with the Department of Homeland Security, adding federal officials have not provided specific details about the shooting incident.
    


            O'Hara emphasized the department's priority is public safety, noting an “emergency recall of all sworn personnel back to duty” and urged residents to avoid the area.
    


            “We understand your frustrations,” O'Hara said. “This is not sustainable.”
    


            Preliminary information shows more than one federal agent was involved in today's shooting, police chief Brian O'Hara said.
    


            Asked if there were multiple officers involved in the shooting, O'Hara said, “That is the preliminary information.”
    


                    “That is our understanding, that it was more than one law enforcement officer involved in the discharge. And again, there is public video that shows several law enforcement officers in a scuffle with someone,” he said.
                





            Asked about the Department of Homeland Security's claims about the fatal shooting of a man in Minneapolis, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said “the video speaks for itself.”
    


            He referenced videos showing the shooting but said police haven't received any “public safety statement” about the incident. DHS has said the man was armed and agents tried to disarm him before firing “defensive shots.”
    


            The police chief said the man is believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. His only past interaction with law enforcement of which they are aware of involved traffic tickets, he said.
    


            The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is at the scene, O'Hara added.
    


            President Donald Trump has been briefed on the fatal shooting involving federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday, according to a White House official.
    


            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey addressed the city Saturday as federal agents continue to deploy crowd-control measures, sharply criticizing the federal law enforcement presence.
    


            Frey condemned the militarized response, saying it “erodes trust in both law enforcement and in democracy” and pushed back on claims that local officials or community members are responsible for the unrest.
    


                    “I'm done being told that our community members are responsible for the vitriol in our streets,” Frey said during the Saturday news conference. “I'm done being told that our local elected officials are solely responsible for turning down the temperature.”
                





            Frey said 15,000 people had peacefully protested the day before, with no reported injuries or property damage, emphasizing that such demonstrations reflect the city's and nation's founding principles. He contrasted this with the “mass militarized force and unidentified agents” occupying Minneapolis streets.
    


                    “We have seen these kinds of operations in other places, in other countries, but not here in America, not in a way where a great American city is being invaded by its own federal government,” he said.
                





            Rachel Sayre, director of Minneapolis' emergency management department, has said the surge in federal agents in the city is having “profound repercussions.”
    


                    “The city's emergency operation center continues to be activated, as it has throughout the surge in federal agents over the last few weeks. We are tracking impacts and coordinating the city's response to the situation, which is having profound repercussions in our community,” Sayre said.
                





            “I can't underscore enough how much Operation Metro Surge is impacting our city,” she said.
    


            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey asked people across the country to support Minneapolis following the shooting of a third person by ICE agents in recent weeks.
    


            “To everyone listening, stand with Minneapolis,” Frey said.
    


            “Your children will ask you what side you were on. Your grandchildren will ask you what you did to act to prevent this from happening again,” Frey added.
    


            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for an end to the federal immigration enforcement campaign that has seen thousands of agents dispatched to the Twin Cities in recent weeks.
    


                    “The invasion of these heavily armed masked agents roaming around on our streets of Minneapolis, emboldened with a sense of impunity – it has to end,” he said.
                





            He addressed President Donald Trump directly, saying, “This is a moment to act like a leader.”
    


            “Put Minneapolis, put America first in this moment. Let's achieve peace,” he went on. “Let's end this operation, and I'm telling you, our city will come back. Safety will be restored.”
    


            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has just described watching a video of “more than six masked agents pummeling one of our constituents and shooting him to death.”
    


                    “How many more residents, how many more Americans need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end? How many more lives need to be lost before this administration realizes that a political and partisan narrative is not as important as American values?” Frey asked during a news conference moments ago.
                





            Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara urged protesters to remain calm after a man was fatally shot by federal agents this morning.
    


                    “We ask everyone to remain calm and to please do not destroy our own city,” he said.
                





            The shooting marks the second fatal shooting of a US citizen by federal agents in Minneapolis this month.
    


            O'Hara also said that police have “very limited information.”
    


            “We have not been told any official reports of what has led up to the shooting, but we have seen the video that is circulating on social media,” he said.
    


            Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a Saturday news conference that the man shot and killed by a federal agent this morning was a 37-year-old male Minneapolis resident who police “believe” is a US citizen.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security said federal agents involved in a deadly shooting this morning in Minneapolis were acting in self-defense, saying the man who was fatally shot “violently resisted” their attempts to disarm him.
    


            The department said agents were conducting a targeted operation against an undocumented immigrant “wanted for violent assault,” when an “individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun.”
    


            “The officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted,” the statement continued. “Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots. Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene.”
    


            A law enforcement source who spoke with CNN separately said a struggle ensued between agents and the man who approached them. Agents attempted to disarm the man; a struggle ensued, and the man grabbed his gun and fired a shot, according to the source, who stressed that information was preliminary and the situation was fluid.
    


            Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey is speaking now after a man was shot and killed by federal agents today in Minneapolis, according to the city's police chief.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security says the man was armed, though it is not immediately clear what led up to the shooting or whether he was holding the gun when he was shot.
    


            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is scheduled to speak at 12:30 p.m. ET after federal agents shot a man in Minneapolis Saturday morning.
    


            After immigration agents fatally shot a man in Minneapolis on Saturday, federal officials attempted to prevent local police from accessing the scene, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN.
    


            O'Hara told his officers to remain on site as part of standard protocol to preserve evidence after a shooting.
    


            The surge of immigration agents to Minneapolis has been marked by frequent tensions between local and federal authorities, particularly after high-profile use of force incidents.
    


            After the killing of Renee Good earlier this month by an ICE officer, federal officials blocked state investigators from participating in their review of the incident.
    


            A man shot while surrounded by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday was armed, according to a Department of Homeland Security official who said the individual “had a firearm with two magazines.”
    


            The situation, the official noted, is evolving and provided a photo of the purported firearm, which appears to be a Sig Sauer Emperor Scorpion.
    


            It's not clear whether the man was holding the gun when he was shot. It is also unclear if he had a permit to carry the firearm, which is required in the state.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security has not described the circumstances that precipitated the shooting.
    


            The incident comes amid very high tensions on the ground in Minneapolis following days of protests after the fatal shooting of Renee Good.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said that he had spoken with the White House about the incident, which he described as “sickening” and called for the end of an aggressive immigration enforcement effort.
    


            “I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. Minnesota has had it. This is sickening,” Walz said.
    


            He continued: “The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”

Officials plead for calm amid ‘anger and questions around what happened'; shooting comes less than three weeks after ICE officer killed Renee Good

Man shot by federal agents in Minneapolis has died

Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara has said the city authorities know the identity of the man killed by federal officers this morning, but the name is not being released at this time.

He described the person shot dead as a white man, a resident of the city and a US citizen. O'Hara said the victim was 37 years old. Wire services had previously said the man was 51.

O'Hara said that the federal authorities have not provided any details about today's incident to the police department and city authorities.

The Minneapolis police chief, Brian O'Hara, said it was his understanding that multiple federal officers were involved in the incident this morning where a man was shot dead by government personnel.

O'Hara said that the Minnesota authorities have put national guard troops on stand-by.

The scene where the shooting took place this morning in the south of the city appears to be calming down somewhat at this moment.

The situation earlier was very chaotic, with the federal agents and officers firing teargas at the protesters gathered where a man was shot dead by federal officers today.

Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, has posted on X saying: “I told the White House the state must lead the investigation” into the fatal shooting of a man in Minneapolis this morning.

“Let state investigators secure justice. As we process the scene, stay peaceful and give them space. The state has the personnel to keep people safe – federal agents must not obstruct our ability to do so,” he said.

Local and federal authorities have been sharply at odds over the escalated immigration enforcement efforts taking place in the city over the last few weeks, with Minneapolis and Minnesota leaders furious about the unilateral dispatch of aggressive federal agents to the city by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security.

Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara has said the city authorities know the identity of the man killed by federal officers this morning, but the name is not being released at this time.

He described the person shot dead as a white man, a resident of the city and a US citizen. O'Hara said the victim was 37 years old. Wire services had previously said the man was 51.

O'Hara said that the federal authorities have not provided any details about today's incident to the police department and city authorities.

As we piece together what happened in Minneapolis on Saturday, where another shooting by federal immigration agents was recorded on video and posted online by witnesses, instant analysis of the images by open-source experts and non-experts has begun.

David Bier, the Cato institute director of immigration studies, shared the distressing video on X.

The video matches the reported location of the shooting mentioned by officials, and shows a man being wrestled to the ground by several law enforcement officers before being shot several times. At least two officers can be seen with weapons in their hands.

Open-source experts have begun to parse the apparent video evidence online, which seemed to capture the sound of an initial shot causing the agents to retreat from the man before one fires at him repeatedly on the ground.

The journalist Eoin Higgins reposted the clip on Bluesky, with suggestion that that one portion of the recording might show that an officer in grey “disarms the man on the ground being beaten – BEFORE shots were fired”.

The Minneapolis police chief, Brian O'Hara, is now telling a press conference that his department does not yet know what happened immediately before the shooting.

Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, has just spoken at the press conference that is ongoing in the city.

After Renee Good was shot dead by ICE, he told the agency to “get the fuck out of” the city.

Moments ago at this conference he urged residents to: “Stand with Minneapolis. Stand up for America. Recognize that your children will ask what side you were on. Your grandchildren will ask what you did to act to prevent this from happening again … What did you do to protect your nation?”

He added: “This is not what America is about. This is not a partisan issue. This is an American issue. This administration and everyone involved in this operation should be reflecting. They should be reflecting right now and asking: what exactly are you accomplishing?”

The police chief of Minneapolis, Brian O'Hara, has kicked off a press conference by acknowledging that people are angry about the latest fatal shooting by federal law enforcement of a man in the city.

He called on federal personnel in the city to conduct themselves with discipline and humanity.

Then he said that members of the public gathered to protest at the scene of the shooting in south Minneapolis were taking part in an “unlawful assembly”.

“There is a lot of anger and questions around what has happened,” O'Hara said.

And he called for calm and begged the public not to damage the city.

Minneapolis's mayor, Jacob Frey, is now talking and we will bring you his remarks asap. He's calling on Donald Trump to “end this operation” and “take action now to remove these federal agents”.

In a statement sent to the Guardian, assistant secretary of homeland security Tricia McLaughlin said that at 9.05am local time, “as DHS law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted operation in Minneapolis” against a person they said was in the country illegally, who she said was “wanted for violent assault”, “an individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun.”

McLaughlin said that “the officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted” and that “more details on the armed struggle are forthcoming.”

“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots” she said, adding: “Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene.”

She added that the man also had “2 magazines and no ID”.

The Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of ICE and Border Patrol, has just said that the man shot dead by federal immigration enforcement earlier this morning was pronounced dead at the scene.

The federal agency said an agent fired “defensive shots”. It is now characterizing protesters as “rioters”, saying there are about 200 people on the scene in south Minneapolis trying to “obstruct and assault law enforcement”.

Illinois governor JB Pritzker has called for a bipartisan reponse to this shooting from US state governors.

“I am asking my fellow Republican and Democratic Governors across the nation to have a unified response. We must all stand against the lawlessness being inflicted in our states,” he posted on X moments ago.

He then posted: “Masked federal agents in Minnesota just shot and killed another person. We must put a stop to Trump's ICE. Now. Stop the funding, stop the occupations, stop the killings.”

Mary Moriarty, the top prosecutor of Hennepin county, where Minneapolis is located, has issued a statement saying that her team is working with state law enforcement, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), to coordinate on a response to this shooting.

“The scene must be secured by local law enforcement for the collection and preservation of evidence,” Moriarty said. “We expect the federal government to allow the BCA to process the scene.”

After Renee Good was killed, the FBI at first cooperated with Minnesota law enforcement and then abruptly shut them out and said it would be only a federal investigation. This outraged state and county officials.

After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them “cowards” and telling them to go home.

One officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: “Boo hoo.” Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car, the Associated Press reports.

The intersection where the shooting occurred has been blocked off, and border patrol agents are on the scene wielding batons.

Teargas has been deployed and the crack of munitions such as flash-bang grenades used in crowd control can be heard close to the scene of this shooting in south Minneapolis.

Clouds of teargas are floating in a haze above the street, while protesters are not leaving the scene.

A US government source directly briefed on the situation rapidly unfolding in Minneapolis has confirmed reports to the Guardian that the man shot by federal immigration officers this morning was armed.

The source, who cannot be named because they are not authorized to give out details at this time, provided an image of a handgun next to a loaded magazine, connected to the man the Department of Homeland Security is calling a suspect.

“Suspect had a firearm with two magazines,” the source said. “Situation evolving. Will get … more information ASAP.”

The Guardian has not yet been able independently to verifiy this information.

A 51-year-old man shot by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis has died, a hospital record obtained by the Associated Press shows.

CNN has also reported that the man shot during the federal immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis has died this morning. The Minnesota Star Tribune has also reported the man has been killed.

Minnesotans have been protesting against the White House's decision to flood the relatively small, liberal midwestern city of Minneapolis with federal immigration enforcement personnel in recent weeks.

Those demonstrations have become a daily constant in much greater volume since an ICE officer shot dead resident (and US citizen) Renee Good on 7 January instead of stepping out of the way of her departing car.

At the time there were fears of a things slipping out of control in the city if protests turned into riots or mass law-breaking.

But in fact demonstrations have been fierce but very much in control. Federal officers and agents from ICE officers to the border patrol have drawn outrage for aggressive and sometimes violent tactics against people they are targeting for immigration enforcement but also against protesters and mere bystanders or passersby.

Governor Tim Walz said: “Minnesota is meeting fear and division with decency and generosity.”

The Guardian's immigration reporter Maanvi Singh said from her experience she had to agree with descriptions of the city as feeling like it is “under siege”.

Minnesota's governor Tim Walz has called for Donald Trump to end his administration's aggressive federal immigration enforcement operations in the state the began a few weeks ago and has caused chaos, injury and death.

“I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. This is sickening,” Walz wrote on the X social media platform.

He continued: “The president must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”

Minneapolis officials are urgently looking into the multiple reports that federal enforcement has shot a man.

Officials in Minneapolis have received reports of another shooting involving federal law enforcement officers in the city during the Trump administration's immigration crackdown there.

The shooting comes less than three weeks after Renee Good was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in the city in Minnesota while she tried driving away from a confrontation with officers. The killing sparked protests nationwide and constant protests in Minneapolis since.

City officials said on Saturday morning in a statement that the “shooting involving federal law enforcement” and occurred in the area of West 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue South – and that they are “working to confirm additional details”.

“We ask the public to remain calm and avoid the immediate area,” the statement added.

Governor Tim Walz called for an immediate end to the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations in the state.

American troops have called Donald Trump a “draft-dodger” and accused him of “denigrating” Britain's role in Afghanistan.

The president, who claimed British forces stayed away from the front line in Afghanistan and left the fighting to the US, received a medical deferment during the Vietnam War for bone spurs.

He faced fierce criticism for his remarks on both sides of the Atlantic, including from one of his former top officials, who warned he could end up isolating the US from its allies.

“We've never needed them. They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan… and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the frontlines,” Mr Trump said of European forces on Thursday.

He received five deferments during the Vietnam War, including for a bone spur in his heel. He has denied dodging the draft and said he would have “gladly served”.

Shawn VanDiver, a US navy veteran who served alongside British forces off the coast of Iraq, said Mr Trump had never shown “courage” in combat and described his comments as “outright, 100 per cent bulls---”.

“For the president to denigrate the service of these patriots is absolutely unconscionable,” he said.

“No wonder Keir Starmer is p----d off… these folks stood shoulder to shoulder with us for two decades of war and across numerous missions.”

One former US service member, who worked with Nato forces in Afghanistan as a contractor, was exasperated at the “nonsense that comes out of that man's mouth”.

British troops were “right there with us”, the individual said, labelling the president a “draft-dodger” who had never set foot inside a war zone.

A former senior Pentagon official described Mr Trump's comments as “rich coming from a guy who dodged the draft” and labelled the president “disgusting and out of touch”.

Sir Keir Starmer criticised Mr Trump's “insulting and frankly appalling” remarks on Friday and suggested the US president should apologise.

Mr VanDiver warned it was a dangerous time for Mr Trump to isolate the US from its allies amid rising tensions with Iran.

“I think if we went to war tomorrow, everybody would give us the middle finger,” he said.

In response to the backlash Mr Trump backtracked on his claims British troops avoided front-line duty in Afghanistan. 

In a statement on Saturday on Truth Social he said British soldiers were “among the greatest of all warriors” and were “GREAT and very BRAVE”. 

He added that the bond between the British and American military was “too strong ever to be broken”.

British forces suffered 457 deaths in the 20 years of the Afghanistan War, sustaining its greatest losses in 2009 and 2010 during the deployment to Helmand Province.

Brandan Buck, who served four tours in Afghanistan, worked alongside British forces in Helmand, a hotbed of insurgent activity, during the fight against the Taliban.

Mr Buck called Mr Trump's comment “verifiably false” and said British intelligence officers were “very friendly and very responsive” and “eager to conduct the war”.

“I never got any sense that they were hesitant… in some ways, they're more active than we were,” he added.

Adml James Stavridis, the former commander of United States European Command, said hundreds of Nato troops had “died under my command on the frontlines in Afghanistan” between 2009 and 2013.

“I honour their memory every single day,” he wrote on social media.

Robert Wilkie, who served as Mr Trump's secretary of veterans affairs in his first term, condemned the president's comments. He said: “I wish he hadn't said it.”

Mr Wilkie questioned who had been briefing Mr Trump, given the high casualty rates suffered among troops serving alongside the US in Afghanistan. He added: “The last thing we need is to fulfil the dreams of every Bolshevik and kleptocrat by separating the US from Europe.”

He said Mr Trump was right in trying to encourage Nato allies to increase spending on defence and for Europe to be much better prepared to defend itself. But he questioned how the president would not be aware of the sacrifice made by British troops in Afghanistan as well as in Iraq, having attended events with UK war veterans.

On Mr Trump's insistence that the US saved Europe from the Nazis, Mr Wilkie said: “I could make a very sublime set of remarks that it was the British Empire on its last legs that saved Western civilisation until the New World woke up.”

After criticism over allegation Nato troops ‘stayed off front lines' in conflict, US president says UK forces were ‘great and very brave'

Donald Trump has said UK soldiers who fought in Afghanistan were “among the greatest of all warriors” after previously drawing criticism for his claims Nato troops stayed away from the frontlines during the conflict.

In a post on social media on Saturday, the US president said: “The great and very brave soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America.

“In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors.

“It's a bond too strong to ever be broken. The UK military, with tremendous heart and soul, is second to none (except for the USA).

“We love you all, and always will!”

It came a day after Trump was criticised for his remarks that Nato allied troops “stayed a little off the frontlines” in Afghanistan.

Keir Starmer raised the comments directly with the US president in a conversation on Saturday, No 10 said.

A Downing Street spokesperson said:

“The prime minister spoke to the president of the United States, Donald Trump, this afternoon.

“The prime minister raised the brave and heroic British and American soldiers who fought side by side in Afghanistan, many of whom never returned home. We must never forget their sacrifice, he said.

“As Ukraine approaches the fourth year of war since Russia's full-scale invasion, the leaders agreed on the need to see progress towards a sustainable ceasefire. Whilst diplomatic efforts continue, the prime minister reiterated that international partners must continue to support Ukraine in its defence against Putin's barbaric attacks.

“The leaders also discussed the need for bolstered security in the Arctic, and the prime minister said it was an absolute priority for his government.

“The leaders discussed the importance of the UK-US relationship, which continues to stand the test of time.

“They agreed to speak soon.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Pentagon has been sending U.S. military assets into the Middle East this week, including an aircraft carrier group and its thousands of troops, as President Donald Trump indicates he is maintaining the possibility of strikes on Iran amid its crackdown on protests.

“We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won't have to use it,” Trump told reporters Thursday, saying they were going “just in case.”

Trump has threatened military action if Iran carried out mass executions of prisoners or killed peaceful demonstrators, but he recently backed away, claiming Iran halted the hangings of 800 detained protesters. He has not elaborated on the source of the claim, which Iran's top prosecutor called “completely false.” 

However, Trump appears to be keeping his options open, saying Thursday aboard Air Force One that his threatened military action would make last year's U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites “look like peanuts” if the government proceeded with planned executions of some protesters.

The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and three accompanying destroyers left the South China Sea and began heading west earlier this week, a Navy official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military movements, said Friday that the Lincoln strike group was in the Indian Ocean.

When they arrive in the region, those warships would join three littoral combat ships, which were in port in Bahrain on Friday, as well as two other U.S. Navy destroyers, which were at sea in the Persian Gulf.

The arrival of the carrier strike group would bring roughly 5,700 additional service members. The U.S. has several bases in the Middle East, including Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which hosts thousands of American troops and is the forward headquarters for U.S. Central Command.

Moving in the aircraft carrier comes after the Trump administration had shifted some resources from the region to the Caribbean Sea as part of a pressure campaign on former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

The world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, was ordered in October to sail from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean along with several destroyers. The carrier USS Nimitz, which helped conduct the June strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, also departed the region in October.

Central Command said on social media that the Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle now has a presence in the Mideast, noting the fighter jet “enhances combat readiness and promotes regional security and stability.”

Similarly, the U.K. Ministry of Defence said Thursday that it deployed its Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar “in a defensive capacity.”

Analysts of flight-tracking data have noticed dozens of U.S. military cargo planes also heading to the region.

The activity is similar to last year when the U.S. moved in air defence hardware, like a Patriot missile system, in anticipation of an Iranian counterattack following the bombing of three key nuclear sites. Iran launched over a dozen missiles at Al Udeid Air Base days after the strikes.

Iran has been gripped since late December by nationwide protests and demonstrations that were sparked by the Islamic Republic's ailing economy. They have been putting new pressure on the theocracy that runs Iran and which has, in turn, responded with a deadly crackdown and shutting down the internet.

Activists say the overall death toll from the crackdown rose to at least 5,032 people, with more than 27,600 detained in a widening arrest campaign. The official Iranian death toll is far lower – only 3,117 dead.

Iranian officials signalled last week that suspects detained in the protests would face fast trials and executions while also promising a “decisive response” if the U.S. or Israel intervened.

This still photo taken from video and provided by the FBI shows Ryan Wedding being taken off a plane at Ontario International Airport in Ontario, Calif. on Friday.

The circumstances of former Canadian Olympic snowboarder turned alleged cocaine kingpin Ryan Wedding's arrest and swiftness of his transport from Mexico to the U.S. are raising concerns about the handover, which appears to have sidestepped the norms that have typically dictated such cross-border operations.

Top law enforcement officials from Canada and the United States stood shoulder-to-shoulder in California on Friday morning, to announce the capture of Mr. Wedding in Mexico the previous evening.

By Friday evening, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation released a video of Mr. Wedding, handcuffed and surrounded by officers, stepping off a plane in California. 

A more conventional process was followed in Canada in November, when the RCMP, at the behest of the U.S. Department of Justice, arrested eight Canadians facing charges in the U.S. in connection to their alleged ties to Mr. Wedding. The accused are now awaiting extradition hearings in Canada, which could be long and complicated, experts have said.

Former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding has been arrested in Mexico on multiple charges of drug trafficking and murder, authorities announced on Friday (Jan 23). Wedding was among the FBI's most-wanted fugitives,

The Associated Press

U.S. authorities declined to comment Friday about the circumstances of Mr. Wedding's quick transport out of Mexico. 

But Robert Currie, a professor of law at Dalhousie University in Halifax warned about the implications of apparently disregarding extradition proceedings. 

“There is a due process problem when we sacrifice extradition just because the alleged offender is supposed to be very dangerous,” Prof. Currie said. “If you start down that slope there will always be reasons we shouldn't follow ordinary procedures.” 

He added that if lawful processes are being devalued by the U.S. and Mexico, it could devalue extradition treaties elsewhere – including Canada. 

Who are the Canadians facing charges connected to Ryan Wedding?

Early last year, Mr. Wedding's alleged No. 2, Canadian Andrew Clark, was similarly transported quickly to the U.S. after his arrest in Mexico, in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's demands that Mexico crack down on cartels.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has followed a policy of appeasing Mr. Trump in hopes of avoiding tariffs with dozens of handovers of suspected cartel leaders for U.S. prosecution.

Mr. Trump has further threatened to pull the U.S. out of its free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada, which is up for renegotiation this year, and fears over this prospect is particularly acute in Mexico, where an end to free trade could throw millions out of work.

Despite this pressure, Ms. Sheinbaum has drawn a red line with the U.S. over violations of Mexico's territorial integrity, including by asserting her country's right to lead its own law enforcement operations. She has repeatedly said “sovereignty is non-negotiable” – and reiterated the message this month after Mr. Trump renewed threats to send U.S. troops into Mexico to fight drug cartels.

A timeline of Ryan Wedding's shift from Olympic snowboarder to alleged drug kingpin and his arrest

Ms. Sheinbaum's government also opposed Mr. Trump's FBI-led operation in Venezuela this month to capture former president Nicolás Maduro. “The government of Mexico energetically condemns and rejects the military actions recently executed unilaterally by the U.S.'s armed forces,” a statement from the Mexican foreign ministry read.

On Friday, U.S. FBI director Kash Patel said the arrest of Mr. Wedding happened in Mexico City on Thursday night, but he could say nothing more due to “operational sensitivities.” In his remarks, Mr. Patel repeatedly thanked the rigour of an FBI Hostage Rescue Team, a unit which has a taken on a dual role in covert counterterrorism missions. 

“Our FBI HRT teams executed with precision, discipline and total professionalism alongside our Mexican partners to bring Ryan James Wedding back to face justice,” Mr. Patel said. 

Ryan Wedding, a former Canadian Olympic snowboarder suspected of becoming a cocaine smuggling kingpin, has been arrested in Mexico, FBI Director Kash Patel said on Friday in Ontario, California.

Mexican officials did not answer questions about the FBI operation, saying instead that Mr. Wedding voluntarily surrendered at the U.S. embassy in Mexico City. 

Ms. Sheinbaum's office circulated a press release from U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson, published several hours after Mr. Patel's news conference, pointing out that the Spanish version of the U.S. government release used the same “voluntary surrender” language as the Mexican government.

The English version said Mr. Wedding's surrender happened after “pressure applied by Mexican and U.S. law enforcement.”

Ms. Sheinbaum's office did not respond to a question about what specifically U.S. and Mexican police did to secure Mr. Wedding's surrender.

Berlin promises to take down bad cyber actors and a new report prompts questions of whether police should carry Tasers to keep them from having to use guns in self-defense. Follow DW here for the latest.

Here are some of the biggest news headlines from Germany from Saturday, January 24:

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius on Saturday joined other NATO partners in pushing back against US President Donald Trump's renewed insults over the sacrifice made by US allies who came to America's aid to fight in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001.

Trump has repeatedly slighted NATO contributions as well as suggesting they could not be counted upon. Pistorius pushed back hard in an interview published in the tabloid Bild on Saturday.

""Our Bundeswehr was ready when our US allies asked for support after the Islamist terrorist attack in 2001,"" he said. 

Germany and other US NATO allies rushed to the US' side when Washington — for the first and only time in NATO's history — invoked Article 5 of the military alliance's treaty, meaning that all must come to the aid of an ally who has been attacked.

Pistorius pointed out that German soldiers had ""fulfilled their mission under the greatest danger to life and limb and under extreme conditions,"" during a 19-year mission.

He also underscored the sacrifice made by Germany. 

""Fifty-nine soldiers and three police officers lost their lives in combat, attacks or accidents. Numerous wounded soldiers still suffer from injuries sustained during this time. We will honor the dedication and courage of our soldiers in Afghanistan. No matter who questions that. They will never be forgotten.""

Leaders throughout the alliance have recoiled at Trump's comments, with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling them, ""frankly appalling.""

Agents from Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office arrested a 36-year-old Lebanese man on Friday with authorities accusing him of having procured live ammunition presumably intended for use in attacks on Israeli or Jewish institutions in Germany and Europe.

Germany's Federal Public Prosecutor's Office made the announcement on Saturday.
Authorities suspect the man of being a member of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which was behind the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Hamas is designated as a terrorist group in Germany as well as several other countries.

German authorities say he was arrested at Berlin's BER Airport on Friday evening upon arrival from the Lebanese capital Beirut.

Investigators say the man is believed to have purchased around 300 rounds of live ammunition for the group.

The 36-year-old is scheduled to appear before the investigating judge at the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe on Saturday.

Friday's arrest is the latest in a string across Europe, after three Hamas members were apprehended during a weapons exchange in the German capital in October, as well as suspects being detained upon entry to the Czech Republic and the UK.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on Saturday criticized the European Union Parliament's decision to seek legal review of the EU-Mercosur free-trade agreement as a ""very serious political mistake.""

Wadephul told German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk Radio that the Wednesday vote — the narrow passage of which was made possible by support from Germany's Green and AfD parties — was ""a major setback.""

Wadephul said the referral could cause ""a significant delay that will harm political trust,"" as other countries with pending trade deals — like India — watch to see if the EU is even capable of passing and implementing such treaties.

The EU-Mercosur trade deal with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay had been in the works for a quarter century before it was approved by the EU on January 9, signed by all parties on January 17, and then halted for review by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on January 21. 

Supporters of the deal say it is necessary for EU security in the face of aggressive and punitive US tariff policy.

European farmers, however, have been among the loudest opponents of the deal, which would involve reducing trade and tariff barriers on goods and services and create one of the largest free-trade zones in the world, covering some 700 million people.

In remarks published in Germany's Tagesspiegel newspaper on Saturday, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said the central bank is the target of relentless cyberattacks. 

""We see 5,000 attacks per minute on our IT systems alone,"" Nagel said, adding that in light of the fact that this comes out to more than two-and-a-half-billion attacks annually, the institution is in a ""never ending race.""

Nagel says the bank has implemented numerous security measures — including stringent employee background checks, secure IT systems, and business continuity management plans — to protect the institution from cyber criminals.

Nagel's remarks came at the same time Federal Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt vowed that Germany would become much more aggressive in fighting cyber crime.

""We will strike back, including abroad,"" Dobrindt told Germany's Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. ""We will disrupt attackers and destroy their infrastructure.""  

Dobrindt said the threshold for action would be set low and that counterstrikes would be carried out jointly by the intelligence services and the Federal Criminal Police Office.

The Interior Ministry intends to set up a new hybrid-threat defense center to improve coordination. Germany's domestic intelligence service is preparing the unit, which is due to start work later this year.

Dobrindt said Germany's institutions, infrastructure and companies are under constant threat of cyber attack, adding, ""We cannot accept that.""

German police shot and killed 17 individuals in 2025 according to statistics published by the Institute for Civil Rights & Public Safety at Humboldt University in Berlin.

The figure was lower than 2024, when a record 25 police killings were logged, yet well above decades-long averages.

The high number, published on the institute's online magazine Civil Rights & Police, has amplified calls for police to be equipped with Tasers in order to provide a non-lethal option for them in threatening situations.

Although special forces units in all 16 German states carry Tasers, not all local and state police do. Several states are looking to pass laws to change that.

GdP Police Union Chairman Jochen Kopelke used the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg as a case example in arguing for the implementation of Tasers. The state registered seven police-related fatal shootings in 2025, predominantly by state and local police with no access to Tasers.  

""Where no or only limited 'non-lethal' means of intervention can be used, firearms are the only proportionate means,"" said Kopelke. ""Where Tasers are more readily available to the police, the use of service weapons is reduced.""

This past October, lawmakers in Germany's Bundestag passed a legislative amendment to expand the list of equipment provided to federal police officers beyond their standard issue of truncheons and service pistols to include ""distance electric pulse devices"" that can deliver electric shocks from a short distanceand usually incapacitate a person.

Guten Tag from the Bonn newsroom, where the sun is shining and the air is crisp. After a whirlwind week of international news, we will start the day here by looking at a shifting cybersecurity posture, police violence statistics, and the tabling of the Mercosur free-trade agreement.

Cybersecurity is a topic being widely discussed here this weekend, with the president of the central bank as well as the federal interior minister addressing the relentlessness of attacks on institutions and a government pivot to more aggressive responses to such crime.

A high number of fatalities as the result of police firearm use in 2025 has amplified calls to give cops access to non-lethal means of intervention and self-defense. Police say Baden-Württemberg, where special forces carry Tasers and state police don't, serves as a case study for the difference they can make.

And as the world digests the ongoing shake-up of global alliances, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has unleashed criticism of the EU Parliament's vote to seek a legal review of the massive EU-Mercosur trade agreement that looked likely to become a reality after 25 years of negotiations. Wadephul called the move a ""very serious political mistake.""

            Newly unsealed court documents show the Trump administration did not have evidence that Tufts University PhD student Rümeysa Öztürk was supporting terrorist activity when she was arrested and her visa was revoked, and the action was taken because of an opinion article she wrote that contained criticisms of Israel.
    


            The documents, related to legal cases of students whose visas were revoked by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and who were threatened with deportation last year, also show the administration found it difficult to find evidence to support the revocation of Öztürk's visa.
    


            In most of the cases, including that of student activist Mahmoud Khalil, the documents show the administration made its recommendations to revoke visas based on the students' involvement in protests criticizing Israel's war in Gaza, despite arguments from the administration of antisemitism and support for terrorism. The administration also acknowledged it would likely face scrutiny in court given the protections granted by the First Amendment.
    


            The New York Times was first to report on the unsealed documents.
    


            Last March, Rubio posted on X that they “will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.”
    


            That same month, Öztürk was detained by a plain-clothed police officer outside her home. The administration sought to deport her after revoking her student visa.
    


            The Tufts PhD student had written an opinion piece, along with three other students, criticizing the university's response to student activists who demanded that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.
    


            A State Department memo said Öztürk's visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions “‘may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization' including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”
    


            DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told CNN at the time that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) investigations had found that Öztürk had “engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans.”
    


            However, in a State Department memorandum released as part of the tranche of documents, a department official wrote that DHS, ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) had not found that Öztürk had “engaged in any antisemitic activity or made any public statements indicating support for a terrorist organization or antisemitism generally.”
    


            The memo, prepared for the acting head of the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, which handles visas, cited the opinion piece co-authored by Öztürk.
    


            “DHS did not identify any alternative grounds of removability that would be applicable to Öztürk, including the ground of removability for aliens who have provided material support to foreign terrorist organization or terrorist activity,” the State Department official wrote.
    


            “Although information provided by DHS/ICE/HSI does not establish any potential ineligibility for Öztürk,” the official recommended her visa be revoked “based on the totality of the circumstances.”
    


            The Trump administration was ordered last May to release Öztürk, with the judge saying that “continued detention potentially chills the speech of the millions and millions of individuals in this country who are not citizens.”
    


            A State Department spokesperson said Friday that “the Trump administration is using every tool available to get terrorist-supporting aliens out of our country. A visa is a privilege, not a right. We abide by all applicable laws to ensure the United States does not harbor aliens who pose a threat to our national security.”
    


            McLaughlin on Friday defended her initial statement and claimed the opinion piece “recycled Hamas (talking points) and propaganda.”
    


            “She makes a false genocide claim and effectively advocates for the end of Israel,” McLaughlin argued.

Tennis star Naomi Osaka withdrew from the Australian Open ahead of her third round match due to a left abdominal injury, ending her pursuit of her third title at the Grand Slam. 

Osaka, who previously won the Australian Open in 2019 and 2021, took to social media to announce her decision. She did not immediately provide details on the nature of her injury.

""I've had to make the difficult decision to withdraw to address something my body needs attention for after my last match,"" her statement posted to Instagram read. ""I was so excited to keep going and this run meant the most to me, so having to stop here breaks my heart but I can't risk doing any further damage so I can get back on the court.""

In a statement later provided by the tournament, Osaka said it was a left abdominal. 

""It's an injury I've had a couple of times before, and I thought I could push through it,"" the 28-year-old tennis pro said. ""I played my last match with some pain, and I thought maybe if I gave myself a break before my match today, I would be able to handle it. But I warmed up, and it got a lot worse.""

Osaka added that her body ""changed quite a lot"" after giving birth to her daughter, Shai, in 2023. During that time, she took a 15-month break away from competition before returning in 2024.

""I'm just grateful to be otherwise very healthy,"" she said, ""and I hope that I'm able to play some good tennis for the rest of the year.""

Although cut short, Osaka's time at the Australian Open was highlighted by her fashion choices and a tense interaction with opponent Sorana Cirstea in the second round.

Cirstea appeared to take issue with Osaka's attempts to motivate herself between points, prompting the four-time Grand Slam champion to make a quip about Cirstea after her 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 victory.

""Apparently a lot of 'c'mons' that she was angry about, but whatever,"" Osaka said during an on-court interview. ""I mean, I tried to play well, I tried my best. She's a great player. I think this was her last Australian Open, so, OK, sorry she was mad about it.""

Osaka later apologized, stating she doesn't ""like disrespecting people. That's not what I do.""

In addition to her two Australian Open titles, Osaka won the U.S. Open in 2018 and 2020.

New York City's food delivery workers could see a bump in tips after a new law takes effect on Monday.

Starting January 26, food delivery apps, including DoorDash and Uber Eats, will have to display for customers the option to tip a courier when they pay under city law. It comes roughly two years after some companies moved the tipping option to after an order is delivered.

The law is the latest example of the debate over when and where tipping should be expected. It's a particularly important topic for delivery workers, many of whom rely on tips to make the job financially worthwhile.

Under New York City's new law, the apps will also have to set the default gratuity to 10% at checkout.

""It's not difficult for them to do it, they used to do it, they have the tech to do it immediately,"" Elizabeth Wagoner at the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection told Business Insider in an interview.

Wagoner, a deputy commissioner at the DCWP, said the department will enforce the new law by monitoring to ensure apps comply with it and pursuing legal action if they don't. Protections for delivery workers, including the tip law and enforcing an existing minimum pay law, have been a focus for the department since Mayor Zohran Mamdani took office on January 1.

Under the new law, customers will still have the final say on how much to tip — or whether to tip at all. But research suggests it matters if customers see the option to tip earlier.

The DCWP estimated earlier this month that delivery workers in the city have missed out on $550 million in tips since December 2023 as a result of companies moving the tipping option to after delivery.

The department expects to see an increase in delivery workers' tips once the apps resume offering the option at checkout, Wagoner said.

Tips are a major source of gig worker earnings on apps like DoorDash and Uber Eats. Nationally, tips accounted for almost 49% of food delivery workers' earnings in 2025, according to Gridwise, a data analytics company.

In a lawsuit that DoorDash and Uber filed last month to block the law, the companies said that mandating a tipping option at checkout would lead to ""tipping fatigue"" among customers. On Friday, a federal judge rejected the companies' suit.

""Allowing this law to take effect means we will likely see an immediate drop off in orders for New York's small businesses, a worse experience for customers, and fewer overall deliveries for New York City dashers,"" a DoorDash spokesperson told Business Insider after the court decision. DoorDash did not directly respond to questions about its concern that orders would decrease as a result of the law.

An Uber spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

In late 2023, about a month before DoorDash removed the option to tip at checkout in New York City, it warned some customers that their orders might take longer to arrive if they didn't tip in advance.

Ricky, who makes deliveries for Uber Eats and DoorDash in Brooklyn, said he's looking forward to the law taking effect after receiving fewer tips since the apps removed the option to tip at checkout.

He knows other delivery workers who work for Grubhub, a delivery service that has continued to prompt customers to tip at checkout in New York City. While a good day for him on Uber Eats involves making just over $100, Ricky said, some of the Grubhub workers make double that, thanks in large part to gratuities from customers.

""When they show me their earnings, they make a significant amount of tips,"" he said.

Ricky said he's hoping for a similar bump in earnings after the city's tip law takes effect on Monday. ""That would give me the motivation to stay outside and work all day,"" he said.

With fewer tips over the past two years, many delivery workers in New York City have had to take extra orders to cover their costs, such as the cost of an e-bike to make deliveries, said Ligia Guallpa, executive director of the Workers Justice Project and cofounder of Los Deliveristas Unidos, two advocacy groups for delivery workers.

""Often, tipping allows them to have the additional income that they need to cover the additional operating costs,"" she said.

Ukraine and Russia ended a second day of U.S.-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi on Saturday without a deal. Future meetings were mooted after overnight Russian airstrikes that knocked out power for over a million Ukrainians amid subzero winter cold.

Statements following the talks did not indicate that any agreements had been reached, but both Moscow and Kyiv said they were open to further dialogue.

""The central focus of the discussions was the possible parameters for ending the war,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X after the meeting.

""As a result of the meetings held over these days, all sides agreed to report back in their capitals on each aspect of the negotiations and to coordinate further steps with their leaders,"" he said, adding that further meetings could take place as early as next week.

A UAE government spokesperson said there was face-to-face engagement between Ukraine and Russia - rare in the almost four-year-old war triggered by a full-scale Russian invasion — and tackled ""outstanding elements"" of Washington's peace framework.

A spokesperson for Ukraine's lead negotiator, Rustem Umerov, told reporters just before 5 p.m. Abu Dhabi time (1300 GMT) that the discussions had concluded.

The bombardment of Ukraine's capital Kyiv and its second largest city Kharkiv by hundreds of Russian drones and missiles prompted Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha — who was not at the talks — to accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of acting ""cynically.""

""This barbaric attack once again proves that Putin's place is not at (U.S. President Donald Trump's) Board of Peace, but in the dock of the special tribunal,"" Sybiha wrote on X.

""His missiles hit not only our people, but also the negotiation table.""

Saturday was scheduled to be the final day of the talks, billed by Zelenskyy as the first trilateral meeting under the U.S.-mediated peace process.

The UAE statement said the talks were conducted in a ""constructive and positive atmosphere.

""(They) included direct engagement between Russian and Ukrainian representatives on outstanding elements of the U.S.-proposed peace framework, as well as confidence-building measures aimed at supporting progress toward a comprehensive agreement,"" it added.

Kyiv is under mounting Trump administration pressure to make concessions to reach a deal to end Europe's deadliest and most destructive conflict since World War Two.

Zelenskyy had said on Friday that it was too early to draw conclusions from the first day of meetings in Abu Dhabi, and he had urged Russia to show it was ready for peace.

U.S. peace envoy Steve Witkoff said at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week that a lot of progress had been made in the talks and only one sticking point remained. However, Russian officials have sounded more skeptical.

After Saturday's talks, Zelenskyy said the U.S. delegation had raised the issue of ""potential formats for formalising the parameters for ending the war, as well as the security conditions required to achieve this.""

Ahead of the discussions, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday Russia had not dropped its insistence on Ukraine yielding all of its eastern area of Donbas, the industrial heartland grouping the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Putin's demand that Ukraine surrender the 20% it still holds of Donetsk — about 5,000 sq km (1,900 sq miles) — has proven a major stumbling block to any deal. Most countries recognise Donetsk as part of Ukraine. Putin says Donetsk is part of Russia's ""historical lands.""

Zelenskyy has ruled out giving up territory that Russia has not been able to capture in four years of grinding, attritional warfare against a much smaller foe. Polls show little appetite among Ukrainians for any territorial concessions.

Russia says it wants a diplomatic solution but will keep working to achieve its goals by military means as long as a negotiated solution remains elusive.

Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, said late on Friday that the first day of talks had addressed parameters for ending the war and the ""further logic of the negotiation process.""

Meanwhile, Ukraine came under renewed Russian bombardment.

Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 375 drones and 21 missiles in the overnight salvo, which once again targeted energy infrastructure, knocking out power and heat for large parts of Kyiv, the capital. At least one person was killed and over 30 were injured.

Before Saturday's bombardment, Kyiv had already endured two mass overnight attacks since the New Year that cutelectricity and heating to hundreds of residential buildings. Ukraine's deputy prime minister said on Saturday that 800,000 people in Kyiv - where temperatures were around -10 degrees Celsius - had been left without power after the latest Russian assault.

Zelenskyy said on Saturday Russia's heavy overnight strikes showed that agreements on further air defence support made with Trump in Davos this week must be ""fully implemented.""

Stock Market Value: ~$3.16B ($53.08 per share) 

Ownership: 2.02% 

Average Cost: n/a 

Activist Commentary: Engaged Capital was founded by Glenn Welling, a former principal and managing director at Relational Investors. Engaged is an experienced and successful small-cap investor and makes investments with a two-to-five-year investment horizon. Its style is holding management and boards accountable behind closed doors. Engaged has an average return of 20.56% versus 17.83% for the Russell 2000. Of the firm's 39 past activist campaigns, nine of them have been at companies in the information technology sector.

On Oct. 30, 2025, Engaged sent a letter calling on the BlackLine's board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP SE. Nearly a month later, Engaged issued a so-called 220 Demand letter requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election to BlackLine's board at the 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former senior vice president at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology-focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.

BlackLine provides financial accounting solutions delivered primarily as Software as a Service (SaaS). This is a very prototypical enterprise software business, characterized by high gross margins (80%) and sticky offerings that are essential for large enterprises. Its largest of these clients is SAP SE, with whom BlackLine has a strategic partnership that contributes approximately 30% of the company's revenue. Historically, the business was focused on growth, and rightfully so, as it was compounding revenue at over 20% annually for many years, and the stock price grew along with that success. By the end of 2020 BlackLine was trading around $133, and Marc Huffman, who led the company through the global pandemic, was promoted from president to CEO, replacing founder Therese Tucker who took on the role of executive chair of the board. However, post Covid, growth began to decelerate, margins did not come up meaningfully to compensate, and the stock fell accordingly, trading as low as roughly $61 in December 2022.

BlackLine was rumored to have been thrown a life raft in 2022, when Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm known for taking positions in select technology companies as a prelude to an acquisition offer, took a roughly 9% public position in BlackLine. There was also speculation that this development piqued the interest of SAP. This seemed like perfect timing: BlackLine's hyper growth had severely slowed and multiples in the space were as high as ever. It is hard to know what type of discussions go on in a boardroom, but an acquisition never happened. In March 2023, Huffman was replaced when Tucker returned to the company in a co-CEO structure with former Deloitte consultant Owen Ryan (until October 2025 when he was made sole CEO). Since Tucker's return, growth has continued to decline to high single digits and while margins have improved modestly, the company's stock is down another 24%. Despite all of this, history repeated itself when it was recently reported that SAP made an offer to acquire BlackLine in June, this time for $66 per share, an over 30% premium to the 60-day trading average at the time. At the time, the company's growth rate was also much lower than it was in 2022, and industry multiples have compressed significantly. BlackLine, despite creating no value in public markets over the last several years, reportedly rejected the approach.

This refusal is what prompted Engaged Capital to send a letter calling on the BlackLine board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP. Engaged is not advocating for a sale of the company at any price, nor does the board have a legal duty to engage every acquisition offer. But conscientious shareholders certainly have the right to question how a board addresses a potential material transaction, particularly when they feel the board is not acting in the best interest of shareholders. Activist investors like Engaged do not view this as a right but an obligation. So, Engaged is asking the board to evaluate the SAP offer and weigh it against any other offers and on a risk-adjusted basis against a standalone path. This request is reasonable under almost any circumstances, but even more so when the potential acquirer is the company's most important business relationship. While SAP may be the most logical partner, and likely the one ultimately willing to pay the biggest premium (estimated to be in the mid-70s). Given their existing strategic partnership, BlackLine meets the profile of an ideal fit for private equity. With stable reoccurring revenue and modest growth, the value here is all in the margins, and PE firms have consistently demonstrated their ability to build software businesses with 20% EBITDA margins, like BlackLine, and expand them upwards of 40% once private, such as Vista/Blackstone at Smartsheet and Francisco Partners/TPG at New Relic. Notably, Clearlake Capital continues to own a 9.6% position in BlackLine. The firm has taken similar positions in companies like Cornerstone OnDemand, which it acquired in 2021, and Blackbaud, which rejected Clearlake's takeout offer in March 2023 and then again in 2024.

A lot has happened since Engaged first presented this thesis last October. Shortly thereafter, BlackLine disclosed that it has maintained an independent strategic committee of the board for more than a year, with members including David Henshall, who is serving as chairperson, Greg Hughes and Tom Unterman. Notably, Henshall has a history of getting companies sold as a director, including New Relic when it was engaged by Engaged. Following this announcement, Engaged issued a 220 Demand letter to the company requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Engaged expressed concerns about the disclosures around the company's strategic committee, noting that BlackLine only recently revealed the committee's existence and has still not disclosed key information around it, including when it was formed, its purpose, the scope, its authority and whether it has retained advisors. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former SVP at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology -focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.

When assessing Engaged's chances of success in a proxy fight, there are several dynamics to consider. First, in late December, Unterman announced that he will not stand for re-election as a member of the board at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting. His impending departure creates both a board vacancy in a seat up for election in 2026, so at worst for Engaged, it will be running its slate of four against three incumbents and a new nominee. Second, Engaged will likely get the support of Clearlake (9.6%), one of the company's largest shareholders. Third, there are signs of shareholder discontent, as CEO Ryan received over 20% withhold votes last time he was up for election. Finally, and most significant, one of the four directors up for election is founder Therese Tucker. If she sees the smallest sign of being ousted from the company she founded, it could lead to a quick settlement or a sale of the company. BlackLine added two new directors in June and July of 2025, which the company will undoubtedly argue is evidence of good corporate governance and board refreshment. However, these directors are in the class up for re-election in 2027, and good corporate governance would dictate that they are voted on in the 2026 election so not to be on the board for two years without shareholder approval. This is something we used to see more of and certainly will not see amid a proxy fight. Finally, it is important to note that one of the directors up for election this year is Scott Davidson who was appointed to the board last year as part of the Scalar Gauge settlement. By targeting him, Engaged cannot necessarily rely on Scalar Gauge's support, but that firm only owns a 1.15% stake.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

This asset has utility and a few other useful features.

Ethereum (ETH 0.94%) is pretty much never the cheapest, nor the fastest, nor the smoothest blockchain to use. Still, some long-term investors prefer owning it to other cryptocurrencies, because they're buying an asset with exposure to a critically important platform within the crypto ecosystem more than they are depending on any single feature of that platform to deliver a return.

So if you care about what can still be relevant in crypto in five or 10 years, Ethereum's mix of steady economic activity on-chain, ongoing tech upgrades, and high degree of traditional finance access are hard to ignore as a package. Let's dive in and look at these factors a bit more.

Ethereum is far and away the most established general-purpose smart contract chain, and that status is the most important reason why it's valuable. Decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, meaning on-chain lending, trading, and collateral management, concentrate where the most liquidity and integrations already exist, which, in the crypto sector, effectively means that every dollar that flows in has good odds of settling on Ethereum either temporarily or permanently.

One metric to watch on this front is DeFi total value locked (TVL), which corresponds to the dollar value of assets deposited into DeFi apps. Ethereum leads all other chains on TVL today, with $69.4 billion in TVL, and there is no reason to expect that to change anytime soon, as for a long time the chain's name was effectively synonymous with DeFi.

Ethereum is also constantly being upgraded to offer better features and higher efficiency to users and app developers. Recently, the chain has experienced a pace of two major updates per year, which is considerably more than most of its peers.

Ethereum's supply is not capped like Bitcoin (BTC 1.13%), but it's not trying to be Bitcoin with extra features either. Under its proof-of-stake (PoS) design, the network's validators lock up their coins to secure the network and earn a reward; that reward is provided by issuing new Ether and adding to the supply. And, during transactions, which incur gas fees, a portion of the fees are burned, removing them from circulation permanently.

Importantly, Ethereum's ongoing fee burn can and often does exceed its ongoing issuance, so its circulating supply can shrink during busier periods. That makes the coin a store of value, even if its supply isn't anywhere near as scarce as Bitcoin's is -- and being a store of value with as much utility as Ethereum is another big reason why many long-term investors prefer to hold it.

Finally, the coin now has a handful of different institutional on-ramps, which helps to attract and retain institutional capital. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are nothing new at this point, but they do help to increase the asset's legitimacy and make it more appealing to those who have a more conservative temperament when investing.

There's no other crypto asset that's precisely as appealing as Ethereum. That doesn't mean you should buy it if you aren't quite tolerant of risk, but if you want to hold any crypto beyond Bitcoin, you should probably hold at least some Ethereum.

Blockchain innovation is leaving hype behind and rewarding projects that deliver real impact. ZKP crypto is turning heads in this shift. As a Layer-1 blockchain, it combines zero-knowledge proof technology with hands-on network participation, letting computation stay private yet verifiable. Its working Proof Pods are already contributing to the network, showing progress that goes beyond words. 

This practical approach has earned the Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) project a spot in conversations about the best crypto presales. Developers, investors, and Web3 enthusiasts are noticing its momentum. By merging privacy, computation, and participation into a single ecosystem, ZKP is shaping itself as a foundation for decentralized applications, privacy-first networks, and the next wave of blockchain projects that actually deliver on their promise.

While many blockchain projects chase faster transactions or purely financial use cases, ZKP crypto takes a different route. It's building infrastructure first, aiming to power a network that's as functional as it is innovative. As a Layer-1 blockchain, ZKP doesn't just support smart contracts and decentralized apps; it weaves zero-knowledge proofs into its very core. 

This means computations can be verified without exposing sensitive information, opening the door for AI tasks, enterprise operations, and other data-sensitive applications. By focusing on real, usable technology instead of fleeting trends, ZKP has become a standout name in discussions of the best crypto presales, appealing to developers, investors, and Web3 pioneers looking for projects with lasting impact.

One of ZKP's most standout features is its physical hardware, Proof Pods; compact devices that plug directly into the ZKP network and perform verifiable compute. Unlike passive staking or mining, each Pod actively validates AI tasks, generates zero-knowledge proofs, and contributes to the network's privacy-first, decentralized infrastructure.

Every Proof Pod starts at Level 1, earning roughly $1 in ZKP per day based on the previous day's presale auction price. Users can upgrade their Pods up to Level 300, with each upgrade costing $100. Each upgrade not only raises the Pod by one level but also grants $100 worth of ZKP coins, so participants increase their earning potential while receiving immediate rewards. A Level 50 Pod, for example, earns approximately $50 in ZKP daily, while Level 300 Pods reach up to $300 daily, all tied to the dynamic presale auction price.



Proof Pods provide full visibility into performance, showing task history, uptime, and ZKP rewards in real time. By turning participation into tangible contributions, ZKP has created a system where every plugged-in Pod strengthens the network and demonstrates why the project is recognized among the best crypto presales.

ZKP's presale auction model stands out as one of the best crypto presales for its fairness, transparency, and price discovery. Every 24 hours, a new presale auction window opens, offering 200 million ZKP tokens (soon dropping to 190 million in Phase II). The price of tokens remains constant throughout each window, determined by the previous day's presale auction results. This gives participants a chance to observe the presale auction's progress, decide if they want to contribute, and strategize their participation based on demand.

To ensure that whales don't dominate, ZKP places a daily contribution cap of $50K, making the presale auction accessible to a broader audience and leveling the playing field. At the end of each presale auction window, participants receive their share of tokens, calculated based on their contribution percentage.

All activity happens on-chain, providing full transparency. Tokens that are not auctioned off are burned permanently, ensuring that only tokens actively purchased by the community remain in circulation. By offering a transparent, accessible, and fair model, ZKP is creating a more democratic presale auction experience for all participants.

Beyond its presale auction and hardware components, ZKP is building an ecosystem designed for developers. The network supports modern execution environments, enabling the deployment of smart contracts and decentralized applications that can leverage zero-knowledge proofs natively.



This makes ZKP particularly appealing to crypto-native developers exploring privacy-focused applications, as well as to Web3 projects seeking scalable and secure compute solutions. The combination of developer readiness and privacy-first architecture reinforces ZKP's placement among the best crypto presales for long-term ecosystem growth.

In an evolving market where credibility and execution matter more than ever, ZKP crypto stands out for aligning technology, participation, and accessibility. With Proof Pods already contributing to the network and a live presale auction welcoming global participation, ZKP represents a modern approach to launching blockchain infrastructure.

As discussions around privacy-preserving computation and decentralized AI accelerate, ZKP's role as a foundational Layer-1 blockchain continues to gain visibility. For those tracking innovation-driven opportunities, ZKP's presence among the best crypto presales reflects its growing relevance in the next phase of Web3 development.

Children who show ADHD traits at age 10 are more likely to experience physical health problems and health-related disability by age 46, according to a study led by researchers at University College London (UCL) and the University of Liverpool.

The researchers say the results likely reflect a broad mix of health risks associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), along with the long-term effects of how people with ADHD are treated and supported across adulthood.

Published in JAMA Network Open, the research is one of the largest and longest-running studies to examine how ADHD traits in childhood are linked to physical health later in life.

Evidence Points to Lifelong Health Challenges

Senior author Professor Joshua Stott (UCL Psychology & Language Sciences) said: ""Here we have added to the concerning evidence base that people with ADHD are more likely to experience worse health than average across their lifespan.

""People with ADHD can thrive with the right support, but this is often lacking, both due to a shortage of tailored support services but also because ADHD remains underdiagnosed, particularly in people in midlife and older, with needs unaddressed.""

How ADHD Can Affect Daily Functioning

People with ADHD experience differences in attention, along with increased levels of hyperactivity or impulsivity. Many have high energy and can focus intensely on activities that capture their interest, but may struggle to stay focused on routine or less engaging tasks.

These challenges can affect planning, time management, and impulse control. Over time, this may make school and work more difficult, increasing the risk of longer-term social and occupational difficulties.

ADHD begins in childhood, and although it is now widely recognized that it often continues into adulthood, adults in the UK receive less treatment than those in other high-income countries. Support services also remain limited.

Tracking Health Outcomes Over Decades

To examine long-term effects, the researchers analyzed data from 10,930 participants in the UCL-led 1970 British Cohort Study, which has followed individuals from birth into middle age.

ADHD traits were assessed using behavior questionnaires completed by parents and teachers when participants were 10 years old. These measures were used regardless of whether a participant had ever received a formal ADHD diagnosis.

Higher Rates of Chronic Illness and Disability

The study found that people with higher levels of ADHD traits in childhood were more likely to report physical health problems by age 46. They had 14% higher odds of reporting two or more conditions, including migraine, back problems, cancer, epilepsy or diabetes.

Among those with elevated ADHD traits at age 10, 42% reported having at least two physical health problems in midlife. By comparison, 37% of those with lower ADHD trait scores reported the same.

Participants with higher childhood ADHD traits were also more likely to report physical health-related disability (reporting having problems with work or other daily activities as a result of their physical health) at age 46.

Possible Reasons Behind the Health Differences

The researchers found that poorer physical health outcomes were partly linked to higher rates of mental health problems, increased BMI, and higher smoking rates among people with ADHD.

Previous studies have also shown that people with ADHD are more likely to experience stressful life events and social exclusion, and are less likely to receive timely medical screening and care.

The association between childhood ADHD traits and physical health-related disability appeared to be stronger in women than in men.

Professor Stott added: ""All of these potential explanatory factors align with the fact that ADHD makes impulse control more difficult, the need for instant gratification and reward more intense, and is also associated with worse mental health in part due to the social disadvantage people with ADHD face.""

Implications for Support and Public Health

A separate study published last year by the same research team reported a possible reduction in life expectancy among adults diagnosed with ADHD, although this finding was not part of the current research.

Lead author Dr, Amber John, who began the work at UCL before moving to the University of Liverpool, emphasized the importance of proper support: ""It's important to note that people with ADHD are a diverse group, with a range of different strengths and experiences, and most will lead long, healthy lives.

""However, many face significant barriers to timely diagnosis and appropriate support. This is important because providing the right support for and meeting the needs of people with ADHD can help to improve their physical and mental health outcomes.

""Additionally, public health strategies should consider the needs of people with ADHD, such as by making screening programs and ongoing health monitoring more accessible for people with ADHD.""

Cordless portable blenders weren't really a thing a decade ago, or maybe even three years ago. But battery tech keeps getting better. This means the best portable blender I've tested, the Ninja Blast Max ($100), is now fully able to make a six-pack of crushed-ice margaritas at your next picnic or blend up a berry-filled protein shake at the gym without breaking much of a sweat. Meanwhile, the ingeniously designed Nutribullet Flip ($115) offers more torque than previous-generation blenders, plus enough insulation to keep ice frozen until it's time for lunch (or even dinner).

Does this not jibe with your past experience with cordless blenders? Reader, I agree. It's a young technology, and most past (and current!) cordless blenders are a disappointment, especially compared to the best blenders that plug into the wall—which are often as much as a hundred times more powerful. But I found that our two top cordless blenders were far superior to the rest, after testing eight of the most promising contenders for battery life, ice crushing, smoothie and milkshake consistency, and all-round blender vortexing.

That said, it's worth considering whether you actually need a cordless blender for blending on the go—or just a small personal blender that performs much better and whose blending chamber can transform magically into a drinking cup to go. WIRED has been testing personal blenders for years, and our top pick, the Nutribullet Ultra ($164), just might be the high-powered, sippy-cup, office-bound solution of your dreams.

Ninja

Ninja

The Blast Max is a titan in the pipsqueak-powered world of cordless blenders, each one the pitiful “before” in a Charles Atlas comic. In part, this is the result of sheer power, when power is measured in tens and not hundreds of watts. The Ninja's 13.3-volt battery helped make it the most powerful I tested, helped along by a proprietary charger instead of the USB-C cable favored by most cordless blenders.

The Max can make protein shakes, of course: Pretty much all of these cordless blenders can. But the cordless Ninja is also good at plowing through almond butter without jamming up. And it's the only portable blender I tested that was able to crush ice without a running start. Indeed, it can turn cubed ice into fluffy snow without any ungainly chunks, a feat that no other cordless blender even came close to achieving. If you add tequila and a little margarita mixer and take the thing to a picnic, the results are even more satisfying.

It still takes up to three hours to charge, alas. But the Blast Max can blend for anywhere from seven to 10 drinks on a single charge, depending on how much blending is needed—enough to reliably make an octet of blended cocktails or smoothies. The trio of blender settings also sets the Blast Max apart, from an efficacious ice crush setting to an AI setting that adjusts power according to the resistance of the various ingredients.

My colleague Adrienne So has told me that the Ninja Blast Max's predecessor, the max-less Ninja Blast, was a life-changing addition to her morning rituals when it arrived in the doldrums of 2023. The specs on the new Max mean it may change lives nearly twice as much.

Nutribullet

Amazon

Portable blenders have a very simple problem: Ice. Ice is what provides a lot of the satisfying texture that makes smoothies fun. But if you're going somewhere without power, you're probably also going somewhere without a freezer. This Nutribullet Flip, quite cleverly, solves this problem by using the same double-walled vacuum technology that keeps your coffee hot and your water cold in your favorite travel mug.

Filled halfway with ice and only ice, the Nutribullet Flip was able to keep most of its ice intact after eight hours, in my testing. Adding a liquid complicates matters, of course, unless the liquid already happens to be ice-cold. But as long as most of the constituents in the blender are chilled, you have a pretty good chance of making it to lunch with some ice cubes still intact.

That's not the only ingenious design element in the Flip. Most portable blenders require that you unscrew the vessel from the blender before adding a drinkable lid, requiring you to keep track of extra parts and potentially causing spills if you forget to flip the thing appropriately as you unscrew it. (You may think you won't do this, until you do so anyway and are sad.) The Flip avoids this problem entirely by adding a little hinged drinking spout to the blending base: When you flip the blender over, it's an adult sippy cup.

The Flip, with its 11-volt battery, is more powerful than the previous generation of cordless blenders but still less powerful than our top-pick Blast Max. This means it's more likely to bog down on ice if you load ingredients in the wrong order. Since the insulated blending jug is opaque, this'll also require that you remember to load ice into the blending jug first before adding softer ingredients and flipping it over. But the thermal insulation may still make the Flip the most useful portable blender for those who want to blend a fresh smoothie at work or on the go.

Nutribullet

Amazon

It's quite possible that you never needed a portable blender in the first place. Ask yourself an important question: Did you actually need to blend your smoothie somewhere other than at home? Or did you just want the convenience of a small blender whose chamber doubles as a portable drinking cup that you can take with you out the door?

It's possible a personal blender might suit your needs better than a lower-wattage portable one. Most cordless blenders top out at double-digit watts. WIRED's top-pick personal blender, the 1200-watt Nutribullet Ultra, is stylish, smartly designed, compact, and convenient—and it will make fast mince of ice, frozen fruits, and every manner of nut butter as long as you make sure you have the prerequisite amount of liquid in your blending jug. It has a particular ability to make beautifully smooth-textured hummus, a feat you will achieve with precisely zero cordless blenders. It'll mess up some leafy greens. It'll make a mean pesto.

Whatever smoothie or protein shake concoction you desire, you can just pop off the blending jug, slap a sippable lid on it and jet to the car. Brilliant. That said, though it's quite compact and convenient at home, you probably won't cart this thing around on an airplane or hiking trip. It's more portable in the car-trunk sense.

How We Test and Choose Blenders

In general, I use some of the same tests for portable blenders as in our guide to other blenders. I test the blender's ability to crush ice, and to make smoothies laden with protein powders and nut butters and frozen produce. I make frozen cocktails (in this case margaritas) to test usefulness at picnics. And I float baby carrots in water to see if the blender can generate a sufficient vortex to suck down and blend the baby carrots.

In all cases, I check the consistency and character of smoothies and shakes and frozen drinks: Is there pulp and water, or is it a pleasantly uniform texture? Is the blended ice sufficiently broken up, or are there chunks?

For cordless smoothies, I also test the charge time and the battery life. This means charging each blender from dead, to see how long it takes to reach full battery life. And it means blending until the battery is dead again, to see how many smoothies I could likely make before running out of power.

I also assess ease of use: Some portable blenders require you to keep track of lids and other accessories. Some don't. Some come with a charging block. Some require you to have one.

How Much Power Do Cordless Blenders Have?

Makers of blenders that plug ito the wall love to brag about how powerful their blenders are. After all, the power comes from your wall socket, so it's pretty easy to get up to 900 or 1,200 watts. Makers of portable blenders tend to be more circumspect, because the numbers are much a smaller. Cordless blenders tend to have the same Lithium-ion battery technology, and the same theoretical max power, of your average cordless beard trimmer—and wattages an order of magnitude smaller than corded blenders.

In general, the lower power of these small blenders means they don't have quite as much torque, and are less able to do useful things like crush ice and create a powerful blender vortex. Thus, most cordless blenders require in their instructions that you add a sufficient quantity liquid to the bottom of the blending jug to help create a blending vortex to mix up ingredients. Most also ask that you layer softer ingredients on the bottom and frozen ingredients on the top, so that the blades can get sufficiently revved up before being called upon to shred a frozen carrot.

Beast Cordless Go for $114: The Beast Cordless Go is probably the closest runner-up to the Ninja Blast Max in power and capability—and it maybe even had the edge in achieving a consistent, satisfying texture for fruit smoothies. But the Beast didn't crush ice nearly as well as the Blast Max. And its wider, straight-walled blending chamber was more likely to bog down or spin uselessly, requiring you to stop, shake, and start again. This then uses up more battery power and cuts the number of drinks you can expect to make with it.

Ninja Blast for $55: Ninja's previous-generation portable blender, which charges via USB-C, is still on the market and eminently affordable, and its blending vessel and lid are dishwasher-safe. It's also tiny enough to earn a permanent home on WIRED editor Adrienne So's counter before its blade gave up after two years. But charge capacity is nowhere near as good as the next-generation Blast Max, and neither is the blending power.

Nutribullet Flex for $70: This Nutribullet has fun colors and a few convenient features, namely the ability to detach the blending jug from the base without incident. But the 7-volt battery just doesn't quite have the necessary capacity or power to blend, and it has a tendency to just give up when faced with ice.

Nutribullet Portable Blender for $55: The base model of Nutribullet's portable blender is economically priced, but faces the same problems as the Flex: Its 7-volt battery just kinda doesn't have (or keep) enough power, and can bog down against ice.

Dash Personal Charging Blender for $40: Dash makes a habit out of creating surprisingly useful, somewhat cute appliances that cost far less than you'd expect. But while the $40 price is nice, the blender's tiny blade isn't overly useful for crushing ice or making a blender vortex, and the cordless blender base doesn't hold much of a charge.

Blendjet 2 Bundle for $60: Leaving aside a somewhat troubling recall of nearly 5 million BlendJet blenders sold between 2020 and 2023 that could potentially overheat and catch fire, my colleague Boutayna Chokrane's experience with underpowered, undersized BlendJet blenders left her suspicious of the entire category of portable blenders.

Food carts are a staple of New York City dining, dispensing everything from dosa and doner kebabs to dogs and dim sum in short order. But no matter how enticing the aroma of a cart's food, the smelly gas generators that keep the lights on threaten to put customers off their meals.

Cart owners and customers may not have to suck on fumes much longer. A Brooklyn-based startup is testing the use of its e-bike batteries to power food carts, starting with La Chona Mexican on the corner of 30th and Broadway in Manhattan.

“This really started out as a lark last summer,” David Hammer, co-founder and CEO of PopWheels, told TechCrunch. “I'm an ex-Googler from the early days, and this felt like a classic, old-school 20% project.”

Normally, PopWheels battery packs are zipping around the city strapped to food delivery bikes. The team soon realized that connecting them to food carts was an avenue worth pursuing.

“Are e-bike packs the perfect energy type to be powering food carts? Maybe, maybe not,” Hammer said. “I would argue it doesn't matter. What matters is, can you solve distribution and charging?”

PopWheels currently operates 30 charging cabinets around Manhattan, which serve gig workers riding e-bikes, most of whom use either Arrow or Whizz models. That's resulted in a “de facto  decentralized fleet,” Hammer said, allowing the company to stock just a few different types of batteries to serve hundreds of customers.

Many delivery workers ride into Manhattan from the farther reaches of the city. It's a trip that can burn a significant portion of their charge, and many workers need two batteries to get through a full day. In response, bodegas started offering e-bike charging services, for which delivery workers typically pay $100 per month. When factoring in battery wear and tear, the total cost nears $2,000 per year, Hammer said.

“We can make the economics work so that we're actually saving them money right off the bat,” he said. PopWheels charges customers $75 per month for unlimited access to its network, and Hammer said the company has a long waitlist.

The startup's charging cabinets can hold 16 batteries, and PopWheels designed them to swiftly extinguish a battery fire should anything go awry during charging. (The company's founding mission was to stamp out e-bike fires in New York City, which became a significant problem few years ago.) After building some initial cabinets, the company raised a $2.3 million seed round last year 2025.

Swap sites are typically small open spaces like parking lots, which PopWheels has retrofit with fences and the necessary electrical connections to support several cabinets. Each cabinet draws about as much electricity as a Level 2 electric vehicle charger, which is to say not that much.

As PopWheels e-bike service grew, the startup began studying other opportunities. 

“There was always a little bit of an underlying thesis that there's something bigger here,” Hammer said. “If you build urban-scale, fire-safe battery swapping infrastructure, you're creating an infrastructure layer that lots of people are going to want to get on board with.”

Hammer started to think about alternative uses for the batteries after someone sent an article about how New York City was working to decarbonize food carts. That's when the PopWheels team started running the numbers.

Food carts, Hammer estimates, probably spend around $10 a day on gas for their generators to keep the lights on. (Most of the cooking is done via propane, which is a separate matter.) That's about how much PopWheels would charge someone to subscribe to four of its batteries per day. Conveniently, four of its batteries can supply about five kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is enough to cover the low end of what a typical cart might draw. If they need more juice, Hammer said they can run to a swap station midday.

After realizing the math penciled out, PopWheels built a prototype adapter and trialed it at a small event at the Brooklyn Navy Yard at last year's New York Climate Week. Since then, the startup has been working with the the non-profit Street Vendor Project to move the idea forward. Last week's demonstration with La Chona was the first time the batteries powered a food cart for a full day. 

“I had multiple food cart owners come up to me and say, ‘Wait, there's no noise with this cart. What are you guys doing? Can I get this?'” Hammer said.

Basically identical performance, and potential cost savings.

AMD announced its new Ryzen 7 9850X3D chip at CES 2026, showcasing a 7% performance uplift over the iconic Ryzen 7 9800X3D, one of the best CPUs. What the company didn't show in that presentation is that you don't necessarily need high-speed DDR5 RAM to achieve those gains. In a marketing slide for the CPU obtained by Videocardz, the company says there's only a 1% difference in FPS between DDR5-4800 and DDR5-5600.

This has been true for X3D chips since the beginning because they leverage the extensive on-die L3 cache, which allows the CPU to access RAM less frequently. Managing latency is key in gaming workloads, so the L3 cache is preferred over system memory in most cases. Since the cache is shared across units of the same SKU, it becomes the bottleneck rather than the RAM you have.

When we reviewed AMD's first 3D V-Cache processor, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, we also measured a 1% difference between DDR4-3200 and DDR4-3800. We've documented the same findings over the last couple of generations of X3D chips, including the Ryzen 7 7800X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D. So, it's great to see the legacy carried forward with the newest entrant in the X3D lineup, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D. The leaked AMD slide compares five games, including Cyberpunk 2077, but the most significant gap was seen in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 at just 1.6%, while Red Dead Redemption 2 showed essentially no gains at 0.2%.

On average, there's a less than 1% difference in FPS, and the company even includes current pricing for 32GB kits at the bottom. According to AMD, the average price for a DDR5-4800 kit is $400, while the DDR5-6000 kit can run you up to $470. Both of those are very generous estimates, as we were able to find a 32GB DDR5-6000 kit for ""just"" $325.99 on Amazon, though it's CL36. A similarly spec'd CL30 kit is $354 on Newegg.

Given the AI boom and its consequences on the industry, it makes sense for the Red Team to market this point. The chipmaker has never explicitly mentioned it before, but we did in our 9800X3D review when it came out. So, if you have bone-stock DDR5 lying around without EXPO or XMP, the X3D chips will give you the same glorious performance as someone with an overclocked kit.

From a physiological perspective, heartbeats and breathing do not operate independently in the human body. Cardiac rhythm varies with the respiratory cycle, and the close interaction between the two is known as cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC). CPC reflects the regulatory state of the autonomic nervous system and serves as an important physiological indicator for evaluating sleep quality, cardiovascular health, and stress levels.

For decades, however, cardiopulmonary coupling has been assessed almost exclusively using electrocardiogram electrodes, respiratory belts, or other contact-based sensors. While effective, these devices can compromise comfort and limit their use in home environments, long-term monitoring, and applications involving sensitive populations such as infants or post-operative patients.

In a study published in Intelligent Sports and Health, a research team led by Professor Rencheng Song at Hefei University of Technology presents a new solution: measuring cardiopulmonary coupling using only a standard video camera.

Our bodies undergo extremely subtle surface changes with every breath and heartbeat, and cameras are capable of capturing this information. This makes it possible to assess cardiopulmonary health under completely non-contact conditions.""

Professor Rencheng Song, senior author of the study 

The researchers developed an intelligent video-analysis framework that first automatically identifies facial and torso regions in video recordings. ""From these regions, optical signals associated with blood flow variations-reflecting cardiac activity-and chest and abdominal motion-reflecting respiration-are synchronously extracted,"" says Song.

Through multi-region signal fusion and high-resolution time–frequency analysis, the method further improves signal stability and enhances the characterization of dynamic physiological changes. Experimental results showed that under different physiological conditions, including normal breathing and simulated apnea, the video-based approach produced cardiopulmonary coupling measurements that were highly consistent with those obtained using conventional contact-based devices.

Principal investigator Yi Qun Gao, noted that the work extends the application boundaries of non-contact physiological monitoring. ""For a long time, cardiopulmonary coupling monitoring has depended mainly on medical equipment or wearable sensors. Our study demonstrates that remote video devices also have the potential to enable CPC assessment,"" he says.

The team highlighted that the approach is particularly well suited to scenarios requiring long-term, comfortable monitoring, such as in-home sleep health screening or remote post-operative rehabilitation. ""In the future, such technology may even be integrated into smartphones or smart cameras, making health monitoring as natural as a video call,"" adds Gao.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","By staying in the NWSL, USWNT's Trinity Rodman became the world's highest-paid women's soccer star","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/trinity-rodman-highest-paid-female-soccer-player-nswl-uswnt-spirit/bltb49cdadcfdb64283","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:02:34 GMT","

Trinity Rodman became the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world by staying in the NWSL. GOAL breaks down what that decision means - and the challenges that came with it.

On Thursday night at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles, U.S. Women's National Team star Trinity Rodman put pen to paper on a deal that will go down as one of the most significant contracts in women's sports. Rodman signed a new agreement with the Washington Spirit that is notable not only for its price tag - though the numbers are historic - but for what it represents: progress, friction, and a clear investment in the future of the women's game.

The three-year deal will see Rodman earn upwards of $2 million annually, plus bonuses, according to ESPN. In doing so, she becomes the highest-paid player in National Women's Soccer League history and the highest-paid female soccer player in the world.

That outcome was not straightforward. An earlier four-year agreement between Rodman and the Spirit was initially vetoed by the league after annual figures exceeded $1 million, forcing both sides back to the negotiating table. With that context - and with a deal this consequential - there is plenty to unpack. In the spirit of the Spirit and a contract that signals a shifting landscape, GOAL breaks down the pros and cons of Rodman's latest groundbreaking move.

For the NWSL, keeping a player like Rodman matters - and the league ultimately did just that. At a moment when elite American talent has increasingly looked overseas, Rodman's decision to remain with the Washington Spirit through 2028 represents a meaningful statement about the league's present and future.

That outcome was not without its hurdles. When Rodman's previous contract neared expiration, NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman was asked how the league planned to retain a player of her stature. Berman responded - and reiterated - that the league would “fight for her.” Yet when the Spirit and Rodman agreed to a four-year deal reportedly valued at more than $1 million annually, the league vetoed the contract, citing concerns over structure and precedent.

What followed was a rare and public standoff. The NWSL Players Association filed a grievance against the league, calling the veto a “flagrant violation” of Rodman's free agency rights. The dispute ultimately pushed the league toward structural change, resulting in the introduction of the High Impact Player rule - a new mechanism that allows teams to spend beyond the salary cap on select players who meet specific criteria.

That rule, however, remains contested. The NWSLPA is seeking its immediate rescission, arguing that both the rule itself and its rollout violate the Collective Bargaining Agreement and federal labor law.

Still, amid the ongoing legal questions, Rodman's deal was finalized. And for the NWSL, the significance goes well beyond the contract. Rodman is not only one of the most talented players in the league - she is one of its most magnetic. Her ability to draw fans, inspire young players to be unapologetically themselves, and elevate the entertainment value of the league sets her apart.

At a time when stars like Naomi Girma, Alyssa Thompson, and Sam Coffey have departed for Europe, keeping Rodman at home marks a shift in narrative. Her presence lifts the entire league, not just the Spirit. She brings attention, goals, and moments that remind audiences why the NWSL remains one of the most compelling leagues in the world.

There has been no clear indication that the High Impact Player rule was used in Rodman's signing, leaving some ambiguity around how - or if - the mechanism was applied. Shortly before Rodman finalized her deal with the Spirit, expansion side Denver Summit signed USWNT captain Lindsey Heaps from OL Lyonnes, a move that could have marked the first use of the HIP rule. The NWSL Players Association filed a grievance shortly thereafter.

One of the primary critiques of the HIP rule centers on its criteria, which are based on national team minutes and evaluations from select media members. The subject has raised broader questions about how the rule could influence decision-making at the international level.

When USWNT head coach Emma Hayes was asked about the rule - and whether it could impact her lineup choices - on the Unfiltered podcast, she was candid in her response.

“The first thing I would say to the players is, look, that's not my call. That's been designed by somebody else, and you have to take that up with someone else,” Hayes said. “My job is to pick the very best team for the U.S. Women's National Team, regardless of status, contracts, or wherever you are.

“It's not the right position to put me, or any coach, in,” she added. “I will just make sure that I do what I always do and pick the very best available team.”

The Spirit have appeared in back-to-back NWSL championship games, they have Michele Kang as the owner, they have a fan base that electrifies Audi Field, and now, they have Rodman for three more years. 

The Spirit continue to lead the charge as not only a team to beat, but be the standard for the NWSL. Their uniforms are bold, but their play is bolder; think Leicy Santos and Croix Bethune in the midfield, and Rodman and Gift Monday up top. They have the defensive unit led by Tara Rudd and the goal protected by Aubrey Kingsbury. Their ownership group also includes NBA legend Magic Johnson as a minority owner. 

Retaining a player like Rodman in the league is one thing, but her wanting to stay with the Spirit and continue her career in the DMV is another. 

""I've made the DMV my home and the Spirit my family, and I knew this was where I wanted to enter the next chapter of my career,"" Rodman in a press release. ""I'm proud of what we've built since my rookie season, and I'm excited about where this club is headed. We're chasing championships and raising the standard, and I can't wait to keep doing that with my teammates and the best fans in the NWSL.""

Rodman is reportedly making upwards of $2 million per year with the Spirit, under her new contract. As that stands, she's the highest-paid player in the NWSL, but also the world. If she signed a deal overseas would it have been more lucrative? It is a fair question to raise. 

When the whispering of interest overseas came to the forefront, her agent, Mike Senkowski, said, ""We worked really hard to put together an agreement that we felt complied with the CBA and would keep Trinity in the league for the foreseeable future... With no certain way to get her fair market value within the NWSL, naturally, that forces you and encourages you to look elsewhere."" 

Rodman reportedly received multiple offers from clubs in England, none of which were restricted by a salary cap. Still, there is no higher designation than becoming the highest-paid female soccer player in the world - and Rodman has now reached it.

""Trinity is an inspiration to young girls across America. She is a player they can relate to, and those young fans matter more than anything to her,"" Senkowski said on Thursday. 

""The decision to continue to play here represents a very clear vision for the future of women's soccer. She set a new standard for the sport and will ultimately drive the continued growth and success of the league and its players. I'm so proud of her.""

Rodman's decision to remain in the NWSL is not only a landmark moment for her career, but one that helps set the tone for what is possible for others. When she signed the deal on Thursday, Rodman was joined by her biggest fan - a young girl named Emma, wearing long pink braids - a small but powerful reminder of the impact she has beyond the field.

That influence on the next generation is already clear. But by signing a deal of this magnitude, Rodman is also helping open the door for players across the NWSL - and beyond it - to envision a future where staying home does not mean settling for less.

""Not only me personally but all of us at the Spirit are profoundly grateful that she has chosen to stay with us for another three years despite some very compelling alternatives she had,"" Kang said at the press conference on Thursday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

A French politician has questioned whether the United States should be allowed to host the FIFA World Cup following renewed controversy surrounding Donald Trump's political positions and foreign policy rhetoric.

The comments add to a growing international debate about whether global sporting events should be insulated from geopolitical tensions.

Speaking amid renewed criticism of Donald Trump's conduct on the international stage, French politician Eric Coquerel raised concerns about staging the World Cup in the United States.

“Seriously, one imagines going to play the World Cup in a country who attacks its ‘neighbours,' threatens to invade Greenland and rides roughshod over international law,” Coquerel said.

Coquerel's remarks came as part of a broader European reaction to comments and positions associated with Trump, which have reignited debate about the political environment surrounding the 2026 FIFA World Cup, set to be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

Donald Trump's connection to Greenland dates back to his first presidency, when he publicly confirmed interest in the United States purchasing the Danish territory in 2019. The proposal was rejected by Denmark, which reiterated that Greenland is not for sale.

Since then, Greenland has remained a subject of political discussion due to its strategic importance in the Arctic, where the United States already maintains a military presence at Pituffik Space Base under long-standing agreements with Denmark.

There is no evidence of any formal plan by the United States to invade or seize Greenland. However, Trump has repeatedly spoken about expanding American influence and security interests in the region, rhetoric that critics argue undermines international norms and fuels diplomatic unease.

FIFA has so far shown no indication of revisiting the hosting arrangements for the 2026 World Cup, but comments from political figures across Europe suggest that the intersection of football and global politics will remain under close scrutiny in the years leading up to the tournament.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","When Djokovic wins the first set, it all adds up to big trouble for opponents","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-scorecards-record-after-winning-first-set","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 17:10:37 GMT","

During the Australian Open, ATPTour.com will bring fans insight into the leaders of key statistical categories, showing how performances throughout 2025 all added up to successful seasons and the promise of more good times ahead in 2026.

Novak Djokovic's 2025 season offered a masterclass in ruthless efficiency: when he wins the first set, he finishes the job.

Across the year, he posted a spotless 30-0 record in matches where he claimed the opening set, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. That consistency is a testament to focus, composure and match intelligence when under pressure, qualities that have been instrumental in Djokovic's storied career.

What makes the Serbian's 2025 performance when taking the first set even more impressive is that it's merely the latest chapter in a long-standing trend. In 2024, Djokovic went an astonishing 35-0 himself when winning the first set and, including his first three victories at the 2026 Australian Open, he has now won his past 87 matches when winning the opener. 

The last time he dropped a match after winning the first set was his epic five-set Wimbledon final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in 2023.

Novak Djokovic's record when winning the first set 2023-2025



 

Beyond the numbers, this streak reveals the core of Djokovic's ability: once he grabs the lead, his mental and physical rhythm stays locked in. In tight moments, when opponents try to claw back, he rarely falters, and his rock-solid baseline game is a huge part of why he has spent a record 428 weeks at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. It's the kind of longevity that is built on consistency, match after match, season after season.

Djokovic's record when winning the first set speaks to a champion who seizes the moment the instant he gets an edge. One who doesn't merely win sets, but locks in, executes and closes out until the job is done.

The two friends and Player's Box podcast co-hosts are working out the details of a bet on who will win their upcoming fourth-round scrimmage.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 24, 2026 copy_link

Published Jan 24, 2026

MELBOURNE, Australia—Madison Keys and Jessica Pegula aren't big on trash talk, but the good friends/Player's Box podcast co-hosts are trying to make the most of their upcoming Australian Open fourth-rounder.“She said she wants to have, like, whoever loses, like, the other person can come up with something,” Keys said of a burgeoning bet between herself and Pegula. “She wants to make me eat her disgusting apple pie with cheese on top of it if I lose, which I said I refuse, so she's going to have to think of something else.”The mention of cheddar apple pie effectively derailed the defending champion's press conference, members of the media eager to get to the bottom of this mysterious sweet-savory dessert.

“Yeah, it's gross,” Keys said in full stand-up mode, having comfortably dismissed former world No. 1 Karolina Pliskova to reach the second week. “We were doing this Thanksgiving podcast. We were talking about what's your favorite foods, your favorite desserts, whatever.“Jess was like, ‘Yeah, it so good. You take apple pie. You put a piece of cheddar cheese on top of it, and then you, cheddar, yellow cheddar'—exactly!—'Then you microwave it and then eat it.'“She tried to make it sound like it was the most normal thing ever, and we were all just disgusted. She tried to double down and said, ‘No, it's amazing.'”Keys didn't mention what her punishment would be for Pegula, whom she's beaten in their last two meetings, but was happy to continue lightly roasting her friendly rival to round out her post-match press conference.“I definitely made it worse in my head, because I was envisioning, like, a Kraft Singles gross, square piece of cheese. She's like, ‘No, you use a good piece of cheddar.' Doesn't make it better!”

If we film tomorrow, we can kind of, yeah, market that it was, like, us recording before we had to play each other.”Pegula and Keys launched *The Player's Box* last summer alongside Krawczyk and Jennifer Brady, the Americans celebrating their first full season of podding with Coco Gauff serving as their first guest.“We're trying to grow it this year, have more gas, kind of base it around depending on where we are, events in the world, things going on,” Pegula outlined during her Media Day interview. “So, I think that will be really exciting. We're excited.”Even while the pair will aim to have fun, Keys clarified she won't play games on the court.“I've never tried to make a person laugh mid-match. I think that's probably the last thing that I'm trying to do on the court.”

Why does F1 have regulations?

First look at Ferrari's 2026 car

Flavio Briatore has stated that Alpine have no reason to not perform well in 2026.

Flavio Briatore has outlined his high expectations for Alpine in 2026, explaining that ""this year is not for excuses"" after they discounted last season in order to capitalise on the new regulations.

After a strong multi-year run of consistent midfield results, 2025 was a gruelling year for the team as they dropped to last place in the Teams' Championship, earning just 22 points at the hands of Pierre Gasly while Franco Colapinto failed to score.

Briatore, who previously guided the squad to numerous titles under the Renault name, returned in 2024 as Executive Advisor and now covers the duties of a Team Principal alongside Managing Director Steve Nielsen, with the pair targeting a much improved season.

Asked at the A526 launch what he expects from the unchanged driver line-up, the Italian answered: “This is a difficult question, but I expect the best. You know, this year is not for excuses anymore. We have a brand new car and we have the same drivers.

“I promise Franco had a very good winter and I hope he gets much better results and he's ready to compete with Pierre. We need two drivers competing. We need the performance of the driver.”

Alpine's 2026 car was revealed in style onboard a cruise ship, marking what Briatore labelled “a new chapter” for the team after they dedicated the bulk of their resources to making their challenger the best it can possibly be.

Like the other 10 teams, they will have to adjust to the new regulations, but the Enstone outfit will face the added challenge of a different power unit as they become a Mercedes customer team.

Briatore appeared confident that, despite the widespread changes, Alpine are ready to compete at a high level once again, saying: “I promise everybody that this season will be fantastic. Before the first race, everybody's world champion. After we go to Australia, we see where we are.

“It's very difficult to see where we are. We need to see what happens in the first race, but we believe we are competitive. We have been working very well and our technical people have done a super job. Alpine has really come back in performance this year.”

Netflix's much-hyped Skyscraper Live won't be going live tonight from Taiwan's capital due to Mother Nature.


	“Due to weather, we are unable to proceed with today's SkyscraperLIVE event,” a spokesperson for the streamer said with just 30 minutes to go before the whole ascend up the Taipei 101 was set to start. “It has been rescheduled for Saturday, January 24 at 8 PM ET | 5 PM PT. Safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding.”


	“We will follow up later today with updated timing on press opportunities for tomorrow,” Netflix added, with digital fingers likely crossed. Fortunately for the company, the immediate reaction on social media was pretty positive and supportive of the delay and Netflix's safety first attitude. 

	











	Also fortunately for Netflix, the forecast for tomorrow (which will be Sunday in Taiwan) is “partly sunny and pleasant,” according to weather services. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	With a 10-second delay built in just in case the worst happens, the latest live event from the increasingly sporty streamer has been pitched in many ways as a mash-up spectacle. With a bit of Philippe Petit's 1974 high-wire walk between the Twin Towers, Evel Knieval's entire career, and Honnold's own free solo climb of El Capitan in the Oscar winning 2018 documentary of the same name, the whole affair is very much on brand for Netflix as the Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters-run business goes for big tent unscripted one-offs. 


	Still, for all the planning and hype, things were already looking a little dicey for Skyscraper Live just a few days ago with the Heavens opening up over Taipei – as Free Solo star Honnold made clear: 

Rest day stroll in rain – very scenic views of Taipei though a little bit wet right now. Getting over my jet lag and feeling pretty good. Getting psyched! pic.twitter.com/zHn7LnPKNd


	Of course, this being high-minded Hollywood, there was, and still is, a timely FU accompanying Honnold's climb today, intentional or not. 


	As Netflix fends off another attempt by David Ellison's Paramount to gobble up Warner Bros Discovery, the streamer's Taipei event would have one day before the much-marketed UFC launch on Paramount+. Labeled with a $7.7 billion payout from Ellison in one of his first big moves after taking over the studio, the debut of Dana White's Octagon ran the rare risk of being overshadowed by Honnold's death defying endeavor.

	











	Now, the stakes are even (pardon the pun) higher as Skyscraper Live and UFC from Sin City will go almost head-to-head tomorrow. 


	Ranked as the tallest building in the world for about five years after its 2004 opening, Taipei 101 is now not even in the Top 10. Coming in at Number 11 today, the 1,667 ft tall Tower is dwarfed by Dubai's 2,722 ft high Burj Khalifa – which has been in the top spot since just after it opened in 2010.


	Beyond the horrors of a fall by Honnold during the two-hour climb, the other challenge Netflix's faces out of Skyscraper Live is a widely-mocked technical glitch or crash from an overload of viewers. Beyond being painful to watch, the November 2024 fight between former champ Mike Tyson and Jake Paul suffered from a series of sound and streaming issues that sent many Netflix subscribers into a frenzy. 


	Then again, like the streamer's holiday NFL games, that Paul-won fisticuffs with Iron Mike scored a massive audience for Netflix …high or low, spectacle always sells.

After watching free solo I concluded the he may be the worlds greatest athlete.

Is he going to climb all the way to the top of the antenna on top of the building?

This is a terrible idea. The mountain faces he usually climbs have gritty surfaces and terrain allowing for traction of the feet and hands. A slick skyscraper with uniform surface and no texture is a far less forgiving surface. Not to mention more conducive to moisture and sweat from the palms which could cause him to lose grip. I hope I'm wrong but we could very well be about to witness something bad.

Apparently you are not aware that this climb is not nearly as dangerous as it seems at first glance. For one thing, there is a balcony every eight floors. At most points if Alex falls, he won't fall too far. Secondly, he has been training for free solos for 30 years. The chances of something going wrong are so extremely low that to me it will be a bit boring.

Stupid. I wish they stopped encouraging stunts like this.

Had no idea it was happening.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","‘Terrified' Nicole ‘Snooki' Polizzi breaks down in tears as she reveals ‘scary' cancer news","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/24/celebrity-news/nicole-snooki-polizzi-cries-reveals-scary-cancer-news/","Sat, 24 Jan 2026 15:28:00 GMT","

“Jersey Shore” staple Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi received terrifying news during a recent doctor's visit.

The reality TV personality took to TikTok on Wednesday to reveal she's been dealing with abnormal pap smear results and precancerous cells for about four years, leading her to undergo an “uncomfortable” colposcopy and biopsy.

“Results come back. Doctor calls me and he's like, ‘Not looking great.' He found cancerous cells on the top of my cervix,” she said, adding that she'll now need a cone biopsy under anesthesia for further testing.

Ladies we are in this together 🙏🏽 #colposcopy #conebiopsy #cervicalcancer 

“I'm terrified. It's scary, but we have to get it done because cervical cancer is nothing to joke about,” the 38-year-old continued. 

A teary-eyed Polizzi explained that if her second biopsy results come back abnormal she may need a hysterectomy.

“Obviously I'm done having kids but, as a woman, the thought of getting a hysterectomy is just sad and scary,” she said. 

“Getting the hysterectomy and then not being able to have kids, I think that's what's killing me.”

“But whatever to keep me healthy and safe to be here for my kids that I have now,” she added, referring to the three children she shares with husband Jionni LaValle — Lorenzo, 13, Giovanna, 11, and Angelo, 6.

Polizzi further said she's “scared and freaking out,” but hoping her video will help her connect with other women who have gone through similar situations. 

She also admitted that she delayed her routine exams out of fear and doesn't want others to make the same mistake. 

“The reason why my doctor's on my ass all the time is because I waited. I waited on my damn appointments because I knew I might not get great results but also because I didn't want to feel the pain. I didn't want to deal with the stress of having to deal with all of this,” she said.

“Just making this video to spread awareness to make sure you get your pap smears. And if your doctor calls you to do it again, do it. Make sure you're fine and prevent all the bad things that could happen, like cervical cancer.”

Polizzi finished by saying she's leaning on family and friends for support. 

“Being a woman is not easy and this is definitely a scary thing. I know I'm going to be fine. It's just scary.” 

“Ladies we are in this together 🙏🏽,” she added in her caption.

Following the conclusion of season 49 of “Survivor” at the end of 2025, all eyes swiftly turned to the upcoming 50th anniversary special. Featuring a cast made up of some of the very best players from “Survivor” history, an increased prize fund, and the return of the live finale, season 50 is set to be a landmark event in the reality television series.

For those who want to catch up on all of the previous seasons or just want to relive the moments that involve season 50's all-star cast of 24 players, there's now a way you can do just that.

Ahead of the season 50 premiere, streaming service Pluto TV is set to stream every single season of the show. The new dedicated 24/7 “Survivor” channel is set to stream each episode of the reality series in chronological order, starting with “Survivor: Borneo” and running all the way up to the season 49 finale. 

You don't have to tune in to the channel, though, to get your “Survivor” fix as every season will also be available to watch on demand up until the launch of season 50 on February 25.

The “Survivor” marathon is set to begin on January 24 at 5:15pm ET, and every season will be available on demand from that time for U.S. viewers. The seasons will be available to watch at no additional cost, with Pluto TV operating as a free, ad-supported service. 

Appropriately titled “Survivor 50: In the Hands of the Fans,” the upcoming season of the show has seen direct input from “Survivor” fans to determine many of the elements that will feature.

CBS gave fans the opportunity to vote for key gaming elements, including everything from where Hidden Immunity Idols would be hidden to which challenges would be included.

According to host Jeff Probst, votes from viewers would play an integral part in the upcoming season.

“They're going to decide what kind of new era [they] want to play in,” said Probst. “Do you want to go back to old school and give [castaways] supplies and rice? Do you want to get rid of lots of advantages and twists? Or do you want to go bursting into the future and say they don't get anything and bring all the game you got, folks?”

							By 

	David Fear



	“It's the end of an era,” Charli XCX said, standing in front of a sold out crowd Friday night at the Eccles Theater in Park City, Utah. The pop star-turned-actor had no less than three films set to play at Sundance — itself celebrating the end of an era, with this being film festival's final edition at its longtime home base in the ski-resort town. But this was the screening that everybody had been buzzing about all week, the hottest ticket to nab, the premiere that was causing a scene outside the fest's biggest venue.


	 Charli XCX was here to unveil The Moment, the mysterious A24 project she'd been teasing for the last year that had been described as a “tour mockumentary,” a “2024 period piece,” a month in the life of a world-conquering icon, and a horror movie. This dizzying look at pop stardom from inside the eye of the storm is all of those things, though creative collaborator and the film's director Aidan Zamiri put it best when he described The Moment as what might have happened if she'd made “entirely different choices” around the phenomenon known as “Brat Summer.” 












	You remember Brat Summer, right? It started with the release of Charli's sixth album Brat in June of 2024, which took her signature party-girl-going-hard-at-the-club style of hyperpop and parlayed it into a collection of songs brimming with head-nodding beats, hot namedrops, and the sort of hangover-fueled anxiety that hits you like the first rays of next-morning sunlight. It ended with the record cover's “puke green” color being inescapable, a killer concert tour, the most quotable political endorsements in ages, and Charli morphing into one of the hugest superstars on the planet. The word became synonymous with a certain type of empowering fuck-it attitude, with the British singer being its prime ambassador. People, products, presidential candidates — being called brat became the ultimate coronation of cool. If you had to ask if you were brat, you most assuredly were not brat.

	A lot of people approached Charli about filming a concert movie that following autumn, partially to chronicle the electric live show that she'd taken around the globe and partially to extend the Brat Summer phenomenon as long as possible. The musician had a different idea. As Zamiri told Variety, Charli's response to the idea of documenting her tour was “the opposite of what I've tried to do with ‘Brat'… [a concert film] feels like the expected route of capitalizing on something which has been successful, whereas the bigger swing would be to take a format like that and disrupt it.”


	If nothing else, The Moment most definitely does that. A collaboration between the pop star, Zamiri (who'd shot her videos for “360” and “Guess”), and his writing partner Bertie Brandes, this woozy take on what it was like to have been in the middle of it all kicks off with a montage that brings you right back to Brat Summer. Then it drops you in September of 2024, with Charli being told by her label head (Rosanna Arquette, doing a bang-up impersonation of a shark in human form) that this thing they've got here? It's minting money. Why just limit it to a summer? Let's make Brat Forever. “It's a bit cringe, isn't it?” Charli says, right after she's recorded some Brat-centric radio promos. “It's all cringe,” her assistant (Isaac Powell) says, before making her do another take.


	The solution to eternal brat-itude, in the eyes of the suits, is to bring in the hottest It director of the moment to capture it all on film. He's Johannes Godwin, a tall enfant terrible of cinema, and living proof that no contemporary working actor plays assholes better than Alexander Skarsgard. Neither Charli nor her creative director Celeste (Hailey Benton Gates) want to work with this passive-aggressive prick of an auteur, but they've been overruled by the powers that be. Johannes insists on sitting in on the rehearsals for the next leg of the tour. He “loves” everything they're doing. But as he's directing the concert film, Johannes has a suggestion about how they can “improve” the experience for the fans. One note turns into several. Which turns into a dozen changes. Which quickly becomes a complete redesign of everything from stage props — 100-foot long giant cigarettes! The word “BITC#” spelled out in lights! — to a whole new, “less vomity” shade of Brat green. Soon, Charli is less a participant in her tour, and her life in general, than a second-hand observer.

	During the postscreening Q&A, festival director Eugene Hernandez made a reference to someone describing The Moment as “This Is Spinal Brat.” And like everything that falls under the category of mockumentary, the shadow of the late, great Rob Reiner‘s gamechanging movie hangs over this faux-doc on the agony and XCX-stasy of being Charli. Zamiri also mentioned the influence of British comedy on the project, which is why Jamie Demetriou ends up being the stealth MVP; if you've seen Stath Lets Flats or any of the gajillion other things he's graced, then you can imagine what Demetriou does with the character of an incompetent tour manager. We'd argue that Larry David is an even bigger patron saint to Zamiri's pop-mythology puncturing here, given that so many scenes feel like improvisations between Charli and various lackeys, flunkies, executives, creative collaborators, control freaks, and fellow celebrities like Rachel Sennott and Kylie Jenner. All of these exchanges inevitably end in some sort of cringe-comedic stalemate. Brat Your Enthusiasm might be a superior alt-title.

	











The Moment starts off as a recognizable satire of everything that goes along with being the world's biggest pop star, from freaked-out selfie-demanding fans to parasitic hangers-on to money-grubbing industry types. “I've met different versions of all of the characters within this film,” Charli noted at the Q&A. “I've met [folks] who are rotting for you, riding for you even if you are an arsehole. I've met people who are in it to be close to the artist. I've met people who are like, ‘We totally get you!' — and they really don't… I've had a lot of practice reacting to those kinds of characters in my real life.” If anything, you wish the movie leaned in harder to the 360-degree ridiculousness of the world around the “360” superstar. It's hard to parody something that's already so over-the-top, yet you feel like this is just scratching the surface of the nonstop mayhem that's part of any world tour centered around a hedonistic yet sensitive pop star surrounded by industry sharks and suck-ups.

	What Zamiri and Charli have really cooked up, however, is a horror film about what would happen if your pop dreams — the ones you've spent a decade working to achieve — and the whole thing turns into a waking nightmare. It ends on what can only be described as a delirious, sweaty-palmed what-if scenario that doubles as an epic act of trolling. (You know how there may have been some beef between her and, say, another massive musical star with a successful tour? Let's just say shots get fired here.) More than anything, The Moment wants to put out one last word on the whole Brat phenomenon, or maybe a  stake through the whole thing's heart. Charli turned the term into a brand. Now she is ready to move on.


	“I'm really wanting Brat to stop, and actually sort of really pivot away from it as far away as possible,” Charli declared, with a slightly nervous giggle. “It's not because I don't love it. It's just that as artists, you wanna challenge yourself… totally switch the creative soup you're in, and live in a different bowl for a while.”

							By 

	Daniel Kreps



The Neptunes' Chad Hugo is once again suing his production partner Pharrell Williams, claiming he's owed $1 million from one of the duo's N.E.R.D. albums.


	Lawyers for Hugo filed the lawsuit Friday against Williams, alleging that there has been a “systematic denial” of Hugo's royalties and rights as a partner in the Neptunes and N.E.R.D., specifically when it comes to the duo's 2017 album No One Ever Really Dies.


	“Williams engaged in self-dealing, concealed material information, and … diverted revenues owed to plaintiff,” Hugo's attorney Brent J. Lehman wrote in the lawsuit (via Billboard). “Such willful, fraudulent, and malicious conduct warrants the imposition of punitive damages.”


	This isn't the first time Hugo has sued his now-former friend and production partner: In 2024, Hugo filed a lawsuit alleging that Williams had “fraudulently” tried to gain sole control over the trademarks tied to their production and songwriting work as the Neptunes, including registering three separate trademarks for the Neptunes without involving Hugo — an alleged violation of the duo's longstanding agreement to share everything equally. 

	











	As the Neptunes, Hugo and Williams produced and wrote some of the biggest hits of the 2000s, including Snoop Dogg's “Drop It Like It's Hot,” Gwen Stefani's “Hollaback Girl” and Justin Timberlake's “Rock Your Body,” in addition to their work as N.E.R.D. The Neptunes last produced songs together in 2022, the same year they were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

	However, following Hugo's 2024 lawsuit, Williams revealed in an interview that he was no longer on speaking terms with his Neptunes production partner. Since that initial legal action, Hugo's new lawsuit claims, Williams has continued not to provide Hugo with the necessary accounting and royalties related to their Neptunes and N.E.R.D. output.

	A rep for Williams did not respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment at press time.


	“After years of obfuscation by Pharrell and his team, Mr. Hugo had no choice but to seek substantial compensation and accountability in court,” Lehman said in a statement to Billboard. “We look forward to presenting the evidence and obtaining the full relief the law provides.”

University of Asia Pacific Drama Club staged their fifth production titled Post-mortem at National Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on Saturday.

Written and directed by Fahim Maleque Evan, the play depicts the lives of city children in a chaotic environment that serves as a hub of incompatibility for its citizens.

The play revolves around a student who suffers from a competitive schooling system and her parents throw her with a lot of engagement instead of achieving moral values and confidence. The play also raises questions about the relationship of parents and their child.

The club members portrayed different characters in the play while, Faruk Khan Titu designed the lighting and Sajia Afrin Luna designed the costumes.

	By Clay Pitman

Fans have been clamoring for the Midnight Sons to join the MCU for years now, and if it ever does happen, these 10 supernatural Marvel heroes could appear in the dark Avengers replacement team. The Midnight Sons is made up of some of Marvel's creepiest and most powerful supernatural heroes and villains, giving them an incredibly interesting dynamic. The MCU has already introduced some key members of the Midnight Sons, while some others are still missing, but either way, these 10 characters must be on the team.

The Midnight Sons were introduced in the early 1990s, when Ghost Rider received a vision that the Mother of All Demons was being resurrected. Thus, Danny Ketch and Johnny Blaze formed a team consisting of characters like Blade, Morbius, Hannibal King, and other minor characters. After this event, the Midnight Sons kept reuniting to face bigger threats, with more significant characters joining the roster each time. Now, the Midnight Sons are one of the most well-known Marvel Comics teams, and they really need to appear in the MCU.

If a potential Midnight Sons movie wants to feature a big-name hero from the current MCU as its figurehead, Doctor Strange is a perfect choice. Strange is currently one of the franchise's A-List heroes, and Benedict Cumberbatch has the starpower to carry the movie on his shoulders. Strange is one of the most powerful and significant characters in the MCU, so if he's part of the team, MCU fans will know that the Midnight Sons are important.

Doctor Strange wasn't part of the original Midnight Sons lineup, but he did work behind the scenes to help form the team. Later, Strange became a major recurring member of the team, appearing in some of the Midnight Sons' most memorable storylines.

Another character who needs to appear in the MCU's Midnight Sons is Blade. Although Mahershala Ali's Blade movie still hasn't happened yet, there are traces of the character in the MCU, such as in Marvel Zombies and the post-credits scene of Eternals. If the MCU's Blade movie never happens, Ali could make his proper debut as Blade in a Midnight Sons movie, which would make the film even more exciting than if Blade had already made his debut.

It would be hard to imagine a Midnight Sons movie without Blade. The daywalker was one of the founding members of the team, and he is one of the most frequently recurring Midnight Sons heroes. If the Blade movie had happened, he would be a shoo-in for team membership. So, hopefully, the film's production problems don't stop him from making an appearance.

Although he isn't as well-known for being part of the team, a current MCU hero who could appear in the Midnight Sons is Wong. As Doctor Strange's right-hand man and the MCU's current Sorcerer Supreme, Wong is an immensely powerful character who would make a fantastic addition to the team. He could also act as the team's comedic relief, as many of the other Midnight Sons members are incredibly self-serious.

Wong made his debut as a member of the Midnight Sons in 2017, with him being part of the modern team's roster. Thus, this perfectly sets him up to be on the Midnight Sons in the MCU. If Strange isn't on the team, Wong really needs to be there, as without either of them, the Midnight Sons wouldn't have a sorcerer.

The status of Oscar Isaac's Moon Knight is a bit mysterious, as he hasn't appeared in any MCU projects since season 1 of his own show. There hasn't been much word on when the character will appear again, and fans are still awaiting Moon Knight season 2 after season 1's cliffhanger ending. However, if the Midnight Sons do make their MCU debut, then Marvel needs to find a way to get Moon Knight back.

Moon Knight also became a member of the Midnight Sons in February 2017, although the character was in his Mr. Knight form. It is likely that the MCU would base its Midnight Sons team on this modern incatnation from the comics, so if it does happen, Moon Knight is a major candidate.

It wouldn't be hard to not know that Man-Thing currently exists in the MCU. The character has so far only appeared in a fairly minor role in Werewolf by Night, the Special Presentation that was released on Disney+ in 2022. However, this version of Man-Thing was a fantastic adaptation of the character, and this comic-accurate monster needs to appear in the Midnight Sons.

In 2009's Marvel Zombies 4, Man-Thing was added to the Midnight Sons line-up, and he has been associated with the team ever since. He reappeared in the 2017 lineup, proving that he was a mainstay of the Sons. So, he is perfect to appear in the MCU team as their big monster, acting as the Hulk of the team.

Outside of the one who appeared in Agents of SHIELD, there isn't currently a Ghost Rider in the MCU, which is a major problem for the Midnight Sons. Ghost Rider is the founder of the team, and there wouldn't be a Midnight Sons without him. The lineup doesn't have to be perfectly comic-accurate, but it at least has to have a Ghost Rider in it.

Johnny Blaze is the most popular Ghost Rider, so it would make sense for him to be the incarnation that appears in a Midnight Sons movie. However, Danny Ketch was also involved in the team's founding, and any of the Spirits of Vengeance could be involved. 

Doctor Voodoo is one of the most popular Marvel Comics characters who hasn't been introduced in the MCU at all. Since Marvel seems to have mostly moved away from introducing new heroes in their own solo movies, if Doctor Voodoo ever does make his debut, it will probably be in a Midnight Sons movie. This would make the film even more exciting, giving fans of the character a reason to watch.

Voodoo was also added to the team in its 2017 incarnation, meaning that he should be in the MCU's team as well. His association with Doctor Strange and Wong in the comics would give them an interesting dynamic in the movie, giving him a reason to be there.

Elsa Bloodstone already exists in the MCU, having made her debut in the Werewolf by Night Disney+ special. She also joined the team in its 2017 incarnation, and would give the mostly male-dominated team some much-needed female representation in the MCU.

Elsa Bloodstone hasn't nearly been used to her full potential in the MCU, and a Midnight Sons movie would help expand on her character. Elsa and the other Werewolf by Night characters need to be introduced to a wider audience, and Midnight Sons is the perfect way to do this.

Speaking of, Werewolf by Night himself needs to appear in the MCU's Midnight Sons. It would be weird for Elsa and Man-Thing to appear without the star of the Special Presentation. Making Midnight Sons a sequel to Werewolf by Night would further tie the movie into the MCU, while giving more people a reason to check out the Special Presentation.

Werewolf by Night joined the Midnight Sons in its Marvel Zombies 4 incarnation, although he surprisingly wasn't part of the team in its 2017 incarnation. Despite this, he would be a fun addition to the team if it wanted to lean further into the monster side of the MCU.

That's right, the highly memed character of Morbius the Living Vampire needs to be in the Midnight Sons if the MCU ever introduces the team. Alongside Ghost Rider and Blade, Morbius is one of the most commonly seen Midnight Sons members. Unfortunately, Jared Leto's take on the character in Morbius isn't the most popular, jeopardizing his chances.

Sony's ownership of Morbius' film rights and the status of the 2022 film make his chances of appearing slim. However, Marvel could recast the character and introduce a Morbius of Earth-616, avoiding the association with Sony's Marvel universe.

Prime Minister Mark Carney takes part in a bilateral meeting with Premier of China Li Qiang at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Jan. 15.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

Donald Trump is threatening to impose a 100 per cent tariff on Canada if it makes a trade deal with China, registering opposition to closer ties between Ottawa and Beijing under Prime Minister Mark Carney.

In a post on Truth Social, the U.S. President argued a trade agreement between Canada and China would result in Canadian territory being a transit point for shipping Chinese goods into the United States.

“If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a “Drop Off Port” for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,” Mr. Trump said, in belittling language that cast the Prime Minister as state governor instead of the leader of a sovereign country.

“If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,” the President wrote.

The Prime Minister's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Dominic LeBlanc, minister responsible for Canada-U.S. Trade, said Canada and China are not working on a trade deal. 

“There is no pursuit of a free trade deal with China. What was achieved was resolution on several important tariff issues,” he said in a post on X.

He said Canada remains committed to the Canada-U.S. relationship. 

“As the Prime Minister said this week, Canada and the United States have built a remarkable partnership in our economy and security – and we will remain focused on ensuring the future of that relationship will benefit workers and businesses on both sides of our border,” Mr. LeBlanc said.

The new tariff threat is the latest attack by Mr. Trump on Mr. Carney since the Prime Minister delivered a provocative speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that amounted to a veiled attack on the damage the U.S. President has done to the international rules-based order built on international law, norms, treaties and institutions such as the United Nations and World Trade Organization. 

Read and watch Mark Carney's Davos speech at the World Economic Forum

Since taking office in January, 2025, Mr. Trump has hit Canada with a slew of tariffs. While most goods still enter the United States tariff-free because they are sold according to the provisions of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the President has imposed a 50 per cent levy on steel and aluminum, 25 per cent on autos and 35 per cent on any goods traded outside the USMCA, with the exception of oil, gas and potash, at 10 per cent. His administration has also significantly hiked duties on Canadian softwood.

Canada and China struck a “strategic partnership” earlier this month to boost ties and allow Chinese investors to play a larger role in Canada's economy. During a four-day visit to Beijing, Mr. Carney praised China as a more predictable trading partner than the United States and broke with Washington over tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.

What to know about the Canada-China tariff deal on EVs and canola

The Prime Minister agreed to allow nearly 50,000 Chinese-made electric vehicles into Canada at a low tariff instead of a 100 per cent tariff Ottawa imposed on these imports in 2024 along with the former Biden administration. In return, Beijing scaled back retaliatory tariffs on canola seed, Canada's No. 1 export to China.

Mr. Carney also welcomed Chinese EV makers into the Canadian market, saying he would like to see investments in Canada within three years.

  Opinion: Carney's survival plan: Canada and other ‘middle powers' must co-operate in order to thrive

Mr. Trump, who previously expressed no opposition to Canada's entente with China, has now shifted his position.

“China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,” the President predicted in his Saturday social media post.

He had previously praised Mr. Carney's agreement with China, saying “That's what he should ⁠be doing. It's a good thing ‍for him to sign a trade deal. If you ⁠can get a deal with China, you should do ‍that,” the U.S. President said at the time.

Canada's annual exports to China – about 5 per cent of overall exports – pale in comparison what it ships to the United States each year. Traditionally about 75 per cent of Canadian exports go to the U.S.

In his Jan. 21 address at Davos, Mr. Trump described Mr. Carney as ungrateful toward the United States.

Eight notable moments from Trump's Davos speech

“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us, by the way. They should be grateful. But they're not,” Mr. Trump said. “I watched your Prime Minister yesterday, he wasn't so grateful. They should be grateful.”

He said Canada only exists because of the United States.

U.S. President Donald Trump takes aim at Prime Minister Mark Carney in a speech at Davos, saying 'Canada lives because of the United States,' a day after Mr. Carney warned the forum that a U.S.-led rules-based international order is over.

The next day, Mr. Trump also retracted an invitation to Mr. Carney for Canada to join his so-called “Board of Peace” project.

“Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time,” the U.S. President posted Jan. 22.

This followed Mr. Carney's address in Davos, a global gathering of political and business elites, in which he called for middle powers to stop pretending the rules-based international order is still functioning, and instead build coalitions to survive in a new era where great powers prey on smaller countries to take what they want.

In his speech, Mr. Carney urged countries to start publicly condemning economic coercion, even when practised by an ally, in another clear reference to the United States. “The old order is not coming back,” he said.

David MacNaughton, former Canadian ambassador to Washington, said Canadians shouldn't be too concerned about President Trump's latest threat.

The USMCA  he helped negotiate in 2018 with former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer does not allow Canada to do comprehensive trade deals with countries such as China, he said.

The trade pact was signed by Mr. Trump in his first term, which he hailed as the best deal ever negotiated.

“Not sure what all the fuss is about what Trump said on Truth Social. Our canola for limited EV imports is hardly a “trade deal” and the CUSMA deal [a Canadian term for the pact] explicitly prohibits participants from doing comprehensive trade deals with “non-market economies,” Mr. MacNaughton said.

“At the time I asked Lighthizer what that specifically meant. He said “any country starting with the letter C and ending with A that isn't Canada. Trump's words aren't news.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada if America's northern neighbor went ahead with its China trade deal, intensifying a feud with Prime Minister Mark Carney, a rising voice in the West's pushback to Trump's new world order.

Trump said in a social media post that if Carney “thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.”

While Trump has waged a trade war over the past year, Canada this month negotiated a deal to lower tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in return for lower import taxes on Canadian farm products.

Trump initially had said that agreement was what Carney “should be doing and it's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal.”

Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister responsible for trade with the United States, said Canada and China had resolved “several important trade issues” but there was no pursuit of a free-trade agreement. 

Trump's threat came amid an escalating war of words with Carney as the Republican president's push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance. Trump had commented while in Davos, Switzerland, this week that “Canada lives because of the United States.” Carney shot back that his nation can be an example that the world does not have to bend toward autocratic tendencies. “Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian,” he said.

Trump later revoked his invitation to Carney to join the president's “Board of Peace” that he is forming to try to resolve global conflicts.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Trump's push to acquire Greenland has come after he has repeatedly needled Canada over its sovereignty and suggested it also be absorbed the United States as a 51st state. He posted an altered image on social media this week showing a map of the United States that included Canada, Venezuela, Greenland and Cuba as part of its territory.




In his message Saturday, Trump continued his provocations by calling Canada's leader “Governor Carney.” Trump had used the same nickname for Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and his first use of it toward Carney was the latest mark of their soured relationship.

Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said “there was a sense Trump showed more respect for Carney than for Trudeau. Now, after Carney's visit to China and, even more, his widely celebrated Davos speech, which clearly outshined and upset Trump, the gloves are off.”

Carney has emerged as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. under Trump. Speaking in Davos before Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu” and he warned about coercion by great powers — without mentioning Trump's name. The prime minister received widespread praise and attention for his remarks, upstaging Trump at the World Economic Forum.

The prime minister even spoke of a “rupture” between the U.S. under Trump and its Western allies that would never be repaired.

Trump, in his Truth Social post Saturday, also said that “China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life.” In a later post, the president said: “The last thing the World needs is to have China take over Canada. It's NOT going to happen, or even come close to happening!”

Carney has not yet reached a deal with Trump to reduce some of the tariffs that he has imposed on key sectors of the Canadian economy. But Canada has been protected by the heaviest impact of Trump's tariffs by the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement. That trade agreement is up for a review this year.

In the fall, the Canadian province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff ad in the U.S. that prompted Trump to end trade talks with Canada. The television ad used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs. Trump pledged to increase tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10%. He did not follow through.

As for China, Canada had initially mirrored the United States by putting a 100% tariff on electric vehicles from Beijing and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. China had responded by imposing 100% import taxes on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood.

But as Trump's pursued pressure tactics, Canada's foreign policy has been less aligned with the U.S., creating an opening for an improved relationship with China. Carney made the tariff announcement earlier this month during a visit to Beijing.

Carney has said that Canada's relationship with the U.S. is complex and deep and that Canada and China disagree on issues such as human rights. 

LeBlanc, the trade minister, said in a statement that Canada would work to ensure that the future of that relationship “benefits workers and businesses on both sides of the border.”

Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US $2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, as are 85% of U.S. electricity imports.

Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.

Colin Cowherd reacts to the news that the Buffalo Bills are interviewing new Los Angeles Chargers OC Mike McDaniel and former NFL QB Phillip Rivers to be their next head coach.

They say no one circles the wagons like the Buffalo Bills, and wide receiver Keon Coleman found himself under the wagon after owner Terry Pegula's press conference on Wednesday.

Pegula and general manager Brandon Beane were asked about Coleman after a lackluster second season, and Pegula blamed the fired coaching staff for selecting the wide receiver in the NFL Draft two seasons ago.

""I'll address the Keon situation,"" Pegula said during the press conference after a question about Coleman was directed at Beane.

""The coaching staff pushed to draft Keon. I'm not saying Brandon wouldn't have drafted him, but (Coleman) wasn't his next choice. It was Brandon being a team player and taking advice of his coaching staff, who felt strongly about the player.""

""He's taken, for some reason, heat over it and not said a word about it. But I'm here to tell you the true story.""

Coleman, who was essentially labeled a draft bust by his owner, didn't understand the comments but quickly shook them off, according to The Athletic. The 22-year-old was taken aback, but then went and worked out and prepared for next season, according to the report.

While Pegula tried to absolve Beane for the selection of Coleman, the general manager stood by the fact that he ultimately made the selection.

""He was my pick. I made the pick,"" Beane said during the press conference. ""Terry's point was that we might've had a different order of personnel versus coaching, and I went that way. But ultimately, I'm not turning in a pick for a player that I don't think we can succeed with. So don't misunderstand that. Keon Coleman is a young player that has been here two years, has two years left on his deal. It's up to us to work with him and develop him.""

Coming into the season, the Bills were relying on Coleman to emerge as the team's No. 1 wide receiver after not making any significant additions to the wide receiver room in the offseason.

As a rookie in 2024, Coleman flashed star potential at times, catching 29 passes for 556 yards and four touchdowns in 13 games. It looked like Coleman had taken the leap in 2025, as he caught eight passes for 112 yards and a touchdown in Week 1.

However, that performance ended up being an anomaly for Coleman. He never had more than 50 yards in a game the rest of the season, including the playoffs, and was a healthy scratch for four games.

A chaotic scene unfolded in Kentucky during a middle school basketball game on Thursday night, as a fight led to someone getting tased.

Emmalena and Carr Creek elementary schools were competing in the A-Team Championships at Knott County Central High School, and things got ugly when two players tackled each other onto the court.

That prompted coaches and players to try to break up the fight, but chaos grew when parents came down from the stands to try to end the fracas.

That only made matters worse, resulting in one adult on the floor getting tased.

The announcers on the call gave A-plus commentary.

""Look here, this ball game's gotta get over,"" one announcer said.

Then, when the moment happened, the announcer called it as if it were a normal occurrence.

""They just tased Ryan,"" the announcer said.

Perhaps middle school basketball just means more in Kentucky.

A brawl ensued at a middle school game in Kentucky, but it was the announcer's call that stole the show.

""He said ‘they just tased Ryan' like Ryan has been tased before,"" another X user wrote.

Somehow, no arrests were reported. The game was called due to the brawl, with Carr Creek leading 48-30, but no winner was declared.

Authorities have found that some funding to combat homelessness in California has instead ended up in Greece.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has accused Alexander Soofer, manager of LA-based housing organization Abundant Blessing, of ""a years-long scheme to defraud the City and County of Los Angeles and other public entities providing funding for homeless housing.""

According to a complaint filed on Friday, while paying his staff ""minimal wages"" and feeding residents at his housing sites ""ramen noodles, canned beans, and breakfast bars,"" Soofer pocketed at least $10 million ""through bank accounts associated with other businesses in his and his wife's names"" for personal expenses after ""fraudulently obtaining"" $23 million in public funding.

Federal officials said that between 2018 and 2025, Soofer's organization received more than $5 million directly from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority and over $17 million through other nonprofits.

Investigators found Soofer's misuse of funds includes $47,000 in luxury home purchases from stores like Restoration Hardware, $15,000 at Hermès, $15,000 at Chanel, $1,000 for cosmetic dermatology, and $4,500 for a four-night stay at the Wynn Las Vegas.

Authorities said they have yet to determine what Soofer bought at Chanel, but listed his purchases at Hermès as including a $1,250 pair of men's Paris calf-skin loafers, a $910 pair of women's Chypre sandals, a $455 Chevaux en Symetrie tie, and a $2,450 men's trotting jacket.

In addition to luxury brands, the complaint said there is at least one property under his name associated with the misappropriated funds. That property in question is located in Greece and relates to ""a $475,000 check issued from an Abundant Blessings bank account.""

The case against Soofer feeds into concerns that California's efforts to combat homelessness may be ineffective and inconsistent despite large spending. According to the Public Policy Institute of California, as of 2024, the state had over 187,000 homeless people, representing about 24% of the nation's total.

State Auditor Grant Parks wrote in a 2024 report to Gov. Gavin Newsom and lawmakers that, when his department analyzed five housing programs that received approximately $13.7 billion in combined funding, only two were ""likely cost-effective.""

Parks also added in the report that, between fiscal years 2018-2023, California cities lacked reliable data to track cost efficiency and outcomes needed to fully understand why the problem didn't improve, despite the billions spent by more than 30 housing programs.

The attorney's office of the Central District of California referred Business Insider to the press release and did not comment further. An attorney for Soofer and the Governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Pep Guardiola has dropped Erling Haaland from the starting line-up for Manchester City's Premier League game against Wolves amid a run of eight games without scoring from open play. Haaland had started all 22 of City's previous league games, scoring 20 goals. But he last hit the net against Brighton from the penalty spot in early January and has not scored in open play since December.

Haaland has not been left out of a City line-up since starting on the bench against Bayer Leverkusen on November 25 while he has not sat out an entire game since City's Carabao Cup tie at Swansea on October 29. And Guardiola admitted last week following the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Newcastle that Haaland was ""exhausted"". The Norwegian hitman badly under-performed during City's resounding 2-0 defeat at Manchester United and missed several chances in the shock 3-1 defeat at Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League on Tuesday. And Guardiola has finally taken action by leaving his top scorer out against Wolves, who are bottom of the Premier League table.

Guardiola explained to Sky Sports why he had left Haaland out:  ""There are a lot of games. I want to, a little bit, clean his mind, his body. And yeah, the selection is always because I believe that for today it is the best.""

Haaland spoke openly about his poor form and City's recent downturn in results following the defeat in Norway. He said: ""I don't have the answers. I take full responsibility of not being able to score the goals I should do. I just apologize to everyone; every single Man City supporter and every single supporter that traveled today, because in the end it's embarrassing.

""Bodo they played some incredible football and in the end it's deserved. Honestly, I don't know what to say because I don't have the answers, and what I can say is sorry.""

City's latest signing Marc Guehi made his debut for the club against Wolves following his arrival from Crystal Palace for £20m. He will partner Abdukodir Khusanov and will be expected to be bring some much-needed leadership and experience to a City defence that has been ravaged by injuries to John Stones, Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias.

Guehi explained how it felt to join Guardiola's side. He said: ""This move feels like the culmination of all the hard work I have put into my career. I am now at the best club in England and part of an unbelievable squad of players. It feels good to be able to say that. I want to grow as a player and a person, and I know at this club that's going to happen.  

""I love football – it has given me so much for so long – and to be able to continue my development at Manchester City is a really special moment for me and my family. I absolutely cannot wait to get started now. I want to meet my teammates, train hard, understand what the manager expects of me and then show the City fans what I can do.""

Guardiola had another reason for resting Haaland against Wolves: to keep him sharp for Wednesday's crucial Champions League game against Galatasaray. City find themselves outside the top eight in the League Phase table heading into their final game against the Turkish giants. They need a win to stand a chance of finishing in the top eight and going straight into the knockout phase, and they will still need a couple of results to go their way to achieve that objective.

Fail to beat Galatasaray and City will have to play a two-legged play-off tie. Guardiola's side have bad memories of the play-offs as they were thrashed 6-3 on aggregate by Real Madrid last season, exiting the competition at the earliest stage since the Catalan coach's first season in charge in 2016-17.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
