                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Deadly shooting: A Minneapolis man was shot and killed by federal agents today, according to city officials. The man is believed to be a US citizen, police said. • DHS says agents defended themselves: The Department of Homeland Security said the man had a handgun and approached Border Patrol officers during a targeted operation. He “violently resisted” when officers tried to disarm him, and an agent shot him in self-defense, according to DHS. • State and local outcry: Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said videos show masked agents “pummeling one of our constituents and shooting him to death,” and he denounced the “impunity” of federal agents operating in the city. Tim Walz called on President Donald Trump to pull ICE out of Minneapolis and allow Minnesota to lead an investigation into the shooting. Video shows a dumpster set ablaze in the street as tensions continue near the federal law enforcement shooting scene, CNN affiliate WCCO reports. State troopers and other law enforcement officers surrounded the fire, which is still burning, while using fire extinguishers to put it out. Authorities continue to deploy additional crowd-control measures as the situation remains volatile, with streets still crowded and chaotic. In Minnesota, citizens must have a permit to legally carry a handgun in public, according to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety. The permit doesn't require the weapon to be concealed and it also serves as a permit to purchase a firearm, meaning holders don't need a separate purchase permit. Once issued, the permit is valid for five years and can be renewed. Tim Walz is urging federal officials to allow the state to take the lead in investigating the Saturday shooting that killed a 37-year-old US citizen during anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis, Walz said in a post on X. Federal officers have deployed tear gas to disperse crowds at the scene. Saturday morning's fatal shooting is the third shooting by federal agents in the city, which has seen numerous protests and demonstrations in response to the shooting and federal immigration crackdown. Amid ongoing protests and a heavy federal law enforcement presence in south Minneapolis, Police Chief Brian O'Hara described the scene as “incredibly volatile” during a Saturday news conference. He said the department has set up a command post and is coordinating with the Department of Homeland Security, adding federal officials have not provided specific details about the shooting incident. O'Hara emphasized the department's priority is public safety, noting an “emergency recall of all sworn personnel back to duty” and urged residents to avoid the area. Preliminary information shows more than one federal agent was involved in today's shooting, police chief Brian O'Hara said. And again, there is public video that shows several law enforcement officers in a scuffle with someone,” he said. DHS has said the man was armed and agents tried to disarm him before firing “defensive shots.” The police chief said the man is believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. President Donald Trump has been briefed on the fatal shooting involving federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday, according to a White House official. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey addressed the city Saturday as federal agents continue to deploy crowd-control measures, sharply criticizing the federal law enforcement presence. Frey condemned the militarized response, saying it “erodes trust in both law enforcement and in democracy” and pushed back on claims that local officials or community members are responsible for the unrest. “I'm done being told that our community members are responsible for the vitriol in our streets,” Frey said during the Saturday news conference. “I'm done being told that our local elected officials are solely responsible for turning down the temperature.” Frey said 15,000 people had peacefully protested the day before, with no reported injuries or property damage, emphasizing that such demonstrations reflect the city's and nation's founding principles. He contrasted this with the “mass militarized force and unidentified agents” occupying Minneapolis streets. Rachel Sayre, director of Minneapolis' emergency management department, has said the surge in federal agents in the city is having “profound repercussions.” We are tracking impacts and coordinating the city's response to the situation, which is having profound repercussions in our community,” Sayre said. “I can't underscore enough how much Operation Metro Surge is impacting our city,” she said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey asked people across the country to support Minneapolis following the shooting of a third person by ICE agents in recent weeks. “To everyone listening, stand with Minneapolis,” Frey said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for an end to the federal immigration enforcement campaign that has seen thousands of agents dispatched to the Twin Cities in recent weeks. “Let's end this operation, and I'm telling you, our city will come back. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has just described watching a video of “more than six masked agents pummeling one of our constituents and shooting him to death.” “How many more residents, how many more Americans need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end? How many more lives need to be lost before this administration realizes that a political and partisan narrative is not as important as American values?” Frey asked during a news conference moments ago. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara urged protesters to remain calm after a man was fatally shot by federal agents this morning. O'Hara also said that police have “very limited information.” “We have not been told any official reports of what has led up to the shooting, but we have seen the video that is circulating on social media,” he said. The Department of Homeland Security said federal agents involved in a deadly shooting this morning in Minneapolis were acting in self-defense, saying the man who was fatally shot “violently resisted” their attempts to disarm him. The department said agents were conducting a targeted operation against an undocumented immigrant “wanted for violent assault,” when an “individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun.” A law enforcement source who spoke with CNN separately said a struggle ensued between agents and the man who approached them. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey is speaking now after a man was shot and killed by federal agents today in Minneapolis, according to the city's police chief. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is scheduled to speak at 12:30 p.m. ET after federal agents shot a man in Minneapolis Saturday morning. After immigration agents fatally shot a man in Minneapolis on Saturday, federal officials attempted to prevent local police from accessing the scene, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN. The surge of immigration agents to Minneapolis has been marked by frequent tensions between local and federal authorities, particularly after high-profile use of force incidents. After the killing of Renee Good earlier this month by an ICE officer, federal officials blocked state investigators from participating in their review of the incident. A man shot while surrounded by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday was armed, according to a Department of Homeland Security official who said the individual “had a firearm with two magazines.” It is also unclear if he had a permit to carry the firearm, which is required in the state. “I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. He continued: “The President must end this operation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After criticism over allegation Nato troops ‘stayed off front lines' in conflict, US president says UK forces were ‘great and very brave' Donald Trump has said UK soldiers who fought in Afghanistan were “among the greatest of all warriors” after previously drawing criticism for his claims Nato troops stayed away from the frontlines during the conflict. “In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors. “It's a bond too strong to ever be broken. “We love you all, and always will!” It came a day after Trump was criticised for his remarks that Nato allied troops “stayed a little off the frontlines” in Afghanistan. Keir Starmer raised the comments directly with the US president in a conversation on Saturday, No 10 said. “The prime minister raised the brave and heroic British and American soldiers who fought side by side in Afghanistan, many of whom never returned home. We must never forget their sacrifice, he said. Whilst diplomatic efforts continue, the prime minister reiterated that international partners must continue to support Ukraine in its defence against Putin's barbaric attacks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shooting comes less than three weeks after Renee Good was shot and killed by an ICE officer in the city He called on federal personnel in the city to conduct themselves with discipline and humanity. “There is a lot of anger and questions around what has happened,” O'Hara said. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey is now talking and we will bring you his remarks asap. In a statement sent to the Guardian, assistant secretary of homeland security Tricia McLaughlin said that at 9.05am local time, “as DHS law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted operation in Minneapolis” against a person they said was in the country illegally, who she said was “wanted for violent assault”, “an individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun.” “Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots” she said, adding: “Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene.” She added that the man also had “2 magazines and no ID”. It is now characterizing protesters as “rioters”, saying there are about 200 people on the scene in south Minneapolis trying to “obstruct and assault law enforcement”. Illinois governor JB Pritzker has called for a bipartisan reponse to this shooting from US state governors. “I am asking my fellow Republican and Democratic Governors across the nation to have a unified response. We must all stand against the lawlessness being inflicted in our states,” he posted on X moments ago. He then posted: “Masked federal agents in Minnesota just shot and killed another person. Mary Moriarty, the top prosecutor of Hennepin county, where Minneapolis is located, has issued a statement saying that her team is working with state law enforcement, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), to coordinate on a response to this shooting. After Renee Good was killed, the FBI at first cooperated with Minnesota law enforcement and then abruptly shut them out and said it would be only a federal investigation. One officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: “Boo hoo.” Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car, the Associated Press reports. Teargas has been deployed and the crack of munitions such as flash-bang grenades used in crowd control can be heard close to the scene of this shooting in south Minneapolis. The source, who cannot be named because they are not authorized to give out details at this time, provided an image of a handgun next to a loaded magazine, connected to the man the Department of Homeland Security is calling a suspect. “Suspect had a firearm with two magazines,” the source said. The Guardian has not yet been able independently to verifiy this information. Minnesotans have been protesting against the White House's decision to flood the relatively small, liberal midwestern city of Minneapolis with federal immigration enforcement personnel in recent weeks. At the time there were fears of a things slipping out of control in the city if protests turned into riots or mass law-breaking. Federal officers and agents from ICE officers to the border patrol have drawn outrage for aggressive and sometimes violent tactics against people they are targeting for immigration enforcement but also against protesters and mere bystanders or passersby. The Guardian's immigration reporter Maanvi Singh said from her experience she had to agree with descriptions of the city as feeling like it is “under siege”. Minnesota's governor Tim Walz has called for Donald Trump to end his administration's aggressive federal immigration enforcement operations in the state the began a few weeks ago and has caused chaos, injury and death. “I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. This is sickening,” Walz wrote on the X social media platform. Minneapolis officials are urgently looking into the multiple reports that federal enforcement has shot a man. Officials in Minneapolis have received reports of another shooting involving federal law enforcement officers in the city during the Trump administration's immigration crackdown there. The shooting comes less than three weeks after Renee Good was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in the city in Minnesota while she tried driving away from a confrontation with officers. City officials said on Saturday morning in a statement that the “shooting involving federal law enforcement” and occurred in the area of West 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue South – and that they are “working to confirm additional details”. Confirmed details are few at this time so stay with the Guardian live blog and we will bring you the developments as they happen.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney takes part in a bilateral meeting with Premier of China Li Qiang at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Jan. 15.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press Donald Trump is threatening to impose a 100 per cent tariff on Canada if it makes a trade deal with China, registering opposition to closer ties between Ottawa and Beijing under Prime Minister Mark Carney. “If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a “Drop Off Port” for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,” Mr. Trump said, in belittling language that cast the Prime Minister as state governor instead of the leader of a sovereign country. “If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,” the President wrote. The Prime Minister's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Dominic LeBlanc, minister responsible for Canada-U.S. Trade, said Canada and China are not working on a trade deal. “There is no pursuit of a free trade deal with China. Read and watch Mark Carney's Davos speech at the World Economic Forum Since taking office in January, 2025, Mr. Trump has hit Canada with a slew of tariffs. His administration has also significantly hiked duties on Canadian softwood. Canada and China struck a “strategic partnership” earlier this month to boost ties and allow Chinese investors to play a larger role in Canada's economy. During a four-day visit to Beijing, Mr. Carney praised China as a more predictable trading partner than the United States and broke with Washington over tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. What to know about the Canada-China tariff deal on EVs and canola The Prime Minister agreed to allow nearly 50,000 Chinese-made electric vehicles into Canada at a low tariff instead of a 100 per cent tariff Ottawa imposed on these imports in 2024 along with the former Biden administration. In return, Beijing scaled back retaliatory tariffs on canola seed, Canada's No. Mr. Carney also welcomed Chinese EV makers into the Canadian market, saying he would like to see investments in Canada within three years. Opinion: Carney's survival plan: Canada and other ‘middle powers' must co-operate in order to thrive Mr. Trump, who previously expressed no opposition to Canada's entente with China, has now shifted his position. “China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,” the President predicted in his Saturday social media post. Traditionally about 75 per cent of Canadian exports go to the U.S. In his Jan. 21 address at Davos, Mr. Trump described Mr. Carney as ungrateful toward the United States. “Canada gets a lot of freebies from us, by the way. “I watched your Prime Minister yesterday, he wasn't so grateful. He said Canada only exists because of the United States. This followed Mr. Carney's address in Davos, a global gathering of political and business elites, in which he called for middle powers to stop pretending the rules-based international order is still functioning, and instead build coalitions to survive in a new era where great powers prey on smaller countries to take what they want. In his speech, Mr. Carney urged countries to start publicly condemning economic coercion, even when practised by an ally, in another clear reference to the United States. David MacNaughton, former Canadian ambassador to Washington, said Canadians shouldn't be too concerned about President Trump's latest threat. The USMCA  he helped negotiate in 2018 with former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer does not allow Canada to do comprehensive trade deals with countries such as China, he said. Our canola for limited EV imports is hardly a “trade deal” and the CUSMA deal [a Canadian term for the pact] explicitly prohibits participants from doing comprehensive trade deals with “non-market economies,” Mr. MacNaughton said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney takes part in a bilateral meeting with Premier of China Li Qiang at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Jan. 15.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press Donald Trump is threatening to impose a 100 per cent tariff on Canada if it makes a trade deal with China, registering opposition to closer ties between Ottawa and Beijing under Prime Minister Mark Carney. “If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a “Drop Off Port” for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,” Mr. Trump said, in belittling language that cast the Prime Minister as state governor instead of the leader of a sovereign country. “If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,” the President wrote. The Prime Minister's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When asked by reporters Thursday how talks with the United States were going, Mr. Carney declined to answer, calling the query “the most boring question.” On Friday he cancelled an expected news conference with reporters following a cabinet retreat in Quebec City. Read and watch Mark Carney's Davos speech at the World Economic Forum Since taking office in January, 2025, Mr. Trump has hit Canada with a slew of tariffs. Canada and China struck a “strategic partnership” earlier this month to boost ties and allow Chinese investors to play a larger role in Canada's economy. During a four-day visit to Beijing, Mr. Carney praised China as a more predictable trading partner than the United States and broke with Washington over tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. What to know about the Canada-China tariff deal on EVs and canola The Prime Minister agreed to allow nearly 50,000 Chinese-made electric vehicles into Canada at a low tariff instead of a 100 per cent tariff Ottawa imposed on these imports in 2024 along with the former Biden administration. In return, Beijing scaled back retaliatory tariffs on canola seed, Canada's No. Mr. Carney also welcomed Chinese EV makers into the Canadian market, saying he would like to see investments in Canada within three years. Opinion: Carney's survival plan: Canada and other ‘middle powers' must co-operate in order to thrive Mr. Trump, who previously expressed no opposition to Canada's entente with China, has now shifted his position. “China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,” the President predicted in his Saturday social media post. In his Jan. 21 address at Davos, Mr. Trump described Mr. Carney as ungrateful toward the United States. “Canada gets a lot of freebies from us, by the way. “I watched your Prime Minister yesterday, he wasn't so grateful. This followed Mr. Carney's address in Davos, a global gathering of political and business elites, in which he called for middle powers to stop pretending the rules-based international order is still functioning, and instead build coalitions to survive in a new era where great powers prey on smaller countries to take what they want. In his speech, Mr. Carney urged countries to start publicly condemning economic coercion, even when practised by an ally, in another clear reference to the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The territorial issue is still the most complicated one at the trilateral talks between Russia, the United States and Ukraine in Abu Dhabi and the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Donbas remains a priority for Russia, a source close to negotiations told TASS on Saturday. "This issue remains to be the most complicated," the source said. "The withdrawal of the Ukrainian military from Donbass is important and various security parameters are being considered regarding this issue," the source stated. On January 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and businessman Jared Kushner, which was described as extremely substantive, constructive, frank, and based on trust by Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov. The talks, focused on the Ukrainian settlement, lasted about four hours. The parties agreed that the first meeting of a Russia-US-Ukraine working group on security issues would take place in Abu Dhabi on January 23. On Friday, a source told TASS that the consultations were over, and the sides will inform their respective governments about the preliminary outcomes. At the same time, the participants have agreed to continue dialogue the following day. The Russian delegation is headed by Igor Kostyukov, chief of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army. The Ukrainian negotiators are led by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Veterans say president risks isolating America from allies with remarks on Afghanistan American troops have called Donald Trump a “draft-dodger” and accused him of “denigrating” Britain's role in Afghanistan. He faced fierce criticism for his remarks on both sides of the Atlantic, including from one of his former top officials, who warned he could end up isolating the US from its allies. He received five deferments during the Vietnam War, including for a bone spur in his heel. Shawn VanDiver, a US navy veteran who served alongside British forces off the coast of Iraq, said Mr Trump had never shown “courage” in combat and described his comments as “outright, 100 per cent bulls---”. “No wonder Keir Starmer is p----d off… these folks stood shoulder to shoulder with us for two decades of war and across numerous missions.” One former US service member, who worked with Nato forces in Afghanistan as a contractor, was exasperated at the “nonsense that comes out of that man's mouth”. British troops were “right there with us”, the individual said, labelling the president a “draft-dodger” who had never set foot inside a war zone. A former senior Pentagon official described Mr Trump's comments as “rich coming from a guy who dodged the draft” and labelled the president “disgusting and out of touch”. “I think if we went to war tomorrow, everybody would give us the middle finger,” he said. In a statement on Saturday on Truth Social he said British soldiers were “among the greatest of all warriors” and were “GREAT and very BRAVE”. Brandan Buck, who served four tours in Afghanistan, worked alongside British forces in Helmand, a hotbed of insurgent activity, during the fight against the Taliban. Adml James Stavridis, the former commander of United States European Command, said hundreds of Nato troops had “died under my command on the frontlines in Afghanistan” between 2009 and 2013. “I honour their memory every single day,” he wrote on social media. Robert Wilkie, who served as Mr Trump's secretary of veterans affairs in his first term, condemned the president's comments. Mr Wilkie questioned who had been briefing Mr Trump, given the high casualty rates suffered among troops serving alongside the US in Afghanistan. But he questioned how the president would not be aware of the sacrifice made by British troops in Afghanistan as well as in Iraq, having attended events with UK war veterans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The document names Russia a ‘persistent threat' to NATO countries, and says that deterrence of China is viewed as a top priority. TASS has gathered the document's key statements. Washington believes that Europe should concentrate its efforts an resources on its own defense. Washington plans an extensive modernization of its nuclear forces, because "the United States should never - will never - be left vulnerable to nuclear blackmail." The Department of War will focus on creating and deploying systems to counter unmanned aerial vehicles and other present-day aerial threats The United States will no longer cede access or influence over key terrain in the Western hemisphere, from the Arctic to South America, in order to "ensure that the Monroe Doctrine is upheld in our time." In the past, Washington used to allow its allies to spend less on defense, but this attitude has changed. The long-term US policy on China does not include attempts to change the government or other forms of conflict with it. The US will not let Iran obtain nuclear weapons. The Pentagon believes that North Korea is boosting its nuclear potential and sees "a clear and present danger of nuclear attack on the American Homeland." The US Department of War will maintain a ‘resource-sustainable' approach to countering Islamic terrorist groups, "focused on organizations that possess the capability and intent to strike the US Homeland.</p>
