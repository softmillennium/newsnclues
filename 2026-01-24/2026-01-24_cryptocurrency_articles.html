                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Real estate guru Grant Cardone has added nearly $70 million worth of Bitcoin in two tranches to his company's balance sheet. Cardone on Monday announced the purchase of $10 million worth of Bitcoin and 650 BTC, most recently worth $58 million, for Cardone Capital's real estate and Bitcoin hybrid fund model. The AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share Sam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early "Been saying for years, there's no shortage of oil & gas, or gold, silver, copper – nothing!" "There is simply no shortage of the things we can mine for, except bitcoin," he continued. Arrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio. "You get something that would normally do 12% or 14% that could potentially do 35% a year and be a very safe investment," he told Fox Business on Jan. 16, talking up the combination of Bitcoin's volatility with the relative stability of the real estate market. Cardone Capital has launched three of these so-called hybrid funds combining Bitcoin and real estate: The 10X Space Coast Bitcoin Fund, which combines 300 apartments in Melbourne, Florida, with $15 million worth of BTC. The 10X Boca Raton Fund, which intends to combine 366 apartments with $100 million in BTC. In all, Cardone has said he intends to launch 10 of these funds, mixing 15,000 apartment units with 10,000 BTC. Meanwhile, Cardone has also said he plans to take these funds public soon. "It should happen this year," he told Fox Business last week. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry. Their venture capital offering lets individual investors gain exposure to private technology companies with low minimums, diversified holdings, and a long-term focus on growth before public markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After selling a significant portion of its crypto stash over the past months, Ethereum-focused treasury firm ETHZilla has now added jet engines to its balance sheet. A Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that the company bought two CFM56-7B24 aircraft engines for $12.2 million through a newly formed subsidiary, ETHZilla Aerospace LLC. Airline operators lease jet engines as spares to ensure the planes can continue to operate without disruption if their primary engine fails. The aerospace business is also currently facing a big-engine supply squeeze, with IATA saying its airline members would be forced to pay about $2.6 billion to lease additional spare engines in 2025. Many public firms that aggressively raised funds to accumulate tokens last year now trade well below the net asset value (NAV) of the crypto on their books, leaving little room to raise fresh capital. Still, buying aircraft engines might be part of ETHZilla's broader ambition to bring tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) onchain. In a December shareholder letter, the company outlined plans to tokenize assets in partnership with Liquidity.io, a regulated broker-dealer and SEC-registered alternative trading system (ATS). Before that, ETHZilla took a 15% stake in Zippy, a lender focused on manufactured home loans, with plans to tokenize those loans as compliant, tradable instruments. It also acquired a stake in auto finance platform Karus with plans to bring loans onchain. "We're building a scalable tokenization pipeline across asset classes with predictable cash flows and global investor demand," the firm said in a Wednesday X post. KuCoin captured a record share of centralised exchange volume in 2025, with more than $1.25tn traded as its volumes grew faster than the wider crypto market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchain innovation is leaving hype behind and rewarding projects that deliver real impact. As a Layer-1 blockchain, it combines zero-knowledge proof technology with hands-on network participation, letting computation stay private yet verifiable. Its working Proof Pods are already contributing to the network, showing progress that goes beyond words. By merging privacy, computation, and participation into a single ecosystem, ZKP is shaping itself as a foundation for decentralized applications, privacy-first networks, and the next wave of blockchain projects that actually deliver on their promise. While many blockchain projects chase faster transactions or purely financial use cases, ZKP crypto takes a different route. As a Layer-1 blockchain, ZKP doesn't just support smart contracts and decentralized apps; it weaves zero-knowledge proofs into its very core. This means computations can be verified without exposing sensitive information, opening the door for AI tasks, enterprise operations, and other data-sensitive applications. By focusing on real, usable technology instead of fleeting trends, ZKP has become a standout name in discussions of the best crypto presales, appealing to developers, investors, and Web3 pioneers looking for projects with lasting impact. One of ZKP's most standout features is its physical hardware, Proof Pods; compact devices that plug directly into the ZKP network and perform verifiable compute. Unlike passive staking or mining, each Pod actively validates AI tasks, generates zero-knowledge proofs, and contributes to the network's privacy-first, decentralized infrastructure. Each upgrade not only raises the Pod by one level but also grants $100 worth of ZKP coins, so participants increase their earning potential while receiving immediate rewards. A Level 50 Pod, for example, earns approximately $50 in ZKP daily, while Level 300 Pods reach up to $300 daily, all tied to the dynamic presale auction price. Proof Pods provide full visibility into performance, showing task history, uptime, and ZKP rewards in real time. ZKP's presale auction model stands out as one of the best crypto presales for its fairness, transparency, and price discovery. This gives participants a chance to observe the presale auction's progress, decide if they want to contribute, and strategize their participation based on demand. To ensure that whales don't dominate, ZKP places a daily contribution cap of $50K, making the presale auction accessible to a broader audience and leveling the playing field. At the end of each presale auction window, participants receive their share of tokens, calculated based on their contribution percentage. Tokens that are not auctioned off are burned permanently, ensuring that only tokens actively purchased by the community remain in circulation. Beyond its presale auction and hardware components, ZKP is building an ecosystem designed for developers. The network supports modern execution environments, enabling the deployment of smart contracts and decentralized applications that can leverage zero-knowledge proofs natively. This makes ZKP particularly appealing to crypto-native developers exploring privacy-focused applications, as well as to Web3 projects seeking scalable and secure compute solutions. In an evolving market where credibility and execution matter more than ever, ZKP crypto stands out for aligning technology, participation, and accessibility. With Proof Pods already contributing to the network and a live presale auction welcoming global participation, ZKP represents a modern approach to launching blockchain infrastructure. For those tracking innovation-driven opportunities, ZKP's presence among the best crypto presales reflects its growing relevance in the next phase of Web3 development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A dangerous new threat is targeting blockchain engineers and developers. The North Korean group known as  is using smart AI tools to build powerful malware. This attack aims right at people working on crypto projects. It could steal wallets, API keys, and even whole crypto holdings. These attacks are sneaky and use new tech like AI to hide better. In this post, we break down how it works, why it's scary for crypto, and simple steps to stay safe. The , also called Opal Sleet or TA406, come from North Korea. They have links to groups like APT37 and Kimsuky. They hit targets in South Korea, Russia, Ukraine, and Europe. Samples show hits from Japan, Australia, and India. Dev environments hold gold for hackers: code, private keys, wallet access, and crypto funds. It all begins with a fake link on Discord. But it downloads a ZIP file with two bad items: Click the shortcut, and things go wrong fast. This sets up the malware without you knowing. It uses math tricks to scramble strings, rebuilds them at runtime, and runs key code with Invoke-Expression. Experts spotted clear signs this malware came from AI, not hand-coded by hackers. AI makes malware faster and harder to spot. Hackers can tweak it quick without deep coding skills. If safe, it makes a unique host ID. The backdoor phones home to a command server (C2). It sends host info like OS, user, and location. If C2 sends PowerShell code, it runs in background jobs. Hackers can steal data, run more malware, or grab crypto keys. Crypto is big money for state hackers like . IoCs are out now: bad Discord links, file hashes, C2 domains. North Korea leads here, but others will follow. Devs use open tools, Discord, and shared repos. Tools like Sigma rules can flag Konni tricks. Blockchain firms must act now to protect devs and assets. Stay safe, share IoCs with your team, and keep learning about threats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Someone of national significance had flown in on a private jet from Florida. “I probably wasn't supposed to know,” she admitted. The VIP broke his silence a few hours later. Behind him, rows of computer servers stretched into the distance. More recently, the crypto industry has also become intertwined with a Trump corporate brand best known for traditional real estate. In just over a year, the family has made at least $1 billion in pretax earnings from multiple crypto ventures that share a common playbook with American Bitcoin: attracting savvy partners and executing complicated transactions that position the family's business organizations to scoop up profits. That message has been baked into the mining venture's branding since inception. Like all the Trump crypto holdings, American Bitcoin faces scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest. What's more, the company must show it can withstand a hyper-volatile crypto market: Since it went public in September, its share price has plummeted alongside a steep decline in Bitcoin's value. Its cofounder told Fortune he's taking the long view. Blinking lights on a wall of servers went from their customary green to an angry red. Three technicians jumped onto a white warehouse cart and sped down a central aisle to the panel of ailing mining servers, which (like most in the industry) were designed with the help of Chinese Bitcoin-mining-chip manufacturer Bitmain. Its pseudonymous inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, launched Bitcoin as a protest of sorts against the profligacy of central banks and governments. Unlike other currencies, it is anti-inflationary—there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins—and it is supported by a decentralized network rather than a bank or government. The mining process distributes new batches of the currency, while also requiring miners to expend energy to maintain that network. In return, the winner receives a payout of Bitcoin, which today amounts to 3.125 coins per reward, plus the opportunity to collect additional transaction fees. It now requires massive computing power, specialized chips—and tremendous amounts of energy. Today there are clusters of mining computers in locations worldwide where cheap energy is easily accessible—places like Vega. The U.S. accounted for 38% of mining activity in the fourth quarter of 2025, far above Russia's second-best 16%, according to Bitcoin mining company Luxor Technology. At this point, Bitcoin is literally made in America. Spurred by President Trump, who issued an executive order in March 2025 to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Republicans have framed the asset as a new front in the economic competition with Russia and China. It was amid the president's push to make America a “Bitcoin superpower” that Eric Trump's venture took shape. Genoot had been in Bitcoin mining for several years, starting a company called US Bitcoin and becoming CEO of Hut 8 after the two companies merged in 2023. “We had about 100 of the same friends,” Eric said. After meeting a few months earlier, Genoot and Eric started talking business in February 2025, over pizza at a Trump golf club in nearby Jupiter. Eric and his brother Donald Trump Jr. had just launched a corporate entity called American Data Centers; perhaps there could be a tie-in with Genoot's company. “I realized how punitive the financial institutions were in this country, and I fell in love with this new era of finance.” In fact, there could be: Hut 8 already owned several Bitcoin mining facilities across the U.S. and Canada—warehouses of servers, close to cheap power sources. “And we build infrastructure assets, whether that be data centers that mine Bitcoin or data centers that go and support AI compute.” (“I would never have considered mining had I not seen the scale to which they had built,” Eric added in a statement.) What followed was a headspinning series of financial transactions. Genoot and Eric agreed to split off Hut 8's Bitcoin mining operation into a separate, Trump-linked company. Hut 8 retained 80% ownership, and shareholders of American Data Centers received the other 20%; the remainder of Hut 8, meanwhile, became a pure data center and power infrastructure play. Late last March, the partners unveiled their new project, then raised $220 million in a private equity funding round led by Solari Capital, whose founder, AJ Scaramucci, is a son of investor and Trump supporter turned dissident Anthony Scaramucci. In September, American Bitcoin went public, with Genoot as executive chairman. Like some other mining ventures, the company employs a hybrid business model that also involves running a “digital-asset treasury.” Digital-asset treasuries raise money by issuing debt and equity, then use that cash to buy crypto for their balance sheets. The business premise, pioneered by Michael Saylor and his company Strategy, relies on the assumption that investors will buy a treasury company's stock to profit from digital assets without owning them directly. He even pitched Eric on mortgaging Mar-a-Lago to buy more Bitcoin. Eric demurred, he said, “But I go, ‘You know…there's a second-best play, right? Shortly after it went public in September, Eric couldn't have been more ecstatic about his second-best play. In the third quarter of 2025, American Bitcoin generated $64 million in revenue, primarily from the 563 Bitcoin it mined during those three months. It was “pretty awesome for a company just coming out of the gate,” Genoot said. President Trump and Eric Trump, along with others in their family, have said many banks either stopped doing business with them or refused to take their deposits after the president and many of his supporters disputed the results of the 2020 election. Banking privacy laws have largely prevented banks from commenting on why they might have stopped working with the Trumps—or even if they worked with the Trumps at all. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America declined to comment on specific customers' accounts, and Capital One did not respond to requests for comment. More broadly, the three banks have denied that they debank customers because of political affiliations. “This is false,” wrote lawyers for Capital One in response to a lawsuit the Trumps filed against the bank in which they alleged their accounts were closed because of their political beliefs. “While Capital One closes bank accounts occasionally, it does so for legally and regulatorily permissible reasons.” “I realized how punitive the financial institutions were in this country,” he said, “and I fell in love with this new era of finance.” Like other crypto diehards, he sees Bitcoin as an improvement over the middlemen, fees, and delays associated with traditional banking. “It's cheaper, faster, more transparent than any other form of finance,” he said. Eric wasn't the only Trump warming to crypto. Although Donald Trump once said that Bitcoin “seems like a scam,” he went on to launch his own collection of NFTs, or collectible images that exist on the blockchain. By 2024, during his campaign to reclaim the White House, he was proclaiming his intention to make the U.S. a dominant force in crypto. And once in office, he signed bipartisan legislation to regulate stablecoins; issued crypto-friendly executive orders, in a reversal of the cryptoskepticism of the Biden administration; and pardoned several people convicted of crypto-related crimes. Amid this political push, the Trump family's sprawling business has diversified beyond its original real estate empire and come to look more like a crypto conglomerate. But one strategy has been consistent: The family expands its range by attaching the Trump name to products and businesses largely developed and operated by others. That company owns a substantial real estate portfolio, but also licenses the Trump name for a fee to developers and other entrepreneurs—generating an income stream with a minimal investment from the organization itself. The Trump family's public social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), has launched a number of crypto-related investment products, including exchange-traded funds, but it has leaned on digital-asset exchange Crypto.com to build and administer them. While it owns almost 78,000 Bitcoin mining servers, American Bitcoin doesn't own or operate the Vega facility itself, or employ its technicians; that's also true of the company's three other data centers. Instead, American Bitcoin pays Genoot's Hut 8 to run its mining operations. “It's the playbook of take the Trump brand, generate a bunch of attention, get the money, and then pay other people to do the work,” said Austin Campbell, a longtime crypto executive and adjunct professor at New York University who teaches classes on blockchain technology. An American Bitcoin spokesman says of Campbell's description, “That characterization is inaccurate. By most measures, these crypto ventures have been lucrative. And while their on-paper valuations wax and wane with the gyrations of the markets, the family's crypto ventures were worth north of $3 billion as of early January, according to an analysis by Fortune and data from crypto analytics firm Nansen. That estimate includes stakes in the memecoin and World Liberty Financial's currency, holdings that Fortune discounted because of their limited liquidity. The rough valuation also includes shares in crypto-related public companies, including American Bitcoin and TMTG. (The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.) In early January, World Liberty Financial applied for a federal banking charter. That's the kind of intersection of the Trump family's business interests with President Trump's powers that has raised alarms in Washington. There is, to be sure, a growing sentiment in tech and investing circles that policymakers and advisors might make better decisions if they have some skin in the game. Ethics experts say that the Trump family's crypto bets have created unprecedented conflicts of interest. “Is he making these decisions because he thinks this is a good thing?” asked Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School who researches government ethics, in reference to the president's crypto policies. “Or is he making these decisions because he knows what's going to have a direct effect on his family's finances?” “Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, in a statement. Eric Trump has also repeatedly pushed back against intimations of impropriety. “My father has no involvement in the Trump Organization,” he said. Beyond rhetorical battles over propriety, there's the question of whether any public company in crypto—an industry inherently tied to politics and regulatory action—can maintain momentum after President Trump leaves office. As of mid-January its price was down more than 25% from its mid-autumn peak, after investors grew anxious over signs of a softening U.S. economy. That tumble coincided with a substantial drawdown in American Bitcoin's stock, which was down more than 70% since its early-September IPO. (Other digital asset treasury companies saw their stocks tumble at around the same time.) The volatility has spread to other Trump crypto assets as well. “I've got more conviction on cryptocurrency right now than ever before,” he said. “Volatility is our friend.” In fact, he, Genoot, and other insiders bought more shares of American Bitcoin in December and early January—in time to benefit from a post–New Year bounce. But others view the data center as a net positive. “It's going to provide some jobs for a rural area that doesn't always have jobs,” said Kari Mays, Vega's assistant city secretary. And local residents do know about the Trumps' role. “[The town] would probably love to tell that story,” said Taylor, the grocery store owner and newspaper editor, about Eric's motorcade driving through rural Texas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's no secret that bitcoin BTC$89,307.80 is currently failing its many narratives, including the claim that it can serve as an inflation hedge or a safe-haven asset amid uncertainty. While gold has climbed more than 80% during this period of high inflation, geopolitical skirmishes, and interest rate uncertainty, bitcoin has dropped 14% year over year. In theory, assets that protect against inflation should rise when the value of money falls. That divergence has raised fresh questions: why would anyone buy bitcoin now when precious metals and equities give better returns?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigeria's experiment with formally regulating cryptocurrency businesses has encountered its first visible constraint, after Quidax, a provisionally licensed digital asset exchange, discontinued its peer-to-peer (P2P) trading feature just five months after launching it. Quidax informed customers via email that its P2P marketplace would be shut down, disabling ads, merchant chats and escrow services, while other products such as instant swaps and order-book trading would continue to operate.

It enables users to buy and sell digital assets directly with one another, often settling transactions through bank transfers outside the exchange itself.

Licensing delays and rising thresholds The timing of Quidax's decision is significant. Startups admitted into the SEC's ARIP programme, including Quidax and competitor Busha, were expected to transition to full crypto licences by August 2025, after completing the one-year incubation period. That process has since stalled, with the regulator pausing licensing approvals to reassess its supervisory readiness. At the same time, Nigeria's crypto rulebook is becoming more demanding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid this environment, a new contender has emerged, and it does not simply speculate on future value; it is redefining how investors bank in the digital era. While traditional finance (TradFi) has long considered Ripple's XRP as the gold standard for banking infrastructure, a structural shift is happening. On that note, investors are turning to Digitap ($TAP), an omni-bank ecosystem that makes crypto spendable like cash in the real world. This explains why demand in its crypto presale is high, based on the more than 197 million $TAP tokens sold so far. Digitap is designed with a rare combination of retail spendability and institutional-grade security, making it one of the best altcoins to buy today. Its ability to work as a bridge currency for RippleNet gave it some real-world legitimacy that other tokens could match. Nonetheless, TradFi investors are starting to notice a growing utility gap while XRP trades around the $1.89 level. XRP is considered a wholesale asset, helping move huge amounts of money between central banks and large financial institutions. But XRP is hard to use for normal users and small businesses in their daily transactions. Furthermore, Digitap offers a direct connection to the global economy via Visa-integrated cards. Digitap's focus on immediate, retail-ready utility explains why investors are buying into its crypto presale. Also, its commitment to cross-chain interoperability makes it thrive above XRP and other traditional payment tokens. Interestingly, Digitap has pushed the Solana integration, meaning that users can now top up their accounts with assets using the Solana network. Thus, the strategic integration has enabled SOL holders to link their funds to a banking environment where they can spend them instantly. Investors will only need to top up their Digitap account with SOL and then use their virtual or physical Visa card to transact at more than 80 million merchant locations. The smooth transition from high-speed blockchain to real-world purchasing power is what TradFi investors want when looking for the best altcoins to buy. Since $TAP is deeply connected with all functions of the Digitap network, its demand is fueled by real-world utility, not speculative trading. The project's economic model is built for long-term sustainability and scarcity. Digitap has adopted a hyper-deflationary buy-back and burn mechanism, where 50% of all platform profits are used to buy $TAP from the open market. Therefore, as more people use Digitap and transact, $TAP's supply decreases. This operation model creates a revenue-backed scarcity, which is highly attractive to TradFi investors. Hence, $TAP is a good crypto to buy this January for long-term gains. Another major reason why investors consider Digitap as the best crypto to buy in 2026 is its large, verified user base. The product-first strategy is believed to be powering this growth. This means users can sample its technology before buying the token. The operational readiness helps to lower Digitap's risk profile considerably. Currently, selling at $0.0439 with a set exchange listing price of $0.14, $TAP's value proposition becomes undeniable. For investors who missed XRP in its early days, Digitap offers them a second chance to own a portion of the core infrastructure that could shape the next decade of digital finance. TradFi investors are focusing on $TAP because it has built a definite path toward sustainable profits powered by real-world utility. By offering investors an omni-bank ecosystem that already works and integrating with the Solana network, Digitap has set a new standard for digital banking. It offers the utility, security, and growth potential that traditional investors demand. While XRP is a dominant player for institutional cross-border remittances, Digitap offers better growth potential since it focuses on retail users. Therefore, $TAP is a better altcoin to buy for the banking bull run of 2026 than XRP at $1.89. Believer in Open-Source Software, Blockchain Technology & a Free and Fair Internet for all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This asset has utility and a few other useful features. Still, some long-term investors prefer owning it to other cryptocurrencies, because they're buying an asset with exposure to a critically important platform within the crypto ecosystem more than they are depending on any single feature of that platform to deliver a return. So if you care about what can still be relevant in crypto in five or 10 years, Ethereum's mix of steady economic activity on-chain, ongoing tech upgrades, and high degree of traditional finance access are hard to ignore as a package. Let's dive in and look at these factors a bit more. Ethereum is far and away the most established general-purpose smart contract chain, and that status is the most important reason why it's valuable. Decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, meaning on-chain lending, trading, and collateral management, concentrate where the most liquidity and integrations already exist, which, in the crypto sector, effectively means that every dollar that flows in has good odds of settling on Ethereum either temporarily or permanently. One metric to watch on this front is DeFi total value locked (TVL), which corresponds to the dollar value of assets deposited into DeFi apps. Ethereum leads all other chains on TVL today, with $69.4 billion in TVL, and there is no reason to expect that to change anytime soon, as for a long time the chain's name was effectively synonymous with DeFi. Ethereum is also constantly being upgraded to offer better features and higher efficiency to users and app developers. Recently, the chain has experienced a pace of two major updates per year, which is considerably more than most of its peers. Ethereum's supply is not capped like Bitcoin (BTC 1.13%), but it's not trying to be Bitcoin with extra features either. Under its proof-of-stake (PoS) design, the network's validators lock up their coins to secure the network and earn a reward; that reward is provided by issuing new Ether and adding to the supply. And, during transactions, which incur gas fees, a portion of the fees are burned, removing them from circulation permanently. Importantly, Ethereum's ongoing fee burn can and often does exceed its ongoing issuance, so its circulating supply can shrink during busier periods. That makes the coin a store of value, even if its supply isn't anywhere near as scarce as Bitcoin's is -- and being a store of value with as much utility as Ethereum is another big reason why many long-term investors prefer to hold it. Finally, the coin now has a handful of different institutional on-ramps, which helps to attract and retain institutional capital. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are nothing new at this point, but they do help to increase the asset's legitimacy and make it more appealing to those who have a more conservative temperament when investing.
