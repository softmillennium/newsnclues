                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new forensic science of proving what's real As deepfakes blur the line between truth and fiction, we'll need a new class of forensic experts to determine what's real, what's fake and what can be proved in court The year is 2030; deepfakes and artificial-intelligence-generated content are everywhere, and you are a member of a new profession—a reality notary. From your office, clients ask you to verify the authenticity of photos, videos, e-mails, contracts, screenshots, audio recordings, text message threads, social media posts and biometric records. All four are at stake on a rainy Monday when an elderly woman tells you her son has been accused of murder. It is sealed in a plastic bag stapled to an affidavit, which explains that the drive contains evidence the prosecution intends to use.

Your first step isn't to look at the video—that would be like traipsing through a crime scene. Instead you connect the drive to an offline computer with a write blocker, a hardware device that prevents any data from being written back to the drive. This is like bringing evidence into a sterile lab. Next you create a copy and hash it, checking that the codes match. Then you lock the original in a secure archive. The video is convincing because it's boring—no cinematic angles, no dramatic lighting. You've actually seen it before—it recently began circulating online, weeks after the murder. You were still at university in the mid-2020s when deepfakes went from novelty to big business. Verification firms reported a 10-fold jump in deepfakes between 2022 and 2023, and face-swap attacks surged by more than 700 percent in just six months. By 2024 a deepfake fraud attempt occurred every five minutes. You had friends whose bank accounts were emptied, and your grandparents wired thousands to a virtual-kidnapping scammer after receiving altered photos of your cousin while she traveled through Europe. In 2021 the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) was founded to develop a standard for tracking a file's history. If the video has any, you could track its creation and modifications. But most have been slow to adopt, and Content Credentials are often stripped as files circulate online. In a 2025 Washington Post test, journalists attached Content Credentials to an AI-generated video, but every major platform where they uploaded it stripped the data. Next you open the file's metadata, though it rarely survives online transfers. They were reset at some point—all are now listed as midnight—and the device field is blank. Nothing indicates the clip came directly from a surveillance system. You begin the Internet sleuthing that investigators call open-source intelligence, or OSINT. After eight minutes, it delivers the results. The reason you are finding the C2PA data is that companies such as Truepic and Qualcomm developed ways for phones and cameras to cryptographically sign content at the point of capture. What's clear now is that the video didn't come from a security camera. You watch it again for physics that don't make sense. The slowed frames pass like a flip-book. Then, at the edge of a wall, light that shouldn't be there pulses. A phone camera scans the world line by line, top to bottom, many times each second, whereas a screen refreshes in cycles—60, 90 or 120 times per second. Someone might have simply recorded the original surveillance monitor to save the footage before it was overwritten. You check for watermarks now—invisible statistical patterns inside the image. Your software finds hints of what might be a watermark but nothing certain. Cropping, compression or filming a screen can damage watermarks, leaving only traces, like those of erased words on paper. Next you run it through a deepfake detector like Reality Defender. You break the video apart into stills. You use the InVID-WeVerify plug-in to pull clear frames and do reverse-image searches on the accused son's face to see if it appeared in another context. The alley's lighting is harsh, casting a distinct grain. His jacket and hands and the wall behind him have its coarse digital noise, but his face doesn't. It's slightly smoother, from a cleaner source. Security cameras give moving objects a distinct blur, and their footage is compressed. The shooter has that blur and blocky quality except for his face. You move back to when the shooter appears. He raises the weapon in his left hand. She tells you her son is right-handed and sends you videos of him playing sports as a teenager. You measure its height and downward angle, using basic trigonometry to calculate the shooter's height—three inches taller than the woman's son. The notarized document you will send to the public defender won't read like a thriller but like a lab report. In 2030 a “reality notary” is no longer science fiction; it is the person whose services we use to ensure that people and institutions are what they appear to be.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These metals are effective but costly and limited in supply. One promising option is tungsten carbide, an Earth-abundant material already widely used in industrial machinery, cutting tools, and chisels. Despite its potential, tungsten carbide has not been easy to use as a catalyst. Researchers led by Marc Porosoff, an associate professor in the University of Rochester's Department of Chemical and Sustainability Engineering, have now made important progress that could allow tungsten carbide to compete with platinum in key chemical reactions. According to Sinhara Perera, a chemical engineering PhD student in Porosoff's lab, one of the main challenges lies in how tungsten carbide atoms arrange themselves. Tungsten carbide's atoms can form many different configurations, known as phases, says Perera. These phases can strongly influence how well the material performs as a catalyst. In a study published in ACS Catalysis, Porosoff, Perera, and chemical engineering undergraduate student Eva Ciuffetelli '27 manipulated tungsten carbide particles at the nanoscale inside chemical reactors that operate at temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius. They then ran chemical reactions and analyzed which versions delivered the strongest performance. The team identified one phase in particular, β-W2C, that showed exceptional performance in reactions that convert carbon dioxide into key building blocks for fuels and useful chemicals. With additional optimization by industry, the researchers believe this form of tungsten carbide could match platinum's effectiveness without its high price or supply limitations. Beyond carbon dioxide conversion, Porosoff and his collaborators have also explored tungsten carbide as a catalyst for recycling plastic waste. Their work focuses on upcycling, a process that transforms discarded plastics into higher-value products rather than lower-grade materials. In a study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, led by Linxao Chen from the University of North Texas and supported by Porosoff and University of Rochester Assistant Professor Siddharth Deshpande, researchers demonstrated how tungsten carbide can drive a chemical process known as hydrocracking. Hydrocracking breaks large molecules into smaller ones that can be reused to make new materials. While hydrocracking is common in oil and gas refining, applying it to plastic waste has proven difficult. Platinum-based catalysts also rely on microporous structures that are too small for large plastic molecules to enter, limiting their effectiveness. "Tungsten carbide, when made with the correct phase, has metallic and acidic properties that are good for breaking down the carbon chains in these polymers," says Porosoff. "These big bulky polymer chains can interact with the tungsten carbide much easier because they don't have micropores that cause limitations with typical platinum-based catalysts." Tungsten carbide was not only far less expensive than platinum catalysts, but it was also more than 10 times as efficient in hydrocracking plastic waste. Researchers say this approach could open new pathways for recycling plastics and advancing a circular economy where materials are continuously reused. A key factor behind these advances is the ability to precisely measure temperature on catalyst surfaces. Many industrial processes rely on multiple reactions occurring together, making accurate temperature control even more important. Current temperature measurement methods provide only rough averages, which can hide critical variations at the catalyst surface. This lack of precision makes it difficult to fully understand and reproduce catalytic behavior. "We learned from this study that depending on the type of chemistry, the temperature measured with these bulk readings can be off by 10 to 100 degrees Celsius," says Porosoff. Using this technique, the team examined tandem catalyst systems in which heat released by one reaction drives another reaction that requires heat input. Better matching these reactions can reduce wasted energy and improve overall efficiency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new image presents an extraordinary view of our galaxy as seen from the Southern Hemisphere, revealing the Milky Way across a broad range of radio wavelengths, often described as different colors of radio light. These systems were needed to process and combine massive amounts of data collected during two major sky surveys. Focusing specifically on our own galaxy, the new image represents a major leap forward compared with the earlier GLEAM image released in 2019. These improvements allow astronomers to examine the Milky Way in far greater detail than before, uncovering features that were previously difficult or impossible to see. "This vibrant image delivers an unparalleled perspective of our Galaxy at low radio frequencies," Ms. Mantovanini said. "It provides valuable insights into the evolution of stars, including their formation in various regions of the Galaxy, how they interact with other celestial objects, and ultimately their demise." Ms. Mantovanini's research focuses on supernova remnants, the expanding clouds of gas and energy created when a star explodes at the end of its life. While astronomers have already identified hundreds of these remnants, many researchers believe thousands more remain undiscovered. "You can clearly identify remnants of exploded stars, represented by large red circles. The smaller blue regions indicate stellar nurseries where new stars are actively forming," Ms. Mantovanini said. By analyzing how bright pulsars appear across different GLEAM-X frequencies, astronomers hope to learn more about how these objects produce radio waves and where they are distributed throughout the Milky Way. "No low-frequency radio image of the entire Southern Galactic Plane has been published before, making this an exciting milestone in astronomy." These sources include pulsars, planetary nebulae, compact HII regions -- which are dense, ionized gas clouds in space -- as well as distant galaxies that lie far beyond the Milky Way.
