Christine Chiu revealed that she has lost a majority of her hair recently. “My first custom wig fitting,” the Bling Empire alum, 42, wrote alongside a clip from her consultation with her hair stylist Maranda Widlund shared via the professional’s Instagram Story on Wednesday, March 19. “For those who don’t know, I am experiencing sudden and dramatic hair loss.” Chiu added that she had already “lost 99 percent of my hair over the last few months.” While Chiu does not know the cause of her hair loss at this time, she has been “running labs, ultrasounds [and] tests” to find out the root issue. In the clip, Chiu donned a dark brown wig with luscious long locks that fell down to her torso. Christine was an original cast member on Bling Empire for all three seasons.

In unanimous bipartisan agreement, Bob Weir has been voted the most swoll man in rock and roll at the age of 77. The founding Grateful Dead member, who’s passionate about shredding his glutes just as much as his guitars, told Rolling Stone in a new interview that he’s lately been too busy to film more of his much-loved “gymming” videos. However, he has a new fitness regime if anyone is interested in trying it out for themselves. “I’ve taken up running barefoot in the morning on rocky roads. Because I think that’s a great way to get grounded,” Weir explained. And I try to incorporate meditation into that. It’s a practice that’s amounting to something for me.” Asked why he subjects his feet to the ground as opposed to, say, wearing socks, Weir insists the physical and emotional calluses are worth it. “I just followed my footsteps, really. We’ll see where it leads to,” he added. “Maybe I’ll live longer, or at least happier.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The two-part doc will be told by the brothers’ sister Angel Carter Conrad, and include conversations between Angel and Nick. According to a press release, Angel “unpacks the complicated family dynamics that led to the untimely deaths of three of the original five Carter kids as well as their father.” She will also discuss the “pain, fame, expectations, addiction, assumptions and at the heart of it all, critical mental health issues faced by the family, with the hope to honor their journey and transform their past into a message of hope and purpose for others encountering similar challenges.”

Per the the release, the upcoming film will also highlight home videos, family photos, audio recordings, and private text messages, and will “[pull] back the veil on the Carter family as we hear them speak out for the first time: from their sadness and fear to love and hope.”

“I Can Only Imagine 2,” the sequel to the 2018 breakout hit “I Can Only Imagine,” will open theatrically on March 20, 2026, in a wide release from Lionsgate.

John Michael Finley will again star as Millard, while Dennis Quaid and Trace Adkins will reprise their roles as Arthur and MercyMe manager Scott Brickell, respectively.

New cast members for the sequel include Milo Ventimiglia as singer/songwriter Tim Timmons, Sophie Skelton taking over the role of Bart’s wife Shannon, Arielle Kebbel as Hilary Timmons, Joshua Bassett as Bart’s brother-in-law Christopher and Sammy Dell as Bart’s son Sam.

The film from Lionsgate and Kingdom Story Company will continue the inspiring true story of MercyMe’s Bart Millard as he faces a deeply personal battle as a father that he can’t fight alone. The sequel will be directed by Brent McCorkle and Andrew Erwin from a screenplay written by McCorkle. Producers include Kevin Downes, Erwin, Cindy Bond, Bart Millard, Daryl Lefever and Joshua Walsh.

The first film took in over $83 million at the domestic box office against a budget of just $7 million. “I Can Only Imagine” told the backstory of how the best-selling Christian single of all time, MercyMe’s song of the same name, came to exist. “So much of Millard’s story is simultaneously relatable and optimistic that the movie works for the same reason the song does: It lightens the burden of the pain people are shouldering today, and gives them something to look forward to,” Variety‘s chief film critic Peter Debruge wrote in his review.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/ludwig-david-mitchell-bbc-britbox-detective-mysteries-1235103340/'>Mystery Dramedy ‘Ludwig’ Gets Everything Right — Apart from Its Actual Mysteries</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 18:00:00 <p>
First screened on the BBC last September to great acclaim and a large audience, “Ludwig” is an unusual detective dramedy in how it appears to treat its whodunits as an afterthought. Any armchair sleuths hoping to test their clue-cracking skills will be left similarly frustrated by the fact breadcrumbs are practically non-existent throughout. For a premise rooted in the world of conundrums, its answers rely far too heavily on ol’ dumb luck. But his reclusive, borderline agoraphobic lifestyle is suddenly torn apart when sister-in-law Lucy (Anna Maxwell Martin) calls him out of the blue and insists he make the 140-mile taxi journey to her home, no questions asked. Trusting the bond they developed as childhood friends — highlighted endearingly by Lucy’s bargaining tool of spaghetti carbonara — John reluctantly follows such orders to learn his detective twin brother James has gone missing. To determine his whereabouts, and why he left a worrying “Burn After Reading” letter of resignation beforehand, Lucy demands John impersonate him to retrieve a potentially revealing notebook at Cambridge police HQ. “Ludwig” draws plenty of comic mileage from this scenario alone, as John struggles to get to grips with anything outside his hermetically-sealed wheelhouse: his car parking skills, for example, which make Mr. Bean’s look flawless, or the mobile phone he hasn’t used since it was gifted at Christmas 2004. “You know kids today… with their skateboards,” he responds after a “colleague” enquires about his “son.” Apparently Cambridge’s greatest minds aren’t able to tell the difference between their confident, competent colleague of many years and his untrained, socially inept doppelganger — even when he amusingly refers to a post-mortem as a “how did they die test?” — and he’s soon roped into the first of many unsolved murders. Mitchell might not exactly be stretching himself here — he’s essentially playing a more sympathetic version of his star-making, typecasting role in “Peep Show.” Nevertheless, few comedy actors are better at inhabiting the bumbling, buttoned-up Brit. “Buildings, offices, computers,” he vexes after a stress-inducing first day on the job. As you’d expect, John soon becomes the force’s secret weapon, much to the ire of Lucy, who grows increasingly irked at how his small undercover mission has turned into a new career. Best-known as permanently exasperated mom Julia in “Motherland,” Maxwell Martin bounces off Mitchell brilliantly, also lending their lifelong relationship a will they/won’t they frisson which intensifies the longer they spend in each other’s company. Possibly connected to the case which scared James into hiding, Russell (Dipo Ola) serves as the audience’s stand-in, responding to all of his new partner’s idiosyncrasies with a mixture of bewilderment and awe. And Dorothy Atkinson is a regular scene-stealer as firm but fair boss Carol. As the BBC’s most-watched scripted original of 2024, “Ludwig” has already been given a second season. That’s a good get, considering its central enigma — which throws in everything from conspiracy theorists to police corruption into the knotty mix — remains open-ended.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Now, as Wilmore and Williams reunite with their families, Starliner will face questions on why its test mission failed. Keep scrolling for a full rundown on Wilmore and Williams’ planned test mission, what they can expect now that they’re home and reactions from prominent figures: Former NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams were originally supposed to take part in an eight-day mission for Boeing’s Starliner when their craft took off June 5, 2024. “This is a very oddly specific question that I ask guys on first dates. Helium leaks were a recurring problem throughout Starliner’s journey, forcing flight controllers to close off two helium manifolds, which in turn disabled 6 of Starlinder’s 28 reaction control system thrusters. Wilmore and Williams were forced to keep Starliner in stasis outside of the space station’s no-fly zone until mission crews on Earth were able to reset the thrusters with a series of tests. This left Wilmore and Williams essentially stranded on the space station until NASA was able to launch a rescue mission in March. I understand why others may think that,” Wilmore told CNN in February. While NASA and Boeing were working on a rescue plan, Wilmore and Williams conducted more than 900 hours of research, according to Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator of NASA’s Space Operations Mission Directorate. “That one time my baby took me to @nasaames and I got to fly 🥹,” Ayesha, 35, wrote via Instagram on Sunday, December 22, alongside a slideshow of pics from the pair’s outing. President Donald Trump ordered NASA to move up its timetable for a rescue mission when he took office in January. On March 18, Wilmore and Williams left the ISS to join two other astronauts, NASA’s Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, on board the Crew Dragon spacecraft for a 17-hour journey back to earth. SpaceX’s Dragon landed safely off the coast of Florida at around 5:57 p.m. Additionally, they regularly endure balance and coordination complications once they return home, plus the possibility of psychological stress and sleep changes due to living in isolation for lengthy periods. Because Wilmore and Williams were originally contracted for an eight-day mission but spent more than 900 hours doing research by the time of their rescue, NASA addressed whether they would receive overtime pay in addition to their reported $152,000 salaries. Related: Former SpaceX Employees Sue Elon Musk for Sexual Harassment Eight former SpaceX employees have filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the aerospace company and its CEO Elon Musk. “When NASA astronauts are aboard the International Space Station, they receive regular, 40-hour work-week salaries. They do not receive overtime or holiday/weekend pay,” NASA told People. As for Starliner, NASA commercial crew program manager Steve Stich told reporters ahead of the rescue mission that Boeing would need to mount another test flight — potentially uncrewed — before pursuing regular missions to the ISS with human crew. Stich later confirmed that Boeing was in the process of organizing another Starliner test mission, following speculation that it could be too costly an investment for the aerospace company. “[We are] working hand in hand with Boeing as well on certification of Starliner, getting that vehicle back to flight,” he said, via BBC News. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk appeared on Fox News on March 18 to thank his rescue crew for bringing the two stranded astronauts home safely. And so congratulations to the SpaceX / NASA teams on excellent work,” he said. Right now, they’re the first people in history to honestly text someone, ‘Sorry, just saw this!’” “Yup, they were up there for nine months, or as the two astronauts put it, ‘There’s three of us now,'” Fallon added. Millions around the world documented on social media what it was like to watch Wilmore and Williams return home after their unexpectedly lengthy stay in space. “In an age of division, let’s take a moment to recognize an achievement that transcends politics: the safe return of our astronauts. This extraordinary feat is a testament to human ingenuity, perseverance, and the boundless possibilities of science and engineering,” The Biggest Loser star Jillian Michaels wrote via X. Today, let’s celebrate not just the individuals who embarked on this journey, but the generations of visionaries, scientists, and engineers who made this moment possible. Happy Days legend Henry Winkler shared, “The Astronauts are home … what a moment ! NASA Acting Administrator Janet Petro said her team was “thrilled” to welcome all four astronauts back to earth following the successful rescue mission.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Here’s a quick rundown of what to know about Chisholm, the man set to become the new Celtics owner, pending league approval. Chisholm was born and raised in Georgetown, Mass., 30 miles north of Boston. As an investor, Chisholm is the hands-on manager of Menlo Park, Calif.-based Symphony Technology Group (STG), a private equity firm with roughly $10 billion in assets under management that focuses on developing software businesses. Prior to starting STG in 2002, he also co-founded The Valent Group. Bill’s wife, Kimberly, is a published author who previously taught at Cal-Berkeley. According to a 2009 profile of STG by Forbes, the company is known for a traditional private equity approach of seeking to improve portfolio companies’ operations with its in-house know-how. In past interviews, Chisholm has emphasized STG’s single-sector focus, staff of experienced operators and desire to grow or “transform” portfolio companies. Chisholm’s net worth has not been publicly reported. The company debuted on Buyouts’ list of the top 100 PE firms in terms of fundraising, with STG placing 54th thanks to its nearly $10 billion haul across five years. Wadhwani, who stepped aside as STG CEO in 2017, has an estimated net worth of $5 billion. Chisholm’s group includes current Celtics stakeholder Rob Hale and Related Companies president Bruce A.

Kristina Khorram, Sean “Diddy” Combs’ chief of staff at Bad Boy Entertainment, broke her silence on claims that she “aided and abetted” the rapper’s alleged crimes. “For months, horrific accusations have been made about me in various lawsuits regarding my former boss,” Khorram said in a statement to Rolling Stone on Tuesday, March 18. I have never condoned or aided and abetted the sexual assault of anyone. She continued, “The idea that I could be accused of playing a role in — or even being a bystander to — the rape of anyone is beyond upsetting, disturbing and unthinkable. That is not who I am, and my heart goes out to all victims of sexual assault. Related: Diddy’s Attorneys Claim Videos of Him and Cassie ‘Confirm’ His Innocence INF/INSTAR Sean “Diddy” Combs has been under investigation for at least a year after being accused of sexual assault by multiple people. Last year, music producer Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones named Khorram in his sexual assault lawsuit against Diddy, calling her the “Ghislaine Maxwell to Sean Combs’ Jeffrey Epstein” in his court filing. Jones alleged that Diddy sexually harassed, drugged and threatened him while they were working on Diddy’s 2023 album, The Love Album: Off the Grid. Jones claimed that he subsequently told Khorram about these alleged unwanted encounters. According to Jones, she allegedly responded, “You know, Sean will be Sean.” He also claimed she “attempted to downplay Mr. Combs’ groping … as friendly horseplay, stating that those acts were Mr. Combs’s way of ‘showing that he likes you.’” “His reckless name-dropping about events that are pure fiction and simply did not happen is nothing more than a transparent attempt to garner headlines.” Holley continued, “We have overwhelming, indisputable proof that his claims are complete lies.

A foreign language action comedy is headed to U.S. movie theaters this spring, but audiences won’t have to groan about subtitles. For the first time, an international feature film will look and sound as if it was made in English thanks to artificial intelligence. Though the supernatural Swedish adventure “Watch the Skies” was made in its native tongue, AI company Flawless has digitally altered the film’s images and sound so character mouth movements and speech will be perfectly synced for English speaking viewers. Flawless has partnered with distributor XYZ films to roll the film out to cineplexes on May 9. “For the movie industry, this is a game changer,” producer Albin Pettersson said in a making-of featurette included below. The original film was titled “UFO Sweden,” and a full trailer for the English-language version is expected next week. Variety previously wrote about Flawless AI on the heels of last year’s Cannes Film Festival, where co-founder Scott Mann discussed the ethics of reformatting and the potential international films will now have in North America. “Showing our materials to filmmakers, especially over the past year, they realize the potential from going to a local stage to a global stage. It’s a huge opportunity to get your work out and it’s been invigorating. They are so excited about showing their work in a wider audience, and especially in America,” said Mann.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Attendees at this year’s Sundance were abuzz about where the festival would choose to relocate in 2027. Is it staying in Utah, but shifting to Salt Lake City? Everyone has a preference, but it’s up to Sundance, not us. However, we decided to hear the same pitches (or, a reasonable facsimile) that will help Sundance make its decision and talk to the people who know those cities best. IndieWire spoke with film commissioners from each of the three finalist cities. From the number of venues to available lodging, affordability, accessibility, and overall vibe, these are the factors that Sundance leadership must weigh before announcing its decision, which is expected to come this spring. There’s an Eccles Theatre and a Main Street in Salt Lake City, Utah, too. The city could also expand into many other performing arts facilities, theaters, restaurants, and Music Cafe options. Utah Film Commission director Virginia Pearce, who put in 14 years working for the festival, enjoyed walking the city with her Sundance host committee and seeing it with fresh eyes. “There’s a lot of standalone, big, purpose-built theaters,” she said. We would be enthusiastic to find locations that meet [Sundance’s] needs.” Right now, Sundance needs more screens than theater-starved Park City can offer. Lodging: Salt Lake would expand the scale of available hotels and Airbnbs. “We have some beautiful spaces looking out over the mountains from the Valley perspective, such a cool view,” said Pearce, “as well as some independent hotels that could be a great fit. We are a major capital city that hosts large-scale events all the time.” Affordability: The popularity of Sundance saw Park City prices skyrocket for housing, dining, and parking near the ski resorts in Park City and Deer Valley. “It’s a tough road for the city to handle,” said Pearce. “It’s been tough for festivalgoers and the festival itself. Move the festival to Salt Lake, with Park City as a special opening- or closing-weekend location, and costs plummet. “Salt Lake and Park City got together and came up with some innovative ideas about how to create a new experience that expands the festival footprint to Salt Lake. The pitch we made is keeping some things in Park City, just because it’s got that feel that people love, but growing a lot more in Salt Lake. Sponsor Opportunities: Upscale Park City and Deer Valley would remain a lure for sponsors who want to entertain clients in ski resorts. Salt Lake City offers “all of the things you get with a big city,” said Pearce, “but you can also be skiing at six or seven resorts within 30 to 45 minutes. Pearce expects Utah Health would remain a loyal supporter as well as longtime sponsor Adobe, which has a significant presence in SLC’s tech center, Silicon Slopes. “Tech would be a great area to expand into,” she said. Airport Access: SLC is a Delta Airlines hub with a still-new airport and direct flights from most major cities, including Atlanta, New York, and Minneapolis, plus super-cheap fares from Los Angeles. Local Vibe: Salt Lake has grown into a sophisticated urban sprawl with a vibrant downtown, thriving art scene, and bustling nightlife with street vendors and musicians. Skiing is way off-site in several locations, including Park City. Salt Lake’s an enormous city, after all; it accommodated the Winter Olympics in 2002. Two other members on our host committee were former managing directors. It’s hard to go anywhere in Salt Lake without hitting someone who has worked for Sundance. A lot of people just can’t imagine it being anywhere else.” “Both cities, Salt Lake and Park City, have been supporting financially since the beginning,” said Pearce. “The legislature has been supportive and allocated $3.5 million to Sundance.” If Sundance stays in Utah, the legislature will approve an ongoing 10-year contract at that level. “No, I won’t veto that bill,” he told reporters. Venues: Cincinnati wants to host Sundance in its Over-the-Rhine neighborhood. Once a German working-class neighborhood, it’s now one of the hipper spots in town. The neighborhood’s Washington Park is flanked by several historic theaters that would become Sundance venues, including nine walkable spots within a radius of a few blocks. These include the Cincinnati Music Hall, Memorial Hall OTR, and the Woodward Theater, all accessible via a free streetcar that traverses Over-the-Rhine. Some will require larger screens, but Kristen Schlotman, Film Commissioner of Cincinnati, says the houses vary in size to offer diverse options for Sundance’s screenings. Lodging: In addition to a healthy mix of hotels and Airbnbs across the city, most major hotels are within a 15-20 minute drive from the airport. Schlotman added that at least eight new hotels are being built over the next two years. “Cincinnati truly is on the precipice of some great change and growth, and doing that with a partner that’s also on the precipice of great change and evolution … is a really exciting time for both,” Schlotman said. Affordability: Because it’s not a traditional college or resort town, Schlotman believes Cincinnati has more affordable options for attendees. She also promises that the Film Office is working with the tourism board to make sure “rates aren’t gouged.” She also points to filmmakers like Todd Haynes, Alexander Payne, David Lowery, Yorgos Lanthimos, Kelly Reichardt, Jennifer Kent, and George Clooney, who have all shot films in the city. Sponsor Opportunities: Once the home to many Fortune 500 companies, some of Cincinnati’s major events that have attracted other buzzy sponsors include BLINK, a street art, light-installation, and projection mapping festival; and AFCI, the Association of Film Commissioners International, which will bring its 50th anniversary to Cincy in 2025. Schlotman says the city is securing letters of intent from various carriers to increase air traffic for Sundance, much as it did when Cincinnati was in the Super Bowl in Los Angeles. For now, however, there is one nonstop between Los Angeles and Cincinnati; it’s a Delta redeye. Local Vibe: Cincinnati is not a cozy mountain town, but Schlotman believes that Race Street in Over-the-Rhine has enough independent shops, restaurants, and bars to capture the vibe of Main Street. Schlotman emphasizes its walkability, green space, and natural beauty. The current mayor for Cincinnati is a Democrat, but JD Vance’s half-brother Cory Bowman, a Republican, is running for the mayor seat. Schlotman couldn’t comment on the incentive the city is offering, but a local report suggested that Cincinnati has already approved $2.5 million for Sundance upfront, with an additional $2.5 million (bringing it to $5 million) if it is selected as the host city. From there, it’s a mile and a half to the 16-screen Cinemark Century Boulder, offering four times as many screens as Park City’s annual venue Holiday Village, which is itself about the same distance from Park City’s Main Street corridor. The Dairy Arts Center, a 20-minute walk from Pearl Street (which hosts many of Boulder’s hotels) seats 500. There are various screening spaces at the University of Colorado Boulder, whose own robust film program, which offers training in cinema studies and filmmaking, could provide an ample student volunteer body as well as other partnership opportunities. Added Colorado Film Commissioner Donald Zuckerman, “We’re in the Mountain West, and this town has a lot of history with the Redfords. Why wouldn’t Sundance want to be in the Mountain West? “These kids can work at Sundance and meet the filmmakers,” he said. There’s been talk that they’ve outgrown Utah. Lodging: Boulder offers a share of both luxury and economy hotel options, including the Limelight Boulder hotel opening this August, with 252 guest rooms and 26,000 feet of event space — including a first-for-downtown-Boulder conference center that could host festival panels. The downtown St. Julien Hotel & Spa brings a luxury option . “We collaborated with our local lodging partners to secure stable hotel pricing for the Festival over the proposed 10-year period, safeguarding attendees from price surges,” Hoffman said. Sponsor Opportunities: Boulder’s rugged surrounding terrain and hiking culture could lure outdoor recreation sponsors, while Google offices on Pearl Street provide an opportunity for partnership with the tech giant. “The entire Colorado Rocky Mountain wilderness sits at Boulder’s doorstep, and our luxury tour operators routinely provide customized outdoor experiences designed for travelers seeking to experience adventure in comfort,” Hoffman said. “As one of the wellness capitals of the West, it’s also a place where attendees can embrace unique relaxation, nourishment and rejuvenation experiences. Exceptional art, Michelin-star dining, and the ‘Rodeo Drive of outdoor apparel shopping’ on Pearl Street round out Boulder’s offerings.” Plus, there’s nearby skiing in Breckenridge, Aspen, and Vail. Another incentive: Recreational marijuana is legal for those 21 and over in Colorado. Bottom Line: Governor Jared Polis is the first non-incumbent openly gay man elected to Congress, and the decidedly blue Colorado doesn’t carry Utah’s baggage of hostility given its current anti-LGBTQ legislation on the table. Sundance is celebrated as a festival of diverse viewpoints, and whatever political backdrop the event heads into, the festival will want to take that into consideration. We don’t have a book-banning law on the books. We don’t have anti-trans bathroom law on the books. We are one of only two state legislatures in the country that have a gay person in the legislature [trans Colorado representative Brianna Titone]. We’re a perfect home for anybody who wants to come here. They will not be treated poorly ever or with anything but respect.” In terms of incentives, Boulder is less competitive than Salt Lake but offers robust cash for Sundance’s relocation. The Colorado Economic Development Commission approved a one-time $1.5 million incentive to support Sundance’s move to Boulder, with other contributions from the city and regional partners. The Colorado Office of Film Television and Media, meanwhile, has committed to $250,000 over five years.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Summer House star Ciara Miller is not trying to be in a love triangle with her costars Lexi Wood and Jesse Solomon. When Us Weekly caught up with Ciara, 29, shortly after Summer House premiered last month, she hinted that she was surprised by the implied drama between her, Lexi, 27, and Jesse, 29, in the season 9 trailer — which included Lexi accusing Jesse of being flirty with Ciara. “I am gonna watch and figure it out with the rest of you guys because I still don’t know,” Ciara told Us. Related: Ciara Miller Drags ‘Annoying’ West Wilson in ‘Summer House’ Clip Ciara Miller is taking no prisoners in the Summer House season 9 premiere — especially when it comes to West Wilson. “What was your car ride up?” Paige DeSorbo asked Jesse Solomon in Us Weekly’s exclusive clip from the Wednesday, February 12 episode. During the Wednesday, March 19, episode of the series, fans saw Jesse tell Ciara it was “turning me on” to have her leg touching him on a pool float. Andy Cohen was a big fan of the moment, asking the Watch What Happens Live audience if Ciara and Jesse “should just go for it” in a poll during Wednesday’s episode of the late night show. Ciara replied that she’s “done dating men on Bravo,” referring to her flings with Austen Kroll and West Wilson. “Me and Jesse were really cool [going into the summer].

A sequel to Pixar‘s 2017 animated gem “Coco” is in the works, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced during an annual shareholders meeting on Thursday. Oscar-winning producer Mark Nielsen (“Toy Story 4,” “Inside Out 2”) will produce the film. The film is tentatively slated for release in 2029. “While the film is just in the initial stages, we know it will be full of humor, heart and adventure,” said Iger. “And we can’t wait to share more soon.” Disney and Pixar’s “Coco” introduced Miguel, a 12-year-old with dreams of becoming a musician despite his family’s generations-old ban on music, who ventures to the vibrant Land of the Dead to unlock the real story behind his family history. “Coco” won two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song (“Remember Me”). The original “Coco” made $817 million worldwide for Pixar at the box office back in 2017. Upcoming for Pixar are “Elio” coming out this summer, which is an original property, as well as “Toy Story 5” coming next year. After a few disappointing turns at the box office with “Lightyear” and others that were kicked just to Disney+, Pixar is returning to the well for other IP, as it did with “Inside Out 2” last year, and it’s also moving away from longer-form series such as the recently released “Win Or Lose” or “Dream Productions” on Disney+.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Blake Lively has filed to dismiss Justin Baldoni’s multi-million dollar lawsuit amid the It Ends With Us costars’ ongoing legal drama. “This lawsuit is a profound abuse of the legal process that has no place in federal court. California law now expressly prohibits suing victims who make the decision to speak out against sexual harassment or retaliation, whether in a lawsuit or in the press,” Lively’s lawyers Mike Gottlieb and Esra Hudson told Us in a statement. In other words, in an epic self-own, the Wayfarer Parties’ attempt to sue Ms. Lively ‘into oblivion’ has only created more liability for them, and deservedly so, given what they have done.” Related: Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds Seek to Dismiss Justin Baldoni’s Lawsuit Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds are seeking to dismiss Justin Baldoni’s defamation lawsuit. A spokesperson for Lively also told Us, “The painful reality is that Ms. Lively is not alone in being sued for defamation after speaking up about being sexually harassed at work. While Ms. Lively has suffered greatly by speaking up and pursuing legal claims, it is important for other people to know that they have protections, and that there is a specific law that expressly protects them from being silenced or financially ruined by a defamation lawsuit because they had the courage to speak up.” News broke in December 2024 that Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment and allegedly launching a “social manipulation” campaign against her to destroy her reputation. “After my clients filed a comprehensive lawsuit packed with almost 200 pages of undeniable facts and documentary evidence which crushed their false allegations of a smear campaign by providing doctored communications to The New York Times, Blake and […] Reynolds filed to dismiss the lawsuit in court documents obtained by Us on Tuesday, March 18.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bolden made history as the first Black U.S. Secret Service agent assigned to the White House detail, where he guarded President John F. Kennedy who had personally appointed him in 1961. “For many years,” Coates says, “dark forces have tried to erase the true story of former Secret Service Agent Bolden. He was acquitted but re-tried and convicted ending up sentenced to six years in prison.” Coates has retained Stephen Jaffe — a former Special Assistant to the New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner in Oliver Stone’s JFK), who famously re-investigated the Kennedy assassination in 1967-1968 — to serve as a technical consultant on the film and an executive producer. Jaffe was a producer of the first feature film on the Kennedy assassination, 1973’s Executive Action, starring Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan. “Bolden’s story was known to us back then but not directly relevant to what happened in Dallas,” Jaffe says. “However, the efforts to silence him were clear proof that there had been several plots to assassinate President Kennedy before Dallas.” After Bolden’s 1964 conviction and sentencing, a movement to clear his name was started by people who learned of his compelling story and read the book. Finally, President Joe Biden granted Bolden a “full and unconditional pardon” in April 2022.

Meet the Breakout Star From Netflix's Adolescence</a></h2><b>Source:</b> usmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 17:01:07 <p>
Newcomer Owen Cooper is on the road to stardom after playing Jamie Miller in Netflix’s Adolescence miniseries. Cooper also noted that costar Stephen Graham, who played his dad on the show, was “always checking in” throughout the emotionally charged shoot. Leonardo DiCaprio was nominated four times before he finally won an Oscar for his fifth nod, for his part in The Revenant, at the 2016 ceremony. “When it was just us two — with no camera — in the police cell, and he scruffed me up and said, ‘You’re never going to see your mum again, you’re never going to see your dad again,’ and was going on and on,” the teen recalled. But after that point I was emotional in every take. When asked by Variety about his previous acting experience, Cooper replied, “Literally nothing.” He had dreams of being a professional soccer — football in the U.K. — player. “I want to play Spider-Man,” he told i-D in March 2025. Once Cooper decided that he wanted to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, he started taking classes at The Drama MOB in Manchester, England. “The lessons were just hourly lessons on a Tuesday where we’d get a piece of script and just read it off,” he told Variety. And then when Adolescence came, I obviously took it a lot more seriously. There was “literally nothing” on Cooper’s acting resume when he filmed a self-tape for Adolescence. Variety broke the news in March 2025 that Cooper would be taking on the role of Young Heathcliff in Fennell’s Wuthering Heights, which is set to star Jacob Elordi and Margot Robbie.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/revelations-movie-review-netflix-yeon-sang-ho-1235110262/'>‘Revelations’ Review: ‘Train to Busan’ Director Yeon Sang-ho Returns with a Glossy Netflix Thriller About a Pastor Who Sees God in All the Wrong Places</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 17:00:00 <p>
And yet, the real problem for Pastor Sung Min-chan (“A Taxi Driver” star Ryu Jun-yeol) is that he’s not alone in mistaking earthly hardship for a kind of divine instruction, as “Revelations” will soon find the good father crossing paths with a serial kidnapper who claims his crimes are committed at the behest of a “one-eyed monster,” as well as a young detective who believes that her dead sister — one of the criminal’s previous victims — is urging her to catch him from the afterlife. Reworked from Yeon’s comic of the same name (co-written by Choi Gyu-seok), “Revelations” is the kind of layered yet messy adaptation that results from someone trying to find new ways of telling a story they’ve almost thought to death already. It’s a movie with slippery footing and a solid foundation, both of which are on full display throughout a needlessly complicated first act that puts all of its characters in motion (while taking great pains not to reveal the full extent of their personal traumas and/or relationships with each other). That starts with the zealous Min-chan, whose eyes burn with evangelical zeal as he preaches in front of a neon red crucifix at his rundown church in a sad part of Seoul. It’s the kind of place that tends to attract lost sheep into its flock, and so Min-chan is unfazed when the visibly unwell Kwon Yang-rae (Shin Min-jae) wanders into a rainy afternoon service. That would be a legally acceptable explanation, but Min-chan — concerned about the impact that ending someone’s life might have on his chances to be hired as the pastor of a new mega-church — elects to bury the body, even if that might complicate the police’s efforts to locate Yang-rae’s latest victim. Detective Lee’s introduction is awkwardly shoehorned into the chaos of Min-chan’s descent towards Hell, and at no point during the 100 minutes that follow does “Revelations” find a way to make her personal journey feel like a meaningful counterweight to Min-chan’s crisis of faith. It doesn’t help that Shin is given exactly one emotion to play (guilt-stricken rage), while Ryu — as a hyper-pious man who would rather warp any number of evils around God’s will than question the righteousness of His word — is invited to sink his teeth into the juicy role of a jilted pastor who sees a divine plan in every sick twist of fate. They say God reserves his toughest battles for his strongest warriors, but to watch Min-chan provide emotional comfort to the missing girl’s mother as the police search for where Yang-rae might have stashed her, it would seem that he only feels like one of God’s strongest warriors because he turns every part of this story into a battle of biblical proportions (a dynamic that Ryu’s performance makes vividly clear as it bends his character’s goodness all the way around into an evil of its own). Min-chan becomes convinced that punishing Yang-rae is his divine purpose here on Earth, to the point that he begins to interpret every wild development in this story as its own deus ex machina (which conveniently allows Yeon’s screenplay to get away with murder). There’s gripping entertainment to be found in the sequences where Yeon’s characters desperately try to arrange themselves into a shape that might satisfy their own sick angles, and there’s no denying that Min-chan and Yeon-hui make for compelling adversaries. Perhaps, the uneasily ambivalent final moments of this movie lead us to wonder, because the pastor couldn’t think of anywhere else to go. “Revelations” will be available to stream on Netflix starting Friday, March 21.

“The Four Seasons” reunites Fey with her “30 Rock” collaborators Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield, who also co-create, co-showrun, write, and EP the show (Fisher additionally directs). Fey is joined by former “SNL” cast-mate Will Forte and “Date Night” co-star Steve Carell for the series, which is a reunion within a reunion (within a reunion) for the cast. Fey and Forte play a couple who have to sniff out which of their other married pals are on the brink of divorce across four vacations. The official synopsis reads: “Six old friends head for a relaxing weekend away only to learn that one couple in the group is about to split up. Over the course of a year, we follow the friends on four vacations, and watch how this shake-up affects everyone’s dynamic — sending old issues and new bubbling to the surface.” Erika Henningsen also stars. “The Four Seasons” is additionally executive produced by David Miner, Jeff Richmond, and Eric Gurian. The film followed a couple (Alda and Burnett) who vacation with their friends and get entangled in a comedy of errors. Alda was a recurring guest star on Fey’s “30 Rock.” Aside from Netflix, Domingo is set to make his directorial debut with “Scandalous” starring Sydney Sweeney as Kim Novak and David Jonsson as Sammy Davis Jr. Domingo previously helmed an episode of “Fear The Walking Dead.” “The Four Seasons” premieres May 1 on Netflix.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/shows/the-residence-review-uzo-aduba-netflix-1235104286/'>‘The Residence’ Review: Netflix’s Wacky, Well-Padded Whodunit Doesn’t Hold Up</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 16:00:00 <p>
There’s no mystery to the guiding ethos of Shonda Rhimes’ new Netflix series, “The Residence.” Episodes take their titles from popular mysteries like “Dial M for Murder” and “The Last of Sheila.” Characters name-drop fictional sleuths like Columbo, Sherlock Holmes, and Benoit Blanc. (“Knives Out,” a Netflix property, also lends its title to Episode 3.) Shots center a book by Agatha Christie, and dialogue references the board game “Clue.” But it’s not only a whodunit, nor was it created by the genre’s usual suspects: “The Residence” is also a comedy, filled with more caricatures than characters and less suspense than bemused curiosity. None of whom, it should be said, are known for dishing up who-donuts. Even without an answer to the series’ central question — only seven of the eight episodes were made available for review — it’s clear Cordelia Cupp’s inaugural case doesn’t hold up. “Who’s Cordelia Cupp?,” you may be asking. Played by three-time Emmy winner Uzo Aduba, Detective Cupp is the world’s top investigator. Her name sparks the aforementioned comparisons to famous fictional counterparts — she’s the “real” Jessica Fletcher, Miss Marple, or, in true alliterative harmony, Charlie Cale. Cupp has to sit down with everyone, sort through their stories, separate fact from fiction, conduct her own research, and avoid getting boxed out of the investigation by the powers that be (who rush her, doubt her, and generally get in the way of things). The President of the United States, Perry Morgan (Paul Fitzgerald), isn’t all that pushy, but his family more than makes up for it. His brother (Jason Lee) is a deadbeat who can’t be trusted to tell the truth until the third or fourth try, and President Morgan’s oldest friend, Harry Hollinger (Ken Marino), keeps trying to steer Cupp toward a conclusion that’s as politically innocuous as possible in order to protect his best bud (and meal ticket). used to run the show, so every one of his behind-the-scenes assistants has their own opinion of the deceased, as well as first-person accounts of his whereabouts that night, water-cooler gossip about various White House goings-on, and plenty more subjects that may or may not matter to determining who dun it. “The Residence” indulges these ostensibly off-topic tangents for reasons that are both adequately addressed in the narrative and purely beholden to its length. She needs to see the situation from every angle and then question anything askance until it’s been straightened out. To that end, Cupp doesn’t even believe in “suspects.” She just finds people (and what they have to say) “interesting,” which only infuriates her fellow authority figures who want to resolve the case as quickly as possible. Here, though, is where “The Residence” starts to deteriorate. A good murder-mystery keeps you guessing, sure, but it does so by planting persuasive red herrings and following promising leads. It doesn’t just overwhelm you with superfluous information while talking down to you at the same time — like it’s holding your hand in a rapidly flooding room instead of simply turning the nozzle to quell the rising tides. Instead of action driving the story, Davies (who writes every episode and serves as showrunner) tries to create momentum through regular repetition and quick cuts; dialogue bounces back and forth between characters like a ping-pong ball — the same core names or phrases batted between parties, who add just the slightest spin to each line to lend the appearance of actual progress. Susan Kelechi Watson and Molly Griggs in ‘The Residence’ Courtesy of Erin Simkin / Netflix And then you’ve also got a third timeline — the actual “present” — set during a Congressional hearing meant to clarify for the American people what really happened that night. (Al Franken and Eliza Coupe play opposing senators leading the committee.) Seven hours into the eight-hour first season, I can’t tell you why we need three timelines, except to make sure viewers who are only half-watching don’t get confused, and to help extend “The Residence” to the standard length of a modern TV season. (Without all the redundancies, this could’ve been wrapped up in, oh, three-to-four hours, max.) That time would’ve been better spent, however, investing in characters — or at least one character. With such a large ensemble, it’s inevitable that most parts will be one-dimensional. Let Jane Curtin lean all the way into her drunk judgey mother-in-law. License Jason Lee to turn loose his screwball side. Demand Ken Marino crank his politco’s sleaze-meter all the way up to 11. These are suspects who largely exist as comic relief — they don’t need to be deep, they just need to be funny (and, when the story calls for it, suspicious). (They’re also the best performances, alongside Susan Kelechi Watson, who shines despite serving as as a de facto tour guide.) “The Residence” leans on Cordelia Cupp’s birding fixation to make her seem quirky and eccentric — because anyone who’s smarter than everyone else can’t look or act like everyone else — but birding isn’t a personality. It doesn’t develop Cordelia as a character. It just traps her in a single character trait, while emphasizing her lack of depth and the show’s lack of imagination. Combined with Cupp’s rude and repeated dismissal of the universally affable Randall Park (who’s so inextricable from his character they share a last name), her flat characterization keeps her far removed from the beloved TV detectives she’s built to imitate. This isn’t an investigator you’d happily follow from one unsolvable case to the next, so much as a plot device masquerading as a person; her single-minded obsession with the case a transparent mask for the show’s single-minded focus on reminding viewers of other, better whodunits. All eight episodes will be released at once.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

From repurposing sets and actors playing multiple roles to various aural and visual motifs that all contribute to a sense of disorientation and déjà vu, the movie is filled with moments that allow the audience to intimately share the protagonist’s experience. As an actor struggling to figure out who he is and where he belongs after an accident leaves him with amnesia, André Holland is so perfect for the part that it’s difficult to imagine the movie without him. “The original script found its way to Ryan Gosling,” Johnson told IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. One of the film’s greatest strengths is its delicate and unique tone, which is haunting and dreamlike yet clear in its intentions; the script skillfully balances humor, tragedy, and suspense without ever losing sight of its larger philosophical concerns related to identity and memory. “The story could go in a lot of different directions,” Johnson said. So it was kind of fun to try all of these iterations and see what floated to the top. Ironically, by the time Johnson was ready to film his script he and Gosling felt their collaboration had shifted somewhat. “At a certain point Ryan felt more like my collaborator in a creative development kind of way,” Johnson said of the actor, who retains a producing credit on “The Actor.” “The story that we were shaping ultimately seemed like it wasn’t the right vehicle for him. Once André’s name came up, it was one of those things like, ‘Oh yeah, we wrote this movie for André, it’s meant to be.

Stassi Schroeder‘s return to reality TV is one of the highlights in the Vanderpump Villa trailer — but we also have questions about Marciano Brunette‘s flirty moments with a MomToker. Hulu released the first look at season 2 on Thursday, March 20, where Stassi, 36, was seen reuniting with Lisa Vanderpump nearly five years after Stassi’s time on Vanderpump Rules. “Remember when I used to tell you don’t get involved in other people’s business?

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/reacher-recap-season-3-episode-7.html'>Reacher Recap: Western Exposure</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 14:00:29 <p>
Even though it was Duffy’s surveillance of West Coast drug kingpin Darien Prado that put her onto Quinn’s trail, thus leading to her entanglement with Reacher — who was separately pursuing Quinn after randomly catching sight of the man he thought he killed 13 years earlier on the street, sure, whatever — it’s Reacher who remembers all of this and suggests the pair of them go see Mr. Prado. While it remains irritating that no characters not named Reacher are allowed to be resourceful or even competent on Reacher — with the eternal exception of Neagley, whose spinoff series has already been announced, and the onetime exception of Kohl, who paid for her efficiency by being tortured to death back in 2012 — the show’s treatment of Susan Duffy is confounding. In the novel, she’s a step or two behind Reacher. On TV, she’s the least effective federal law enforcement officer since Robert Hanssen. This penultimate episode of the season underlines this by having Duffy bring Reacher along to look in on Teresa’s grandma before they head to Logan Airport. It turns out Duffy is on a first-name basis with the woman whose granddaughter she placed in mortal danger after Teresa had kicked the habit and cleaned up her life. But Nicky Guadagni gives a charming performance in this role, picking up on what she says is the palpable sexual tension between Reacher and Duffy. He’s also the most loose-tongued character we’ve met all season, immediately spilling his guts when all Neagley has done is threaten to shoot him. “There are only a few people left alive who know that name,” he says. So how the Wrigley Field fuck is Costopoulos still walking around Chicago, Ontario intact, going out in his bathrobe to collect his own newspaper in his own hometown, when he knows all about the guy Reacher has described as “the most evil man I’ve ever known?” Not addressed! If Quinn were a tenth as dangerous as we’re been repeatedly told he is, Costopoulos wouldn’t be alive to tell Neagley any of this. In a Los Angeles hotel room, Duffy is showing Reacher the surveillance video of Prado that turned out to be inadmissible because poor, dead Agent Eliot misread a map and shot the video from a place he wasn’t supposed to be. They still fuck, of course, because this is Reacher and Duffy packed a very nice bra. Each Reacher season has given our abnormally large vigilante hobo an statistically ordinary, human-size paramour. I’d like to see him coupled with a partner of commensurate tectonic stature in subsequent seasons. Because I made a whole thing out of Alan Ritchson’s mispronunciation of McLean, Virginia in episode four, and a far bigger thing about Sonya Cassidy’s war crime of a Boston accent all season, I should acknowledge that she pronounces Worcester, Massachusetts, properly in the scene in which she and Reacher accost Prado. Like Victor Maitland in Beverly Hills Cop all those decades ago, Prado is hiding his drug operation behind the front of an art gallery. Reacher and Duffy tell him they will claim in court Prado threatened his doctor to get it, which would constitute his third strike, earning him a life sentence. Al Capone went down for tax evasion, so whatever works. The button on this scene comes when a throng of DEA agents arrive to search Prado’s gallery. Duffy already told us, way back in episode one, that she was handling this investigation unofficially after that blown surveillance warrant got her ordered off the Prado case, but who remembers these things? Maybe all these other DEA agents are working off the books, too. Back in Maine, Beck meets up with who he thinks is Prado’s representative — Neagley — while Reacher, Duffy, and Villanueva observe. Zachary Beck is now sporting a bandage where his right ear used to be. Neagley reveals to Beck that she’s speaking for Reacher, not Prado, and tells him his only chance of surviving this ordeal is to find out where and when Quinn’s big gun deal is happening so Reacher can kill Quinn. The green-screen work behind Maria Sten and Anthony Michael Hall in this “quarry” scene is laughable, Weather Channel–grade. Beck tells Neagley the buyers are flying in from Yemen, but that’s all he knows. After letting not one but two spies infiltrate his house, he’s understandably been cut out of the loop. Now, at last, we see Teresa Daniel handcuffed to a pipe in some dingy basement. “I could’ve had you all to myself,” he tells her. “Use you up, then cut off all your pretty pieces. The actor’s name is Storm Steenson, and she doesn’t even get a line. Anthony Michael Hall’s best scene of the season comes when Zachary catches Richard trying to repair the broken toy revolver he bought his dad as a 50th birthday gift. He expected to be killed eventually, and he didn’t want his death to be as painful for Richard as the passing of his mother, years prior, already was. “No one gets training on how to be a dad unless you get it from your own dad,” Zachary says, “I didn’t.” Hall is so good in these few moments that I wonder if this scene was the reason he took what has often been a thankless part. Neagley, now fully integrated into the Reacher-Duffy-Villanueva camp, tails Quinn’s customers after they land at a private airfield that Villanueva tells us the Bushes use when they fly into Kennebunkport. Reacher objects on the grounds that the ATF, being a law enforcement outfit, will not allow him to execute Quinn — which he already tried to do once! ), then stashed in the trunk of Duffy’s car, I guess? He’s still hell-bent on killing Quinn, even after Duffy reminds him that this will mean spending the rest of his life on the run. Taking up a shooting position, Reacher calls Neagley to warn her to get rid of all evidence they’ve been in contact for the last week so she won’t be implicated in his murder of Quinn, who’s due any minute now. When Neagley tells Reacher he must be wrong because she’s still tailing the gun buyers, Reacher infers that the deal will be happening at Beck’s house and that he and the ATF have been lured into a trap. Only one episode remains, and Reacher still needs to settle up with Paulie!</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/the-wheel-of-time-recap-season-3-episode-4.html'>The Wheel of Time Recap: Cities in Dust</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 14:00:29 <p>
Historically, the show has always benefited from narrowing its focus. Though I haven’t read it, I’ve certainly gathered from speaking to fans that the repleteness of author Robert Jordan’s source material is its main attraction. But boy, is it nice when The Wheel of Time stops to … I was gonna say smell the roses, but not on this show. No, this show only stops to rub its characters’ faces in the thorns. After some initial business that further fleshes out Aiel society and culture, Rand al’Thor and Moiraine Sedai travel to Rhuidean, the Aiel people’s sacred “city in the clouds.” It’s actually a psychic crucible of sorts, a fog-enshrouded no-place where crystal columns rise up into the sky to guide the men who brave the empty city through their ancestral past, while three massive linked rings beckon female seekers to witness literally 1 million possible futures. Those who survive the ordeal exit as either clan leaders or Wise Ones, respectively. One day, the Aiel prophecy goes, a man will enter and exit not just with one magical dragon tattoo, the customary marking the city doles out to those who have weathered it, but two, one on each arm. You can guess how Rand’s arms look when he exits, I’ll bet. Moiraine’s journey is comparatively simple to explain. When she arrives at the rings, she finds Aviendha floating there; the spear-maiden has secretly been a Wise One in training all along, one who wished to shirk her duty but has now been forced to lay down her weapons and follow her destined path. Moiraine follows Aviendha’s footsteps and finds herself suspended in midair amid the rings, which is one of the most striking and memorable visuals this show has yet served up. While she hangs there, she’s forced to witness a thousand spins of the Wheel, showing her glimpses of her possible futures. Moiraine knows that none of these futures are set in stone, but this one, at least, seems more likely to come to pass than the others. Rand’s journey, by contrast, takes him backward through time. His father, who killed the king of Cairhien, who dared cut down a sacred tree to make his throne. But I had faith in creator/showrunner Rafe Lee Judkins because he earned it during the last go-round. It was with some surprise and delight that I saw his name pop up as the writer of this episode, specifically, because it feels like a small triumph. How do you cram literally millennia of backstory and a million iterations of prophecy into a show without killing its momentum dead? You pack these infodumps into episode-long physical ordeals. You make those ordeals as telegenic as possible, borrowing from science fiction and video games to create haunting mist-enshrouded images, like Moiraine and Aviendha floating in the rings, or like a potential rival to Rand clawing his own eyes out rather than face the past the glass columns have forced him to confront. There are many ways to skin this particular cat, mind you. Back in the heyday of Game of Thrones, creators David Benioff and Dan Weiss realized you could get away with some pretty dry dialogue regarding characters’ lineages or motivations if the characters involved were either naked themselves or watching naked people do naked things together. This approach was widely maligned at the time; the term sexposition was even coined as a derogatory marker of moments when backstories and backsides collided. Personally, I never understood the aversion to it. We’re watching an epic fantasy — there’s gonna be a gigantic history lesson delivered by somebody at some point, as surely as there will be sword and sorcery. Why not make those lessons more entertaining by delivering them while someone is getting their junk rubbed? So it is here with The Wheel of Time. This isn’t sexposition, obviously, even though Moiraine’s visions of the future are notably randy at times. But it follows the sexposition playbook, simply substituting surrealism for nudity.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A group led by William Chisholm and backed by private equity fund Sixth Street has reached an agreement to buy the Boston Celtics, according to multiple people familiar with the agreement, in what will be the most expensive NBA team sale in history. Irving and Wyc Grousbeck announced the deal Thursday morning in a letter to Celtics investors. The group also includes Rob Hale, a current Celtics investor, and Bruce A. Beal Jr., president of Related Companies. “We had tremendous interest from potential control owners and we’re grateful for the considerable time and effort bidders put in over the past few months, especially. The agreement concludes a sale that was closely tracked, both in the NBA and other U.S. leagues, as a barometer for sports valuations overall. The Celtics are among the NBA’s most successful and most popular franchises, but they are a tenant in their arena and own just a small piece of their local media partner. He is the co-founder, managing partner and chief investment officer of STG, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif. STG’s portfolio includes more than 50 active and closed investments, with about $10 billion of assets under management, as of March 2023. Sixth Street has more than $100 billion in assets under management. In addition to its Giants LP, its other sports holdings include Legends and NWSL club Bay FC, plus minority investments in the San Antonio Spurs, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. Sixth Street would join Arctos Partners and Blue Owl as PE firms with multiple NBA team investments. Arctos is invested in the Golden State Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers, Sacramento Kings and Utah Jazz, while Blue Owl holds stakes in the Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota Timberwolves and Kings. They announced that the franchise was for sale last July, less than two weeks after winning an NBA-record 18th championship. Sportico reported last week that four groups remained engaged in the process. They were Chisholm, Phillies owner Stan Middleman, the Friedkin Group, and existing investor Steve Pagliuca. Pagliuca was viewed by many throughout the process as a front-runner, and said his group was “saddened” by the outcome in a statement on social media. “We had no debt or private equity money that would potentially hamstring our ability to compete in the future. He added that if the Chisholm sale doesn’t go through, “my partners and I are ready to check back into the game and bring it home.” It has also been updated in the third paragraph to add additional clarity around Sixth Street’s investment.)</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” which has been deemed his most “commercial” project yet, reunites him with Warner Bros. Pictures film chiefs Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy, the executives who produced Anderson’s most recent film, his 2021 feature “Licorice Pizza.” De Luca also brought “Boogie Nights” to the screen during his New Line tenure. With “One Battle After Another,” auteur Anderson is working with both new and familiar faces, the biggest of whom is Leonardo DiCaprio, who is making his PTA debut with the comedy-thriller. It’s a “Licorice Pizza” reunion for Anderson with Alana Haim and Sean Penn; the cast also includes Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor, Shayna McHale, Wood Harris, and “Presumed Innocent” star Chase Infiniti, who plays DiCaprio’s onscreen daughter. However, it’s rumored that “One Battle After Another” is inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s 1997 novel “Vineland” about a “zone of blessed anarchy in Northern California that is the last refuge of hippiedom,” per the book’s synopsis. The full novel description reads: “Here, in an Orwellian 1984, Zoyd Wheeler and his daughter Prairie search for Prairie’s long-lost mother, a Sixties radical who ran off with a narc. ‘Vineland’ is vintage Pynchon, full of quasi-allegorical characters, elaborate unresolved subplots, corny songs (“Floozy with an Uzi”), movie spoofs (Pee-wee Herman in The Robert Musil Story), and illicit sex (including a macho variation on the infamous sportscar scene in V.).” The feature, which was shot on 35mm film using VistaVision cameras, is getting an IMAX release from Warner Bros. DiCaprio has a slew of other projects in the works, including various Martin Scorsese collaborations. “Home” is also in the works at Apple with Scorsese producing. “One Battle After Another” will be released in theaters on September 26 from Warner Bros.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

EVERETT, WA—In an effort to emulate the pleasurable sensation of contact with another person, single man Henry Goldfarb reportedly sat on his own hand before dialing 911 Thursday to make it feel like someone else cared. “If you use your imagination, it basically feels just as good as having somebody call emergency services for you,” said Goldfarb, lying back in the contented afterglow of the act while still envisioning a caring loved one’s hand placed on his shoulder. “You can get kind of stuck in the same rut of always tending to it yourself when you have a life-threatening medical event, so once in a while it’s nice to pretend that there’s someone else out there who has any concern for my well-being whatsoever.” At press time, reports confirmed a self-satisfied Goldfarb had lost consciousness while still covered in his own mess.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

WASHINGTON—Despite the risks to national security from revealing such confidential information, the Pew Research Center released a study Thursday proving that 93% of individuals with one earbud in are receiving top-secret commands from HQ. “Nearly every person you see in public wearing a single earbud is currently undertaking a clandestine mission on behalf of an undisclosed government agency,” the report read in part, going on to state that the increase in persons wearing one earbud was directly correlated to the decrease in access to phone booths where agents would have previously accepted their assignments. “The man on the bus bobbing his head to “music” is actually carrying out a covert hit via a directive from headquarters. Same with the woman at the grocery store engaging in a “phone call” with her “sister.” These operatives are highly skilled at blending in with the public while they wait for confirmation that Operation Sidewinder is a go.

While it looks like there may yet be some justice in the case of “Coyote Vs. Acme” — if it indeed finds a new home and a theatrical release with Ketchup Entertainment — fans of the “Looney Tunes” still find themselves at the mercy of far greater forces than Bugs Bunny behind an animator’s desk. Discovery pulled its catalog of the original “Looney Tunes” cartoons, a collection of animated shorts that stretch from 1930 to 1969, beginning on March 16 as part of a wider effort to rebrand the streaming platform as a place much more for adult and family content as opposed to children’s programming. Another is that this isn’t the first time Warner Brothers has decided to vanish “Looney Tunes” content. Back in the early 2000s, Warner Bros. pulled “Looney Tunes” off of Cartoon Network. Where previously the likes of Elmer Fudd and Foghorn Leghorn had shared programming space with Batman and Fred Flintstone, Warner Bros. left a void that they themselves then tried to fill with different “Looney Tunes” cartoons. That move really hurt the franchise,” animation historian and CalArts professor Jerry Beck told IndieWire. In August of 2024, Warner Bros. also put the kibosh on Genndy Tartakovsky’s R-rated, Looney Tunes-inspired 2D film “Fixed,” from New Line and Sony Pictures Animation (made by Renegade Animation and Lightstar Studios), about a dog that has 24 hours to have fun before getting neutered — that may be another rescue mission for Ketchup Entertainment if “Coyote Vs. Acme” goes well. Whatever the streaming performance numbers on Max, “Looney Tunes” has always been a very healthy IP and the top studio brass’s dismissal of Duffy and his chums hasn’t stopped non-stop licensing and merchandising of “Looney Tunes” characters. “You look at our competitors from across the street and they’re just cranking out shows left, right, and center with these characters — multiple shows with these beloved characters. Discovery seems much more comfortable placing their bets on Batman and DC Comics IP, with Hanna-Barbera stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo” filling the gaps, when it comes to animation. DC and “Batman,” in particular, also have the benefit of playing far more into the darker fantasy worlds that anchor HBO’s favorite live-action children, “Game of Thrones” and “Harry Potter.” Even if the “Looney Tunes” put their spin on more operas, there’s a lighthearted, clever playfulness that doesn’t quite fit the current grim-dark brand. “Looney Tunes” also fights against a tide that is currently running away from 2D animation. “The industry seems to have moved on — but 2D will exist and continue. There are always rumors that Pixar or Dreamworks have a 2D feature in development and my animation students at CalArts, Woodbury, and UCLA are chomping at the bit to join a hand-drawn project. Just some really renaissance artists worked on this, I believe.” A true revival will need the success of more than one feature film and some willingness on Warner Bros. Discovery’s part to reinvest in the inventive mayhem that “Looney Tunes” represents. “All the ‘Looney Tunes’ are available on a free broadcast channel that anyone can pick up: MeTV TOONS. And Warner Archive Collection has released numerous Blu-ray collections of the best of the best Looney Tunes (a new one, ‘Looney Tunes Collector’s Vault Collection,’ comes out in June).”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/adolescence-fails-girls-side-of-the-incel-conversation.html'>What About Katie?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 12:13:47 <p>
Spoilers follow for all four episodes of Adolescence, now streaming on Netflix. In the second episode of Adolescence — the new acclaimed Netflix limited series and runaway hit about a 13-year-old boy accused of murder — Detective Sergeant Misha Frank (Faye Marsay) tells one of her male colleagues what upsets her most about the case. “You know what I don’t like about all this?” Frank says. We’ve been following Jamie’s brain around this entire case. It’s an astute observation, and perhaps a self-critically meta one, given that the show in which Frank is saying these lines is devoted entirely to Jamie: what he did, why he did it, and who’s to blame. But focusing on the topic of teenage violence and misogyny from the perspective of one of its perpetrators doesn’t necessarily provide us with any new or special insights into young men’s online radicalization — and it threatens to further obscure the lived reality and humanity of those who suffer its real-world consequences in the process. I’d agree with them; it’s also the most revealing episode in terms of the show’s exploration of gender dynamics and male rage. A court-appointed psychologist named Briony Ariston (Erin Doherty) interviews Jamie for an independent pretrial report on his mental health; we’re made to understand they’ve met several times before. The pair kick things off with friendly banter before she encourages him to tell her about his relationships with his father and grandfather. This is the first of many times Jamie will fluctuate between a sometimes friendly, sometimes petulant child, and the aggressive, paranoid, resentful man he’s becoming. When Briony has convinced him to go along with her questions about how he feels about men and masculinity, Jamie is reticent at first. We all do.” We learn that his father, Eddie, played by series co-creator and co-writer Stephen Graham, is into sports and that he once tried the classic dad move of getting his son to follow in his footsteps. When Jamie tried playing football, he admits to Briony, Eddie would “cheer me on and everything, but when I’d fuck up —” Jamie pauses, the camera close on his face as it storms with sadness and mortification just beneath the surface. “He’d just look away … Maybe he didn’t want me to see him looking sorry … Or, I don’t know, ashamed.” When Briony asks him how he felt about that — seeing his dad’s shame — Jamie bristles again, wondering accusatorily why she hasn’t pushed back and assured him that must be all in his head; a father wouldn’t be ashamed of his child. That relationship is given much more attention than the few mostly feeble and surface-level attempts at explaining teens today, despite what the series’ title might suggest. It’s also the only time when we meet anyone who both knew and loved Katie. Jade gets angry at a line of questioning that she thinks is victim blaming — the cops ask her if Katie really couldn’t stand Jamie, why did they comment on each other’s Instagrams? We don’t see Jade speaking with any of her peers (were she and Katie total loners? ), though we do get to witness multiple teen boys feverishly discussing Jamie’s case and whether they think he really did it (yes). The second episode doesn’t give us anything specific or real about Katie. Instead, its purpose is for Bascombe to learn from his son, who attends the same school, that the police have been totally clueless about the emojis Katie used in her interactions with Jamie online, which are meant to imply he’s a loser virginal incel. More than probing the particularities of these teenagers’ lives and relationships in an era of virulent online misogyny, however, the shallow buzzword revelations just play up the show’s most prevalent theme of father-son tensions; Bascombe tells Frank their talk about emojis were the most words he’s exchanged with his teenager for quite a while. It’s Bascombe listening to a voice-mail from his son that opens the whole series. Graham told Netflix’s in-house magazine, Tudum, that he was inspired to create the show after seeing young boys accused of knife crimes on the news. I really just wanted to shine a light on it and ask, Why is this happening today? And it’s in the third episode when we get some answers. Jamie tells Briony that boys in school had been passing around topless photos of Katie, laughing at her for being so flat chested, and he thought that was the prime time to ask her out: when she was being made fun of, and therefore a “weak” target. He put on his best tracksuit and asked her to the fair. “I’m not that desperate,” she told him in response. He gets so worked up relaying this story that he makes what sounds like an accidental confession, then gets so mad at himself that he flies into another rage, throwing his chair across the room, which encourages Briony to prematurely abort the session and choke back tears once he’s out of sight. In her review for the New York Times, critic Margaret Lyons writes that she watched this episode multiple times, “and it can land in different ways. I’ve considered whether she’s the one who really holds all the cards — she elicits a confession, after all — or whether, as she jokes to Jamie at one point, he’s really the one in charge. Though perhaps that ambiguity is also the result of some wishy-washy writing. We learn that Jamie — who has commented crude things on models’ Instagrams and brags about his sexual exploits to Briony before denying he’s ever experienced those things at all — doesn’t consider himself popular, had been bullied at school, and that he had a motive to kill Katie because she was one of his tormentors (recall the incel comments). A guard drags Jamie from the interview after he asks Briony what she thinks of him, and he starts screaming when she won’t answer: “Do you like me? Do you like me?” He bangs on the windows, desperate. The show’s final episode — the one most heavily criticized for being “slow” and involving “too much irrelevant chitchat” — takes place over a year after the murder, when Jamie’s family is trying to return to normal while he’s awaiting trial. It’s all about Eddie — the whole series, despite the third episode without him, has really been all about Eddie and his struggle to accept the truth of what his son did — who frets that even though he didn’t hit his children, the way his father had hit him, maybe he didn’t do enough to prevent violence from manifesting in his own son. This isn’t a story about adolescence today: it’s one of inherited rage, shame, and misogyny. What starts out as a much more intriguing premise — a teenage victim of revenge porn turns the tables, becoming the bully of her own bullies — is left unexplored. In the finale, we learn that when Eddie was an adolescent, he once dressed up in a pink wig (“Your dad never cared when people were laughing at him,” his wife tells their daughter), implying he was once the kind of guy who was confident enough to sidestep masculinity’s rules. While getting more time with Eddie, I kept thinking back to Katie and Jade, their untold stories. “We wanted you to look at this family and think, My God. “And what’s happening here is an ordinary family’s worst nightmare.” With his impressively weepy performance (less so his co-written script), Graham captures that nightmare well. Though one also has to wonder: Wasn’t it Katie’s friends and family, and Katie herself, who experienced the worst nightmare of all?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/kelly-clarkson-back-on-show-what-happened.html'>Kelly Clarkson Made It Back for Her Show’s 1,000th Episode</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 11:20:58 <p>
Just The Show, I guess — with a revolving door of guest hosts who had been stepping in during Clarkson’s unexplained absence for the last few weeks. Beginning March 3, when Simu Liu subbed at the last minute, celebrities like Brooke Shields and Kal Penn have been filling her seat. But thank God she was back again for the episode we were in the studio audience for, which aired March 20, just in time to celebrate the show’s landmark 1,000th episode. At the taping of the milestone episode at her Rockefeller Center studio (which the show moved to from Los Angeles in 2023), Clarkson was her usual chatty self and admittedly over-caffeinated — which would have given any court stenographer a run for their money. In addition to Perry, who was there to promote his new film, Duplicity, her guests included Alicia Vikander (who brought Swedish candy Clarkson hated and spit out) and the Venezuelan pop duo Mau y Ricky (who gifted her alcohol, which was much more well received). The candy might have flopped, but the teaser for Vikander’s new movie, The Assessment, definitely won Clarkson over, in which Vikander acted out like a child to assess whether a couple would be good parents. While “Since U Been Gone” would have been an apt Kellyoke for her grand return, the episode featured a prerecorded, stripped-down cover of Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing” — probably because they were worried about how I would react to seeing a Kellyoke live in person. But an iconic performance was still delivered for the show’s studio audience, when Clarkson had to reshoot a pickup of one of her questions after the interviews. The montage included Remy’s iconic performance of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” from earlier this year, proof that Kellyoking is a genetic condition. And while musicians everywhere may have been resting easy these past few weeks knowing that Clarkson wouldn’t be Kellyoking their songs (Kellyoke is a verb), the queen of covers is back in Studio 6A and no song is safe.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/one-battle-after-another-trailer-release-date-cast.html'>One Battle After Another Begins Its Fight</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 11:16:30 <p>
Narrator enters stage right, sits down on a dimly lit wooden chair, and dabs forehead sweat with rag. NARRATOR: These days, it’s just One Battle After Another. The upcoming Paul Thomas Anderson movie is one of the most anticipated films of the year, seemingly destined to be iconic even if it flops. It has a great cast and a respected auteur, and it was very, very expensive. Below is everything we know about the upcoming movie. In the first teaser trailer, out March 20, star Leonardo DiCaprio pensively sips a beer, intercut with shots of a machine-gun-shooting pregnant woman, a baby, and an unforgiving desert. “What are you gonna do about this baby?” a voice asks. DiCaprio is the main draw, obviously, but don’t let his presence overshadow how stacked the rest of this cast is. Teyana Taylor (A Thousand and One), Regina Hall (Support the Girls), two-time Oscar winner Sean Penn (Milk), PTA fave Alana Haim (Licorice Pizza), and Benicio del Toro (Traffic) all star. The movie is reportedly based on Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland, which tracks, given that PTA previously adapted Pynchon’s Inherent Vice. Vineland is very much a book about the ’80s — set in 1984, a.k.a. Reagan’s America, it follows a hippie named Zoyd as he flashes back to the “free love” ’60s to explain how we arrived at the conservative era. One Battle After Another, meanwhile, is contemporary, so it’s hard to say how many liberties Anderson has taken with the source material in updating it. That’s not particularly notable for a blockbuster, but PTA isn’t known for creating blockbusters. His most successful movie at the box office was There Will Be Blood, which pulled in $76 million. His previous film, Licorice Pizza, cost just $40 million — that’s 100 million fewer dollars than his current project. One Battle After Another was originally scheduled to come out August 8, but on March 20, Warner Bros. pushed the release to September 16. That would be a battle for the ages.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

After Searchlight Pictures dumped the Jonathan Majors bodybuilding drama, only one studio dared touch it. “I certainly do not shy away from controversy,” says CEO Tom Ortenberg. Searchlight Pictures ultimately walked off with domestic-distribution rights to Magazine Dreams for a reported $10 million. After winning Sundance’s U.S. Special Dramatic Jury Award, the film seemed bound for awards glory. Then Majors was arrested on domestic-violence charges — including choking his then-girlfriend, Grace Jabbari, in March of that year — dropped by his management team, fired by Marvel (as the chief supervillain of its Phase 5 Avengers franchise), and convicted of assault and harassment. (Jabbari also sued Majors for defamation; the suit was settled.) In October, up-and-coming indie distributor Briarcliff Entertainment snapped up distribution rights to Magazine Dreams for an undisclosed sum. Now, the Los Angeles–based production-distribution company that was formed in 2018 specifically to release the hot-button Michael Moore documentary Fahrenheit 11/9 — and increasingly specializes in putting out films considered “distressed assets” — is finally giving Magazine Dreams a wide theatrical release on March 21. Photo: Briarcliff Entertainment/Everett Collection After Magazine Dreams star Jonathan Majors was convicted of assault and harassment, Searchlight Pictures quietly returned the rights to the filmmakers. Even within Hollywood, Briarcliff is still somewhat of a little-known media entity. But since August, when it acquired the controversial Donald Trump biopic The Apprentice — another movie no other studio would touch that yielded an October release garnering a Best Actor Oscar nomination for Sebastian Stan and a Best Supporting Actor nod for co-star Jeremy Strong — Briarcliff has become known as a studio of last resort for hard-to-market, contentious yet compelling titles. In an increasingly compartmentalized media landscape when the entertainment industry has never been more risk-averse, when theatrical distribution has never been more iffy and the economics of independent film are in turmoil, Briarcliff is making a name for itself by championing difficult projects where other, more deeply funded and longer-established movie purveyors fear to tread. “I’m very grateful for Briarcliff taking a chance on this film, and I appreciate their willingness to support all kinds of films and filmmakers. Briarcliff is the brainchild of Tom Ortenberg, a visionary executive with decades of experience navigating culture wars, juggling Hollywood hot potatoes, and turning profits from titles mired in conflict. As president of theatrical films at Lionsgate in 1999, he cut a deal to put out Kevin Smith’s Dogma after Disney stifled the fallen-angel comedy’s release (it had come under fire at Disney subsidiary Miramax for spoofing tenets of Christianity) going so far as to debate a senior official at the Catholic League on the movie’s merits. Then, as co-founder and chief executive of Open Road Films (the now-shuttered production and distribution venture backed by AMC and Regal Theatres), Ortenberg co-financed production of the $20 million Todd McCarthy–directed journalism drama Spotlight — plotted around a Boston Globe investigation of child sex abuse by Catholic clergy — and oversaw its platform release en route to a 2016 Best Picture Academy Award. In May, the biographical drama (which follows the young Donald Trump’s professional and political coming-of-age mentored by ruthless legal fixer Roy Cohn) received a ten-plus-minute standing ovation at its Cannes Film Festival premiere, also drawing “audible gasps” for a scene in which Stan as Trump throws his first wife, Ivana, to the ground and rapes her. Briarcliff CEO Tom Ortenberg says he considers Jonathan Majors “a friend.” Photo: Daniel Zuchnik/Variety via Getty Images The film’s producers spent the summer of 2024 untying a sticky legal predicament (buying out an ownership stake by Kinematics, a production company bankrolled by billionaire Trump supporter Dan Snyder). Then, with virtually no domestic competition, Briarcliff appeared like a savior out of the mist to buy The Apprentice just days before awards season kicked off. “But we’re extremely happy with Tom Ortenberg of Briarcliff. Tom’s experience is exactly right for this movie.” (While The Apprentice has only earned $4 million at the North American box office and Briarcliff has yet to negotiate a deal for its streaming-video on-demand rights, Ortenberg says: “I can tell you with confidence we did not lose money on the deal.”) Haggis’s 2004 ensemble drama, Crash, explores incendiary racial and social fault lines baked into turn–of–the–millennium Los Angeles — a setting notably absent of clear heroes and villains that intentionally backs off moral absolutes. Or is he the loving son trying to get his dad basic health care?” The executive says he applied that rationale to Magazine Dreams when a source attached to the film approached him last summer about acquiring its distribution rights. Moreover, at a cultural pivot point when a growing number of performers canceled by Me Too and sexual misbehavior allegations — Aziz Ansari, James Franco, Louis C.K., and Kevin Spacey among them — are returning to work onstage or in front of the camera, Majors is hardly alone in attempting to bounce back from career oblivion. “I’m certainly not condoning any inappropriate behavior by anybody, but does a misdemeanor conviction mean that somebody doesn’t get to work again?” Ortenberg asks. Indisputably, there will be an odd, meta-narrative spectacle attached to watching an acclaimed, Yale-educated Serious Thespian transform himself into a brutal, homicidal Mr. Universe wannabe almost two years to the day since Majors’s assault arrest. Just days before Rolling Stone published an article featuring an audio recording in which Majors seems to acknowledge strangling his girlfriend, I ask Ortenberg how Briarcliff intends to overcome toxic discourse surrounding the star — or if the company’s goal is now to galvanize curiosity surrounding Majors’s comeback to get people into theaters? “For those who want to point out art imitating life, or the film being a little on the nose as it relates to real life, so be it. But we’re not focusing on the controversy at all,” says Ortenberg. I think most of the American moviegoing public has moved on.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/noah-wyle-the-pitt-er-interview.html'>If the Scrubs Fit</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 08:00:51 <p>
“I got kind of at peace with not feeling like I was doing work that was in the Zeitgeist.” Photo: Marco Giannavola His character, Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch, has been plagued with knee-buckling COVID flashbacks, forced to fire a trusted colleague, watched numerous children die, and continues to butt heads with a hospital administrator obsessed with patient-satisfaction scores. In the episode “6:00 P.M.,” everything gets worse in a typically American way: There’s an active shooter at a nearby music festival, and the ER Robby oversees is bombarded. Robby, who previously strode from patient to trainee with unassailable empathy and decisiveness, looks lost. His face, so often calm and ready, crumples into despair. “What you’re seeing is the water level in his eyes. I’m the only one that knows we take this train over a cliff.” There are always medical procedurals on TV; each of the big four networks currently has at least one. The Pitt has the hallmarks of an old-school television hit: It follows a weekly release model instead of streaming’s more customary binge. It features a star from the second-longest-running prime-time medical drama of all time. The show’s unabashed story lines — about abortion, and access to health care for trans people, and racial bias among medical professionals — run counter to the real world’s trend toward DEI abandonment. Wyle and I are sitting in the Players Club, the private actors’ society in New York City that he’s been a member of since he skyrocketed to fame as Dr. John Carter on ER. Wyle has been transfixed with the Booths since his teens, back when he was acting in plays with his family or at school, and decades on, he feels at home among their possessions. He points to the legendary skull of the horse thief Fontaine, which Edwin used to perform Hamlet and is now sealed off behind a velvet rope. He and his friend Steven Weber, another prime-time leading man from the ’90s who is currently appearing on successful medical procedural Chicago Med, would “fuck around” with the skull, Wyle says, letting out a raspy laugh that bursts forth whenever he’s making fun of himself. We’re chatting six days after The Pitt wrapped in early February. He is used to these long-term gigs; he dedicated four years to the TNT series The Librarians and Falling Skies, respectively, and 15 years to ER, playing a privileged kid who starts out as a fumbling medical student, grows into a politically engaged resident, and ends the series as a stoic attending physician. ER attracted nearly 35 million weekly viewers, but most of the original actors, like George Clooney, left the show after a few seasons. ER was the monoculture, generating breathless attention over its characters’ romantic entanglements, as well as countless magazine covers, beginning with an October 1994 Newsweek that declared ER “A Health-Care Program That Really Works.” During the series’ run, he had to turn down movie roles in Saving Private Ryan and Clooney’s Good Night, and Good Luck. What came after was a string of “almost Jimmy Stewart characters” on basic cable. Wyle’s sweet spot is playing normal guys who radiate knowledge and a touch of mischief — the types who could lead you into war or make a college lecture interesting. “We were all sewing each other up.”) “He’s extremely intelligent, and that intelligence comes off,” Wells says. It’s an ability to listen, and a stillness that he brings as an actor, which is a skill that goes unnoticed sometimes.” Falling Skies and The Librarians had a fraction of ER’s viewership, but they made good use of Wyle’s level gaze and pitched-down tone, and attracted their own niche sci-fi/fantasy audiences — the kinds who show up to comic-cons and buy tie-in novels. “I got kind of at peace with not feeling like I was doing work that was in the Zeitgeist,” Wyle says. Then in March 2020, as COVID was decimating the country’s medical infrastructure and shuttering Hollywood, Wyle started receiving dozens of Instagram DMs from first responders who knew him from ER. Some messages were “confessional” about the difficulty of the work, some were complaints about how inadequate that era’s pot-banging appreciation felt. Many were a “Hey, Carter, we could use you out here” appeal. The first idea was a project affiliated with ER and Dr. Carter, which fell apart in April 2023. Wyle can’t share many details about this because he, Wells, and Warner Bros. are being sued by the estate of author and ER creator Michael Crichton, which has claimed that The Pitt is an unauthorized reboot of ER. Wyle insists The Pitt is an entirely separate endeavor. “I just wanted to put this spotlight back on these first responders. I wanted to put the attention back on this community that needed it,” Wyle says. “And Wells goes, ‘We could still do that.’” They set out to make something “radically different” from ER, with a “radically different guy, and have everything be able to live on its own.” The Pitt is set in Pittsburgh, not Chicago, and the season unfolds in real time, with overlapping crises ratcheting up tension as the cast careens around the sterile white set. Carter and Robby are indeed both medical professionals and educators, but in temperament, attending physician Robby has a grizzled, earthy, seen-some-shit air that distinguishes him from the desperate-to-prove-himself, low-key womanizer Carter. (Plus, Robby occasionally wears a little pair of glasses that accentuates a menagerie of serious and comical reaction faces; Wyle reassures us they’ll get more play in season two, “because my eyes are getting worse and worse.”) Wyle says he’s still surprised to have been cast as the lead when The Pitt shed its connections to ER. “I think of Max and HBO as sort of a big league that I haven’t been playing in for a while. “Over the last five years, pretty much everything in streaming has had a movie star who’s agreed to be in the show,” Wells says. It was a role he performed behind the scenes, too, as an executive producer and writer. “It lends itself perfectly for this character in terms of someone who’s been through so much and is still trying to keep doing it and pass it on to the younger people.” When The Pitt’s casting calls went out, Wyle attached a letter to each character breakdown, referencing director and screenwriter Robert Altman’s approach to ensemble pieces like M*A*S*H and Nashville. Unlike ER, whose cast talked openly in interviews about stealing scenes out from under one another and intimidating guest stars, The Pitt would be an even playing field for everyone. “Sometimes, there’s games with people trying to steer a scene in their direction. It was just like throwing the ball back and forth. “It wasn’t like we sat around in the room going, ‘What would really rile up America?’” Wyle says. Instead, his “agenda” is “to call into question some of the misinformation that’s out there, that wants to call a medical fact an opinion.” Photo: Warrick Page/Max “That was the most difficulty I had in terms of juggling my responsibilities outside of work, because it was almost just like, What’s the point? I need to stay in it all the time.” In 2012, Wyle was arrested at a Capitol Hill protest against Medicaid cuts, and he appeared in a 2016 PSA urging the Electoral College to remove Donald Trump from the ballot. “It wasn’t like we sat around in the room going, ‘What would really rile up America?’” he says. Instead, his “agenda” is “to call into question some of the misinformation that’s out there, that wants to call a medical fact an opinion.” Wyle himself wrote two episodes this season, including “3:00 P.M.,” in which two moms get in a fistfight about mask use. That, Wyle confesses, was meant to be a statement. Talk to Wyle long enough and an Old Hollywood, liberal-coded traditionalism comes out, especially in his beliefs that storytelling is an empathy generator and the people doing it should earn a living wage. He’s on a streaming series now, but he’s doubtful of any business model that ceaselessly prioritizes “unlimited growth.” “Our dads built something that was really great, and then we all looked at it and thought, Let’s break it and do something better,” Wyle says. This whole thing feels very cyclical.” He wants to keep bringing work like The Pitt to Los Angeles, the city where three generations of his family (including his mother, a former orthopedic head nurse) have lived and which he recently saw destroyed by devastating wildfires. “I’ve been through a lot of shit in that city. I’ve never seen anything like that,” he says. Maybe Wyle will eventually go out for movie roles again, or develop his own show, or produce other projects that inspire him as much as The Pitt. It’s difficult for him to think ahead, though, “when I have the career that I want right now.” Plus, he’s already come to terms with the idea that mainstream success at the level of ER might never come his way again.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/buena-vista-social-club-broadway-marco-ramirez-theater-review.html'>The Buena Vista Social Club Gets Bigger and Smaller on Broadway</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 02:00:45 <p>
And if the songs are already hits, and the dancers are already fantastic, but you’re not quite achieving liftoff? Well, there’s always one place to look. That’s what I have to assume happened in production meetings for Buena Vista Social Club somewhere between its Off Broadway run in 2023 and its arrival at the Schoenfeld Theatre this spring. Back when my colleague Sara Holdren reviewed the musical, very loosely based on the true-life stories of the sensational Cuban supergroup, she noted that “the play side of Buena Vista feels like it’s been carefully assembled by committee.” It had a convoluted, rushed, and generically inspirational narrative about how these players met, weathered the revolution, and returned to each other. Instead, they’ve just hacked through Buena Vista’s Gordian knot. The remarkable thing is how much that approach works. The Broadway Buena Vista clocks in a little shorter than its Off Broadway iteration — now, it’s just two hours with intermission — and breezes through its set-up with quick dashes of exposition. Juan de Marcos (Justin Cunningham) is a young record producer enamored with classic Cuban songs who’s come up with a plan to record “a love letter to Golden Age Cuban music,” but first he needs to convince the diva Omara Portuondo (Natalie Venetia Belcon, exuding confidence in a series of power shawls by Dede Ayite) to come to the studio. Juan’s already recruited the eager old hand Compay (Julio Monge, wry and foxy, able to land even the hoariest jokes) among a company of younger musicians, but as Compay tells Omara when she gets in the studio, “These old songs … they kick up old feelings.” Soon it flashes back to a younger Omara (Isa Antonetti) and her officious sister (Ashley De La Rosa) preparing for their performances at the Tropicana before the revolution and hiring a younger Compay (Da’Von T. Moody) and his pianist compatriot Rubén (Leonardo Reyna) as their accompanists. The two boys lure Omara off to their rowdier club on the bad side of town; she meets a busboy with a voice of gold named Ibrahim (Mel Semé). I remember the Off Broadway plot contorting itself into a few more curlicues — there was one confusing side plot about that club being a hub for weapon-smuggling, and a lot more of the characters talking around the politics of the revolution while saying little. Here, Ramirez’s script is more skeletal: It tends to hit the clichés then segue into music as quickly as possible. After the young Omara and Ibrahim fall for each other and then are separated by circumstance, have no fear that she will eventually find an older Ibrahim (Jainardo Batista Sterling, movingly poised) and the two will sing together again. First, there is the music: Those standards from the original album, a grab bag of genres and styles from a Cuba several decades ago, no surprise, still kill. At the Schoenfeld, everything has more space to luxuriate. With its book whittled down so much and its careful hedging to only speaking the broadest generalities about Cuba’s history, Buena Vista Social Club only aims modestly high, just above the level of a tribute concert. It’s a reminder, primarily, of how wonderful those songs are, to stream that album once you’re in the subway, and maybe inspire you to do a little research back home on their histories. There’s a richness and thorniness even in very abridged versions of those stories that hasn’t made it to the stage. That’s good material, if anyone wants to really wrestle with it. Buena Vista Social Club is at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/summer-house-recap-season-9-episode-6.html'>Summer House Recap: Pirate’s Booty</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 02:00:45 <p>
All season, I’ve been joking that Jesse Solomon (always both names!) But in this episode, it seems like they’re on a whole different level. It starts in the first opening moments when Jesse pulls up to pick up West and gets a kiss on the cheek. At the gym, West straddles Jesse to “spot” him, joking about how he “can’t get it up.” Oh, and when they return from the bar all drunken, Jesse pushes their beds together and West jokes that the weekend is about him and Jesse “renewing our vows and seeing what transpires.” Oh, I can see what transpires, and there is not a single eggplant emoji on my keyboard, so I can’t really type it out. Are they doing this just so I’m nice to them in the weekly recaps? It seems that Jesse is the reason they have bad boundaries. Just look at what is up with him and Ciara. Jesse flirts with her like he flirts with most of the other women in the house — did you see him put Gabby’s full head into his shirt? Before the big pirate party, Jesse is on a pool float with Ciara, and she puts her leg on his, and he jokes about how “this is kind of turning me on.” He then rolls over and goes into full body-on-body contact with her. This might have been a gag because he just got out of the pool and was getting her all wet, but this seems like my favorite Jim J Bullock sitcom, Too Close for Comfort. There are two reasons Jesse shouldn’t be doing this. One is that West confided in him that he’s still not making much headway with Ciara being nice to him in the house. West says, in confessional, that his phone is “always juicy,” but he’s prioritizing his relationship with Ciara in the house this summer, which is a very sweet sentiment. I applaud Jesse for trying to mend the relationship between his two friends, but the full-fire house of flirting might not be the right move, especially based on what Ciara says in her confessional: “Me and Jesse definitely flirt, but I don’t have any intentions behind it. When Jesse flirts with Amanda or “gasses her up” on Instagram, it’s cute harmless fun. That’s not only awkward between him and West but also between him and Lexi, who is also in the house all summer. Speaking of awkward all around, let’s talk about Carl, who is throwing perhaps the best, most on-theme party that Summer House has ever thrown. I thought it was all going to look cheesy, but like Imrul’s shirt the moment he gets in the club, Carl really pulled it off. As for how it’s going to go with Lil, the woman he invited to the party and has been chatting with, it’s unclear. They somehow introduced them on social media, and she slid into the DMs. Okay, I’m sorry, but if my parents said to me, “We met a guy who is really great. He was sitting alone at a soccer game,” I would tell them to put that troll back in his box and return him to his bridge. Carl seems to be doing okay with Lil at the party, though. But it’s when Jesse comes in that things really heat up. Carl says he wants to go on a date with her before doing hot yoga together. Consider this a date and go do hot yoga in the morning, my man. Also super awkward is whatever is happening with Kyle and Craig, who are still beefing over Craig and his alcohol investment that may or may not have happened. He says he texted Craig before the weekend to see if they could squash the beef, and Craig texted him back, but they didn’t talk. Kyle was right to get it out of the way, especially on Friday night after the rather tame (and by tame, I mean sober) birthday party they threw for Amanda. Craig insists that they talk the next day because he isn’t ready for it, and Kyle has to go into the backyard to wander around and mumble, which is apparently the only way he can deal with his anger other than getting totally wasted. At least Kyle has his priorities straight now that he’s calmed down about Craig. He says that he wants to try to preserve their friendship, mostly so that things between Paige and Amanda can stay copacetic. He says that Kyle doesn’t even deserve a talk, so if he is going to talk, then it’s on his terms. I’m sorry, but no matter what Craig thinks about the merits of this feud, Kyle deserves a talk, if only because Paige and Amanda are besties. While Craig may not be ready to forgive Kyle, he needs to preserve the peace in the house and one of his girlfriend’s close friendships. Both ladies agree that Kyle and Craig are the sorts of dudes who need to be right, but not only that, they need the other person to relent to their rightness before they can move on. That’s why this talk is going to go horribly, and I, for one, can’t wait to watch it all go wrong in the next episode. Paige also doesn’t tee Craig up to have a productive conversation because the episode ends with the two of them sitting in an inflatable raft talking about their relationship. It’s a continuation of the conversation from last week, which left a bad taste in Paige’s mouth that wasn’t from the kangaroo kebabs. Yes, to continue a partnership, they’re going to have to make room for each other among their busy schedules, but if Craig is more worried about how he might feel about her success, then he isn’t really supporting her in that success, and it makes absolute sense why they would break up over this issue. As they were not rowing a raft across the party, Jesse told West they needed to go into the kitchen and try to find a bottle opener. West dug through the drawers, rattling around random cutlery, spatulas, slotted spoons, and a random juicer as Jesse, in his Captain Jason from Below Deck Down Under costume, looked on with a smile. “I didn’t ask you in here for a bottle opener,” Jesse said, standing right next to West. West, a little nervous, let out one of his signature giggles. They were in a tunnel of their own longing, the energy sluicing back and forth between them, as Jesse put his index finger under West’s chin, slowly propping it up so that Jesse could put his lips right on West’s. The kiss lasted a little bit longer than it should have. Jesse put all his weight on West, leaning both of them against the counter, and a certain stiffening happened in both of their pants. Finally, Jesse broke it, and his eyes went back to West’s.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/survivor-recap-season-48-episode-4.html'>Survivor Recap: Three’s a Crowd</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 01:30:51 <p>
No, wait, it’s the final four fire-making challenge. I think this episode proves that having three small tribes is an absolute failure because, so often, one of those tribes is decimated, and it screws up the game entirely. Jeff says he likes the small tribes because there is nowhere to hide. I’m telling you where they can hide: a winning tribe! After this week’s elimination, there are 14 players remaining in the game, and only seven of them have been to tribal council. Is this how we do it on Survivor, Jeff? After tonight’s episode, you can go to Jeff’s overly complicated URL and vote on what will happen in Survivor 50, including whether or not there should be a tribe swap. Even this vote is a little bit bullshitt-y because it’s not just a question about if the tribes are swapped but how. As I always say, nothing on this show should be left up to luck. I would also contend that swapping up three full tribes this early in the game when we haven’t really gotten to know two of the tribes, because they haven’t been to tribal council, actually makes it a worse viewing experience. Now, we need to learn where everyone is now, where they were before, who they talked to before, and who they talk to now, and keep that all straight for three tribes. For the casual viewer, that’s far too much. (Actually, you know it’s green because they’re the ones that keep losing.) That way, viewers still know mostly who is on Cika and who is on Lavo, and they won’t get too confused. (Actually, it’s Civa and Lagi, but you didn’t even notice the difference because you still haven’t learned the tribes.) By subtracting one number from each tribe and adding them to a new tribe, it will allow all new dynamics and relationships to flourish with the least amount of intervention. Or better yet, whoever wins picks the person from their tribe (which could also be themselves!) There’s another method that I think Survivor needs to explore more, and that is taking some of the social-experiment dynamics from shows like Squid Game: The Challenge and Beast Games, things that will be familiar to the younger YouTube-addicted fans who also watch Survivor. This show was the true pioneer of reality television, but without pushing some boundaries and going into some new experimental directions, it’s in danger of looking tame and boring in comparison. If you don’t do it in 15 minutes, we’re eliminating two people.” This would be a real twist because not even these superfans on the cast would see it coming. It’s totally new and would require them to think about the game in a way without precedent. What has always made this show interesting, from when Richard Hatch invented the idea of alliances, is the interpersonal dynamics at play. We’ve seen from both the aforementioned shows that letting the players select their own destiny under pressure is a lot more heart-wrenching and surprising than just letting good old Lady Luck decide what is going to happen. Okay, enough free ideas from me for this recap. Why would we need to know and remember all of this unless it’s coming up at tribal? Rather than bore you with the details of the challenge, which we already know how it’s going to end, let’s have a little update on David and his girlfriend, who we learned last episode told him she was going to dump him if he didn’t win $1 million so she can be the stay-at-home mom of four. When talking to his new tribe, he says she dumped him over money issues. She wants a rich man who is going to give her the kind of life you can’t give her right now, which means she doesn’t love you. She loves an ideal of a certain kind of life, and she’ll take it from anyone (with at least six visible abdominal muscles). David says if he wins the big prize, then the first thing he’s going to do is ask her about her ring size. (This suddenly feels way more like one of my Real Housewives recaps than it does Survivor.) As much as I hated the tribe change-up, the episode was saved by Kyle and Kamilla’s fantastic performance post-merge at Vulu. They’re all slumming it in a shitty camp with no flint — punishing the new tribe members for losses made by people who are no longer on the tribe — and Kyle and Kamilla make the smart decision to pretend like they’re not that close or working together. Kamilla tells the California Girls — Thomas, Shauhin, and Joe — that she wants Kyle out, and Kyle tells them he wants Kamilla out. The best part, honestly, was Kamilla saying she was at the bottom of her tribe and they were going to vote her out. She quickly establishes so much trust in these guys that Shauhin searches Kyle’s bag right in front of her, essentially telegraphing to her how they’re going to lay their votes at that night’s tribal council. Shauhin didn’t find the idol (it was in Kyle’s shoe, not his bag), and the CGs made no contingency plans, mostly because Thomas didn’t tell him about his extra vote. I’m always banging on about not telling people they have advantages, but this was the time for Thomas to speak up. Even though they didn’t find an idol, they could have done two on Kyle and two on Kamilla, and even if Kyle played his idol and they both voted for Thomas, it would have been a tie, and the remaining players could have sent Kamilla home. Instead, they loaded up on Kyle, who played his idol, and Kyle and Kamilla voted out Thomas, my middle-aged, mustachioed, slightly bitchy (complimentary) doppelgänger. However, there are two reasons why the California Girls didn’t switch up their strategy. So, while I will definitely be voting that there is no tribe swap, I’d much rather be voting to go back to the old days with two bigger tribes where really interesting dynamics were allowed to flourish.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

An 18-year-old spring breaker landed himself in the slammer after allegedly biting off another young man's ear during a St. Patty's Day brawl that went down on Fort Myers Beach in Florida. A police report obtained by TMZ paints the horrific scene ... video reportedly shows the victim -- identified as Juwan Black -- lying face-down in the sand as Turner mounts his back. Police say Turner then yanks Black's head upward as he goes in for the bite ... leaving the victim's left ear with "traumatic auricular amputation." A witness told police she was walking down the beach with Black when Turner began slinging racial slurs at him ... eventually striking him from behind. Black stood up for himself by getting into a fighting stance ... which is when, the eyewitness told police, the physical altercation ensued. Black was treated for his injuries at Gulf Coast Hospital. Turner was released from jail after fulfilling a $50,000 surety bond. He is due to appear in court on April 21. We're told Black and Turner previously knew each other. LCSO tells TMZ ...

So, after a recent Lakers win, in the locker room, I was called over to say hello ahead of our discussion the following day. I saw the same smile I recalled from when he was just a boy, dribbling circles around his friends on the court after a Cavs win. I witnessed the same politeness from when Bronny was a freshman at the University of Southern California, recovering from a major health scare, and he stopped in the Lakers press room during a game and spoke in conversation with “yes, sir” and “no, sir.” “I definitely think I’ve improved, not only as a player, but just having a different mindset as a player to go out and play my game and play the game that I know how to play,” he said. It’s not just Bronny, or me, for that matter, who thinks so. As of this writing, Bronny appeared in 20 NBA games for the Lakers, averaging 1.7 points and shooting just 26 percent from the field in about five minutes per game. In a recent, close loss to the Denver Nuggets, the Lakers were without several of their rotation players, including Bronny’s dad and new Lakers superstar Luka Dončić. Coach JJ Redick turned to Bronny for 16 game minutes, and though he made just one of the five shots he took, his bucket was a crucial 3-pointer in a pressure situation. He also got to the foul line and turned in a steal. “It’s great that JJ had the level of trust to throw him into a big game the other night at Denver, which is a tough place to play, and he got in the game, made a couple defensive plays, made a corner 3, and I think that’s what he prides himself in is the 3-and-D type of archetype,” Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka said. Redick added that Bronny “has been fantastic in practices” lately, his confidence and aggression have grown, and his “biggest area of improvement is probably his playmaking, and I don’t just mean that in terms of passing, but just his ability to play on and off the ball as a decision-maker — either a scorer or a passer.” So that’s what the big-league Lakers think of their second-round draft pick, taken 55th overall in June. They see an improved, young player deep on their bench, which is where he should be at this point in his career. Any outside suggestion or expectation that Bronny, who missed half of his lone college season recovering from cardiac arrest suffered during a summer practice caused by a congenital heart defect, would do more for the Lakers than what he’s done this season was off base. In 16 games for the South Bay Lakers, Bronny is averaging 17.4 points on 31 percent shooting from 3-point range, with 4.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists in 30 minutes per game. “I just think it’s a confidence thing,” Bronny said of his transformation. After the Lakers drafted Bronny, they signed him to a four-year, fully guaranteed contract. It was unusual for a player of Bronny’s relative inexperience, and the statistics he turned in during his one partial season in college, to get that kind of contract and security. The Lakers franchise, Bronny and his advisers decided he should play road games for South Bay — maybe not all of them, but when they made sense. Bronny’s first road game for South Bay was on Dec. 12, against the Phoenix Suns’ affiliate, and he enjoyed his first 30-point game as a pro — more notable because his first three games in the G League hadn’t gone that well (six points on 2-of-9 shooting in his debut; four points in the second game; 16 points but 6-of-15 shooting in the third). He was again inconsistent in the three G League games that followed, and he had a trip planned with South Bay for just after Christmas to go to Cleveland, where his grandparents still live and where he spent some of his formative years, for two games. Bronny scored 38 points total in those two Cleveland games and has been even stronger since. This was not the case for Bronny during his Lakers’ summer-league session (averages of seven points on 33 percent shooting in six games) or the NBA preseason (4.2 points and 8.3 percent shooting from 3-point in six games). “I saw consistency coming (before that Cleveland trip), and that’s like the biggest thing I’ve been criticized about for a minute, just being consistent as a player,” Bronny said. “I started to see that, and it kind of drove you to (consider that), well, maybe these people don’t think that I could be consistent as a player, be a good player, produce as a player. In our talk, it was Bronny who first brought up the criticism. We all know that Bronny James is in the NBA because of his dad.” Throughout Bronny’s brief pro career, his father had always said that Bronny tunes out or doesn’t hear the critics — he keeps his head down, focuses on the game and so on. But in our conversation Bronny said, multiple times, he actually does hear some of what is said about him, and he uses it to his advantage. “But I just take that and use it as fuel for me to go out, wake up every day and get to the gym early, get my extra work in, watch my extra film every day, get better every day,” Bronny continued. He’s at the practice facility by 9, when his work begins. It includes film study and individual work, playing in “stay ready” games for players at the end of the Lakers bench and physical therapy. If Bronny continues his current trajectory, perhaps they will get more court time — in practices or games — for the Lakers before his dad retires. “He doesn’t seem to take a day for granted,” Pelinka said. “He really embraces every day, and you just love to have people like that in your program.” (Illustration: Demetrius Robinson / The Athletic; top photos: Alex Slitz, Sean M.

Bronny James is addressing all the negativity surrounding his NBA career ... saying despite people thinking he's a "f***ing robot," he does have feelings -- and the criticism is motivating him to prove the haters wrong. The 20-year-old NBA player spoke out in a feature with The Athletic ... on the heels of a confrontation between LeBron and Stephen A. Smith at the Lakers game earlier this month -- which was sparked due to the ESPN talent's comments on the four-time champion's son. Bronny said all the outside noise doesn't go unnoticed ... but instead of letting it hurt his pride, it's actually having the opposite effect. "My first thought about everything is I always try to just let it go through one ear and out the other, put my head down and come to work and be positive every day," Bronny said. "But sometimes it just, it fuels me a little bit. I see everything that people are saying, and people think, like, I’m a f***ing robot, like I don’t have any feelings or emotions." Bronny continued ... "But I just take that and use it as fuel for me to go out, wake up every day and get to the gym early, get my extra work in, watch my extra film every day, get better every day." Bronny -- averaging 20.6 points in the G League -- believes he is improving physically and mentally. He attributes his progress to his newfound confidence. "That’s what Rob [Pelinka] wants me to do as a young guy, coming in, playing in the G League, and learning from far on the bench watching the Lakers play," Bronny added.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Boston Celtics are off the market ... the 18-time NBA champions have been scooped up for a whopping $6.1 billion -- making it the largest sale for a sports franchise in North American history.

Bill Chisholm -- the managing partner at Symphony Technology Group -- was the man to submit the winning bid for the 2024 NBA champs. The $6.1 billion price tag surpasses the number previously set by Josh Harris when he purchased the Washington Commanders in 2023 for $6.05 billion.

The Celtics hit the market not long after they defeated the Dallas Mavericks in the 2024 NBA Finals. Their current owner -- 63-year-old Wyc Grousbeck -- announced plans to sell his stake for "estate and family planning considerations." Grousbeck intended to sell 51% of the team by late 2024 or early 2025, with the rest closing in 2028.

He is expected to remain on as team governor until 2028. The Grousbeck purchased the Cs back in 2002 for $360 million.

Chisholm -- a Dartmouth graduate -- grew up 40 minutes outside of Beantown ... and is said to be a longtime fan of the squad.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Christopher Crisona -- a contestant on "Family Feud" during Steve Harvey's very first season as host -- has been arrested and charged with child sexual abuse ... TMZ has learned. Crisona and another man -- Father John Taggart -- have been arrested and charged with several felonies connected to alleged abuse at St. Thomas the Apostle School in Wilmington, Delaware. The Delaware Attorney General's Office says Crisona was a teacher at the school for a year and a half back in the mid-1990s before he was removed from his post following a student complaint. Taggart, now 80, is accused of abusing the same individual as the 57-year-old Crisona. Crisona -- who the Delaware AG's Office states is currently working as an elementary school teacher in Florida -- has been charged with several crimes, including unlawful sexual contact, unlawful sexual intercourse, unlawful sexual penetration, and continuous sexual abuse of a child. Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said ... "The State’s indictment alleges a pattern of gravely serious abuse against a juvenile by two adults in a position of trust. As prosecutors, and as parents, these kinds of cases keep us up at night -- but they also give us purpose. "The victim in this case suffered profound trauma over a period of years and deserves justice.

Blake Lively is following the same game plan as her husband Ryan Reynolds ... officially asking a judge to cut her out of Justin Baldoni's lawsuit.

Blake filed her motion to dismiss Thursday, and according to the docs ... she says Justin's actually violating the law by filing his lawsuit against her, because it's all being done for revenge.

She says her "It Ends With Us" costar and director only filed his defamation suit against her, Ryan and her publicist after Blake filed her lawsuit alleging he had sexually harassed her while making the movie, and launched a smear campaign when she reported the alleged abuse to the studio.

Blake says under California law Justin is barred from suing her based on her accusing him of sexual harassment -- which is why she wants the judge to dismiss his suit against her.

In the new docs, Blake's lawyers say Justin and his company, Wayfarer Studios, have "created more liability for themselves by their malicious efforts to sue Ms. Lively 'into oblivion.'" That liability will come in the form of a lot of money -- Blake says Justin will have to pay her legal fees, plus massive damages for having filed this kind of suit against her.

Blake also addresses the bullying narrative Team Baldoni's put out ... claiming Blake and Ryan are using their A-list Hollywood power to bully him. According to the docs, it's actually Justin doing the bullying with a lawsuit "designed to further [Baldoni's] sinister campaign to 'bury' and 'destroy' Ms. Lively for speaking out about sexual harassment and retaliation."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A woman in Indiana was arrested after she and her two kids allegedly beat up a student ... and, the fight was seemingly caught on shocking video.

Latea Hentz -- a 36-year-old mother -- and her teenage son and daughter are accused of hopping on a school bus to throw hands with an 8th-grade student they claim was bullying the son.

Watch the clip ... the three people in the vid -- identified by local outlets as Hentz, her 17-year-old daughter and her 13-year-old son -- throw punch after punch at this other student. One person in the fray screams at this kid to never touch her son again.

It's a pretty shocking clip ... and, many students onboard are begging the three to let the kid go, though they don't leave until they've landed quite a few punches.

According to local reports ... Hentz told cops the student had been bullying her son for weeks, but the school wouldn't do anything to stop it. The day before this went down in early March, she says, he slapped her son.

Police say the kid who was beaten up went to the hospital for treatment, where it was determined his nose was fractured and his left eye was bruised and swollen.

Hentz was reportedly charged with multiple felonies ... including criminal confinement, battery resulting in moderate injury, intimidation, and criminal trespass. The children are also facing undisclosed charges.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
