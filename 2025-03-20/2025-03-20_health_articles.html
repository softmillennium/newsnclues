Biohacking, an emerging and revolutionary approach to human enhancement, offers just that. At its core, biohacking encompasses a wide range of strategies, from lifestyle modifications to cutting-edge biotechnology.1 Supplementing with nootropics or compounds that may improve cognitive function is another avenue under investigation, with some substances like caffeine and omega-3 fatty acids demonstrating benefits.3 However, more extreme biohacking methods, including self-experimentation with gene editing or unregulated supplements, lack robust scientific validation and pose significant risks. Additionally, the use of implantable technologies, where individuals insert Radio Frequency Identification and Near Field Communication chips, biosensors, or magnets into their bodies to interact with electronic devices or augment their senses have raised significant ethical concerns.1 As biohacking continues to evolve, distinguishing evidence-based strategies from speculative or hazardous practices remains essential for its responsible application.1 This article explores five evidence-based biohacking strategies with the potential to promote longevity. Research suggests that intermittent fasting enhances longevity by triggering autophagy, reducing oxidative stress, and improving insulin sensitivity.4 A key mechanism behind these benefits is the metabolic switch from glucose to ketone-based energy, which has been linked to improved mitochondrial function and reduced inflammation.5 Studies indicate that intermittent fasting may lower the risk of metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative conditions.2 Additionally, intermittent fasting has been shown to modulate gut microbiota, which plays a crucial role in immune function, inflammation, and overall health.5 Furthermore, emerging research suggests that intermittent fasting can also influence gene expression related to longevity by activating sirtuins, a family of proteins involved in cellular repair and aging.4 However, the long-term implications of different intermittent fasting protocols remain an area of active research, necessitating further clinical trials to establish optimal fasting durations for longevity benefits. Despite its benefits, intermittent fasting is not suitable for everyone. Individuals with certain metabolic disorders, pregnant women, or those with a history of eating disorders should consult a medical professional before attempting fasting regimens.2 Future studies should focus on personalized approaches, considering factors such as genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and existing health conditions. Cold exposure, including practices such as ice baths and cryotherapy, induces hormesis — a biological phenomenon where mild stressors elicit adaptive benefits. Moreover, research suggests that cold exposure modulates immune function, reducing inflammation and neuroinflammation.7 This effect may be particularly relevant for aging, as chronic low-grade inflammation is a key driver of age-related diseases. Some studies suggest that regular exposure to cold temperatures may even enhance cardiovascular health by improving vascular function and circulation.8 However, excessive cold exposure can be harmful, leading to hypothermia or increased cardiovascular strain in individuals with pre-existing health conditions.8 It is essential to adopt a gradual approach, starting with brief cold showers or localized ice application before progressing to more extreme methods such as ice baths. Nutrigenomics explores the relationship between genes, diet, and health, allowing for personalized nutritional interventions. Nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation has been shown to boost the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a coenzyme critical for mitochondrial function and cellular repair, which declines with age.9 Additionally, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and magnesium are emerging as key nutrients in longevity science, with studies linking them to reduced risks of chronic diseases.10,3 While nutrigenomics shows promise, supplementation should be tailored to individual needs. Quality sleep is a crucial determinant of longevity, with evidence linking disrupted sleep patterns to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and metabolic disorders.11 Melatonin, a hormone that regulates circadian rhythms, plays a key role in sleep quality and longevity. Aligning lifestyle habits with natural circadian rhythms, such as enhancing exposure to natural light to increase melatonin production, may also promote optimal hormonal balance and metabolic efficiency.12 In addition to melatonin, sleep hygiene practices such as reducing caffeine intake, optimizing the bedroom environment, and engaging in relaxation techniques before bed contribute to better sleep quality. Poor sleep has been associated with increased levels of beta-amyloid, a protein linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.12 Moreover, emerging research suggests that deep sleep plays a crucial role in metabolic regulation, immune function, and brain detoxification. Strategies to enhance neuroplasticity — such as meditation, brain-training exercises, and nootropic compounds — have been extensively investigated for their potential to slow cognitive aging and improve mental resilience.3 Meditation has also been shown to reduce stress-related neuroinflammation, while studies have reported that certain nootropics, such as caffeine, may enhance cognitive function. Technological advancements in neurofeedback and brain-computer interfaces may further enhance cognitive longevity. Current studies are striving to identify the most effective cognitive enhancement strategies while balancing efficacy with ethical considerations and safety. While intermittent fasting, cold exposure, nutrigenomics, sleep optimization, and neuroplasticity interventions show scientific merit, their long-term implications need further exploration. The current understanding suggests that future research should focus on refining these strategies and personalizing interventions to maximize their benefits while minimizing risks. https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2016.1235859 Spiljar, M., Steinbach, K., Rigo, D., Suárez-Zamorano, N., Wagner, I., Hadadi, N., Vincenti, I., Page, N., Klimek, B., Rochat, M.

Flying with a food allergy can be daunting. I receive so many messages from my followers asking about flying and which airlines to choose when you have allergies. I’ve decided to write this blog post to give you a better understanding of my process and hopefully help you manage it better! Every airline has its own policies regarding allergies, so it's always best to know ahead of time. It can be super frustrating and scary when the airline industry doesn't take your allergy seriously. It's definitely worth taking some time to pick an airline with a good track record, although this can be hard because everyone can have different experiences with the same airline. Some airlines have changed their policies and no longer serve nuts on flights. This is a massive step forward and a relief for so many people who fly regularly. We can only hope that more airlines follow in their footsteps! It’s also always worthwhile getting a letter from your doctor saying that you have an allergy and carry medication for it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

When it comes to managing food allergies, most of us focus on knowledge. We research symptoms, memorize allergen lists, and practice using an epinephrine injector in controlled scenarios. But what happens when knowledge collides with fear in a moment that demands action? That’s the question I faced during a recent experience with my oldest daughter, and the answer was humbling. On that afternoon, my daughter – who has multiple food allergies – began showing alarming signs of a potential anaphylactic reaction after eating a small bowl of dry Honey Nut Cheerios. She started with excessive, uncontrollable coughing, followed by difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, and a sense of lethargy that sent my heart racing. My daughter’s allergies include eggs, dairy, nuts, shellfish, cinnamon, and strawberries. Thankfully, she had recently passed her wheat challenge, and under her allergist’s guidance, we’d reintroduced wheat into her diet. In all her years of managing these allergies, we’ve been fortunate – she had never experienced a severe reaction requiring an epinephrine pen. But as I watched her symptoms escalate, I knew this might be the moment we had always prepared for.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Mammograms, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) models, may reveal much more than cancer, according to a study being presented at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session (ACC.25). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that middle-aged and older women get a mammogram—an X-ray of the breast—to screen for breast cancer every one or two years. About 40 million mammograms are performed in the United States each year. The new study, which used an AI image analysis technique not previously used on mammograms, demonstrates how AI can help fill this gap by automatically analyzing breast arterial calcification and translating the results into a cardiovascular risk score. Our study showed that breast arterial calcification is a good predictor for cardiovascular disease, especially in patients younger than age 60. Theo Dapamede, MD, PhD, postdoctoral fellow at Emory University in Atlanta and study's lead author Previous studies have shown that women with calcium buildup in the arteries face a 51% higher risk of heart disease and stroke. The segmentation approach is what separates this model from previous AI models developed for analyzing breast artery calcifications. "Advances in deep learning and AI have made it much more feasible to extract and use more information from images to inform opportunistic screening," Dapamede said. Overall findings showed the new model performed well at characterizing patients' cardiovascular risk as low, moderate or severe based on mammogram images. After calculating the risk of dying from any cause or suffering an acute heart attack, stroke or heart failure at two years and five years, the model showed that the rate of these serious cardiovascular events increased with breast arterial calcification level in two of the three age categories assessed—women younger than age 60 and age 60-80, but not in those over age 80. This makes the tool particularly well suited for providing early warning of heart disease risk in younger women, who can benefit more from early interventions, researchers said. The researchers also plan to explore how similar AI models could be used for assessing biomarkers for other conditions, such as peripheral artery disease and kidney disease, that might be extracted from mammograms.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250320/Oophorectomy-linked-to-higher-risk-of-heart-failure-in-women.aspx'>Oophorectomy linked to higher risk of heart failure in women</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 00:00:00 <p>
Women of childbearing age who had both ovaries removed, in a procedure called bilateral oophorectomy, were more likely to develop heart failure later in life, according to a study being presented at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session (ACC.25). The new study sheds light on the potential and unique role that this procedure might play in heightening cardiovascular risk given that it abruptly stops the production of estrogen and other hormones and, depending on timing, can induce early onset menopause, which researchers said may be distinct from other causes of early menopause. We know that sex hormones, including estrogen and progesterone levels, play a crucial role in cardiovascular risk. Our study shows that there is an association between removing both ovaries and future development of heart failure, in particular. Understanding this allows us to anticipate and manage potential complications, particularly cardiovascular disease." Compared with women in the general population who have their ovaries, those who underwent a bilateral oophorectomy had a 1.5-fold increased risk of developing heart failure after adjusting for race, age, gender, diabetes, smoking status and high cholesterol. According to researchers, their findings also underscore the need to integrate cardiovascular risk discussions and closer heart monitoring for women contemplating oophorectomy before natural menopause (defined as not having a period for one full year), which usually occurs at 51 years of age, on average. "Women must do what is medically necessary in terms of oophorectomy, but our findings suggest they should have an informed discussion with their health care team about how to monitor their cardiovascular health and manage potential risk factors for heart failure, including adopting a healthy lifestyle as much as possible and perhaps asking about any potential role of hormone replacement therapy," Kulthamrongsri said. While some women may not have a choice in terms of when they undergo this procedure, for those who do, an informed discussion about the best timing based on their age and health is important to be able to discuss and weigh the potential added cardiovascular risks. This may be especially important for White women who appear to have a much higher risk of developing heart failure. This finding might be explained by the etiology of heart failure that develops in early surgical menopause, related to myocardial infarction or other etiologies in which sex hormones play a crucial role," Kulthamrongsri said. This concern is especially relevant given the number of women who undergo oophorectomy procedures. Additional studies should be done to validate these findings using larger, global datasets. Future research should also explore possible preventive solutions, including cardiovascular screening recommendations and the use of prophylactic heart medications.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250320/Cell-map-offers-insights-into-endometrial-dysfunction-in-women-with-PCOS.aspx'>Cell map offers insights into endometrial dysfunction in women with PCOS</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 00:00:00 <p>
Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) find it harder to get pregnant, have more frequent miscarriages and have a higher risk of developing endometrial cancer. Women with the syndrome have difficulty getting pregnant and are at increased risk of miscarriage and uterine cancer, especially cancer of the endometrium. It is also common for affected women to be overweight and insulin resistant. By studying endometrial tissue samples from five healthy women and 12 women with PCOS, the researchers created a cell map of individual cells. In the study, all women were overweight, but only the women with PCOS were insulin resistant and had elevated levels of male sex hormones. In total, almost 250,000 cell nuclei from the women's uterine linings were analyzed. These results show that the growth of the cells is affected, which may explain why it can take longer for affected women to become pregnant and why they are more likely to miscarry, as well as contributing to the increased risk of endometrial cancer." "Our analyses show that certain cell types in the endometrium have disrupted communication and interaction specific to PCOS," says Gustaw Eriksson, one of the study's first authors and a doctoral student in Elisabet Stener-Victorin's research group. After 16 weeks of treatment, the researchers found that many gene expressions in specific cell types, especially in the epithelial and stromal cells, were normalised by metformin, but also by lifestyle changes, although not as pronounced. "We can show that metformin seems to have many more functions in women with PCOS than lowering blood sugar. In the study, all the women were overweight, but it is likely that metformin has similar effects in affected women who are not overweight but insulin resistant if they have problems getting pregnant or have repeated miscarriages," says Elisabet Stener-Victorin. "As we identified changes in gene expression in specific cell types, this study provides crucial guidance for developing more targeted treatments for PCOS-related endometrial dysfunction," says Elisabet Stener-Victorin.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Healthcare professionals need better support to help recognize and treat symptoms of disordered eating in people living with type 1 Diabetes, according to new research from the University of Surrey. Disordered eating in people living with type 1 Diabetes is often referred as T1DE. Diabulimia is one example of T1DE, a dangerous eating disorder which involves deliberate misuse of insulin for weight loss, leading to severe health problems and even death. New research from Surrey, led by Dr Katie Fitzgerald and supervised by Dr Rose-Marie Satherley, highlights the challenges healthcare professionals face in recognizing and treating T1DE. This may lead to delays in diagnosis and potentially life-threatening complications for patients. The study found that some healthcare professionals often perceived T1DE as an "inevitable" consequence of living with type 1 diabetes, leading to a sense of helplessness. "Our study highlights the need for better training and clear clinical guidelines to support healthcare professionals in addressing disordered eating in adults with type 1 diabetes. The phrase "a bit of a black hole" that was used by one participant, aptly captures the uncertainty and confusion surrounding T1DE. "There is a real fear and lack of confidence these professionals are experiencing, so we must address the intersection of physical and mental health in diabetes care. We must equip our teams with psychological-expertise, effective communication strategies, as well with the tools and support they need to have these critical conversations to help improve their patients' health."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Despite their extended lifespan, BC survivors often face faster cognitive decline and physical frailty compared to women without cancer. The study utilized a relatively new measure of aging—Phenotypic Age Acceleration (PAA)—to evaluate biological aging in BC survivors. BC patients were, on average, five years older than controls and had double the mortality rate (8% vs. 4%) over a median follow-up period of nine years. Surgery was the most common intervention, performed in nearly 90% of cases. Targeted therapy was administered to 17% of patients, but only 3% received immunotherapy. Over the follow-up period, 2% developed a second BC, and 20% experienced metastasis or recurrence. The degree of PAA varied based on several factors. Patients diagnosed at age 65 or older were initially phenotypically younger than their CA, but over time, they aged faster, surpassing their CA by 1.5 years at two, five, and ten years. Those with stage III/IV BC exhibited a five-year PAA at diagnosis, which persisted for ten years. Surgery appeared to have a protective effect, with patients showing a phenotypic age seven years younger than their CA at year ten. When both were used together, the impact was similar to that of surgery alone. Chemotherapy and targeted therapy did not significantly impact PAA when administered alone. However, combination regimens that included chemotherapy led to accelerated aging by four years at one-year post-diagnosis. Patients who received hormone therapy—whether alone or alongside chemotherapy and targeted therapy—aged nearly three years faster than their CA at both one and ten years. However, antimetabolites ultimately accelerated aging by seven years at year ten, while AIs added two years to the CA at the same time point. These findings suggest that hormone therapy may contribute to faster aging overall. Accelerated aging in BC survivors may result from multiple factors. Cytotoxic chemotherapy can induce cellular senescence, telomere shortening, chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, and epigenetic alterations. The study indicates that these effects may persist even ten years after diagnosis. Hormone therapy may also play a role by disrupting normal hormonal adaptation, genomic stability, and mitochondrial function, leading to stem cell exhaustion and increased biological aging. “This study provides evidence of accelerated aging among BC survivors and identifies high-risk populations based on tumor characteristics and treatments.” Notably, this is the first study to apply PAA based on biochemical markers rather than epigenetic parameters in BC survivors. However, the findings must be interpreted cautiously due to selection and survival biases. Patients with high-grade tumors or aggressive treatments may have higher PAA but also higher rates of recurrence or death, potentially skewing results. Additionally, tumor characteristics primarily influence aging at diagnosis rather than during follow-up. Further research is needed to explore how demographic and lifestyle factors interact with aging-related outcomes in BC survivors, particularly with modern treatment regimens. These insights could help improve long-term care and quality of life for survivors.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250320/Scientists-discover-irreversible-peptide-inhibitors-for-undruggable-cancer-target.aspx'>Scientists discover irreversible peptide inhibitors for undruggable cancer target</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 00:00:00 <p>
For the first time scientists have identified promising drug candidates that bind irreversibly with a notoriously "undruggable" cancer protein target, permanently blocking it. Transcription factors are proteins that act as 'master switches' of gene activity and play a key role in cancer development. Attempts over the years to design "small molecule" drugs that block them have been largely unsuccessful, so in recent years scientists have explored using peptides – small protein fragments – to block these "undruggable" targets. Now researchers from the University of Bath have for the first time detailed an approach to discover peptides that bind selectively and irreversibly within cells, permanently blocking a transcription factor that drives cancer known as cJun. The team, publishing in the journal Advanced Science, used a new drug discovery screening platform technology, called the Transcription Block Survival (TBS) assay, which tests a huge number of peptides to "switch off" transcription factors that drive cancer. Their previous work identified reversible inhibitors of cJun, but this latest work builds on that by discovering peptides that bind selectively and irreversibly within cells, permanently blocking cJun action. It can become overactive in cancer, driving uncontrolled cell growth, so the researchers designed a peptide inhibitor that binds to one half of cJun, stopping it from forming pairs and attaching to the DNA. "However our platform screens for peptide activity directly in the cell, overcoming many common challenges faced by drugs based on small molecules or antibodies. "We hope this technology can in the future uncover other promising drug candidates for previously 'undruggable' targets." Having proven cell permeability and activity in cancer cells, as well as target selectivity, the researchers now need to show the inhibitors work in preclinical cancer models.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
