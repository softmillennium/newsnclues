A U.K. start-up has shocked the space exploration community after unveiling plans to use a novel nuclear fusion propulsion system to power an orbital fleet of reusable "alien-like" rockets, known as Sunbirds, which the company says could revolutionize how we explore the solar system — and beyond. One expert told Live Science it could be at least a decade away, if not more. Pulsar Fusion, which also makes traditional plasma thrusters and is developing nuclear fission engines, first announced the Sunbird project on March 6 after developing the concept in "complete secrecy" over the last decade, according to a statement emailed to Live Science. In theory, the proposed rockets will be stored in massive orbital satellite docks before being deployed and attached to other spacecraft and rapidly propelling them to their destinations like giant "space tugs," which would massively reduce the cost of long-haul space missions. A concept video shows how the futuristic rockets could be used to transport a larger spacecraft to Mars and back using docking stations at both ends of the journey (see below). Sunbird rockets could act as "space tugs" that attach to spacecraft in low-Earth orbit and propel them out of our planet's gravity well. (The current record for a trip to Pluto is 9.5 years, which was set by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft in 2015.) "If we are going to be the species that actually get to other planets, then exhaust speeds are pretty much the most important thing," Dinan said during a talk at Space-Comm Expo. On Earth, using nuclear fusion as a source of near-limitless energy is still likely decades away , which at first glance makes the idea of fusion rockets seem like pure science fiction. However, the opposite is true because "the bar is lower for fusion in space," Dinan told Live Science in an interview at Space-Comm Expo. That's because the proposed reaction needed in space is different from what physicists are attempting on Earth. In traditional nuclear fusion reactors, known as tokamaks, the goal is to fuse deuterium and tritium — both heavy isotopes, or versions, of hydrogen — in order to emit a constant stream of neutrons, which generates heat (and in turn energy), as well as breeding more fuel for the continued reaction. In this case, the reaction would pump out protons, and their charge can be used for direct propulsion. Additionally, the proposed reaction would only need to last for short periods at a time, similar to the timescales already achieved on Earth . In space, there is also a natural vacuum and temperatures reaching absolute zero , which will prevent the reactor from overheating. However, the designs of the DDFD are still a closely guarded secret and have not yet been properly tested, so their exact workings and feasibility are unclear. But not everyone agrees that it will be so easy. If Pulsar can master the DDFD, the plan is to use the resulting Sunbirds as "space tugs" that can propel any spacecraft from low-Earth orbit (LEO) further into space — largely because fusion is not a viable or safe way of launching rockets directly from Earth's surface. So rather than having to build giant rockets with massive thrusters in order to completely escape Earth's gravity, as SpaceX's temperamental Starship rocket does, sunbirds will allow any spacecraft that makes it into LEO to escape our planet's pull. Another big draw of the Sunbirds is that they would only require small amounts of fuel and could be easily refilled and recharged while they are "perched" on their orbital docking stations, potentially making them much more reusable than most other propulsion systems, Dinan said. In theory, multiple docking stations could be constructed around the solar system, allowing for faster return journeys to Earth as well. This is due to thick "tank-like" armor plating that will hopefully allow them to survive being bombarded with cosmic radiation and micrometeorites in space, which is why they look "super weird," Dinan said. Each Sunbird could cost upwards of $90 million (70 million British pounds) to produce, largely because of how expensive helium-3 is to obtain, Dinan estimated. However, the amount of money that these rockets could save a potential client means they would be well worth the cost, he added. "If I can get them there quicker, they will pay for it." In the future, helium-3 could be mined from regolith on the moon, which would be much cheaper than trying to produce it on Earth, Lozano said. These initial tests won't use helium-3 because it is too expensive to obtain for use in a prototype, meaning that true fusion will not be achieved. Instead, an "inert gas" will be used in its place to test how the engine could theoretically work, Dinan said. Next, Pulsar Fusion plans to undergo an orbital demonstration for some of the "key technological components" in 2027, he added. However, Dinan says that there is no timeline for creating the first Sunbird prototype and it is "too speculative" to predict when this may happen.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/biological-secrets-of-worlds-oldest-woman-maria-branyas-morera-revealed-after-death'>Biological secrets of world's oldest woman, Maria Branyas Morera, revealed after death</a></h2><b>Source:</b> livescience&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 16:30:00 <p>
Maria Branyas Morera was 117 when she died in August 2024 — but aspects of her biology looked much younger, new research finds. These include genes associated with immune function, fantastic cholesterol levels, and a high level of inflammation-fighting bacteria in her gut. Related: Extreme longevity: The secret to living longer may be hiding with nuns... and jellyfish Notably, however, not all researchers are convinced that studying supercentenarians — people ages 110 or older — is a fruitful method of understanding longevity. That's partly because the actual ages of these individuals have been called into question. Esteller and his colleagues investigated Branyas' genes, immune cells, blood levels of lipids, and proteins in her tissues, comparing her results to those of younger individuals who had undergone similar testing. For example, they compared Branyas' genetic results to those of 75 other Iberian women in the 1000 Genomes Project , an effort to map variation in the human genome. They may have protected against these diseases and improved organ function, the scientists suggested. They also found that Branyas had excellent mitochondrial function, meaning the powerhouses that provide cells energy worked better than those of younger women. She also had healthy cholesterol levels and a high production of proteins that are beneficial for immune function. Bacteria of the genus Bifidobacterium, which are known to excrete anti-inflammatory compounds, were especially prevalent. "She had this bacteria in the gut that protected against inflammation and she had this bacteria for two reasons," Esteller theorized. Branyas reported eating three yogurts a day, he said; fermented foods like yogurt contain probiotics , or living microorganisms that can replenish and maintain the gut microbiome . (Image credit: Unknown author, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons) Another intriguing finding was a schism between the molecular markers of aging in Branyas' body and her chronological age. When people age, structures at the ends of their chromosomes, called telomeres, become progressively shorter. Telomeres help prevent DNA from fraying, which would contribute to cellular aging and cancer. As expected for someone of an extreme age, Branyas' telomeres were almost nonexistent, Esteller said. In these two ways, Branyas' biology looked very old — but another marker of aging on her DNA looked strangely young, the team found. Branyas' clock looked like that of someone between age 100 and 110, about a decade younger than she was at death. An accumulation of many little genetic benefits and lifestyle choices may enable extreme longevity, Esteller concluded. Given the study's findings, "maybe we can think about interventions now," he said, including potential drugs to increase life span. But there may be a caveat to this research and other studies like it: the ages of the subjects it focuses on. For example, in 1997, the oldest person to have ever lived, Jeanne Calment of France, died, and her age was validated by longevity organizations and the Guinness Book of World Records at 122 years old. They contend that her daughter, Yvonne, took on her identity to evade taxes — and in doing so, she inadvertently became the purported oldest person ever. (If these critics are right, the woman who died in 1997 was actually only 99.) Another study , which is currently under peer review, argues that the problems with old-age validation go far beyond Calment. This research, first released as a preprint in 2019, suggests that regions with the highest reported proportions of extremely old residents are disproportionately poor and unhealthy . What does predict high numbers of very old people, Newman found, is poor record-keeping. For example, U.S. states established birth certificate systems at different times, and the number of people ages 110 and older drops by an estimated 69% to 82% after that record-keeping improves. Often, people born before such documentation was de rigueur might not even know their true ages, Newman told Live Science. In poor regions, people might also have been motivated to tack years onto their age or take on the identity of a deceased relative to receive a pension. Esteller and colleagues relied on the work of age-verification organizations to validate Branyas' age and did not have direct access to her documents.

Astronomers have found oxygen in the most distant known galaxy, upending assumptions about how quickly galaxies matured. Heavy elements like oxygen are forged in the nuclear fires of stars. As the newfound oxygen existed when the universe was just 2% of its present age, this primordial element is a major head-scratcher for astronomers because it suggests that stars in the early universe were born and died to seed their surroundings with heavy elements much faster than previously expected. "It is like finding an adolescent where you would only expect babies," Sander Schouws , a researcher at Leiden University in the Netherlands and lead author of the second study, said in a statement . The detection of JADES-GS-z14-0 and other galaxies like it, however, turned this assumption on its head . The light detected by JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph originated in an enormous halo of young stars surrounding the galaxy's core that were burning for at least 90 million years before its observation . Related: James Webb telescope confirms there is something seriously wrong with our understanding of the universe Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors Young stars are typically composed of hydrogen and helium, and they fuse them into heavier elements, like oxygen, as they grow old and scatter them throughout their host galaxies upon the stars' violent deaths. At the roughly 300 million-year mark where we can see JADES-GS-z14-0, astronomers expected the universe to still be too young to be rife with heavy elements.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

One of the smallest human relatives ever found has been unearthed in South Africa. Standing just 3 feet, 4.5 inches (1.03 meters) tall, the adult Paranthropus robustus, who died 2 million years ago, is even shorter than the famously diminutive " Lucy " from Ethiopia and the mysterious group of tiny " hobbits " from Indonesia — but researchers aren't sure why. "These small early hominin individuals are reconstructed as shorter and stockier than modern human 'pygmies'," or groups of people with an average male height under 4 feet, 11 inches inches (150 centimeters), study lead author Travis Pickering , a paleoanthropologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, told Live Science in an email. The newly uncovered individual, designated SWT1/HR-2, "was probably similarly built — short and stocky," he said. The team retrieved chunks of sedimentary rock dated between 1.7 million and 2.3 million years old from the Swartkrans limestone cave, which is located in South Africa's Cradle of Humankind — a region that encompasses 180 square miles (470 square kilometers) and includes more than a dozen major fossil sites. But very few fossils of the body of P. robustus have ever been found, making the new discovery important for understanding what they looked like and how they moved. Related: 1.4 million-year-old jaw that was 'a bit weird for Homo' turns out to be from never-before-seen human relative This tiny P. robustus, which was found inside a cave, probably weighed about 60.4 pounds (27.4 kg). Other fossils at the site also have puncture marks that match leopard teeth, study co-author C.K. Although the leg bones provide important new evidence for what life was like for P. robustus, the researchers are still unsure why this species was so small. There is currently no evidence that the species was affected by insular dwarfism , study co-author Jason Heaton , a paleoanthropologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told Live Science in an email. That process — in which a species evolves to be smaller over time due to competition for resources — may be why Homo floresiensis, also called the hobbits , were very short. "I think that there is a good chance that much more of the SWT1/HR-2 skeleton will be recovered," Pickering said, "especially if we are correct and she was killed and eaten by a leopard, since leopards do not generally consume bones."

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/our-new-study-indicates-maternal-exposure-to-relatively-low-fluoride-levels-may-affect-intelligence-in-children-251193'>Our new study indicates maternal exposure to relatively low fluoride levels may affect intelligence in children</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 14:14:23 <p>
In some countries, such as the US, Canada, UK, Australia and Ireland, fluoride is commonly added to the public water supply at around 0.7mg per litre to prevent tooth decay. The World Health Organization guideline for fluoride in drinking water is 1.5mg per litre. Given the concern that fluoride in drinking water might affect children’s intelligence, the addition of this mineral to drinking water has become controversial. The US National Toxicology Program’s, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, most recent evaluation states with moderate confidence that higher fluoride exposure (above the World Health Organization guideline) is consistently associated with decreased child intelligence, while they conclude that more research is needed to understand the effects at lower fluoride exposure levels. A new study my colleagues and I conducted found that relatively low exposure to fluoride during the foetal stage (as a result of the mother’s exposure to fluoride) or in the child’s early years may affect their intelligence. For the study, which was published in Environmental Health Perspectives, we followed 500 mothers and their children in rural Bangladesh, where fluoride occurs naturally in the drinking water, to investigate the link between early life exposure to fluoride and children’s intelligence. Psychologists evaluated the children’s cognitive abilities at five and ten years of age, using standard IQ tests. Urine samples reflect the continuing exposure from all sources, such as drinking water, food and dental products (such as toothpaste and mouthwash). Urine samples are the most accurate way of determining fluoride exposure in people. The children’s average urinary fluoride concentrations at five and ten years of age (0.62 and 0.66mg per litre, respectively) were similar to those of their mothers during pregnancy. Among children who had more than 0.72mg per litre of fluoride in their urine by age ten, increasing urinary fluoride concentrations were associated with lower intelligence. Out of the cognitive abilities measured, associations of both maternal and child urinary fluoride concentrations were most pronounced with nonverbal reasoning and verbal abilities. Still, we couldn’t exclude the possibility that there were contributions from other sources. Fluoride in toothpaste is important for preventing tooth decay, but it’s important to encourage small children not to swallow the toothpaste during brushing. A limitation of our study is that we measured fluoride only in one urine sample at each time point. As a result, we did not convert the results to IQ scores (with an average of 100) that can be compared across populations. Our findings support previous well-designed studies from Canada and Mexico, where exposure levels obtained below the existing WHO guideline for fluoride in drinking water were associated with impaired cognitive development. Similar findings were recently provided when combining multiple studies from several countries. It was noted that at low exposure levels, findings with cognitive development were more conclusive among studies estimating fluoride exposure via urine than among studies that relied on concentrations in drinking water only. Still, as this is an observational study, no firm conclusions can be drawn about causalities. There is still a need for more well-designed research studies on low-level fluoride exposure and cognitive development, in combination with experimental studies to determine the possible molecular mechanisms driving it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A new comb-like computer chip could be the key to equipping drones, smartphones and autonomous vehicles with military-grade positioning technology that was previously confined to space agencies and research labs. Scientists have developed a "microcomb chip" — a 5 millimeter (0.2 inches) wide computer chip equipped with tiny teeth like those on a comb — that could make optical atomic clocks, the most precise timekeeping pieces on the planet, small and practical enough for real-world use. This could mean GPS-equipped systems a thousand times more accurate than the best we have today, improving everything from smartphone and drone navigation to seismic monitoring and geological surveys, the researchers said in a statement . They published their findings Feb. 19 in the journal Nature Photonics . With an optical atomic clock, you may achieve a precision of just a few centimeters [where 1 centimeter is 0.4 inches]," study co-author Minghao Qi , professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University, said in the statement. "This improves the autonomy of vehicles, and all electronic systems based on positioning. An optical atomic clock can also detect minimal changes in latitude on the Earth's surface and can be used for monitoring, for example, volcanic activity." There are approximately 400 high-precision atomic clocks worldwide, which use the principles of quantum mechanics to keep time. These shifts, called oscillations, happen naturally at an extremely high rate, acting like an ultra-precise ticking clock that keeps timekeeping accurate to within a billionth of a second . That is why atomic clocks form the backbone of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) — which is used to set global time zones — and GPS (global positioning system) satellites, which rely on atomic timekeeping to provide positioning data to cars, smartphones and other devices. Optical atomic clocks can be built by locking a microcomb tooth to a ultra-narrow-linewidth laser, which in turn locks to an atomic transition with extremely high frequency stability," the researchers explained in the statement. Just as gears transfer motion while reducing speed, the microcomb acts as a converter that changes the ultra-fast oscillations of atoms into a stable time signal that electronics can process.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/debate-over-h-1b-visas-shines-spotlight-on-us-tech-worker-shortages-248711'>Debate over H-1B visas shines spotlight on US tech worker shortages</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 13:01:47 <p>
The H-1B visa program is subject to an annual limit of new visas it can issue, which sits at 65,000 per fiscal year. There is also an additional annual quota of 20,000 H-1B visas for highly skilled international students who have a proven ability to succeed academically in the United States. At Rice University, where I work, much of STEM research is carried out by international graduate students. As a computer science professor – and an immigrant – who studies the interaction between computing and society, I believe the debate over H-1B overlooks some important questions: Why does the U.S. rely so heavily on foreign workers for the tech industry, and why is it not able to develop a homegrown tech workforce? The U.S. has been a magnet for global scientific talent since before World War II. After World War II, U.S. policies such as the Fulbright Program expanded opportunities for international educational exchange. Tech industry giants Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google were all founded by first- or second-generation immigrants. Furthermore, immigrants have founded more than half of the nation’s billion-dollar startups since 2018. Restricting foreign graduate students’ path to U.S. employment, as some prominent Trump supporters have called for, could significantly reduce the number of international graduate students in U.S. universities. It must be emphasized that international students make a significant contribution to U.S. research output. So making the U.S. less attractive to international graduate students in science and engineering would hurt U.S. research competitiveness. So, why is there such a reliance on foreign students for U.S. science and engineering? And why hasn’t America created an adequate pipeline of U.S.-born students for its technical workforce? After discussions with many colleagues, I have found that there are simply not enough qualified domestic doctoral applicants to fill the needs of their doctoral programs. In 2023, for example, U.S. computer science doctoral programs admitted about 3,400 new students, 63% of whom were foreign. It seems as if the doctoral career track is simply not attractive enough to many U.S. undergrad computer science students. The top annual salary in Silicon Valley for new computer science graduates can reach US$115,000. Bachelor’s degree holders in computing from Rice University have told me that until recently – before economic uncertainty shook the industry – they were getting starting annual salaries as high as $150,000 in Silicon Valley. The opportunity cost of pursuing a doctorate is, thus, up to $100,000 per year. So, pursuing a doctorate is not an economically viable decision for many Americans. The reality is that a doctoral degree opens new career options to its holder, but most bachelor’s degree holders do not see beyond the economics. Yet academic computing research is crucial to the success of Silicon Valley. A 2016 analysis of the information technology sectors with a large economic impact shows that academic research plays an instrumental role in their development. The U.S. is locked in a cold war with China focused mostly on technological dominance. So maintaining its research-and-development edge is in the national interest. Universities are paying doctoral students so little because they cannot afford to pay more. But instead of acknowledging the existence of this problem and trying to address it, the U.S. has found a way to meet its academic research needs by recruiting and admitting international students.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

By combining these two departments, Congress sought to create an overarching agency that could more cohesively and strategically support American museums and libraries. The agency’s mission, programs and funding have been reaffirmed through subsequent legislation, such as the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003. What does the Institute of Museum and Library Services do? Libraries of all types – public, academic, school and research – also benefit from the agency’s funding. Through grants, research and policy initiatives, the IMLS helps these institutions better serve their communities. For libraries, the IMLS might fund technology upgrades, such as virtual reality learning stations, AI-assisted research aids or digitization of rare books. The agency also pays for community programs that take place in libraries, from early childhood reading initiatives to workshops that help people land jobs. Recent funding has supported the digitization of over 2,000 vertebrate specimens, including rare and endangered species. Beyond financial support, the MSU Museum benefits from IMLS policy papers, professional training opportunities and resources developed through the National Leadership Grants for Museums program. Our staff members also contribute to national campaigns spearheaded by the IMLS, such as its Strategies for Countering Antisemitism & Hate initiative. Looking beyond Michigan State, what might be lost with its shuttering? Its funding has sustained museums, advanced digital preservation, expanded accessibility for low-income communities and fueled innovation in educational programming. In 2024 alone, the agency distributed US$266.7 million through grants, research initiatives and policy development. For example, ExplorationWorks, a children’s museum in Helena, Montana, received $151,946 in 2024 from the IMLS to expand its early childhood programs that serve low-income and rural families. Without this support, many institutions will struggle to hire and retain qualified staff, leading to fewer exhibitions, stalled research and reduced educational outreach. They’re often the only sources of cultural and historical education in their regions, and their loss would create cultural voids that cannot easily be filled. But my understanding is that the “applicable law” in this case primarily refers to the Museum and Library Services Act, which, as I noted earlier, was created in 1996 and has been reauthorized multiple times since then. Since the IMLS was created through this congressional legislation, it cannot simply be eliminated by an executive order. Additionally, the Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from operating without appropriated funding. If Congress were to defund the IMLS rather than repeal its authorizing statute, the agency would be forced to cease operations due to a lack of money, even if the legal framework for its existence remained intact. Is there anything else you’d like to add? A 2022 American Library Association survey revealed that 89% of voters and 92% of parents believe local public libraries have an important role to play in communities. People of all political stripes rely on libraries for free internet access, job searches and literacy programs. The Institute of Museum and Library Services is central to this work. Stripping this support would threaten the sustainability of these institutions and weaken their ability to serve as pillars of education, civic engagement and truth. I see it as a disinvestment in an informed, connected and resilient society.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A weather scientist explains</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 12:49:06 <p>
Windstorms can seem like they come out of nowhere, hitting with a sudden blast. They might be hundreds of miles long, stretching over several states, or just in your neighborhood. As a result of this temperature difference, strong winds develop at high altitudes over midlatitude locations, like the continental U.S. Because Earth rotates, these upper-altitude winds blow from west to east. Waves in the jet stream – a consequence of Earth’s rotation and variations in the surface land, terrain and oceans – can cause air to diverge, or spread out, at certain points. Earth’s rotation causes these winds to spiral around areas of high and low pressure. These highs and lows are like large circular mixers, with air blowing clockwise around high pressure and counterclockwise around low pressure. This flow pattern blows warm air northward toward the poles east of lows and cool air southward toward the equator west of lows. One of the biggest risks is dust storms in arid regions of west Texas or eastern New Mexico, exacerbated by drought in these areas. When the ground and vegetation are dry and the air has low relative humidity, high winds can also spread wildfires out of control. Even more intense winds can occur when the pressure gradient interacts with terrain. Of course, winds can become even stronger and more violent on local scales associated with thunderstorms. When thunderstorms form, hail and precipitation in them can cause the air to rapidly fall in a downdraft, causing very high pressure under these storms. Meteorologists call these straight line winds, and the process that forms them is a downburst. Large thunderstorms or chains of them moving across a region can cause large swaths of strong wind over 60 mph, called a derecho. Finally, some of nature’s strongest winds occur inside tornadoes. They form when the winds surrounding a thunderstorm change speed and direction with height. This can cause part of the storm to rotate, setting off a chain of events that may lead to a tornado and winds as strong as 300 mph in the most violent tornadoes. Tornado winds are also associated with an intense pressure gradient. The pressure inside the center of a tornado is often very low and varies considerably over a very small distance. It’s no coincidence that localized violent winds from thunderstorm downbursts and tornadoes often occur amid large-scale windstorms. Extratropical cyclones often draw warm, moist air northward on strong winds from the south, which is a key ingredient for thunderstorms. Storms also become more severe and may produce tornadoes when the jet stream is in close proximity to these low-pressure centers. In the winter and early spring, cold air funneling south on the northwest side of strong extratropical cyclones can even lead to blizzards.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

After Donald Trump’s “very good and productive” phone call with Vladimir Putin earlier this week, all eyes were on his subsequent call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Or would Zelensky manage to engage with the US president in a cooperative way that encourages him to see Ukraine and its leader in a more favourable light? In a post on his Truth Social site, Trump referred to their “very good telephone call”, which got the two leaders “very much on track”. With his vocal support of Trump’s proposal for peace, Zelensky has put the attention back on Putin. He clearly wants to appear to be the more reasonable negotiating partner by going along with the US president’s proposals. In spite of Zelensky’s misgivings about how trustworthy Putin is, he has agreed to a limited ceasefire with Russia on energy infrastructure (while stressing that, unlike Putin, he agrees with Trump’s aim for a complete ceasefire). Zelensky clearly knows that Russia has a great deal to gain from a pause on attacks on energy grids and oil refineries, given Ukraine’s increasing capacity to use long-range drone attacks. And a maritime ceasefire, if agreed, would also favour Russia. Sign up to receive our weekly World Affairs Briefing newsletter from The Conversation UK. Every Thursday we’ll bring you expert analysis of the big stories in international relations. Putin, meanwhile, in his call with Trump laid out a set of frankly unreasonable demands. He also demanded a complete halt on Ukrainian troop mobilisation and rearmament. Interestingly Trump, when he was interviewed after his phone call with Putin, denied that the pair had discussed aid. But while Trump still leans toward Putin, his relationship with Zelensky seems to have improved. The Ukrainian president appears to have learned that Trump doesn’t have a long memory and that flattery goes a long way with the US president. Trump, meanwhile, is no longer calling Zelensky a dictator, and as yet there is no mention of halting US military aid or intelligence to Ukraine. There is the opposite, in fact, as the US has said it will assist in finding more Patriot missile defence systems after Zelensky mentioned that they were sorely needed. Zelensky has also successfully turned Trump’s attention to the 35,000 missing children abducted from Ukraine into Russia during the war. Putin is generally thought to be stringing these negotiations out as long as possible in order to maximise the amount of Ukrainian territory his army occupies. So the question is how long Trump can remain distracted or satisfied by Putin’s false engagement with the peace process. The American president seems to be changing his tune on Ukraine more generally. His disastrous Oval Office press conference last month with Zelensky was viewed by some as a ploy to portray Ukraine as a difficult and ungrateful partner compared to Russia who he maintained was only interested in achieving a peaceful end to the war. For now, at least, the pressure is back on Putin.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Why comparisons between Trump and King George III miss the mark on 18th-century British monarchy</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 12:48:10 <p>
George III, king of Great Britain and its colonies at the time of the American Revolution, has been maligned unfairly. When the president bypassed Congress to create a new government agency, appointed its head and stopped payment of millions of dollars of allocated federal funds, his critics noted that he assumed the role of Congress, a power grab that supposedly made him similar to George III. He was not the all-powerful monarch that Trump allegedly aspires to be. After fighting two civil wars, executing one king, and, eventually, forcing the monarch to agree to rule with Parliament rather than on his own, they believed their liberties were safeguarded. This system, known as limited monarchy, was the pride of Great Britain. It was also admired by the American founders. Some fears came from their study of political theory, which taught that government worked best when composed of various branches that represented the concerns of the different political classes. As this theory went, an unbalanced government would descend into tyranny with a too-powerful monarch; oligarchy under a dominant aristocratic class; or anarchy with the people out of control. They believed these perils could be avoided only by maintaining balance. Even though the British did not fear imbalance or a tyrant king in their own case, they could see the danger threatening elsewhere in Europe. The mighty Genius of this isle disdains Ambitious slavery and golden chains.” Within a few years, Anglo-American criticism of kingly tyranny in France would be validated: That country descended into a violent revolution that resulted in decades of warfare and political violence, including the execution of the entire royal family. This experience confirmed for the British and Americans that a balanced system was best and that they should count their blessings. Americans did not revolt against the nature of British government. Rather they objected to their changing place within the British Empire. In the past, Colonists had been free to move west, challenged only by the indigenous residents who fought to defend their lands. Before 1776, the Colonists believed that George III would come to their rescue and halt these changes imposed by Parliament. They thought initially that he did not realize how the new policies affected them. Only in 1776 did they accept that George III supported the policy changes and would not defend their rights. Although they complained about the tyranny of George III, their true objection was that their subordinate position within the empire gave them little leverage when opposing policies that king and Parliament agreed to impose on them.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Because their physical appearance has changed very little over time, supported by a slow rate of evolution, sturgeon have been called living fossils. But it’s not clear what baseline population level people should strive toward restoring. How do today’s sturgeon populations compare with those of the past? We study the evolution, population health and resilience of these species over time to better understand humans’ interaction with their environments and the sustainability of food systems. For our recent sturgeon project, we joined forces with fisheries conservation biologist Matt Balazik, who conducts on-the-ground monitoring of Atlantic sturgeon, and Torben Rick, a specialist in North American coastal zooarchaeology. Woodland Era pottery remnants at archaeological sites from as long as 2,000 years ago show that the fall and springtime runs of Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus) upstream were celebrated with feasting. When Captain John Smith was leading Jamestown, he wrote “there was more sturgeon here than could be devoured by dog or man.” The fish may have helped the survival of this fortress-colony that was both stricken with drought and fostering turbulent relationships with the Native inhabitants. This abundance is in stark contrast to today, when sightings of migrating fish are sparse. At that point, local protection regulations were established, but only in 1998 was a moratorium on harvesting these fish declared. Meanwhile, abundance of Atlantic sturgeon remained very low, which can be explained in part by their lifespan. Short-lived fish such as herring and shad can recover population numbers much faster than Atlantic sturgeon, which live for up to 60 years and take a long time to reach reproductive age – up to around 12 years for males and as many as 28 years for females. Since then, conservationists have pioneered genetic studies on Atlantic sturgeon, demonstrating through the power of DNA that natal river – where an individual fish is born – and season of spawning are both important for distinguishing subpopulations within each regional group. Scientists have also described genetic diversity in Atlantic sturgeon; more genetic variety suggests they have more capacity to adapt when facing new, potentially challenging conditions. Archaeological remains are a direct source of data on genetic diversity in the past. Then we can compare that baseline with today’s genetic diversity. The James River was a great case study for testing out this approach, which we call an archaeogenomics time series. Having obtained information on the archaeology of the Chesapeake region from our collaborator Leslie Reeder-Myers, we sampled remains of sturgeon – their scutes and spines – at a precolonial-era site where people lived from about 200 C.E. We also sampled from important colonial sites Jamestown (1607-1610) and Williamsburg (1720-1775). And we complemented that data from the past with tiny clips from the fins of present-day, live fish that Balazik and his team sampled during monitoring surveys. DNA tends to get physically broken up and biochemically damaged with age. So we relied on special protocols in a lab dedicated to studying ancient DNA to minimize the risk of contamination and enhance our chances of successfully collecting genetic material from these sturgeon. We focused on a few genetic regions, just enough to get an idea of the James River population groupings and how genetically distinct they are from one another. What stood out, though, was how starkly different they were, which is something that can happen when a population’s numbers drop to near-extinction levels. With our collaborator Audrey Lin, we used the mitochondrial DNA to confirm our hypothesis that the fish from archaeological sites were more genetically diverse than present-day Atlantic sturgeon. Our interpretation of this genetic finding is that over very long timescales – many thousands of years – changes in the global climate and in local ecosystems would have driven a given sturgeon population to migrate into a new river system, and possibly at a later stage back to its original one. This notion is supported by other recent documentation of fish occasionally migrating over long distances and mixing with new groups. Our study used archaeology, history and ecology together to describe the decline of Atlantic sturgeon.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

While hospitals tracked cases and deaths within their walls, the broader picture of mortality across communities remained frustratingly incomplete. Policymakers and researchers quickly discovered a troubling pattern: Many deaths linked to the virus were never officially counted. Excess deaths, meaning those that exceed the number expected based on historical trends, serve as a key indicator of underreported deaths during health crises. In addition, lack of real-time tracking for medical interventions during those early days slowed vaccine development by delaying insights into which treatments worked and how people were responding to newly circulating variants. Five years since the beginning of COVID-19, new epidemics such as bird flu are emerging worldwide, and researchers are still finding it difficult to access the data about people’s deaths that they need to develop lifesaving interventions. Approximately 2.8 million death records are added to the U.S. mortality data system each year. Still, this figure is widely considered to be a major undercount of true excess deaths from COVID-19. In addition, real-time tracking of COVID-19 mortality data was severely lacking. Ideally, it provides up-to-date insights for decision-making, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, these tracking systems lagged and failed to generate comprehensive data. Without comprehensive data on prior COVID-19 infections, antibody responses and adverse events, researchers faced challenges designing clinical trials to predict how long immunity would last and optimize booster schedules. And as part of the broader U.S. vital records system, mortality data is essential for medical research, including evaluating public health programs, identifying health disparities and monitoring disease. These long-standing policies, such as reliance on paper-based death certificates and disjointed state-level reporting, have failed to keep pace with real-time data needs during crises such as COVID-19. The U.S. mortality data system has been cobbled together through a disparate patchwork of state and local governments, federal agencies and public health organizations over the course of more than a century and a half. It has been shaped by advances in public health, medical record-keeping and technology. However, these early efforts were inconsistent, as death registration was largely voluntary and varied widely across states. For example, the system required all U.S. states and territories to standardize their death certificate format. For example, states had no unifom timeline for submitting mortality data, resulting in some states taking months or even years to finalize and release death records. Local or state-level paperwork processing practices also remained varied and at times contradictory. To begin to close gaps in reporting timelines to aid medical researchers, in 1981 the National Center for Health Statistics – a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – introduced the National Death Index. This is a centralized database of death records collected from state vital statistics offices, making it easier to access death data for health and medical research. As time has passed, the National Death Index and state databases have become increasingly digital. The rise of electronic death registration systems in recent decades has improved processing speed when it comes to researchers accessing mortality data from the National Death Index. However, while the index has solved some issues related to gaps between state and federal data, other issues, such as high fees and inconsistency in state reporting times, still plague it. With the Trump administration’s increasing removal of CDC public health datasets, it is unclear whether policy reform for mortality data will be addressed anytime soon.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ongoing research has found that bad sleep could lead to numerous health problems, including heart disease. Dr. Julio Fernandez-Mendoza is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral health, neuroscience and public health sciences at Penn State College of Medicine. Julio Fernandez-Mendoza: Adults who report getting about seven to eight hours of sleep per night generally have the best health, in terms of both physical and mental health, and longevity. Adults over age 65 may need just six to seven hours of sleep per night. Fernandez-Mendoza: Our team was the first to show that those complaining about insomnia – difficulty falling or staying asleep – were more likely to have high blood pressure and be at risk for heart disease. These problems tend to show up before you develop heart disease. What about people who have more serious sleep problems? But people with a persistent sleep problem may need to make more behavioral changes. Research studies point to a set of six rules that can improve your sleep. You can follow these changes consistently in the short term, and then choose how to adapt them into your lifestyle down the road. First, get up at the same time no matter what. Second, do not use your bed for anything except sleep and sexual activity. Instead, get out of bed, go into another room if you can, and do an activity that’s enjoyable or relaxing. Fourth, get going with daily activities even after a poor night’s sleep. If you have chronic insomnia, don’t nap, sleep in, or doze during the day or evening even after poor sleep the previous night. And sixth, start with the amount of sleep you’re now getting – with the lowest limit at five hours – and then increase it weekly by 15 minutes. If they don’t work, see a provider who can help you. It’s not just the obvious physical, emotional and behavioral changes that occur during adolescence and puberty – there are changes in a teenager’s brain that can alter their sleep patterns. While it’s true that adolescents are more engaged at night because of their social relationships, there’s also biology behind why they want to stay up late – their internal clocks have shifted. School start times for most adolescents are at odds with that biological shift. So they don’t get enough sleep, which affects their performance in school. Research suggests that schools with later start times are more closely aligned with the science on child development and don’t put adolescents at risk by making them wake up earlier than their bodies are biologically inclined to. Set a time for kids to stop doing homework and put away electronics. Instead, they can watch TV with the family or read – something relaxing and enjoyable that will help them wind down before bed. You can also gradually move back their wake-up time. Don’t try to reshift them suddenly – for example, waking up a teenager at 5 a.m. like it’s the military – because that doesn’t work. If that doesn’t work, see a clinical provider. What kind of treatments can a sleep clinician provide? Some people may think a sleep provider just prescribes expensive medication, but that’s not true. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the first-line treatment recommended for insomnia.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/australias-pbs-means-consumers-pay-less-for-expensive-medicines-heres-how-this-system-works-252736'>Australia’s PBS means consumers pay less for expensive medicines. Here’s how this system works</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 12:27:39 <p>
The United States pharmaceutical lobby has complained to US President Donald Trump that Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is damaging their profits and has urged Trump to put tariffs on pharmaceutical imports from Australia. But what exactly is the PBS, and why does it matter? In the early 1900s, Australians had to pay for medicines out-of-pocket. Some could get free or cheap medicines at public hospitals or through Friendly Society Dispensaries, but otherwise access was restricted to those who could afford to pay. At the time, few effective medicines were available. After World War II, the federal government wanted to expand these powers but it encountered several constitutional roadblocks. A rare successful referendum in 1946 changed that, enabling the National Health Act 1953 to pass. This established the PBS as we know it today. Most are dispensed at community pharmacies (such as treatments for heart disease, the pill and antibiotics), but some more expensive ones are available at public hospitals or specialist treatment centres (such as chemotherapies and IVF medicines). Pharmacies then buy these medicines from wholesalers or companies. It’s evaluated for safety, efficacy and quality. A panel of experts (including doctors, pharmacists, epidemiologists, health economists, health consumer advocates and a pharmaceutical industry representative) recommends which medicines should be listed on the PBS, based on effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness and the total cost on the budget of the medicine versus alternative treatments. (If the panel rejects a medicine, companies may revise their application and re-submit.) When this happens, the medicine moves from F1 to F2. Generic medicine companies may offer pharmacists discounts on the PBS list price (for example, ten for the price of nine). Companies must disclose these discounts to the government, resulting in further price reductions. Many countries use similar assessments to determine whether governments should subsidise new medicines, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, Canada’s Drug Agency, and Pharmac in New Zealand. Small differences exist, including whether the list of medicines is a positive (and they’re subsidised) or negative (meaning they’re not subsidised), whether the lists are established at the central level (such as the PBS in Australia) or local level (such as by province in Canada) or a mixture, and how co-payments are set. Similar to its health system, the medicines system is a complex and decentralised mix of public and private organisations, including government agencies, independent organisations, health-care providers and payers such as health insurers. The PBS ensures all Australian patients have access to highly effective medicines. This has been achieved by keeping prices down for both F1 and F2 medicines. By doing so, it creates room in the government budget to fund other new medicines. Other benefits include having a level playing field for all medicines, while maintaining flexibility to fund highly effective medicines for patients with unmet needs. No system is without its drawbacks and risks. the high frequency of re-submissions and delays to PBS listing the ongoing lack of high-quality clinical evidence about medicines to treat rare diseases and certain patient populations, such as children. When PBS-listed brands aren’t available due to supply chain issues, other non-PBS listed brands may be available at full cost to the patient. Increased medicine costs can discourage patients from filling necessary prescriptions, which can have longer-term impacts on health and health expenditure. Finally, companies have argued Australia’s small market size plus low PBS prices can make it financially unviable to bring new medicines to Australia. The PBS is a crucial part of Australia’s health system, making essential medicines affordable, while keeping costs down. Like any system, it has its challenges and there is ongoing debate about whether and how the system should change.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The large numbers of pottery fragments from seventh century B.C. Now, an analysis of ancient pottery fragments indicates that Megiddo was indeed occupied by the Egyptians at that time, Israel Finkelstein , an archaeologist at the University of Haifa and Tel Aviv University, told Live Science. He said in an email that large numbers of Egyptian pottery fragments had been discovered alongside Greek pottery fragments in a layer dating to the late seventh century — a time when Egypt often employed Greek mercenaries alongside Egyptian troops. If he was there, as the Bible says, it's unclear if Josiah died from wounds he'd suffered during a battle against the Egyptians at Megiddo, or if he was executed there as a vassal of the pharaoh. Josiah's death was later said to foretell the fall of Jerusalem in 586 B.C.

The layer with Egyptian and Greek pottery fragments described in the latest study is among several layers that date from after 732 B.C., when records indicate Megiddo was conquered by the Neo-Assyrians under their king Tiglath-Pileser III. Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Megiddo Expedition and Sasha Flit/Tel Aviv University) The many fragments of Greek pottery found at Megiddo suggest a contingent of Greek mercenaries were stationed there alongside Egyptian troops. (Image credit: Megiddo Expedition and Yevgeni Ostrovsky/Ben-Gurion) The many Egyptian pottery fragments found in the same place indicate Megiddo was then under the military control of a force of Egyptian troops. There is debate among academics whether the encounter between Josiah and Necho at Megiddo in 609 B.C. was actually a battle, or if Necho had merely executed his vassal Josiah there—in other words, whether the southern Israelite kingdom of Judah was subordinate to Egypt at that time. Historian Jacob Wright , a professor of Hebrew Bible at Emory University who was not involved in the study, told Live Science that Josiah had probably traveled from Jerusalem to Megiddo to pay homage to Necho but was executed there for an unknown reason. Wright and Reinhard Kratz , a historian at the University of Göttingen in Germany who was also not involved in the study, both noted that the relevant verse in the Book of Kings says only that Josiah traveled to Megiddo and was "put to death" there — and that nothing was written about a battle until more than 100 years later in the Book of Chronicles. Finkelstein noted that Josiah was considered an exceptionally pious king, and that the idea of "Armageddon" had only begun after his death.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The parasitic infection that 'eats' your red blood cells</a></h2><b>Source:</b> livescience&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 11:00:00 <p>
Affected populations: Babesiosis is a rare and potentially fatal parasitic disease that destroys red blood cells, the cells that supply tissues with oxygen from the lungs . Causes: Babesiosis is caused by microscopic parasites that belong to the genus Babesia. These parasites usually infect cattle and are spread between animals by ticks that eat the blood of different hosts. Related: Tick-borne parasite is spreading in the Northeast, CDC says Once inside the body, Babesia parasites invade and destroy red blood cells. This severely limits the ability of these cells to supply tissues with oxygen. In the U.S., most babesiosis infections are caused by a parasite species called Babesia microti and are spread by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis), also known as deer ticks. These ticks are typically found in wooded, brushy or grassy areas. In rarer instances, Babesia parasites can be spread from one person to another via contaminated blood transfusions , and they can also spread from mother to fetus across the placenta. Symptoms usually emerge within one to four weeks of a person being infected with Babesia parasites, and they can last for several days after onset. Estimates for death rates from babesiosis vary considerably between studies. Treatments: Patients who don't have symptoms of babesiosis usually don't require treatment , as the immune system will typically clear the parasites away within one to two weeks . In symptomatic patients, the main treatment for babesiosis is a combination of antiparasitic drugs and antibiotics. The latter drugs are primarily used to treat bacterial infections, rather than parasitic infections, but certain kinds of antibiotics, such as clindamycin, can also be effective against parasites .</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Will there be drug shortages?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 10:27:13 <p>
Talks of a trade dispute between the United States and Australia over the cost of medicines have no doubt left many Australians scratching their heads. With all this talk of attacks on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), and the prospect of a tariff on Australian drugs entering the US, many will be wondering about two key issues. Does this mean the price of medicines will rise? And could any fall-out from the trade dispute lead to drug shortages? Let’s see how this could play out domestically. The PBS provides Australians with subsidised medicines, keeping out-of-pocket costs low for consumers. To receive the subsidy from Australian taxpayers all drug companies (not just US ones) must submit evidence to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) which assesses if the drug is cost-effective compared to existing alternatives. These price negotiations often involve confidential discounts and rebates, which can also cause delays in listing on the PBS and to people accessing them at the subsidised rate. US drug companies have recently labelled the PBS “egregious and discriminatory”. The PBS acts to keep prices low and so benefits consumers. So it is difficult to see how the US government could influence these specific negotiations between a private and often global pharmaceutical company and a sovereign government. That’s unless these issues are caught up in some larger trade or political deal. Both Labor and the Coalition have come out defending the PBS, saying it would not be a bargaining chip in any trade war. If Trump imposes tariffs, this will increase the prices of Australian drugs sold in the US relative to US manufactured drugs. For Australian patented drugs where there are no alternatives, this would hurt US consumers whose only option would be to pay higher prices and consume less. The demand for drugs manufactured in Australia would fall (by how much is uncertain), creating incentives for Australian manufacturers to become more efficient. This may mean moving manufacturing overseas in the long term to countries with lower tariffs or to increase marketing efforts in other countries. But this would not necessarily create new shortages of medicines in Australia. What if Australia retaliated with its own tariffs on US imported pharmaceuticals? Some 21% of our imported pharmaceuticals come from the US. Only then might tariffs influence price negotiations for listing on the PBS. This would be a bad idea for Australians’ access to innovative patented drugs. It’s difficult to know how these trade negotiations will play out and we’ll likely be hearing more about them in coming weeks. Overall, though, it is difficult to see how the US can influence the prices that Australians pay for pharmaceuticals, especially with the recent pre-election announcement of further reductions in drug costs for patients to $25.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

For over 40 years, the Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK, has waged an armed insurgency against Turkey, fighting for Kurdish rights and autonomy. But in late February, Abdullah Öcalan, the PKK’s imprisoned founder, called for the group to lay down its arms and dissolve itself. Days later, the PKK, which is labelled as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, Europe and the US, declared a ceasefire with Turkey. In this episode of The Conversation Weekly podcast, we speak to political scientist Pinar Dinc about what’s led to this moment and whether it could be the beginning of a lasting peace between Turkey and the Kurds. “Both groups recognise the necessity of addressing regional tensions.” Dinc says international support for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in north-eastern Syria, and its Rojava revolution, means that Turkey has been forced to recognise a new “Syrian Kurdish reality”. At the same time, she says, the Kurdish movement has also reached a limit in what it can achieve in an era of modern warfare. Now we see increased use of drones surveillance and advanced weaponry, and I think the PKK guerrillas in the Qandil mountains, what they refer to as the medya defence zones, they’re also realising that this is getting more and more difficult. Dinc says this is a real opportunity for a broader reconciliation process, but there will be real challenges in the detail of what it means for Turkey’s Kurdish population. The PKK is an outcome of structural problems arising from the longstanding oppression and marginalisation of Kurds in Turkey, and addressing these root causes is essential for achieving lasting peace.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/grattan-on-friday-dutton-says-he-could-handle-donald-trump-but-can-any-australian-pm-252511'>Grattan on Friday: Dutton says he could handle Donald Trump, but can any Australian PM?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 09:15:17 <p>
In the Trump age, how the next government, whether Labor or Coalition, will handle foreign affairs, defence and trade is shaping as crucially important. It’s a weird time when your friends become almost as problematic as your potential enemies, but that’s the situation we face. As many have observed, Donald Trump’s long shadow hangs over our election, at a time of multiple other uncertainties. So what face would a Peter Dutton government present to the world? He presented a mix of bipartisanship and differences with the government. Some of the latter weren’t so much fundamental disagreements as claims Labor had failed and the Coalition would be more competent or effective. Dutton says as prime minister he wouldn’t resile from taking on the United States when necessary. With fears about US drug companies spearheading a war on Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, he declared, “I will stand up and defend the PBS […] against any attempt to undermine its integrity, including by major pharmaceutical companies”. In arguing that, in general, he’d be able to deal with Trump, Dutton invoked the previous Coalition government’s success with Trump Mark 1 (though Mark 2 is very different), and the power of AUKUS to anchor relations. The question Australians should ask themselves is this: “Who is better placed to manage the US relationship and engage with President Trump?” I believe that […] I will be able to work with the Trump administration Mark 2 to get better outcomes for Australia. But, as he acknowledged, “Australia’s national interests do not always align perfectly with the interests of partners – even of our closest allies”. The way Trump is operating at the moment, it may be that a PM of either stripe will find him impossible on certain issues. Now, he is a mix of hawkish and dovish. It’s true things have changed greatly in Australia-China relations in recent times, but another reason for Dutton’s more nuanced position is highlighted by the line in his speech that “Australia has a remarkable Chinese diaspora”. Dutton now walks a line that is critical of China militarily, but anxious to promote and expand the now-restored trading relationship. On Ukraine, the Coalition and Labor are at one in their backing for President Volodymyr Zelensky, although Dutton criticises aspects of the government’s delivery of support. “Australia can’t afford the multibillion-dollar sustainment price tag for having troops based in an ill-defined and endless European presence,” Dutton said. The “multibillion-dollar” price tag was overegged, but many would agree there are sound arguments for not deploying Australian forces on such a venture. Dutton claims Labor “has viewed our relationship with Israel through a domestic policy lens and with a view to its political imperatives” – that is, the Muslim vote. One of Dutton’s “first orders of business” would be to call Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “help rebuild the relationship Labor has trashed”. Israel will be able to count on our support again in the United Nations. The Coalition repeatedly says Australia needs to spend more on defence. We need to do nothing short of re-thinking defence, re-tooling the ADF, and re-energising our domestic defence industry, and that’s exactly what our government will do. Would the Coalition be willing to go to around 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence spending, as the Trump administration wants? That would require a lot of sacrifice in other policy areas. The Australian Financial Review this week reported Coalition sources saying it is weighing up boosting defence spending to at least 2.5% by 2029. I don’t agree with some of the funding that they’ve withdrawn, and I think it is detrimental to the collective interests in the region, and I hope that there can be a discussion between our governments about a sensible pathway forward in that regard.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfires-help-fuel-ozone-pollution'>Wildfires and farm fertilizer use are fueling ozone pollution</a></h2><b>Source:</b> sciencenews&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 09:00:00 <p>
Images of California’s wildfires this winter speak for themselves about the fires’ devastating effects. Together with soil emissions, the fires are driving an increase in ground-level ozone pollution — causing a fundamental shift in our atmosphere’s chemistry, researchers say, and potentially rendering air pollution standards unmeetable. “We’re entering a new air pollution regime,” says Ian Faloona, an atmospheric chemist at University of California, Davis. These NOx emissions levels are now comparable with those from such human-made sources as cars and factories throughout the southwestern United States, Faloona says. He reported his initial findings January at the American Meteorology Society’s annual meeting in New Orleans. Ground-level ozone typically comes from other primary pollutants that react with sunlight and stagnant air. It has been linked to adverse health effects, including increased respiratory illness, reproductive problems, premature death and some cancers. Leveling off While ozone levels in different California air basins have dropped over the past few decades, they remain persistently above the EPA standard (red dashed line) for ambient air quality. That includes in both urban (San Diego) and more agricultural areas (like the Sacramento Valley). A new study teases out how wildfires and agricultural practices may be contributing to the problem. Previous research has shown how wildfire smoke wafting over cities can jump-start ozone production. And Dan Jaffe, a climatologist at the University of Washington in Bothell, Wash., recently showed that the number of days that exceed national air quality ozone thresholds doubles during high wildfire years. But how much wildfire smoke, along with fertilizer emissions, contributed to the problem was unknown. A steady decrease over the past z several decades has now stalled. Meanwhile, now-regulated automobile and industrial sources, which once accounted for as much as 15 to 20 ppb in mid-sized cities, now contribute under 6 ppb in most urban areas (excluding megapolises like Los Angeles). What emerges is that unregulated sources of ozone precursors from wildfires and agricultural soils are presently contributing as much to most urban areas in the U.S. Southwest as are traditional anthropogenic sources. Yet some of that data aren’t always figured into efforts to combat ozone. “If you’re holding the wrong person accountable for pollution they didn’t cause, our system breaks down,” Jaffe says.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/how-can-you-tell-if-your-childs-daycare-is-good-quality-252613'>How can you tell if your child’s daycare is good quality?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 06:15:31 <p>
This week, we heard claims of shocking abuse and neglect in Australian childcare centres on ABC’s Four Corners program. How can you tell if your child is going to a good quality childcare service? Read more: Amid claims of abuse, neglect and poor standards, what is going wrong with childcare in Australia? Australian’s childcare regulator – the Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority or ACECQA – oversees national quality standards for early childhood education and care. In some cases, they may note “significant improvement [is] required”. However, they may not reflect the current situation in a service. But there are other ways for parents to assess the quality of their child’s early childhood education. If early childhood educators want to work at your childcare service, this is a strong sign it is a good quality service. Excessive workloads, not being valued by employers and poor pay are some of the reasons early childhood educators leave their jobs. This is a huge problem, because high-quality staff are key to providing high-quality education and care, built on strong, stable relationships with children. Some daycare centres market themselves to parents by offering a “barista made” coffee in the morning, yoga classes and designer interiors. is there space to play outside, with natural materials? It is recommended toddlers and preschoolers are physically active for at least three hours per day Read more: Real dirt, no fake grass and low traffic – what to look for when choosing a childcare centre This is not about teaching children to read and do algebra before they start school. It is about supporting children to have positive play experiences, so the associated learning is fun and leaves children wanting to know (and do) more. Services should provide children with lots of opportunities to explore in age-appropriate ways. For example, toddlers may have a sandpit with multiple tools and toys. Sometimes they may act as a partner, helping to extend children’s imaginations. Other times, they may support from the sideline, encouraging a child to climb to a higher part of the climbing frame than yesterday. They should not be telling children what to do all the time. It’s important for children to be given the time and space to test out their theories about how the world works. Or are children given the chance to express their creativity? Or are toys required to be kept in certain places? Families should also receive clear, regular communication about their child’s development and progress. If there are issues with behaviour, the centre should provide evidence-based support that respects the rights and dignity of children (rather than punishing or shaming them). Finally, does your child seem to have fun at childcare? Provided there are no other issues (such as separation anxiety), do they want to go and see their educators and friends? If you have any concerns or need more information, try talking to your centre director first. Alternatively, you can contact the regulatory authority in your state or territory.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/cosmic-dark-energy-may-be-weakening-astronomers-say-raising-questions-about-the-fate-of-the-universe-252627'>Cosmic dark energy may be weakening, astronomers say, raising questions about the fate of the universe</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 03:46:50 <p>
The universe has been expanding ever since the Big Bang almost 14 billion years ago, and astronomers believe a kind of invisible force called dark energy is making it accelerate faster. In extreme scenarios, evolving dark energy could either accelerate the universe’s expansion to the point of tearing it apart in a “Big Rip” or cause it to collapse inward in a “Big Crunch”. First discovered in 1998, dark energy is a kind of essence that seems to permeate space and make the universe expand at an ever-increasing rate. Another 25% is invisible dark matter than can only be detected indirectly. DESI’s results are not the only thing that gives us clues about dark energy. We can also look at evidence from a kind of exploding stars called Type Ia supernovae, and the way the path of light is warped as it travels through the universe (so-called weak gravitational lensing). They do not directly measure dark energy or how it evolves, but they provide clues about the universe’s structure and energy content — helping to test dark energy models when combined with other data. When the new DESI results are combined with all this cosmological data, we see hints that dark energy is more complicated than we thought. It seems dark energy may have been stronger in the past and is now weakening. By mapping galaxies, we can detect subtle patterns in their large-scale distribution called baryon acoustic oscillations. By tracking these patterns over time, DESI can map how the universe’s expansion rate has changed. DESI is only halfway through a planned five-year survey of the universe, releasing data in batches as it goes. The new results are based on the second batch of data, which includes measurements from more than 14 million galaxies and brightly glowing galactic cores called quasars. This dataset spans a cosmic time window of 11 billion years — from when the universe was just 2.8 billion years old to the present day. Results from the first batch of data gave a hint that dark energy might not behave like a simple cosmological constant — but it wasn’t strong enough to draw firm conclusions. Now, the second batch of data has made this evidence stronger. However, no combination of data so far meets the typical “five sigma” statistical threshold physicists use as the marker of a confirmed new discovery. Still, the fact this pattern is becoming clearer with more data suggests that something deeper might be going on. If dark energy grows stronger over time, the universe could face a “Big Rip” scenario, where galaxies, stars, and even atoms are torn apart by the increasing expansion rate. DESI aims to collect data from a total of 40 million galaxies and quasars. Future DESI releases and independent cosmological experiments will be crucial in determining whether this represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of the universe. If dark energy is found to be dynamic, it could require new physics beyond Einstein’s theory of general relativity and open the door to new models of particle physics and quantum gravity.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A national energy strategy for Aotearoa New Zealand was meant to be ready at the end of last year. As it stands, we’re still waiting for a cohesive, all-encompassing plan to meet the country’s energy demand today and in the future. The next step should be greater renewable electrification of all sectors. However, questions remain about the cradle-to-grave implications of investments in these renewable resources. We have conducted life-cycle assessments of several renewable electricity generation technologies, including wind and solar, that the country is investing in now. Both indicate that overall demand for electricity could nearly double by 2050. One study suggests the power generation capacity will potentially need to increase threefold over this period. Other modelling efforts project current capacity will need to increase 13 times, especially if we want to decarbonise all sectors and export energy carriers such as hydrogen. This is, of course, because we want all new generation to come from renewable resources, with much lower capacity factors (the percentage of the year they deliver power) associated with their variability. Following the termination of work on a proposed pumped hydro project, other options need investigating. Offshore wind projects are on the horizon, too, but have been facing challenges such as proposed seabed mining in the same area and a lack of price stabilisation measures typical in other jurisdictions. Our analysis indicates wind (onshore and offshore) and distributed solar will make an almost equal contribution to power generation by 2050, with a slightly larger share by utility-scale solar. The main goal is to maintain a stable grid with secure and affordable electricity supply. But there are other sustainability considerations associated with what happens at the end of renewable technologies’ use and where their components come from. We have also investigated the materials intensity of taking up these technologies in Aotearoa New Zealand, and discussed the greater dependence on those supply chains. We have undertaken comprehensive life-cycle assessments, based on international standards, of the recently commissioned onshore Harapaki wind farm, a proposed offshore wind farm in the South Taranaki Bight, a utility-scale solar farm in Waikato and distributed solar photovoltaic systems, with and without batteries, across the country. GWP: global warming potential (carbon emissions during a technology’s life cycle per energy unit delivered). CED: cumulative energy demand over the life cycle of a technology. A value of more than ten is generally viewed as positive. Because of New Zealand’s already low-emissions grid, the carbon payback time is around three to seven years for utility-scale generation. But for small-scale, distributed generation it can be up to 13 years. Utility-scale wind and solar being commissioned now have an operational life of 30 years but are typically expected to be refurbished. This means their energy return on investment is becoming comparable to hydropower.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The foul stench of penguin poop sets Antarctic krill on edge. The stink also seemed to suppress krill’s appetites. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) form a cornerstone of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Understanding the critters’ movements could help identify key areas for marine conservation. Krill use their antennae to sniff out food, mates and even pollution. But scientists weren’t sure if they could detect predators by scent. “Penguin crap is the most vile thing you can imagine,” Fields says. Just opening guano storage bags “would clear the entire lab space.” But in water with algae and guano, the krill zigzagged, Hellessey says. Krill in buckets with penguin poop ate only about 25 percent. But since Adélie penguins’ diets are over 99 percent krill, “a lot of that guano would have crushed-up krill sort of scents,” Hellessey suspects. Some chemical cue might make the krill go, “‘Oh my god, my buddy’s hurt, I shouldn’t go over there.’”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has indicated a Coalition government would quickly approve a giant gas project off Western Australia which will release billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases until around 2070. Woodside Energy is leading the joint venture, which would dramatically expand offshore drilling and extend gas production at the North West Shelf project – already Australia’s largest gas-producing venture. In a statement on Wednesday, Dutton said a Coalition government would “prioritise Western Australian jobs and the delivery of energy security” by directing environment officials to fast-track assessment of the extension, later saying “we will make sure that this approval is arrived at in 30 days”. Mining and business interests have been pushing her to make a decision this month. Evidence suggests extending the project would undermine global efforts to curb carbon emissions and stabilise Earth’s climate. The extension also threatens significant Indigenous sites and pristine coral reef ecosystems. Federal approval of the project puts both natural and heritage assets at risk. The project currently comprises offshore extraction facilities and an onshore gas-processing plant at Karratha. Greenhouse gases – such as methane, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide – are emitted throughout the gas/LNG production process. Emissions are also created when the gas is burned for energy or used elsewhere in manufacturing. However, Australia’s greatest contribution to global emissions occurs when our coal and gas is burned overseas. The North West Shelf project is already a major emitter of greenhouse gases. Woodside estimates the expansion will create 4.3 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases over its lifetime. Increasing greenhouse gas emissions at this magnitude, when the window to climate stability is fast closing, threatens major damage to Earth’s natural systems, and human health and wellbeing. Woodside says it will use carbon-capture and storage to reduce emissions from the project. Woodside proposes to reduce the project’s climate impacts by buying carbon offsets. This involves compensating for a company’s own emissions by paying for cuts to greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere, through activities such as planting trees or generating renewable energy. However, there are serious doubts over whether carbon offset projects deliver their promised benefits. The reef is home to thousands of plant and animal species. Scientists say the project threatens migrating whales and endangered turtles, among other marine life. Traditional Owners suffered severe cultural loss in the 1980s when about 5,000 rock art pieces were damaged or removed during construction of Woodside’s gas plant. The Albanese government has failed to deliver its promised reform of Australia’s national environment laws. This means nature lacks the strong laws needed to protect it from harmful development. At federal, state and territory levels, both major parties support expansion of the gas industry. In the current term of government, Plibersek has green-lit numerous polluting projects. No federal government should prioritise short-term economic gain over Earth’s climate and human health.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-did-multicellular-life-evolve-20250320/'>How Did Multicellular Life Evolve?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> quantamagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 00:00:00 <p>
Cells existed, functioned and reproduced as free-living individuals. Some cells joined forces, working together instead of being alone. This transition, known as multicellularity, was a pivotal event in the history of life on Earth. Multicellularity enabled greater biological complexity, which sparked an extraordinary diversity of organisms and structures. How life evolved from unicellular to multicellular organisms remains a mystery, though evidence indicates that this may have occurred multiple times independently. To understand what could have happened, Will Ratcliff at Georgia Tech has been conducting long-term evolution experiments on yeast in which multicellularity develops and emerges spontaneously. In this episode of The Joy of Why podcast, Ratcliff discusses what his “snowflake yeast” model could reveal about the origins of multicellularity, the surprising discoveries his team has made, and how he responds to skeptics who question his approach. All episodes Your browser does not support the audio element. JANNA LEVIN: Hey Steve, how you doing out there? This is gonna be a really exciting season and I’m so thrilled that we’re doing it together. And you’re kicking it off this season. And the topic was one I had never thought about before, I wonder if you’ve run across it. LEVIN: Well, I found it fascinating that single-celled organisms waffled for so long on the Earth. STROGATZ: But, so, I think of you thinking more about, like, black holes, space time, astrophysical stuff, but why are you thinking about this? I like the science that other people are doing too. And sometimes I just wanna hear about it. That single-celled critters, like we had bacteria, maybe cyanobacteria in the oceans, taking them a long time to get their act together to go multicellular. Right, I mean if you ask about astrobiology, is that happening on other planets? STROGATZ: And did it only happen just once? And apparently, and this came as a shocker to me, it did not just happen once, it happened something like 50 times independently. LEVIN: Yeah, why am I the last to know? STROGATZ: Well, I think when we were in high school and they were teaching us biology, they didn’t know that. But it’s now understood that, you know, in all these different kingdoms or whatever they call them in biology — so whether it’s animals, plants, fungi — they all figured out their own way to do it, to go multicellular. But in any case, one question then is how does a unicellular organism manage to make this transition, in any of these cases? I mean, there’s the historical question of ‘How did it happen?’, but what’s so amazing and really very courageous about our guest — Will Ratcliff is his name, he’s a biologist at Georgia Tech — is that he wants to do this in the lab. He wants to induce a multicellularity transition in a single-celled organism that we’ve all heard of — yeast — like the yeast in making beer or bread rising, whatever, which normally lives as a eukaryotic, single-celled organism. Are they trying to be a multicellular organism in their own right? LEVIN: Well, I really hope that stays in the lab. LEVIN: I don’t want it coming out of my kitchen sink drain, you know, like one of those crazy cyclops fungi. That’s not where the episode is going. But as we’ll hear from Will, it is controversial. There are colleagues of his who feel what he’s doing is irrelevant to the history of life on Earth, that he’s just doing something in the lab, and it may be telling us very little about what happened in real biology. It’s opening up a realm of possibilities for us to explore. But, still, it shows us what biology is capable of. WILL RATCLIFF: Hey Steve, how’s it going? I’m really excited to have you on the show today. Can we begin by talking about your hobby farm? RATCLIFF: I think it mainly means that we spend much more money than we would ever gain from any proceeds from the farm. We have peacocks, which haven’t hit maturity yet, so my neighbors are still okay with them. STROGATZ: So, in addition to raising animals and plants though, you do, as we’re going to be talking about today, raise yeast. But before we get to that, could we just talk about, more broadly, the question of unicellular life versus multicellular life? RATCLIFF: Yeah, so, you know, life on Earth has a very long history. And by then, we had honest-to-goodness cells, with the things that you’ve probably learned about in your high school biology class, right. And so, cells are these fantastic biological machines, right, in which you have this concentrated soup of highly functional macromolecules. And once sort-of cells evolved, they really took off, and it has been the sort-of basic building block of life for the last three-and-a-half billion years. Multicellular organisms are a kind of organism that is built upon the basis of cells, but where many cells live within one group and function essentially collectively. So, we are a multicellular organism, we contain approximately 40 trillion cells, which divide labor and perform all these various functions to allow us to do things in the multicellular, you know, environment — run around, have eyes, see things, talk on podcasts — that wouldn’t be possible for single-celled organisms, right? And it’s evolved, not once or twice, but many times. But there’s at least 50 independent transitions to multicellularity that we know of. That’s not something I remember hearing in my high school biology class. That’s something we only figured out, what, in the past few decades? RATCLIFF: Uh, yeah, I think it’s been a gradually increasing number. But I think as people, we tend to be very animal-centric, but then there’s a whole slew of things that are a little bit more esoteric. There’s cellular slime molds that live on land that, you know, move around like a slug, and then will grow as single cells and come together, like a transformer, to then do something as a group, you know. And I think partly we’ve known about this for a while, but especially as we develop the tools to understand bacteria and archaea — the big domains of single-cell life that have been around for a very long time — we’re finding more and more types of multicellular bacteria and archaea that we just didn’t know existed, because, unless you’re looking at them with a high-powered microscope or using other advanced techniques, you can’t just see it, right? STROGATZ: So, one thing I was wondering about here is dates. RATCLIFF: We have reasons to think that cellular life exists around three-and-a-half billion years ago, and Earth is only four-and-a-half billion years old total. But it probably happened earlier, and by that time they’ve already done the things that are required to evolve cells, and have all these basic building blocks of life, like DNA, which contains the, sort-of, code of the organism. Yeah, this is very helpful, because there are so many interesting transitions to talk about, each of them being astonishing. You know, the origin of life from non-life would be one. And, if I’m hearing you right, that is not quite what we’re talking about. The evolution of multicellularity is broader than just animals. It’s a process, through which lineages that are single-celled can form groups, which then become units of adaptation. Evolutionary units that can get more complex through, you know, natural selection. And the Cambrian explosion is an incredible period where animals, which had already been around for probably 100 million years or more, just start to figure out all of these innovations which are hallmarks of extant animals. They don’t have any of these things. And we think it’s probably due to these, like, ecological arms races, where you have predators attacking prey. So, you know, you have just this explosion of animal complexity in what appears to be a very short period of time in geological terms. STROGATZ: But that Cambrian explosion, when the animals start to figure out all these evolutionary innovations, that’s later, right? So, cyanobacteria were evolving multicellularity with honest-to-goodness development and cell differentiation around 3 billion years ago. It doesn’t take that long after you get cells that you start to get multicellular organisms evolving. The green algae start doing it around then too. Animals, they really start to take off around 600 million years ago. Again, it’s really hard to put an accurate date on that, so we have to be, sort of you know, hedgy. And then the brown algae — the most complex kelp — they actually only began evolving in multicellularity around 400 million years ago. We want to understand how initially dumb clumps of cells… can evolve into increasingly complex multicellular organisms, with new morphologies, cell-level integration, division of labor, and differentiation. And you know, I think we should not think of it as one process, but something where there are ecological niches available for multicellular forms, and there has to be a benefit to forming groups and evolving large size. And most of the time, there isn’t, but occasionally there will be an opportunity for a lineage to begin exploring that ecology and not be inhibited by something else that’s already in that space. That might be why something like animals has only evolved once, because once you already have an animal, then it suppresses any other innovation to that space, like a first-mover advantage. STROGATZ: So, what are the benefits and what are the things that would inhibit you from that transition? So, John Tyler Bonner is an evolutionary biologist, who worked on multicellularity decades ago, and he has this quote that I really like, that there’s always room one step up on the size scale, right? So, you know, the ecology of single-celled organisms, that’s a niche that’s been battled over for billions of years. And there’s lots of ways to make a living in that space and that’s why we are in a world of microbes. If you imagine that you’re, you know, an algae growing on a rock in a stream, single-celled algae will get the light but, hey, if something can form groups, now they’re intercepting that resource before it gets to you. Or, you know, groups also have advantages when it comes to motility and even division of labor and trading resources between cells. So, there’s many different reasons to become multicellular. And there isn’t just one reason why a lineage would evolve multicellularity. But what you need for this transition to occur is those reasons have to be there, and that benefit has to persist long enough that the lineage sort of stabilizes in a multicellular state and doesn’t just go back to being single-celled or die out. You can imagine there’s lots of ephemeral reasons to become multicellular, and then they go away, and then the single-celled competitors just win again, right? I actually took biology with John Tyler Bonner. STROGATZ: He was a very sweet man too. But I’m bringing it up, not just to tell my own story, but because I get the feeling you’re some kind of math, physics, computer-ish kind of person. But you’re right that we use all of those different approaches. My longest running collaborators are with a physicist at Georgia Tech, Peter Junker, and a mathematician in Sweden, named Eric Libby, who is a theorist, and I’ve been working with both of them for 10 to 15 years. We also throw synthetic biology into that pot, which is one of the beautiful things about working with yeast. You’ve probably said it already but, what is the big idea underlying research you’ve been doing now for some years? RATCLIFF: Big picture, we want to understand how initially dumb clumps of cells, cells that are one or two mutations away from being single-celled, don’t really know that they’re organisms — they don’t have any adaptations to being multicellular, they’re just a dumb clump — how those dumb clumps of cells can evolve into increasingly complex multicellular organisms, with new morphologies, with cell-level integration, division of labor, and differentiation amongst the cells. Just like, we want to watch that process of how do these simple groups become complex. And this is, like, one of the biggest knowledge gaps in evolutionary biology. But it’s something where, you know, we can use the comparative record. We know multicellularities evolved dozens of times, and the only truly long-term evolution experiments we’ll have access to are these ones that happened on Earth over the last hundreds of millions or billions of years. But because they’re so old, and because those early progenitors, those early transitional steps, aren’t really preserved, we don’t really know the process through which simple groups evolve into increasingly complex organisms. So, what we’re doing in the lab is, we are evolving new multicellular life using in-laboratory directed evolution over multi-10,000 generation timescales, to watch how our initially simple groups of cells — dumb clumps of cells — figure out some of these fundamental challenges. How can you make that one genome be used for different purposes in different cells to underpin new behaviors at the multicellular level? Does this thing become entrenched in a multicellular state which prevents it from ever going back, or at least going back easily, to being single-celled? And so, we’re watching this stuff occur with a long-term evolution experiment, which, we’re now on generation 9,000 of what we call the Multicellularity Long-Term Evolution Experiment… M.U.L.T.E.E… MuL-TEE… absolutely a pun. It’s also named in homage of the long-term evolution experiment, which is a 70,000 and counting generation experiment with single-celled E. coli, started by Rich Lenski and now run by Jeff Barrick. So, we’re basically trying to do something similar, but in the context of understanding how multicellular organisms evolve from scratch. How they can, sort of, co-opt basic physics and bootstrap their way to becoming organisms. And I’m sure your critics would say hubris or you’re playing God or, you know, but still, this is a wild idea to try to make multicellularity happen in the lab. So, what are you doing to encourage this transition? So, you know, we start out with a single-celled yeast. We did some preliminary experiments where we evolved them in an environment — it’s just a test tube that’s being shaken in incubator — where it’s good to grow fast, because they have access to sugar water, and the faster you eat the sugar water, the more babies you can make. And it’s, you know, scramble competition, everyone has access to the same food. And here, there’s an advantage to being big, because big groups sink faster through liquid media than small groups. This is just due to, you know, surface area-to-volume scaling relationships. Bigger groups will have more, you know, gravity pulling them down relative to the friction from their surface. They go to fresh media and you just, kind of, keep repeating this very simple process. If you remove oxygen, now bigger is better. So, yeast have a budding mechanism, where a mother cell will pop off a baby, from one of their poles, and then they can keep dividing and adding new cells to the same cell, right? So, in our early experiments that were just open-ended, we got these simple groups forming that have this beautiful fractal geometry. We had this easy mutation — it turns out it’s just one mutation in a regulatory element of the cell — that prevents daughter cells from separating. Every time the cells divide, they pop off a baby but remain attached. And so, you get this sort of growing fractal branching pattern. They kind of look like that, and they end up becoming more spherical with these you know nice branches. And they even have a genetic bottleneck in this life cycle, in that the base of the branch that came off is one cell. So, as mutations arise, they get segregated between groups, and every group is basically clonal. There’s a lot of things going on. RATCLIFF: That’s the key thing for forming simple groups, correct, yep. So, we figured out what this mutation was, and when we started our long-term evolution experiment, we started them with basically one genotype, so one clone, that already had this mutation engineered into it, but with replicate populations. Because what we want to understand is, how do these simple groups of cells evolve to become more complex? And I don’t want that to be confounded by the mechanism through which they form groups in the first place. So, we have actually 15 parallel evolving populations, that started out the same in the beginning, but we actually have different metabolic treatments for them. So, one of them, is taking all their sugar, and they are burning it up with aerobic respiration, using air from the environment to respire their sugar. One of them, we broke their mitochondria in the very beginning, so they don’t get to use respiration, they can only ferment, and they get a much lower energetic payoff from that. But they don’t have to worry about oxygen diffusion anymore. So, when you spoke of 15 different lines, they all have the property that their daughters will stay attached. But then you say some get to use oxygen, in this advantageous way for their metabolism through respiration, others have to use fermentation. RATCLIFF: Which is how you make beer, by the way. And then you said some of them, at least, don’t have to worry about oxygen diffusion. What is the scary thing about oxygen diffusion? But it turns out that they’ve actually stayed very simple for almost 10,000 generations. They haven’t done that much in the last 8,950 generations. RATCLIFF: They peaked early, and they’re only about six times bigger than the ancestor, and we don’t see any beginnings of cell differentiation. They’re just simple kind of bigger snowflakes. If you form a body, and oxygen is this valuable resource that if you get it you can grow a lot more, but it can’t diffuse very far into the organism, then all of a sudden, the bigger you are, the smaller a proportion of your cells are able to access this really valuable resource, and your growth rate just falls off a cliff. And so, in our case, the anaerobic line, they’ve done the interesting things because they’re not being constrained by oxygen. And they’re solving all these fundamental multicellular problems. STROGATZ: If I’m hearing you right, you’re saying something like that the anaerobic ones, because they don’t get this a sugar high from the availability of oxygen early on, they have to be resourceful. RATCLIFF: So yeah, I like the way you phrased that, but to be just a little bit more precise with our system. RATCLIFF: The ones that have access to oxygen, as they get bigger and bigger, their slower and slower growth rates really push back against them, and kind of act in the opposite direction of any benefits that come from size. But if you remove oxygen, now bigger is better. And then they figure out a way to get bigger. And they can really push the envelope on size and explore large size in a way that the ones with oxygen can’t, because they’re getting pushed back on by growth rate. But then as they get bigger and tougher, they actually start to have real trade-offs that are created by forming big bodies. You know, they’re bigger than fruit flies now. I mentioned that they grow and would normally break due to physical strain arising from packing problems. But they solve that, by figuring out how to make tough bodies, by making their cells long enough that they actually wrap around one another and entangle. This is now a vining procedure where, if you break one branch of a vine, you know, the ivy is still not coming off your shed. I live in Atlanta, I’m tugging ivy on trees and sheds all the time and it’s very difficult, because entanglement percolates those forces throughout the entire, you know, entangled structure. And we even understand the genetic basis of this, all the way up to the physics, it’s really cool to be able to watch mutations arising that change the properties of cells that underpin emergent multicellular changes, which natural selection can see and can act upon, and can, sort-of, drive innovation in that multicellular space. Because he’s got this hypothesis going on, on the basis of what we believe about the importance of oxygen, and we even talk about it when we’re looking for other planets and life on other planets. And all this stuff that we’re really so certain is what’s needed to really accelerate life and life radiating. You have these oxygen hogs that got stuck. STROGATZ: Oh, I love your exobiology perspective on this. I don’t know what to make of it. Evolution, as they always remind me, is not just mutation. STROGATZ: Welcome back to The Joy of Why. STROGATZ: I’d like to get into a question about clusters versus organisms. What would make an organism different than a colony? And it really cuts to the core of what do we mean by multicellularity. And I think a lot of confusion in my field, for the last half a century, has come down to poorly resolved questions of philosophy about what do we mean by these words, and people inadvertently speaking at cross purposes. Okay, so part of this is that the word multicellular really means three different things, and we’re not very clear with our language. It’s treated as a noun in English to say, you know, multicellularity, but it’s really an adjective which modifies different nouns. You could have a multicellular Darwinian individual, and that is a multicellular group which participates in the process of evolution as an entity at the group level. So, something which reproduces, where mutations can arise which generate novelty in a multicellular trait, and which natural selection can act on and cause evolutionary change in a population of groups. And the sort of philosophical distinctions of what’s an individual and what’s an organism, there’s been a lot of work done in the last 20 years, and I’m pretty happy with the results of where that field is right now, which is that organisms are functional units. Organisms have integration of parts and work well at the organismal level with, you know, high-function minimal-conflict. And so, the distinction is that are, sort of, progressively higher bars for how you get to these additional steps, and they tend to occur sequentially. The first step would be forming a group. The second step would be making that group capable of Darwinian evolution. And so, a trait that would be diagnostic of that would be cellular specialization or differentiation, especially if it comes down to reproductive specialization. People love that in evolutionary biology because if cells give up their direct reproduction, they’re no longer making offspring, that’s something which is a behavior that you really can’t ascribe to the direct fitness interests of that cell, right? So, your skin cells will never make a new Steve, right? And so, the vast majority of our cells are not directly on the line of descent, but that is a derived state. A lot of confusion in my field, for the last half a century, has come down to poorly resolved questions of philosophy. Originally, simple groups don’t have this kind of reproductive specialization. But over millions of generations of multicellular adaptation, you get organisms that have, now, cellular parts, where those parts work together to allow the organism to do things that it couldn’t have done before, and an important part of that is specialization. STROGATZ: Just to make sure I get that point. What does it mean to be in the line of descent, in relation to skin cells versus what, like gonadal cells? And this isn’t a strict requirement, right? And that’s how you, kind of, square it. STROGATZ: I mean, when you start talking about Darwinian adaptation at the level of the group, I hear Richard Dawkins’s British accent in my ear, drilling in that there’s no selection except at the level of the gene. And then if it were Stephen Jay Gould talking to me, he would say there’s no selection except at the level of the individual. I’m oversimplifying, but group selection is where people traditionally start yelling at you. You’re totally right, and I think there should be some sociological studies on this in evolutionary biology, because it has been much more, do you believe the consensus rather than, like, actually rigorously thinking through it. And in the last 15, 20 years, I’d say the anti-group selection sentiment, that was very powerful all the way up through the 2000s, has mostly melted away, as people have embraced more pluralistic philosophies that, like, there is sort of one evolutionary process, you can view it through different perspectives, sometimes it makes more sense to use a group selection model. And, I think if we’re thinking about individuals, in this, in the Gould sense, selection acting on the traits of individuals, for multicellular organisms those individuals are groups. I mean, the individual is made of other things. RATCLIFF: Yes, and people are happy to sort-of round them up to just one, but there was a point where it wasn’t just one. It was a simple group, and it wasn’t so clear that that group was an individual. Like a snowflake yeast, you can break off any cell, put it into its own flask of media, and it’ll turn back into another snowflake yeast, right? That wouldn’t happen with one of my arm cells. Now, if you go for a really long time in my experiment, that stops happening. They don’t do so well as being outside of groups anymore. This is unpublished work, so I want to be appropriately hedged here. But we’ve done like single-cell RNA sequencing, and we can see new cell states evolving over the five thousand-generation timescale. We go from one, sort of, putative cell type to three. STROGATZ: If this pans out, it’s saying that the cells have differentiated in their gene expression. But, to what extent do we think these multicellular transitions that you’re provoking shed any light on what happened historically in the wild? It’s something I’ve thought a lot about, in the sense that in order for our experiments to have meaning, they need to be somewhat generalizable. You know, it’s not a single thing. But nonetheless, the thing that does unite it all is this evolutionary process. You have to have group formation, those groups become units of selection, and they turn into organisms as a consequence of group adaptation. And that evolutionary process, while it might play out in different ways in different lineages, some of these things are fundamental. And size is universal, and the physical side-effects that come with size, scaling laws, challenges with diffusion, and the opportunities that come to break those trade-offs through innovations, those things are all generalizable, even if they take different paths in different lineages, because they’re all proximate creatures of their environment and their gene pool, right? And we’ve never seen those processes play out in nature. And I don’t know that we ever will, because they’re historical things that we don’t have the actual samples to see it. And one of the things that we can do is, while we’re not saying this is how multicellularity evolved in any one lineage, what we’re saying is this is how multicellularity can evolve, and this is how some of these things that, maybe looking in hindsight, you think you need really complex developmental control… oh, actually it turns out you don’t, because physics gives you all these things for free, that are kind of noisy, but they work, and you can bootstrap those into your evolutionary life cycle and build upon them, without necessarily having to evolve those traits for a reason. So, a lot of things in our experiment have turned out to be easier than we expected, and while the details may differ, I suspect that some version of these things that we’re seeing in our experiment play out in the different transitions in nature. STROGATZ: You seem to have some practice with answering that question. You have thought about that one a lot. You mentioned earlier, a scientist named Rich Lenski, who had done this very long-term evolution experiment with bacteria, and that that’s been passed on now. Do you have a Jeff Barrick lined up? You’re not quite close to retirement, yet I don’t suppose. But, first of all, I want to say I’d be remiss if I didn’t say that our experiment is actually run in my lab by Ozan Bozdag, who’s a research scientist with me, who started the MuLTEE as a postdoc in 2016. So, like, without Ozan, I wouldn’t be here and doing this. He’s the one that, kind-of, figured out how to really make it work. I’d actually be interested in doing this a little bit differently perhaps than the way the LTE has been run, which is, I want to run the standard MuLTEE myself, but I wouldn’t mind doing like a multiverse-type thing and have collaborators or others that were interested in running their own version of the experiment. There’s no reason that it has to be one timeline. I mean, you know, we could go all Loki. STROGATZ: I see, separate universes doing the experiment. RATCLIFF: Sure, I mean, we already have kits that we send to teachers, where they can evolve their own snowflake yeast, or do experiments with predators. We’re actually making a new kit this summer for these hydrodynamic-flow behaviors that we’ve been observing that snowflake yeast actually act like volcanoes or sea sponges, pulling nutrients through their bodies and shooting them up at the center of the group, which totally overcomes diffusion limitation. But also, if scientists want to work on our system, then, I think, if we democratize this and make it a resource for the community, science benefits, right? STROGATZ: So, you’ve been very good about responding to what are some aggressive questions here. I felt mostly like good vibes from the broader community for many years now. Like Carl Zimmer had interviewed me for the New York Times, and then got a bunch of critiques, and then re-interviewed me and I, as a postdoc, had to like defend myself to very senior faculty that I really looked up to. And, um, that didn’t feel very good. It felt sort of, like, I wasn’t welcome in those communities where it seemed like at the time, maybe, we were just bullshitting and trying to spin a good story, and there wasn’t much substance there. That definitely affected my own approach to science, and my own thoughts on inclusion and just being really supportive of younger scientists. Anytime you critique a paper in my field, you might think you’re critiquing the senior scientists on the paper, but they usually have a graduate student or a postdoc who wrote the thing. Like, I hang out with physicists and mathematicians. And similarly, like, in the context of multicellularity, I’m always trying to bring new people into the field. Like, we’re pluralists, we want new people to come in, we want you to bring your systems and your ideas, there isn’t just one way of thinking about this. And I had a polished answer, and that’s because I’ve been challenged on this enough times over the last 15 years that I had to really think hard about that, right? And certainly thinking hard about it changes the way you do your science, right? You develop the areas that you think are more general and more impactful, as opposed to just doing the next experiment. That being said, the criticisms, the sharp and penetrating criticisms I’ve always appreciated, because that makes your science better. Because, you know, if someone says, and I’ve gotten this a lot, “It’s cool what you do, but snowflake yeast aren’t multicellular”. Like, there isn’t just one thing here, right? So, maybe in the future you can just play this for some of those people. STROGATZ: Anyway, it’s been really a great pleasure talking to you. So, we had Will Ratcliff with us, talking about the evolution of multicellularity, and it has really been fun. Do you have any personal experiences with that, or maybe you’ve seen it with your own students? I’m still a student of the subject, and even now, it really resonated in that, it can be very discouraging if someone’s dismissive. It’s okay if somebody’s, like, really critical and you’re exploring together, and you’re gonna get to the answer. But to be dismissive, that is something that, it’s not only hard to hear, it sort of engenders a little bit of distrust, I think. You feel like, I don’t trust that person so much anymore? LEVIN: When I hear people being dismissive, it doesn’t have to just be at me, I get a little suspicious. STROGATZ: Uh-huh, like they have another agenda about self-promotion or something else? I wanna get a letter of review from him. I want him to review one of my papers. STROGATZ: Something about his phrasing that, to be dismissed is not productive. I thought that was such an interesting operational word to use. And it could take the wind out of your sails, because then there isn’t anything to discuss. If you have something to hang onto and a point to respond to with a compelling, rational, mathematical, formal, experimental argument, whichever avenue is required, that you can keep going. STROGATZ: It doesn’t help you be a better scientist. It doesn’t help you make new discoveries, to just be dismissed like that. STROGATZ: I can’t wait to do the next one. You can also leave a review for the show, it helps people find this podcast.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://undark.org/2025/03/20/opinion-toxic-relationship-herbicides/'>Our Toxic Relationship with Herbicides</a></h2><b>Source:</b> undark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 00:00:00 <p>
I had taken part in invasive plant removals for years, both throughout Athens and in my hometown in Wisconsin, but all of those removals had been done by hand, with painstaking hours spent pulling up seedlings, cutting vines off trees, and chopping down shrubs. As I held the bottle of glyphosate — stained blue so that we could see where it was sprayed — a flurry of thoughts raced through my brain: “I’m here to help the environment — don’t herbicides cause harm? We were removing heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica), an invasive shrub commonly used in landscaping whose berries are poisonous to native birds. But, as with many other invasive plants, the stump and root-sprouting ability of Nadina meant that leaves would reappear within a year. Invasive plants wreak havoc on ecosystems by outcompeting native species, often forming dense stands of nothing but the invader. Learning about herbicides has convinced me that although my initial concerns were valid, herbicides currently offer the best hope we have to control invasive plants. Herbicides need not be used in all situations: Some plants are effectively controlled through mowing, burning, or the use of natural pests. In small areas, hand pulling plants can be enough for local eradication, though this takes dedication. (I’m on year three of yanking Chinese privet regrowth in my backyard.) But in most cases, these other options aren’t effective or the invasive plant covers too much land to be controlled by labor-intensive methods. When an invasive plant grows over multiple acres — as I’ve seen with my study subject, cogongrass — herbicide application can be done by one person in mere hours, compared with the days it would take people to pull plants by hand. Using herbicides drastically reduces the amount of people and time needed to manage invasive plants, increasing our chance of making a meaningful dent in existing populations. Herbicides don’t have a much better track record environmentally. The effects of herbicides can also spread beyond plants themselves, affecting microorganisms and animals. Landscapes created by herbicides and invasive plants are visually opposite but face the same problem: The brown fields of plants killed by herbicides and the vibrant green fields of densely growing invasive plants both lack biodiversity. This dichotomy puts people dedicated to protecting their local biodiversity in an impossible spot: Do they risk their own health and that of their local ecosystem to effectively control invasive plants using herbicides, or do they let invasive plants smother the native organisms they hold dear? Many managers feel the same way I do; we don’t want to use them, but we feel that there aren’t better options. Even after herbicides are used, invasive plants still dominate many landscapes. Some invasive plants have already developed resistance, which renders current herbicides useless against them and will likely render them useless against more plants in the future. We could develop new herbicides, but they would likely continue to create issues for both human and environmental health. Research is currently being done to create control methods that target only one species (methods such as biological control, RNAi, and autotoxicity), which would allow us to kill only the invasive plants while leaving other organisms, including humans, unharmed. Elizabeth Esser is a Ph.D. student at Mississippi State University whose research focuses on invasive plant management.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
