Spoilers follow for all four episodes of Adolescence, now streaming on Netflix.

In the second episode of Adolescence — the new acclaimed Netflix limited series and runaway hit about a 13-year-old boy accused of murder — Detective Sergeant Misha Frank (Faye Marsay) tells one of her male colleagues what upsets her most about the case. She and Detective Inspector Luke Bascombe (Ashley Walters) are visiting the secondary school previously attended by the accused killer, Jamie (newcomer Owen Cooper, who was only 14 at the time of filming), and his classmate Katie (Emilia Holliday), the girl he’s accused of killing.

“You know what I don’t like about all this?” Frank says. “The perp always gets the front line: A man raped a woman. We’ve been following Jamie’s brain around this entire case. Katie isn’t important; Jamie is. Everyone will remember Jamie; no one will remember her. That’s what annoys me. That’s what gets to me.”

It’s an astute observation, and perhaps a self-critically meta one, given that the show in which Frank is saying these lines is devoted entirely to Jamie: what he did, why he did it, and who’s to blame. Meanwhile, the person whose life he’s extinguished is relegated to a briefly shown photograph of a smiling girl in a baseball cap, some comments on social media, and a teacher who remembers she “talked a bit too much.” The only time we see Katie alive is at a distance in the CCTV footage police have obtained of the girl silently shoving Jamie away from her in a parking lot late at night, before he pursues her and stabs her to death. In Adolescence’s four episodes — all shot in one appropriately claustrophobic and unsettling long take — Katie isn’t important; Jamie is. The show knows this, acknowledges it, and makes the case for its own existence nonetheless. But focusing on the topic of teenage violence and misogyny from the perspective of one of its perpetrators doesn’t necessarily provide us with any new or special insights into young men’s online radicalization — and it threatens to further obscure the lived reality and humanity of those who suffer its real-world consequences in the process.

Many have heralded the gripping third episode, which takes place almost entirely in one room in a youth psychiatric facility seven months after Jamie’s arrest, as far and away the best of the bunch. I’d agree with them; it’s also the most revealing episode in terms of the show’s exploration of gender dynamics and male rage. A court-appointed psychologist named Briony Ariston (Erin Doherty) interviews Jamie for an independent pretrial report on his mental health; we’re made to understand they’ve met several times before. The pair kick things off with friendly banter before she encourages him to tell her about his relationships with his father and grandfather. What are they like, she asks. “Men,” Jamie says. He accuses Briony of trying to trick him; of being posh; of “chatting shit.” She ensures him they’re just having a conversation. This is the first of many times Jamie will fluctuate between a sometimes friendly, sometimes petulant child, and the aggressive, paranoid, resentful man he’s becoming.

When Briony has convinced him to go along with her questions about how he feels about men and masculinity, Jamie is reticent at first. Is his dad funny? “Sometimes.” Loving? “No, that’s weird.” Angry? “I suppose.” Though he’s quick to clarify his father has never hit him: “He just gets mad. We all do.” We learn that his father, Eddie, played by series co-creator and co-writer Stephen Graham, is into sports and that he once tried the classic dad move of getting his son to follow in his footsteps. It went poorly, as those things so often do. When Jamie tried playing football, he admits to Briony, Eddie would “cheer me on and everything, but when I’d fuck up —” Jamie pauses, the camera close on his face as it storms with sadness and mortification just beneath the surface. “He’d just look away … Maybe he didn’t want me to see him looking sorry … Or, I don’t know, ashamed.” When Briony asks him how he felt about that — seeing his dad’s shame — Jamie bristles again, wondering accusatorily why she hasn’t pushed back and assured him that must be all in his head; a father wouldn’t be ashamed of his child. Would he? Soon afterward, Jamie has his first major outburst, standing over Briony as she sits in her chair, screaming at her that she doesn’t control his life: “Get that in that little fucking head of yours.”

Quite a lot of Adolescence is devoted to plumbing the complicated depths of Jamie’s relationship with his father. That relationship is given much more attention than the few mostly feeble and surface-level attempts at explaining teens today, despite what the series’ title might suggest. Only one episode, the second (with a title card featuring photos of the teenage actors when they were younger children, innocents) is set in teen world, at the secondary school where the detective worries to her superior that Katie will be forgotten while Jamie lives on in infamy. It’s also the only time when we meet anyone who both knew and loved Katie. When the police interview her best friend, Jade (Fatima Bojang), about what the murdered girl was like, she says Katie was “the best person she knew” — but the most important fact about her is that she’s dead now. Jade gets angry at a line of questioning that she thinks is victim blaming — the cops ask her if Katie really couldn’t stand Jamie, why did they comment on each other’s Instagrams? — which is followed by a brief After-School Special sort of scene between Jade and a teacher about her home life. We don’t see Jade speaking with any of her peers (were she and Katie total loners?), though we do get to witness multiple teen boys feverishly discussing Jamie’s case and whether they think he really did it (yes).

The second episode doesn’t give us anything specific or real about Katie. Instead, its purpose is for Bascombe to learn from his son, who attends the same school, that the police have been totally clueless about the emojis Katie used in her interactions with Jamie online, which are meant to imply he’s a loser virginal incel. Andrew Tate gets name-dropped. More than probing the particularities of these teenagers’ lives and relationships in an era of virulent online misogyny, however, the shallow buzzword revelations just play up the show’s most prevalent theme of father-son tensions; Bascombe tells Frank their talk about emojis were the most words he’s exchanged with his teenager for quite a while. It’s Bascombe listening to a voice-mail from his son that opens the whole series.

Graham told Netflix’s in-house magazine, Tudum, that he was inspired to create the show after seeing young boys accused of knife crimes on the news. “It shocked me,” he says. “I was thinking, What’s going on? What’s happening in society where a boy stabs a girl to death? What’s the inciting incident here? And then it happened again, and it happened again, and it happened again. I really just wanted to shine a light on it and ask, Why is this happening today? What’s going on? How have we come to this?”

Those are seemingly the big questions animating the series: What was Jamie’s motive? What causes children to commit violent crimes against other children? And it’s in the third episode when we get some answers. Jamie tells Briony that boys in school had been passing around topless photos of Katie, laughing at her for being so flat chested, and he thought that was the prime time to ask her out: when she was being made fun of, and therefore a “weak” target. He put on his best tracksuit and asked her to the fair. “I’m not that desperate,” she told him in response. He gets so worked up relaying this story that he makes what sounds like an accidental confession, then gets so mad at himself that he flies into another rage, throwing his chair across the room, which encourages Briony to prematurely abort the session and choke back tears once he’s out of sight.

In her review for the New York Times, critic Margaret Lyons writes that she watched this episode multiple times, “and it can land in different ways. Through one lens, [Briony] plays [Jamie] like a piano, provoking a variety of emotional responses. Through another, she is a ship on his ocean, a witness to his tempestuousness but not its cause.” I’ve also watched the episode a few times, and I’ve wondered how a professional who must have spoken with dozens of violent and dangerous people managed to get so shaken by a 13-year-old boy — Jamie makes fun of her for this, too, taunting her for being scared of a child. I’ve considered whether she’s the one who really holds all the cards — she elicits a confession, after all — or whether, as she jokes to Jamie at one point, he’s really the one in charge. The strength of both actors’ performances, their intimate push and pull, opens the door to these different interpretations. Though perhaps that ambiguity is also the result of some wishy-washy writing. We learn that Jamie — who has commented crude things on models’ Instagrams and brags about his sexual exploits to Briony before denying he’s ever experienced those things at all — doesn’t consider himself popular, had been bullied at school, and that he had a motive to kill Katie because she was one of his tormentors (recall the incel comments). Does Briony — and the show itself — really believe that Jamie was the victim of abuse at school, or was she using the specter of his being made fun of to bait him into revealing the truth?

What episode three does do well is depict a boy teetering between his resentment and even hatred of women — he implies Briony is flat chested like Katie and therefore undesirable; he belittles and intimidates her; he compares her unfavorably to his other male therapist — and his desperation for attention and affirmation. A guard drags Jamie from the interview after he asks Briony what she thinks of him, and he starts screaming when she won’t answer: “Do you like me? Do you like me?” He bangs on the windows, desperate. “Tell my dad I’m all right.”

Of course, his father’s opinion of him matters more than that of any woman’s. And Eddie knows this. The show’s final episode — the one most heavily criticized for being “slow” and involving “too much irrelevant chitchat” — takes place over a year after the murder, when Jamie’s family is trying to return to normal while he’s awaiting trial. It’s all about Eddie — the whole series, despite the third episode without him, has really been all about Eddie and his struggle to accept the truth of what his son did — who frets that even though he didn’t hit his children, the way his father had hit him, maybe he didn’t do enough to prevent violence from manifesting in his own son. This isn’t a story about adolescence today: it’s one of inherited rage, shame, and misogyny. A tale as old as time.

What starts out as a much more intriguing premise — a teenage victim of revenge porn turns the tables, becoming the bully of her own bullies — is left unexplored. In the finale, we learn that when Eddie was an adolescent, he once dressed up in a pink wig (“Your dad never cared when people were laughing at him,” his wife tells their daughter), implying he was once the kind of guy who was confident enough to sidestep masculinity’s rules. But no longer: “Don’t laugh at me! Fuck off!” he screams at the teen boy he accuses of spray-painting “nonce” (British slang for pedophile) on his work van, whom he also shoves to the ground. While getting more time with Eddie, I kept thinking back to Katie and Jade, their untold stories. What happens to young girls who, not so unlike Jamie, are conditioned to hate themselves? What of their shame and their rage?

“We wanted you to look at this family and think, My God. This could be happening to us!” Graham told Tudum. “And what’s happening here is an ordinary family’s worst nightmare.” With his impressively weepy performance (less so his co-written script), Graham captures that nightmare well. Though one also has to wonder: Wasn’t it Katie’s friends and family, and Katie herself, who experienced the worst nightmare of all?",vulture

Noah Wyle is having a nightmare of a day on The Pitt. His character, Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch, has been plagued with knee-buckling COVID flashbacks, forced to fire a trusted colleague, watched numerous children die, and continues to butt heads with a hospital administrator obsessed with patient-satisfaction scores. In the episode “6:00 P.M.,” everything gets worse in a typically American way: There’s an active shooter at a nearby music festival, and the ER Robby oversees is bombarded. Blood pools on the floor and soaks through doctors’ scrubs; ambulance sirens overtake the sound mix. Robby, who previously strode from patient to trainee with unassailable empathy and decisiveness, looks lost. He was supposed to attend the festival with his ex’s son, and he hasn’t heard from the 17-year-old. His face, so often calm and ready, crumples into despair. Things aren’t going to be okay. It’s a hell of a way to end an episode of a series that has, to this point, won over audiences with the familiar, assured smile of a former ER star and the idea that health care is a human right, not a profit generator.

“What you’re seeing is the water level in his eyes. He’s almost going under,” Wyle says. “We gave the press the first ten episodes. Everybody’s enjoying this train ride. I’m the only one that knows we take this train over a cliff.”

There are always medical procedurals on TV; each of the big four networks currently has at least one. The Pitt is Max’s, the product of a brain trust that worked together on the juggernaut ER and includes Wyle (also an executive producer and writer on the show), creator R. Scott Gemmill, and executive producer John Wells. The Pitt has the hallmarks of an old-school television hit: It follows a weekly release model instead of streaming’s more customary binge. It mirrors the structure of the popular early-aughts show 24, with each claustrophobic, fluorescent-lit episode unfurling as one hour inside the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center’s emergency room. It features a star from the second-longest-running prime-time medical drama of all time. Viewership is wide, reviews are enthusiastic, and in more present-day terms of success, social-media posts about Wyle are thirsty. The show’s unabashed story lines — about abortion, and access to health care for trans people, and racial bias among medical professionals — run counter to the real world’s trend toward DEI abandonment.

Wyle and I are sitting in the Players Club, the private actors’ society in New York City that he’s been a member of since he skyrocketed to fame as Dr. John Carter on ER. The club was founded by Edwin Booth, elder son of the acting dynasty best known for producing John Wilkes. Wyle has been transfixed with the Booths since his teens, back when he was acting in plays with his family or at school, and decades on, he feels at home among their possessions. He points to the legendary skull of the horse thief Fontaine, which Edwin used to perform Hamlet and is now sealed off behind a velvet rope. “The skull used to be right here — you used to be able to pick it up,” he says. He and his friend Steven Weber, another prime-time leading man from the ’90s who is currently appearing on successful medical procedural Chicago Med, would “fuck around” with the skull, Wyle says, letting out a raspy laugh that bursts forth whenever he’s making fun of himself. (That cackle can be a bit self-loathing, too, like when he claims he looked like a “hostage” in a recent appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show.)

We’re chatting six days after The Pitt wrapped in early February. The next week, Wyle will report to the series’ writers’ room to begin work on season two. He is used to these long-term gigs; he dedicated four years to the TNT series The Librarians and Falling Skies, respectively, and 15 years to ER, playing a privileged kid who starts out as a fumbling medical student, grows into a politically engaged resident, and ends the series as a stoic attending physician. “The John Carter character arc that extends from the pilot episode to the finale is one of the biggest dramatic arcs you can possibly play,” Wyle says. ER attracted nearly 35 million weekly viewers, but most of the original actors, like George Clooney, left the show after a few seasons. Not Wyle. He stuck around for a hulking 254 episodes, taking a two-season break only after the birth of his son Owen in 2002. ER was the monoculture, generating breathless attention over its characters’ romantic entanglements, as well as countless magazine covers, beginning with an October 1994 Newsweek that declared ER “A Health-Care Program That Really Works.” During the series’ run, he had to turn down movie roles in Saving Private Ryan and Clooney’s Good Night, and Good Luck. “I had a really great first act in my career, and got associated with a show that ran for a really long time. I stayed with it,” he says. “What came after that came after that.”

What came after was a string of “almost Jimmy Stewart characters” on basic cable. Wyle’s sweet spot is playing normal guys who radiate knowledge and a touch of mischief — the types who could lead you into war or make a college lecture interesting. (His longtime colleague, the costume designer Lyn Paolo, says she let the actor give her stitches once; she’d cut her finger on the set of ER, and writer and co-executive producer Dr. Joe Sachs agreed to supervise the suturing. “We worked hard, we played hard back then,” Wyle says. “We were all sewing each other up.”) “He’s extremely intelligent, and that intelligence comes off,” Wells says. “It’s not just empathy. It’s an ability to listen, and a stillness that he brings as an actor, which is a skill that goes unnoticed sometimes.” Falling Skies and The Librarians had a fraction of ER’s viewership, but they made good use of Wyle’s level gaze and pitched-down tone, and attracted their own niche sci-fi/fantasy audiences — the kinds who show up to comic-cons and buy tie-in novels. “I got kind of at peace with not feeling like I was doing work that was in the Zeitgeist,” Wyle says.

Then in March 2020, as COVID was decimating the country’s medical infrastructure and shuttering Hollywood, Wyle started receiving dozens of Instagram DMs from first responders who knew him from ER. Some messages were “confessional” about the difficulty of the work, some were complaints about how inadequate that era’s pot-banging appreciation felt. Many were a “Hey, Carter, we could use you out here” appeal. “The volume was sort of directly proportional to my depression at the time,” Wyle says. “I felt useless, and I was being acknowledged, and that was a weird combination for me to reconcile.” Wyle eventually shared the messages with Wells and Gemmill, and the three of them met intermittently over the next few years to talk about working together again. The first idea was a project affiliated with ER and Dr. Carter, which fell apart in April 2023.

Wyle can’t share many details about this because he, Wells, and Warner Bros. are being sued by the estate of author and ER creator Michael Crichton, which has claimed that The Pitt is an unauthorized reboot of ER. Wyle insists The Pitt is an entirely separate endeavor. “I just wanted to put this spotlight back on these first responders. I wanted to put the attention back on this community that needed it,” Wyle says. “And Wells goes, ‘We could still do that.’” They set out to make something “radically different” from ER, with a “radically different guy, and have everything be able to live on its own.” The Pitt is set in Pittsburgh, not Chicago, and the season unfolds in real time, with overlapping crises ratcheting up tension as the cast careens around the sterile white set. Drs. Carter and Robby are indeed both medical professionals and educators, but in temperament, attending physician Robby has a grizzled, earthy, seen-some-shit air that distinguishes him from the desperate-to-prove-himself, low-key womanizer Carter. (Plus, Robby occasionally wears a little pair of glasses that accentuates a menagerie of serious and comical reaction faces; Wyle reassures us they’ll get more play in season two, “because my eyes are getting worse and worse.”)

“I had 192 days to walk in circles thinking about what kind of work I wanted to do, and who I wanted to do it with, and what I wanted it to feel like, and the impact I wanted it to have,” Wyle says of the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Photo: David Livingston/Getty Images

In May 2023, the trio met for the first brainstorming session for The Pitt, only for the WGA to announce its strike the next day, sending Wyle out onto the Hollywood picket lines around Netflix and Warner Bros. “I had 192 days to walk in circles thinking about what kind of work I wanted to do, and who I wanted to do it with, and what I wanted it to feel like, and the impact I wanted it to have,” Wyle says. “That was the incubation, so that when we hit the ground, we hit it really running fast.” Fourteen months later, The Pitt debuted on Max, with Dr. Robby getting a hottie introduction, sunglasses shielding his eyes from the 7 a.m. light glinting off the gray in his beard as he walks to work. Wyle says he’s still surprised to have been cast as the lead when The Pitt shed its connections to ER. “I think of Max and HBO as sort of a big league that I haven’t been playing in for a while. This was just an answered-prayer gig.”

“Over the last five years, pretty much everything in streaming has had a movie star who’s agreed to be in the show,” Wells says. “And Noah, he’s very humble about himself. I don’t think he realizes just how large a star he actually is.”

Inside the ER, nicknamed “the Pitt,” Wyle’s Dr. Robby is the hub of the wheel, the central point around whom everyone else revolves and from whom everyone else takes direction. It was a role he performed behind the scenes, too, as an executive producer and writer. “There’s an element of Noah’s personal experiences in a business that’s tough,” says Gemmill. “It lends itself perfectly for this character in terms of someone who’s been through so much and is still trying to keep doing it and pass it on to the younger people.” When The Pitt’s casting calls went out, Wyle attached a letter to each character breakdown, referencing director and screenwriter Robert Altman’s approach to ensemble pieces like M*A*S*H and Nashville. Unlike ER, whose cast talked openly in interviews about stealing scenes out from under one another and intimidating guest stars, The Pitt would be an even playing field for everyone. Any character, a lead or an extra, could be tapped for a major moment. “There’s no differentiation on a good set between foreground and background, or cast and crew. It’s just company,” Wyle says.

The Pitt was the first recurring TV gig for Patrick Ball, and he says Wyle created a “non-ego-ful” atmosphere where Ball felt comfortable getting physical during their characters’ confrontation at the end of episode “4:00 P.M.” Each episode is named after an hour of the characters’ shift, and they tend to close on bangers, scenes where the actors get a chance to wrestle the episode away from medical emergencies and toward their characters’ inner lives. In the scene, Dr. Robby is shocked to learn that his trusted senior resident, Dr. Frank Langdon (Ball), is stealing benzos from the unit; their altercation involves the normally cool Robby losing his temper and the supremely confident Langdon begging to keep his job. “We got in the hallway and just started walking around, pushing each other around,” Ball says. “Sometimes, there’s games with people trying to steer a scene in their direction. None of that. It was just like throwing the ball back and forth. You’re just playing.”

“It wasn’t like we sat around in the room going, ‘What would really rile up America?’” Wyle says. Instead, his “agenda” is “to call into question some of the misinformation that’s out there, that wants to call a medical fact an opinion.” Photo: Warrick Page/Max

That scene is the start of Dr. Robby’s breakdown arc, intensifying with the “mass-cas” story line of “6:00 P.M.” Gone are the quirky ER regulars who razz Dr. Robby and the other staff members; in their place is a wave of gunshot victims who mirror what countless Americans have seen on the news, if not experienced themselves. Performing the back of the season was as emotionally grueling as you’d expect. “You’re covered in blood and you’re listening to a lot of screaming and crying. You don’t ever get a reprieve from it because you’re so immersed in it,” Wyle says. “That was the most difficulty I had in terms of juggling my responsibilities outside of work, because it was almost just like, What’s the point? I need to stay in this. I need to stay in it all the time.”

In 2012, Wyle was arrested at a Capitol Hill protest against Medicaid cuts, and he appeared in a 2016 PSA urging the Electoral College to remove Donald Trump from the ballot. He isn’t afraid to share some of his other opinions: He doesn’t care for billionaires meddling in government affairs and he supports a national health-care plan, which he says is “not a question of ideas. It’s a question of will.” But Wyle stops short of suggesting that story lines on The Pitt are partisan. (For the record, the episode featuring a man with brain worms wasn’t a jab at Health and Human Services secretary and anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he says, just a coincidence.) “It wasn’t like we sat around in the room going, ‘What would really rile up America?’” he says. Instead, his “agenda” is “to call into question some of the misinformation that’s out there, that wants to call a medical fact an opinion.” Wyle himself wrote two episodes this season, including “3:00 P.M.,” in which two moms get in a fistfight about mask use. The story line wraps with the anti-mask mom needing surgery on her hand and acknowledging that she wants the doctors performing the procedure to be masked. That, Wyle confesses, was meant to be a statement. “Masks are important. They cut down on disease transmission. It’s a fact. It shouldn’t be a political position.”

Talk to Wyle long enough and an Old Hollywood, liberal-coded traditionalism comes out, especially in his beliefs that storytelling is an empathy generator and the people doing it should earn a living wage. He’s on a streaming series now, but he’s doubtful of any business model that ceaselessly prioritizes “unlimited growth.” “Our dads built something that was really great, and then we all looked at it and thought, Let’s break it and do something better,” Wyle says. “And then we came up with something better and bigger and totally unsustainable. And then we went, ‘What did Dad do?’ And then we rebuilt what Dad did. This whole thing feels very cyclical.” He wants to keep bringing work like The Pitt to Los Angeles, the city where three generations of his family (including his mother, a former orthopedic head nurse) have lived and which he recently saw destroyed by devastating wildfires. “I’ve been through a lot of shit in that city. I’ve never seen anything like that,” he says.

Maybe Wyle will eventually go out for movie roles again, or develop his own show, or produce other projects that inspire him as much as The Pitt. It’s difficult for him to think ahead, though, “when I have the career that I want right now.” Plus, he’s already come to terms with the idea that mainstream success at the level of ER might never come his way again. “Because I know it doesn’t lead to anything other than, you know, this.” I ask him to elaborate on what “this” means, and he tells me about how, after our meeting at the Players Club, he went back the next night, to “the space that I love,” winning at the pool table and drinking at the bar. He worried he’d fall and crack his head open during the drunken walk through the snow back to his hotel, and then he slipped in the shower after throwing up. He called his wife early in the morning, wondering if he had a concussion. She told him to go to the doctor. He jokingly replied that he basically is a doctor. “You can be on a hit show. You’re still going to slip in the shower and hit your head, piss off your wife,” Wyle says. “It’s just life.”",vulture
https://vulture.com,The Studio Behind Magazine Dreams Is Hollywood’s Home for Canceled Movies,https://www.vulture.com/article/only-one-studio-in-hollywood-dared-to-touch-magazine-dreams.html,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 11:00:18 GMT","After Searchlight Pictures dumped the Jonathan Majors bodybuilding drama, only one studio dared touch it. “I certainly do not shy away from controversy,” says CEO Tom Ortenberg. Photo: Briarcliff Entertainment/Everett Collection

In January 2023, the roid-rage-fueled, Taxi Driver–esque bodybuilding drama Magazine Dreams flexed its awesome muscularity at the Sundance Film Festival with all the coiled grandeur of a back double-biceps pose. Plotted around a bravura performance by Jonathan Majors — who physically transformed into an actual bodybuilder for the role as a driven but mentally unstable brute-naïf — the indie garnered a standing ovation in Park City’s Eccles Theater and sparked a bidding war between Sony Pictures Classics, Neon, and HBO. Searchlight Pictures ultimately walked off with domestic-distribution rights to Magazine Dreams for a reported $10 million.

After winning Sundance’s U.S. Special Dramatic Jury Award, the film seemed bound for awards glory. Searchlight teed up a December 2023 release at the peak of prime Oscars campaigning season with Majors — then gaining additional cultural momentum as Kang the Conqueror in Marvel’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — as the face of its awards offensive and a seeming Best Actor nominee shoo-in. Then Majors was arrested on domestic-violence charges — including choking his then-girlfriend, Grace Jabbari, in March of that year — dropped by his management team, fired by Marvel (as the chief supervillain of its Phase 5 Avengers franchise), and convicted of assault and harassment. (Jabbari also sued Majors for defamation; the suit was settled.) In January 2024, Searchlight quietly returned the rights of Magazine Dreams to its filmmakers: the active supposition being that a Majors star vehicle was too radioactive to release, especially for the prestige art-house studio division of Disney.

But a funny thing happened on the way to the cinematic junk heap. In October, up-and-coming indie distributor Briarcliff Entertainment snapped up distribution rights to Magazine Dreams for an undisclosed sum. Now, the Los Angeles–based production-distribution company that was formed in 2018 specifically to release the hot-button Michael Moore documentary Fahrenheit 11/9 — and increasingly specializes in putting out films considered “distressed assets” — is finally giving Magazine Dreams a wide theatrical release on March 21.

Even within Hollywood, Briarcliff is still somewhat of a little-known media entity. But since August, when it acquired the controversial Donald Trump biopic The Apprentice — another movie no other studio would touch that yielded an October release garnering a Best Actor Oscar nomination for Sebastian Stan and a Best Supporting Actor nod for co-star Jeremy Strong — Briarcliff has become known as a studio of last resort for hard-to-market, contentious yet compelling titles. In an increasingly compartmentalized media landscape when the entertainment industry has never been more risk-averse, when theatrical distribution has never been more iffy and the economics of independent film are in turmoil, Briarcliff is making a name for itself by championing difficult projects where other, more deeply funded and longer-established movie purveyors fear to tread. “I spent many years trying to get the movie made … so when distribution fell through, I accepted this was the journey for Magazine Dreams; I had to make peace with the idea that the movie may never get released,” says its writer-director Elijah Bynum. “I’m very grateful for Briarcliff taking a chance on this film, and I appreciate their willingness to support all kinds of films and filmmakers. I think they like being underdogs. I think they like swimming against the current.”

Briarcliff is the brainchild of Tom Ortenberg, a visionary executive with decades of experience navigating culture wars, juggling Hollywood hot potatoes, and turning profits from titles mired in conflict. As president of theatrical films at Lionsgate in 1999, he cut a deal to put out Kevin Smith’s Dogma after Disney stifled the fallen-angel comedy’s release (it had come under fire at Disney subsidiary Miramax for spoofing tenets of Christianity) going so far as to debate a senior official at the Catholic League on the movie’s merits. Ortenberg was an early champion of Moore, releasing in 2004 the Flint, Michigan firebrand’s Fahrenheit 9/11 — a connect-the-dots investigation of the George W. Bush presidency, the Iraq war, and corrupt wartime profiteering — which still stands as the highest-grossing documentary of all time. He topped that feat by acquiring North American rights to the low-budget ensemble drama Crash out of the Toronto International Film Festival for $3.3 million. Through aggressive marketing and savvy campaigning, Lionsgate parlayed that slim outlay into a robust $54 million at the box office and an Oscars sweep of major awards including Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Paul Haggis and Best Picture (upsetting presumed winner Brokeback Mountain in the process). Then, as co-founder and chief executive of Open Road Films (the now-shuttered production and distribution venture backed by AMC and Regal Theatres), Ortenberg co-financed production of the $20 million Todd McCarthy–directed journalism drama Spotlight — plotted around a Boston Globe investigation of child sex abuse by Catholic clergy — and oversaw its platform release en route to a 2016 Best Picture Academy Award.

Speaking from his Santa Monica office, Ortenberg notes that his — and by extension Briarcliff’s — release agenda encompasses more than just trafficking in outrage. “I certainly do not shy away from controversy; I kind of run toward it,” the CEO says. “But I don’t want to be known just as the guy who does the controversial films. I love all movies.”

To that end, the company has traversed the high-low, putting out schlocky Liam Neeson thrillers like Honest Thief (2020) and Blacklight as well as the gun-control advocacy documentary Gabby Giffords Won’t Back Down and The Dissident (a doc examining the assassination of political dissident-journalist Jamal Khashoggi in context of Saudi Arabia’s efforts to suppress international dissent).

But it is fair to say The Apprentice first put Briarcliff on the cultural radar. In May, the biographical drama (which follows the young Donald Trump’s professional and political coming-of-age mentored by ruthless legal fixer Roy Cohn) received a ten-plus-minute standing ovation at its Cannes Film Festival premiere, also drawing “audible gasps” for a scene in which Stan as Trump throws his first wife, Ivana, to the ground and rapes her. Also depicting the future 45th/47th president experiencing erectile dysfunction, popping amphetamines, and receiving liposuction, the fact-based film made a huge splash on the Croisette but failed to find a North American distributor. At issue: a Trump spokesman castigated The Apprentice as “pure malicious defamation” and the president’s attorneys issued a cease-and-desist letter to the filmmakers effectively warning any potential studio partner that they’d be “buying a lawsuit.”

Ortenberg, however, saw an opportunity. “As I’m watching it, I’m thinking, Trump supporters — if they give it a chance — will probably like it,” he recalls. “If you’re anti-Trump, the film reinforces it. If you are pro-Trump, you watch The Apprentice and you think to yourself, Yeah, that’s my guy. This movie is far from some left-wing hatchet job. It’s an intense, searing, sometimes very funny character study of one of the most important and certainly iconic figures in modern American history. I thought it was going to please audiences on both sides of the aisle to pretty much the same degree. It deserved to be seen.”

The film’s producers spent the summer of 2024 untying a sticky legal predicament (buying out an ownership stake by Kinematics, a production company bankrolled by billionaire Trump supporter Dan Snyder). Then, with virtually no domestic competition, Briarcliff appeared like a savior out of the mist to buy The Apprentice just days before awards season kicked off. “After those threats were made by Trump, it created fear in the industry; you can imagine why these companies didn’t engage,” Apprentice producer Dan Bekerman told me in the fall before the film’s release. “But we’re extremely happy with Tom Ortenberg of Briarcliff. Tom’s experience is exactly right for this movie.” (While The Apprentice has only earned $4 million at the North American box office and Briarcliff has yet to negotiate a deal for its streaming-video on-demand rights, Ortenberg says: “I can tell you with confidence we did not lose money on the deal.”)

Haggis’s 2004 ensemble drama, Crash, explores incendiary racial and social fault lines baked into turn–of–the–millennium Los Angeles — a setting notably absent of clear heroes and villains that intentionally backs off moral absolutes. “The lesson I took away from the movie is none of us are as good as we appear on our best day and none of us are as bad as we appear on our worst day,” Ortenberg says. “Is Matt Dillon the racist, misogynistic cop? Or is he the loving son trying to get his dad basic health care?”

The executive says he applied that rationale to Magazine Dreams when a source attached to the film approached him last summer about acquiring its distribution rights. Moreover, at a cultural pivot point when a growing number of performers canceled by Me Too and sexual misbehavior allegations — Aziz Ansari, James Franco, Louis C.K., and Kevin Spacey among them — are returning to work onstage or in front of the camera, Majors is hardly alone in attempting to bounce back from career oblivion. “I’m certainly not condoning any inappropriate behavior by anybody, but does a misdemeanor conviction mean that somebody doesn’t get to work again?” Ortenberg asks. “Los Angeles Media Fund are financiers on this movie. Do they have to light their money on fire? The dozens, the hundreds of people who worked on this movie, everybody has to pretend it doesn’t exist anymore. We’re just going to burn the negative? I say no.”

“I’ve gotten to know Jonathan over the past several months and I’m proud to consider him a friend,” he continues. “It’s not my business to speak to what happened a couple of years ago. But I’ll tell you this: I wouldn’t mind everybody remembering me on my best day, whatever that might have been, but I’m glad that not everybody throws my worst day in my face.”

Indisputably, there will be an odd, meta-narrative spectacle attached to watching an acclaimed, Yale-educated Serious Thespian transform himself into a brutal, homicidal Mr. Universe wannabe almost two years to the day since Majors’s assault arrest. Indeed, Magazine Dreams’ opening scene features his musclebound character Killian Maddox attending court-ordered counseling for his lack of impulse control and violent episodes.

Just days before Rolling Stone published an article featuring an audio recording in which Majors seems to acknowledge strangling his girlfriend, I ask Ortenberg how Briarcliff intends to overcome toxic discourse surrounding the star — or if the company’s goal is now to galvanize curiosity surrounding Majors’s comeback to get people into theaters? “For those who want to point out art imitating life, or the film being a little on the nose as it relates to real life, so be it. But we’re not focusing on the controversy at all,” says Ortenberg. “We’ve moved on. I think most of the American moviegoing public has moved on.”",vulture
https://vulture.com,The Buena Vista Social Club Gets Bigger and Smaller on Broadway,https://www.vulture.com/article/buena-vista-social-club-broadway-marco-ramirez-theater-review.html,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 02:00:45 GMT","Photo: Matthew Murphy

In musical theater, the book’s often the trickiest thing to get right and the easiest target for criticism. If you don’t believe that the characters have a reason to break into song, blame the book. If the night feels like it’s dragging, blame the book. And if the songs are already hits, and the dancers are already fantastic, but you’re not quite achieving liftoff? Well, there’s always one place to look. That’s what I have to assume happened in production meetings for Buena Vista Social Club somewhere between its Off Broadway run in 2023 and its arrival at the Schoenfeld Theatre this spring. Back when my colleague Sara Holdren reviewed the musical, very loosely based on the true-life stories of the sensational Cuban supergroup, she noted that “the play side of Buena Vista feels like it’s been carefully assembled by committee.” It had a convoluted, rushed, and generically inspirational narrative about how these players met, weathered the revolution, and returned to each other. You might expect that book writer Marco Ramirez and director Saheem Ali took feedback like that and deepened and extended the thing in rewrites. Instead, they’ve just hacked through Buena Vista’s Gordian knot. Why not simply cut as much of the book as possible?

The remarkable thing is how much that approach works. The Broadway Buena Vista clocks in a little shorter than its Off Broadway iteration — now, it’s just two hours with intermission — and breezes through its set-up with quick dashes of exposition. Juan de Marcos (Justin Cunningham) is a young record producer enamored with classic Cuban songs who’s come up with a plan to record “a love letter to Golden Age Cuban music,” but first he needs to convince the diva Omara Portuondo (Natalie Venetia Belcon, exuding confidence in a series of power shawls by Dede Ayite) to come to the studio. Juan’s already recruited the eager old hand Compay (Julio Monge, wry and foxy, able to land even the hoariest jokes) among a company of younger musicians, but as Compay tells Omara when she gets in the studio, “These old songs … they kick up old feelings.” Soon it flashes back to a younger Omara (Isa Antonetti) and her officious sister (Ashley De La Rosa) preparing for their performances at the Tropicana before the revolution and hiring a younger Compay (Da’Von T. Moody) and his pianist compatriot Rubén (Leonardo Reyna) as their accompanists. The two boys lure Omara off to their rowdier club on the bad side of town; she meets a busboy with a voice of gold named Ibrahim (Mel Semé). Her sister would never approve!

I remember the Off Broadway plot contorting itself into a few more curlicues — there was one confusing side plot about that club being a hub for weapon-smuggling, and a lot more of the characters talking around the politics of the revolution while saying little. Here, Ramirez’s script is more skeletal: It tends to hit the clichés then segue into music as quickly as possible. The younger Rubén was “Picasso on the keys.” The older Rubén (Leonardo Reyna) can barely walk anymore, but when Juan puts on a recording of a classic song, he suddenly remembers the notes. After the young Omara and Ibrahim fall for each other and then are separated by circumstance, have no fear that she will eventually find an older Ibrahim (Jainardo Batista Sterling, movingly poised) and the two will sing together again.

Thinning the book of Buena Vista, however, has left the other aspects of the production expand in its absence, and that’s where the show is on its surest feet. First, there is the music: Those standards from the original album, a grab bag of genres and styles from a Cuba several decades ago, no surprise, still kill. Belcon brings the house down with “Candela,” maybe the most famous entry in the album, with more than a little help from Buena Vista’s band — in character, Omara disproves of a flute solo, until she hears the show’s flautist Henry Paz wail away on the instrument (a moment that wows the audience, too). You get to know the players in the band through their riffing, their personalities just if not more vivid than the paper characters that surround them. The band, composed of musicians from around the globe, also gives the show its center of gravity. They’re almost always onstage, whether in a central platform that doubles as the actual space of Juan’s recording studio or watching the action from the sidelines. Downtown, that could cramp the action, with dancers trying to negotiate around a small space with a double bass. At the Schoenfeld, everything has more space to luxuriate. The musicians can wander and engage with the theater audience as they jam, while the choreography of husband-and-wife team of Justin Peck and Patricia Delgado gets more physical space to traverse. They fill in a lot of detail with that movement, providing texture that the show tends to lack elsewhere. In their dance number at the Tropicana, for instance, Omara dances with her heels down, while her more uptight sister is on her toes. The dance also gives the show jolts of kinetic energy, especially when Compay takes Omara on her first trip to the titular club, with the ensemble shifting between moments of chaos and precision, like a murmuration of birds changing course with the wind.

All that adds up to a rousing evening at the theater, if also something less than a great musical. With its book whittled down so much and its careful hedging to only speaking the broadest generalities about Cuba’s history, Buena Vista Social Club only aims modestly high, just above the level of a tribute concert. It’s a reminder, primarily, of how wonderful those songs are, to stream that album once you’re in the subway, and maybe inspire you to do a little research back home on their histories. To that end, the Buena Vista has inserted a pamphlet of mini-histories of each of the songs into its Playbill (for the sake of immersion, the introduction says those notes are by the character Juan de Marcos, but the text is credited to Hugo Eugenio Perez). That pamphlet goes into further detail about the song’s histories; the folktales that inspired them; and the way some, like “El Cumbanchero,” were co-opted into prettified marketing for the island while others contain the legacies of slavery. There’s a richness and thorniness even in very abridged versions of those stories that hasn’t made it to the stage. That’s good material, if anyone wants to really wrestle with it.

What’s The Kelly Clarkson Show without Kelly Clarkson? Just The Show, I guess — with a revolving door of guest hosts who had been stepping in during Clarkson’s unexplained absence for the last few weeks. Beginning March 3, when Simu Liu subbed at the last minute, celebrities like Brooke Shields and Kal Penn have been filling her seat. But after ten episodes and curious fan speculation, Clarkson made her return on March 18 without addressing her brief hiatus. And since some episodes were pretaped, the From Justin to Kelly star was once again absent the next day, when Andy Cohen hosted the March 19 episode. But thank God she was back again for the episode we were in the studio audience for, which aired March 20, just in time to celebrate the show’s landmark 1,000th episode. Though given her absences, the episode was probably somewhere in the 900s for Clarkson.

At the taping of the milestone episode at her Rockefeller Center studio (which the show moved to from Los Angeles in 2023), Clarkson was her usual chatty self and admittedly over-caffeinated — which would have given any court stenographer a run for their money. She also was dropping enough “motherfuckers” with her guest Tyler Perry to keep the editing bay’s bleep button busy for the rest of the day. In addition to Perry, who was there to promote his new film, Duplicity, her guests included Alicia Vikander (who brought Swedish candy Clarkson hated and spit out) and the Venezuelan pop duo Mau y Ricky (who gifted her alcohol, which was much more well received). The candy might have flopped, but the teaser for Vikander’s new movie, The Assessment, definitely won Clarkson over, in which Vikander acted out like a child to assess whether a couple would be good parents.

While “Since U Been Gone” would have been an apt Kellyoke for her grand return, the episode featured a prerecorded, stripped-down cover of Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing” — probably because they were worried about how I would react to seeing a Kellyoke live in person. But an iconic performance was still delivered for the show’s studio audience, when Clarkson had to reshoot a pickup of one of her questions after the interviews. Since the shot was just on her, she asked it to the empty couch before tossing her hair, turning to the audience, and declaring, “Acting!”

The highlight of the celebration six seasons in the making came via the show’s “What I’m Liking” segment, which normally features viral social-media clips, but for this episode was a montage of Clarkson’s kids River Rose (10) and Remy’s (8) many appearances on the show through the years. Naturally, the clips brought tears to the host’s famously hazel eyes. The montage included Remy’s iconic performance of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” from earlier this year, proof that Kellyoking is a genetic condition. And while musicians everywhere may have been resting easy these past few weeks knowing that Clarkson wouldn’t be Kellyoking their songs (Kellyoke is a verb), the queen of covers is back in Studio 6A and no song is safe.",vulture

Narrator enters stage right, sits down on a dimly lit wooden chair, and dabs forehead sweat with rag.

NARRATOR: These days, it’s just One Battle After Another.

Scene.

The upcoming Paul Thomas Anderson movie is one of the most anticipated films of the year, seemingly destined to be iconic even if it flops. It has a great cast and a respected auteur, and it was very, very expensive. That’s a recipe for, at the very least, a great awards season. Below is everything we know about the upcoming movie.

What does it look like?

In the first teaser trailer, out March 20, star Leonardo DiCaprio pensively sips a beer, intercut with shots of a machine-gun-shooting pregnant woman, a baby, and an unforgiving desert. “What are you gonna do about this baby?” a voice asks. Well, that’s an ominous question.

Who’s in the cast?

DiCaprio is the main draw, obviously, but don’t let his presence overshadow how stacked the rest of this cast is. Teyana Taylor (A Thousand and One), Regina Hall (Support the Girls), two-time Oscar winner Sean Penn (Milk), PTA fave Alana Haim (Licorice Pizza), and Benicio del Toro (Traffic) all star. Now that is a cast.

What is it about?

Uhhhh … unclear. The movie is reportedly based on Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland, which tracks, given that PTA previously adapted Pynchon’s Inherent Vice. Vineland is very much a book about the ’80s — set in 1984, a.k.a. Reagan’s America, it follows a hippie named Zoyd as he flashes back to the “free love” ’60s to explain how we arrived at the conservative era. One Battle After Another, meanwhile, is contemporary, so it’s hard to say how many liberties Anderson has taken with the source material in updating it.

What’s this about money?

Estimates by the The Wall Street Journal put the film’s cost at around $140 million. That’s not particularly notable for a blockbuster, but PTA isn’t known for creating blockbusters. His most successful movie at the box office was There Will Be Blood, which pulled in $76 million. His previous film, Licorice Pizza, cost just $40 million — that’s 100 million fewer dollars than his current project. Of course, the reason for the gamble is DiCaprio, one of the biggest stars around. Can he guarantee a hit? No, really, we’re asking.

When is it coming out?

One Battle After Another was originally scheduled to come out August 8, but on March 20, Warner Bros. pushed the release to September 16. The company explained the change as getting access to a global Imax release for its auteur film — the Oppenheimer playbook, basically. The move up in the year also gives the movie a slightly more awards-friendly release date, as most awards fare is released in the fall as opposed to the blockbuster summer. Leo vs. Timmy at the 2026 Oscars? That would be a battle for the ages.",vulture
https://vulture.com,The Wheel of Time Recap: Cities in Dust,https://www.vulture.com/article/the-wheel-of-time-recap-season-3-episode-4.html,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 14:00:29 GMT","The Wheel of Time He Who Comes with the Dawn Season 3 Episode 4 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Prime Video

The Wheel of Time is at its best when it lets the wheel stop spinning. During season two, when the show finally found its footing, it did so with the help of strong stand-alone episodes or lengthy segments: Nynaeve’s heartbreaking journey through the alternate realities of the Aes Sedai’s Arches, Egwene’s breaking at the hands of her Seanchan captor Renna. Historically, the show has always benefited from narrowing its focus.

Though I haven’t read it, I’ve certainly gathered from speaking to fans that the repleteness of author Robert Jordan’s source material is its main attraction. There’s simply a lot of stuff going on at all times, involving a lot of people from a lot of cultures in a lot of places following a lot of quests to achieve a lot of things, and if you have a certain kind of fantasy-nerd mind-set (as I do!), this is a ton of fun. So, I understand why that’s the show’s baseline approach. But boy, is it nice when The Wheel of Time stops to … I was gonna say smell the roses, but not on this show. No, this show only stops to rub its characters’ faces in the thorns.

So it is with this week’s episode, hands down the best of the young season so far. Its task is simple. After some initial business that further fleshes out Aiel society and culture, Rand al’Thor and Moiraine Sedai travel to Rhuidean, the Aiel people’s sacred “city in the clouds.” It’s actually a psychic crucible of sorts, a fog-enshrouded no-place where crystal columns rise up into the sky to guide the men who brave the empty city through their ancestral past, while three massive linked rings beckon female seekers to witness literally 1 million possible futures. Those who survive the ordeal exit as either clan leaders or Wise Ones, respectively.

One day, the Aiel prophecy goes, a man will enter and exit not just with one magical dragon tattoo, the customary marking the city doles out to those who have weathered it, but two, one on each arm. He is the Car’a’carn, the Aiel messiah, destined to be both the destroyer of these people and the savior of those who survive the calamity he brings about. You can guess how Rand’s arms look when he exits, I’ll bet.

But as with all such tests — reminiscent of everything from Frodo looking into the Mirror of Galadriel to Atreyu’s ordeals in The NeverEnding Story — it’s the journey, not the destination. Moiraine’s journey is comparatively simple to explain. When she arrives at the rings, she finds Aviendha floating there; the spear-maiden has secretly been a Wise One in training all along, one who wished to shirk her duty but has now been forced to lay down her weapons and follow her destined path. Moiraine follows Aviendha’s footsteps and finds herself suspended in midair amid the rings, which is one of the most striking and memorable visuals this show has yet served up.

While she hangs there, she’s forced to witness a thousand spins of the Wheel, showing her glimpses of her possible futures. In some, she is Rand’s servant. In some, Rand is hers. In some, she subdues him. In some, she kills him. In some, they are lovers. In some, she and Lanfear are lovers. And in many — many, many, many — Lanfear kills her, over and over and over. Moiraine knows that none of these futures are set in stone, but this one, at least, seems more likely to come to pass than the others.

Rand’s journey, by contrast, takes him backward through time. With each time warp, he’s thrown back further and further into the bodies of his most influential ancestors. His father, who killed the king of Cairhien, who dared cut down a sacred tree to make his throne. The first Aiel chieftain to set foot in Rhuidean, a city built by the Aes Sedai to show the Aiel their shameful past as oathbreakers. The young man who broke the Aiel taboo against killing and established the violent Aiel ethos as we know it while his pacifist countrymen, forever after known as the Tuatha’an, continue their wanderings. The old man who, with his grandson, kept that wandering tradition alive that left many of the Aiel ready to abandon the path laid out for them.

The loyal servant of the Aes Sedai who led the Aiel, originally a servant class in the capital before the Breaking of the World, into exile, each of them carrying a magic sapling in their wagon; his own contained a special magical item, a crystal ball called Sakarnen, a more powerful sa’angreal (or One Power-forged item) even than the legendary sword Callandor. The original Aiel man who worked for Mierin Sedai, the original identity of Lanfear before she freed the Dark One and became Forsaken, who returns to the fields to work with his people at her encouragement — to be spared from the destruction and collapse of the massive floating Death Star–size sphere that served as the capitol building before Mierin destroys it and cracks open a hole in the sky, from which the Dark One presumably emerges.

This is, obviously, A Lot. But it doesn’t feel that way — not the way the first three episodes felt, piling subplot on subplot and supporting character on supporting character until it felt like the whole thing might collapse under the weight. But I had faith in creator/showrunner Rafe Lee Judkins because he earned it during the last go-round. It was with some surprise and delight that I saw his name pop up as the writer of this episode, specifically, because it feels like a small triumph. How do you cram literally millennia of backstory and a million iterations of prophecy into a show without killing its momentum dead? You pack these infodumps into episode-long physical ordeals. You make those ordeals as telegenic as possible, borrowing from science fiction and video games to create haunting mist-enshrouded images, like Moiraine and Aviendha floating in the rings, or like a potential rival to Rand clawing his own eyes out rather than face the past the glass columns have forced him to confront.

In short, you make the infodump bitchin’.

There are many ways to skin this particular cat, mind you. Back in the heyday of Game of Thrones, creators David Benioff and Dan Weiss realized you could get away with some pretty dry dialogue regarding characters’ lineages or motivations if the characters involved were either naked themselves or watching naked people do naked things together. This approach was widely maligned at the time; the term sexposition was even coined as a derogatory marker of moments when backstories and backsides collided. Personally, I never understood the aversion to it. We’re watching an epic fantasy — there’s gonna be a gigantic history lesson delivered by somebody at some point, as surely as there will be sword and sorcery. Why not make those lessons more entertaining by delivering them while someone is getting their junk rubbed?

So it is here with The Wheel of Time. This isn’t sexposition, obviously, even though Moiraine’s visions of the future are notably randy at times. But it follows the sexposition playbook, simply substituting surrealism for nudity. The glass columns, the three rings, the anti-gravity suspension in midair, the man clawing his eyes out, the uncanny repetition of actor Josha Stradowski’s physiognomy throughout time, the sense that we’ve been sent hurtling forward and backward through time at a juncture point where the future could change on a dime — to say all this adds some pizzaz to what is essentially a Wiki entry on the history of the Aiel and of Rand’s family tree is to understate the case considerably. But that’s exactly what it does, as surely as if all this information had been delivered by Littlefinger as he watches prostitutes eat each other’s asses.

What I’m saying is that this is television, baby. Enjoy it while it lasts.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Reacher Recap: Western Exposure,https://www.vulture.com/article/reacher-recap-season-3-episode-7.html,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 14:00:29 GMT","Reacher L.A. Story Season 3 Episode 7 Editor’s Rating 2 stars * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Jasper Savage/Prime

Reacher’s third and, to date, weakest season deviates further from its source novel, 2003’s Persuader, as it heads into the home stretch. There’s no literary felony to prosecute here; it’s not as though the showrunners have changed the ending to The Scarlet Letter. Some of the changes to Lee Child’s book have been improvements: losing the Elizabeth Beck character, for one, who in the novel is yet another woman whose only role in the story is to be victimized.

The Los Angeles side quest that occupies a big chunk of this penultimate episode is a new-to-the-series element. With Reacher’s cover blown, he and Duffy need a new way to stay on Beck and Quinn’s scent long enough to rescue Teresa Daniel — the informant and recovering addict Duffy strong-armed into taking a secretarial job at Bizarre Bazaar, Beck’s rug-importing/gun-running business with the Bob’s Burgers–esque name. Even though it was Duffy’s surveillance of West Coast drug kingpin Darien Prado that put her onto Quinn’s trail, thus leading to her entanglement with Reacher — who was separately pursuing Quinn after randomly catching sight of the man he thought he killed 13 years earlier on the street, sure, whatever — it’s Reacher who remembers all of this and suggests the pair of them go see Mr. Prado.

Of course, it’s Reacher’s idea. While it remains irritating that no characters not named Reacher are allowed to be resourceful or even competent on Reacher — with the eternal exception of Neagley, whose spinoff series has already been announced, and the onetime exception of Kohl, who paid for her efficiency by being tortured to death back in 2012 — the show’s treatment of Susan Duffy is confounding. In the novel, she’s a step or two behind Reacher. On TV, she’s the least effective federal law enforcement officer since Robert Hanssen.

This penultimate episode of the season underlines this by having Duffy bring Reacher along to look in on Teresa’s grandma before they head to Logan Airport. It turns out Duffy is on a first-name basis with the woman whose granddaughter she placed in mortal danger after Teresa had kicked the habit and cleaned up her life. Naturally, this poor woman is ignorant of her friend Susan’s role in her granddaughter’s disappearance. But Nicky Guadagni gives a charming performance in this role, picking up on what she says is the palpable sexual tension between Reacher and Duffy. (“I know a thing or two about a thing or two.”) After protesting that their relationship is strictly professional, Reacher confides to Ms. Daniel that Duffy “just wants me for my body.” That’s the best laugh we get this week.

A snapshot of Teresa Ms. Daniel has stuck to her fridge reminds us of the human MacGuffin that’s been driving this entire season. “She’s a good shit,” her grandma says. Sweet-talker.

There follows a scene wherein Neagley sneaks up on a Chicago crook named Costopoulos as he’s collecting his morning paper. I hate to see anyone who’s still paying for daily newspaper delivery treated this way, but this is the guy who sent the two button men to Neagley’s office in the prior episode. He’s also the most loose-tongued character we’ve met all season, immediately spilling his guts when all Neagley has done is threaten to shoot him. Somehow, he knows that Julius McCabe, the man who ordered him to send the hitters, is also Xavier Quinn. “There are only a few people left alive who know that name,” he says.

“He’s not my boss anymore, but I was Quinn’s fixer back when he set up here,” Costopoulos continues. He tells Neagley the sad story of a Chicago-based family import-export operation that Quinn took over and eventually killed all the principals of, the exact playbook he’s now using with the Beck family and Bizarre Bazaar.

So how the Wrigley Field fuck is Costopoulos still walking around Chicago, Ontario intact, going out in his bathrobe to collect his own newspaper in his own hometown, when he knows all about the guy Reacher has described as “the most evil man I’ve ever known?” Not addressed! If Quinn were a tenth as dangerous as we’re been repeatedly told he is, Costopoulos wouldn’t be alive to tell Neagley any of this.

In a Los Angeles hotel room, Duffy is showing Reacher the surveillance video of Prado that turned out to be inadmissible because poor, dead Agent Eliot misread a map and shot the video from a place he wasn’t supposed to be. When Reacher asks her to make a part of the frame bigger, Duffy hits him with a “that’s what she said.” Her flirtation game is as sharp as her law enforcement game.

They still fuck, of course, because this is Reacher and Duffy packed a very nice bra. But it feels obligatory, even if it’s fun to see Duffy climb Reacher like a jungle gym. Each Reacher season has given our abnormally large vigilante hobo an statistically ordinary, human-size paramour. I’d like to see him coupled with a partner of commensurate tectonic stature in subsequent seasons. Is Gwendoline Christie available?

Because I made a whole thing out of Alan Ritchson’s mispronunciation of McLean, Virginia in episode four, and a far bigger thing about Sonya Cassidy’s war crime of a Boston accent all season, I should acknowledge that she pronounces Worcester, Massachusetts, properly in the scene in which she and Reacher accost Prado. Cheers.

Like Victor Maitland in Beverly Hills Cop all those decades ago, Prado is hiding his drug operation behind the front of an art gallery. Reacher and Duffy’s purpose in flying across the country turns out to get Prado to place a phony firearms order with Zachary Beck. I loved that their point of leverage against this drug kingpin is that he’s using a disabled parking placard. Reacher and Duffy tell him they will claim in court Prado threatened his doctor to get it, which would constitute his third strike, earning him a life sentence. Al Capone went down for tax evasion, so whatever works. The button on this scene comes when a throng of DEA agents arrive to search Prado’s gallery. Duffy already told us, way back in episode one, that she was handling this investigation unofficially after that blown surveillance warrant got her ordered off the Prado case, but who remembers these things? Maybe all these other DEA agents are working off the books, too.

Back in Maine, Beck meets up with who he thinks is Prado’s representative — Neagley — while Reacher, Duffy, and Villanueva observe. Villanueva asks Duffy if a visible injury on her arm is the result of her fight with Harley last episode; she dismisses it as a “rug burn.” Villanueva, his instincts honed by his decades of service as a lawman, intuits that the only way a human being can reasonably incur a rug burn is via high-friction hotel room coitus with a 250-pound man. “You were supposed to be working!” he protests.

Zachary Beck is now sporting a bandage where his right ear used to be. When Quinn demanded a “matching set” in the last episode, he might’ve meant he was going to cut off Richard’s other one, but it turns out he wanted a father-and-son set. Neagley reveals to Beck that she’s speaking for Reacher, not Prado, and tells him his only chance of surviving this ordeal is to find out where and when Quinn’s big gun deal is happening so Reacher can kill Quinn. The green-screen work behind Maria Sten and Anthony Michael Hall in this “quarry” scene is laughable, Weather Channel–grade. Beck tells Neagley the buyers are flying in from Yemen, but that’s all he knows. After letting not one but two spies infiltrate his house, he’s understandably been cut out of the loop.

Now, at last, we see Teresa Daniel handcuffed to a pipe in some dingy basement. Quinn might be a fourth-rate international criminal mastermind, but he’s a first-rate sadist. He laments to his hostage that he’ll soon have to deliver her to his customers. “I could’ve had you all to myself,” he tells her. “Use you up, then cut off all your pretty pieces. Throw you in the riptide like chum when the fun’s over.” Then he forcibly injects her with heroin. There’s no part of this that isn’t gross. The actor’s name is Storm Steenson, and she doesn’t even get a line. I hope she’s bound for better things.

Anthony Michael Hall’s best scene of the season comes when Zachary catches Richard trying to repair the broken toy revolver he bought his dad as a 50th birthday gift. When he discovers what his son has done to try to reconnect with him, he confesses that he withdrew from Richard intentionally after Quinn invaded their lives. He expected to be killed eventually, and he didn’t want his death to be as painful for Richard as the passing of his mother, years prior, already was. “No one gets training on how to be a dad unless you get it from your own dad,” Zachary says, “I didn’t.” Hall is so good in these few moments that I wonder if this scene was the reason he took what has often been a thankless part.

Neagley, now fully integrated into the Reacher-Duffy-Villanueva camp, tails Quinn’s customers after they land at a private airfield that Villanueva tells us the Bushes use when they fly into Kennebunkport. It’s jarring to hear a real-world political family name-checked in a show this divorced from reality. Duffy and Villanueva, meanwhile, tell Reacher they’ll need the ATF to back them up when they bust Quinn. Reacher objects on the grounds that the ATF, being a law enforcement outfit, will not allow him to execute Quinn — which he already tried to do once! “I don’t want justice,” Reacher says. “I want vengeance.” You’re not Batman, man!

When Duffy brings word of this massive gun deal to the ATF, Sears, the senior ATF man in the room, quite reasonably tries to cut her and Villanueva out, pointing out that it’s a gun case, not a drug case, and that all the evidence they’ve gathered has been obtained illegally. He finally agrees to let her and Villanueva watch the bust from the van. My favorite part of the scene is that Sears never asks who Reacher is until the big man who’s been standing in the corner looking pissed off opens his mouth. This Honda Fit–size dude dressed in jeans and a T-shirt made it into a conference room inside a secure government building where an imminent law enforcement operation is being discussed without having to identify himself. Maybe you are Batman, man!

That’s actually less plausible than the fact that Reacher is able to dip out of the ATF van to grab a sniper rifle that he says he bought from a pawn shop (!), then stashed in the trunk of Duffy’s car, I guess? He’s still hell-bent on killing Quinn, even after Duffy reminds him that this will mean spending the rest of his life on the run. Reacher says this wouldn’t change his lifestyle much, though we know he lives off of his Army pension. Instead of trying to arrest him, Duffy sulks back to the van.

Taking up a shooting position, Reacher calls Neagley to warn her to get rid of all evidence they’ve been in contact for the last week so she won’t be implicated in his murder of Quinn, who’s due any minute now. When Neagley tells Reacher he must be wrong because she’s still tailing the gun buyers, Reacher infers that the deal will be happening at Beck’s house and that he and the ATF have been lured into a trap.

Only one episode remains, and Reacher still needs to settle up with Paulie!",vulture

All season, I’ve been joking that Jesse Solomon (always both names!) and West Wilson (just this one time, both names!) have no boundaries with each other. They’re chatting when they poop, they’re in the shower together, they’re bro-ing out non-stop. But in this episode, it seems like they’re on a whole different level. It starts in the first opening moments when Jesse pulls up to pick up West and gets a kiss on the cheek. It continues at the house when Jesse is doing a handstand, and West is holding his legs to take a pic. As they fall over, West’s face gets perilously close to, how can I say this, Jesse’s Solomon. At the gym, West straddles Jesse to “spot” him, joking about how he “can’t get it up.” Oh, and when they return from the bar all drunken, Jesse pushes their beds together and West jokes that the weekend is about him and Jesse “renewing our vows and seeing what transpires.” Oh, I can see what transpires, and there is not a single eggplant emoji on my keyboard, so I can’t really type it out.

Are these two legit banging? Are they actually in love? Are they doing this just so I’m nice to them in the weekly recaps? Quite possibly, but probably not at all. It seems that Jesse is the reason they have bad boundaries. Just look at what is up with him and Ciara. Jesse flirts with her like he flirts with most of the other women in the house — did you see him put Gabby’s full head into his shirt? — but he flirts with her the hardest because he’s probably the closest to her. Before the big pirate party, Jesse is on a pool float with Ciara, and she puts her leg on his, and he jokes about how “this is kind of turning me on.” He then rolls over and goes into full body-on-body contact with her. This might have been a gag because he just got out of the pool and was getting her all wet, but this seems like my favorite Jim J Bullock sitcom, Too Close for Comfort. (If you got that joke, congratulations, you are now eligible for Social Security while it still exists.)

There are two reasons Jesse shouldn’t be doing this. One is that West confided in him that he’s still not making much headway with Ciara being nice to him in the house. West says, in confessional, that his phone is “always juicy,” but he’s prioritizing his relationship with Ciara in the house this summer, which is a very sweet sentiment. I applaud Jesse for trying to mend the relationship between his two friends, but the full-fire house of flirting might not be the right move, especially based on what Ciara says in her confessional: “Me and Jesse definitely flirt, but I don’t have any intentions behind it. I definitely think that if the opportunity presented itself, I have 90 percent on he would probably take it.”

This is exactly the problem. When Jesse flirts with Amanda or “gasses her up” on Instagram, it’s cute harmless fun. She’s married and not going to do anything, and he knows that. I love flirting. Go for it. But he clearly thinks Ciara is hot (because he is a human being with eyes), and she’s right; he would go for it. That’s not only awkward between him and West but also between him and Lexi, who is also in the house all summer. Yes, she’s absent this weekend, but if she and Jesse are still dating (please don’t let it be true), she’s gonna be pissed when she sees the way he was behaving with another single woman he is attracted to while she was away. This is awkward all around.

Speaking of awkward all around, let’s talk about Carl, who is throwing perhaps the best, most on-theme party that Summer House has ever thrown. This man got the entire set of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales in the backyard. He has a blue tarp covered in a little island, palm trees, shark fins, and a raft that Paige thinks looks enough like a bed that she’ll actually hang in it. I thought it was all going to look cheesy, but like Imrul’s shirt the moment he gets in the club, Carl really pulled it off.

As for how it’s going to go with Lil, the woman he invited to the party and has been chatting with, it’s unclear. Did you clock how they met? Amanda — winner of the best costume of the night for her parrot impersonation — tells the other girls that Carl went to a soccer game alone and met her parents. They somehow introduced them on social media, and she slid into the DMs. Okay, I’m sorry, but if my parents said to me, “We met a guy who is really great. You should date him. He was sitting alone at a soccer game,” I would tell them to put that troll back in his box and return him to his bridge.

Carl seems to be doing okay with Lil at the party, though. She’s complimenting his eyeliner and saying he looks like a lemur, which is good because she likes lemurs. But it’s when Jesse comes in that things really heat up. Jesse asks her what she does, and she says she’s a dancer and yoga instructor. Carl says he wants to go on a date with her before doing hot yoga together. Good on you, Carl, moving slowly and making your romantic intentions clear in a sweet and non-threatening way. However, that is not what Lil seems like she is after. Jesse just flat-out asks, “Are you staying over?” Then Lil looks at Carl and asks, “Am I staying over?” And then Carl looks at her and says, “You could stay over.” Bam! Done! Deal sealed! Consider this a date and go do hot yoga in the morning, my man. You can thank Jesse later.

Also super awkward is whatever is happening with Kyle and Craig, who are still beefing over Craig and his alcohol investment that may or may not have happened. It’s still hard to really say because there was more talk about the talk and when to talk and how to talk and where to talk and what to wear to talk and “all you do to me is talk talk, talk talk talk talk” like in the song “Talk Talk” by the band Talk Talk. I don’t know what the merits of the actual talk will be, but Kyle wins the talk about the talk. He says he texted Craig before the weekend to see if they could squash the beef, and Craig texted him back, but they didn’t talk. Kyle was right to get it out of the way, especially on Friday night after the rather tame (and by tame, I mean sober) birthday party they threw for Amanda. Craig insists that they talk the next day because he isn’t ready for it, and Kyle has to go into the backyard to wander around and mumble, which is apparently the only way he can deal with his anger other than getting totally wasted.

At dinner, Kyle dropped it because Amanda asked him to, but Kyle knew just what was going to happen: Craig was going to wait until the next day when there is a theme party planned, and then they have to have their talk talk while absolutely wasted and wearing costumes, which is not a dignified way to talk about business at all. At least Kyle has his priorities straight now that he’s calmed down about Craig. He says that he wants to try to preserve their friendship, mostly so that things between Paige and Amanda can stay copacetic.

Craig does not have this concern. He says that Kyle doesn’t even deserve a talk, so if he is going to talk, then it’s on his terms. I’m sorry, but no matter what Craig thinks about the merits of this feud, Kyle deserves a talk, if only because Paige and Amanda are besties. While Craig may not be ready to forgive Kyle, he needs to preserve the peace in the house and one of his girlfriend’s close friendships. Paige says as much, saying that she’s mad at Craig for reasons having to do with their own relationship, but she’s also upset at him with how he’s dealing with Kyle, and then she’s doubly mad that Craig can’t see that she is mad or why she might be mad.

The real revelation about these CEOs, founders, and entrepreneurs, however, comes when Paige and Amanda are chatting about it. Where is their chat? It’s in a bed, so you know Paige is at the height of her powers and telling the truth. Both ladies agree that Kyle and Craig are the sorts of dudes who need to be right, but not only that, they need the other person to relent to their rightness before they can move on. That’s why this talk is going to go horribly, and I, for one, can’t wait to watch it all go wrong in the next episode.

Paige also doesn’t tee Craig up to have a productive conversation because the episode ends with the two of them sitting in an inflatable raft talking about their relationship. It’s a continuation of the conversation from last week, which left a bad taste in Paige’s mouth that wasn’t from the kangaroo kebabs. Craig wants to feel like he’s still a priority to Paige even though she’s gotten really busy with her career, but he also admits that she hasn’t actually made him feel like he isn’t a priority yet … he’s just worried that he’s going to feel like that. We’re all responsible for our partner’s feelings, but if we’re also responsible for any potential feelings, then we would never stop arguing long enough to enjoy whatever relationship we’re having.

Pagie has been very open that her life and career are very different from when they started dating. Her priorities and her lifestyle have changed, and she should not be apologizing for that, period. Yes, to continue a partnership, they’re going to have to make room for each other among their busy schedules, but if Craig is more worried about how he might feel about her success, then he isn’t really supporting her in that success, and it makes absolute sense why they would break up over this issue.

As they were not rowing a raft across the party, Jesse told West they needed to go into the kitchen and try to find a bottle opener. West dug through the drawers, rattling around random cutlery, spatulas, slotted spoons, and a random juicer as Jesse, in his Captain Jason from Below Deck Down Under costume, looked on with a smile. “Dude, I can’t find it,” West says.

“I didn’t ask you in here for a bottle opener,” Jesse said, standing right next to West. He took three steps toward the counter, backing West up so his ass, as juicy as his phone, hit against it. West, a little nervous, let out one of his signature giggles. Jesse placed a hand on West’s shoulder and slowly rubbed his way down his bare bicep. “I just wanted to tell you that you make a really handsome pirate,” Jesse said. His eyes were locked on West’s, which were locked on Jesse’s. They were in a tunnel of their own longing, the energy sluicing back and forth between them, as Jesse put his index finger under West’s chin, slowly propping it up so that Jesse could put his lips right on West’s. The kiss lasted a little bit longer than it should have. Jesse put all his weight on West, leaning both of them against the counter, and a certain stiffening happened in both of their pants. Finally, Jesse broke it, and his eyes went back to West’s. After a pause, he said, “Damn. Don’t lose that mustache.”",vulture

Of all the innovations of the new era, the thing I hate the most is three tribes of six. No, wait, it’s the final four fire-making challenge. No, wait, it’s the tribes. No, it’s the fire. No, it’s the tribes. But tonight, it really is about the tribes. I think this episode proves that having three small tribes is an absolute failure because, so often, one of those tribes is decimated, and it screws up the game entirely. Jeff says he likes the small tribes because there is nowhere to hide. I’m telling you where they can hide: a winning tribe! After this week’s elimination, there are 14 players remaining in the game, and only seven of them have been to tribal council. Is this how we do it on Survivor, Jeff? Half the people can be almost to the merge and never have engaged in voting someone off, the defining activity of the whole game.

This episode marked what I would consider a failure of a tribe swap, taking one tribe of three and two tribes of six and combining them into three tribes of five, which makes sense for all sorts of challenge reasons. After tonight’s episode, you can go to Jeff’s overly complicated URL and vote on what will happen in Survivor 50, including whether or not there should be a tribe swap. Even this vote is a little bit bullshitt-y because it’s not just a question about if the tribes are swapped but how. I don’t mind a tribe swap, but we’re 50 seasons in; can’t we switch it up a bit?

This swap relied on the classic Survivor method of everyone drawing new buffs, and that determines what tribe they are on. Yes, it’s up to luck. You might as well have them roll dice. As I always say, nothing on this show should be left up to luck. I would also contend that swapping up three full tribes this early in the game when we haven’t really gotten to know two of the tribes, because they haven’t been to tribal council, actually makes it a worse viewing experience. It’s hard to keep track of who is where and what the dynamics of that tribe are. Now, we need to learn where everyone is now, where they were before, who they talked to before, and who they talk to now, and keep that all straight for three tribes. For the casual viewer, that’s far too much.

What if, to even out the tribes, they kept them mostly the way they were? All you really needed was to add one player from each of the bigger tribes to Vulu, which you don’t even know what color that is because you’re still learning the tribes. (Actually, you know it’s green because they’re the ones that keep losing.) That way, viewers still know mostly who is on Cika and who is on Lavo, and they won’t get too confused. (Actually, it’s Civa and Lagi, but you didn’t even notice the difference because you still haven’t learned the tribes.) By subtracting one number from each tribe and adding them to a new tribe, it will allow all new dynamics and relationships to flourish with the least amount of intervention.

There are a number of creative ways to divvy this up that have nothing to do with luck. Let’s say Civa and Lagi both do a challenge, like the classic hold-a-bucket-of-water-up-as-long-as-you-possibly-can challenge. Whoever drops their bucket first goes to Vulu. Or better yet, whoever wins picks the person from their tribe (which could also be themselves!) to go to Vulu. This is also going to create movement in the dynamics, because if the evicted Civa or Lagi member makes it to the merge, they’re going to hate the person who sent them there and maybe their whole tribe, which would then keep the post-merge game from being all about the same tribes they started in.

There’s another method that I think Survivor needs to explore more, and that is taking some of the social-experiment dynamics from shows like Squid Game: The Challenge and Beast Games, things that will be familiar to the younger YouTube-addicted fans who also watch Survivor. This show was the true pioneer of reality television, but without pushing some boundaries and going into some new experimental directions, it’s in danger of looking tame and boring in comparison.

What if Jeff said, “There are 15 of you, and you have 15 minutes to make three new tribes. If you don’t do it in 15 minutes, we’re eliminating two people.” This would be a real twist because not even these superfans on the cast would see it coming. It’s totally new and would require them to think about the game in a way without precedent. Or, even better, he tells each tribe they need to get rid of one person to go to Vulu; he doesn’t care how they figure it out, but they have to do it in an allotted time.

What has always made this show interesting, from when Richard Hatch invented the idea of alliances, is the interpersonal dynamics at play. We’ve seen from both the aforementioned shows that letting the players select their own destiny under pressure is a lot more heart-wrenching and surprising than just letting good old Lady Luck decide what is going to happen.

Okay, enough free ideas from me for this recap. After the utterly random selection of tribes, we have Chrissy, Mitch, Cedrek, Sai, and Bianca on the new Civa; David, Eva, Charity, Star, and Mary on the new Lagi; and Joe, Shauhin, Thomas, Kyle, and Kamilla on the new Vulu. Immediately, we know that Vulu is going to be the one to lose and go to tribal council. Why? Because the “Previously on Survivor…” is all about Thomas and his Steal-a-Vote, Kamilla and her extra vote, and Kyle and his idol. Why would we need to know and remember all of this unless it’s coming up at tribal?

Rather than bore you with the details of the challenge, which we already know how it’s going to end, let’s have a little update on David and his girlfriend, who we learned last episode told him she was going to dump him if he didn’t win $1 million so she can be the stay-at-home mom of four. Well, it turns out she already has. When talking to his new tribe, he says she dumped him over money issues. David, this woman does not want you! She wants a rich man who is going to give her the kind of life you can’t give her right now, which means she doesn’t love you. She loves an ideal of a certain kind of life, and she’ll take it from anyone (with at least six visible abdominal muscles). David says if he wins the big prize, then the first thing he’s going to do is ask her about her ring size. Why? She’s already dumped you, dude. This relationship is gone! Let it go! (This suddenly feels way more like one of my Real Housewives recaps than it does Survivor.)

As much as I hated the tribe change-up, the episode was saved by Kyle and Kamilla’s fantastic performance post-merge at Vulu. They’re all slumming it in a shitty camp with no flint — punishing the new tribe members for losses made by people who are no longer on the tribe — and Kyle and Kamilla make the smart decision to pretend like they’re not that close or working together. Kamilla tells the California Girls — Thomas, Shauhin, and Joe — that she wants Kyle out, and Kyle tells them he wants Kamilla out. The best part, honestly, was Kamilla saying she was at the bottom of her tribe and they were going to vote her out. The California Girls hear this and think they can keep her around and add her as a number. She quickly establishes so much trust in these guys that Shauhin searches Kyle’s bag right in front of her, essentially telegraphing to her how they’re going to lay their votes at that night’s tribal council.

Shauhin didn’t find the idol (it was in Kyle’s shoe, not his bag), and the CGs made no contingency plans, mostly because Thomas didn’t tell him about his extra vote. I’m always banging on about not telling people they have advantages, but this was the time for Thomas to speak up. Even though they didn’t find an idol, they could have done two on Kyle and two on Kamilla, and even if Kyle played his idol and they both voted for Thomas, it would have been a tie, and the remaining players could have sent Kamilla home. Instead, they loaded up on Kyle, who played his idol, and Kyle and Kamilla voted out Thomas, my middle-aged, mustachioed, slightly bitchy (complimentary) doppelgänger. At least now I know that if I played Survivor, I would be voted out on day eight.

However, there are two reasons why the California Girls didn’t switch up their strategy. Why? First is because Kamilla is playing an excellent game. (Based on editing, David, Sai, Kamilla, and Eva seem to be the ones to watch.) The other reason why they didn’t play as much defense is that they had never been to tribal council before. They don’t know how it works. Why? Because they were hiding on a winning tribe. So, while I will definitely be voting that there is no tribe swap, I’d much rather be voting to go back to the old days with two bigger tribes where really interesting dynamics were allowed to flourish. It’s not called hiding; it’s called relationships, and that’s why we’re here.",vulture

In unanimous bipartisan agreement, Bob Weir has been voted the most swoll man in rock and roll at the age of 77. Just look at those delts! The founding Grateful Dead member, who’s passionate about shredding his glutes just as much as his guitars, told Rolling Stone in a new interview that he’s lately been too busy to film more of his much-loved “gymming” videos. However, he has a new fitness regime if anyone is interested in trying it out for themselves. “I’ve taken up running barefoot in the morning on rocky roads. Because I think that’s a great way to get grounded,” Weir explained. “I don’t run very fast, because I want to breathe through my nose. And I try to incorporate meditation into that. And sometimes I meditate with a mantra and sometimes I just straight-up meditate while I’m running. Or trotting, I guess, really. It’s a practice that’s amounting to something for me.” Asked why he subjects his feet to the ground as opposed to, say, wearing socks, Weir insists the physical and emotional calluses are worth it. “I just followed my footsteps, really. We’ll see where it leads to,” he added. “Maybe I’ll live longer, or at least happier.”",vulture
https://indiewire.com,"Who Wants Sundance? Salt Lake, Boulder, and Cincinnati Make Their Pitch",https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/sundance-2027-move-salt-lake-boulder-cincinnati-1235103612/,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:30:00 GMT","Attendees at this year’s Sundance were abuzz about where the festival would choose to relocate in 2027. Is it staying in Utah, but shifting to Salt Lake City? Heading east to Cincinnati, Ohio? Boulder, Colorado? Everyone has a preference, but it’s up to Sundance, not us. However, we decided to hear the same pitches (or, a reasonable facsimile) that will help Sundance make its decision and talk to the people who know those cities best.

IndieWire spoke with film commissioners from each of the three finalist cities. We allowed them, in their own words, to give us their best pitch for their town as the new home for Sundance. From the number of venues to available lodging, affordability, accessibility, and overall vibe, these are the factors that Sundance leadership must weigh before announcing its decision, which is expected to come this spring.

With everything we know now, we don’t envy the choice they have to make.

Salt Lake City

Venues: News flash! There’s an Eccles Theatre and a Main Street in Salt Lake City, Utah, too. Sundance has long presented festival showings in SLC, and there’s a cinephile community with year-round programming via the Salt Lake Film Society’s arthouse Tower Theatre and downtown’s Broadway Center Theatre. The city could also expand into many other performing arts facilities, theaters, restaurants, and Music Cafe options.

Utah Film Commission director Virginia Pearce, who put in 14 years working for the festival, enjoyed walking the city with her Sundance host committee and seeing it with fresh eyes. “There’s a lot of standalone, big, purpose-built theaters,” she said. “We have the Capitol Theatre, and the gorgeous, old Grand Theatre within a couple of blocks of each other, and the Megaplex at the Gateway. We would be enthusiastic to find locations that meet [Sundance’s] needs.”

Right now, Sundance needs more screens than theater-starved Park City can offer.

Lodging: Salt Lake would expand the scale of available hotels and Airbnbs. These include a range of major hotel chains, like a brand-new Hyatt and the Hotel Monaco, a Clifton hotel. “We have some beautiful spaces looking out over the mountains from the Valley perspective, such a cool view,” said Pearce, “as well as some independent hotels that could be a great fit. We are a major capital city that hosts large-scale events all the time.”

Salt Lake has the capacity to host not only the Olympic Games (in 2002 and again, in 2034) but regular play for their national sports teams the Utah Jazz (NBA), the Utah Hockey Club (NHL), Real Salt Lake (MLS), and the Utah Royals (NWSL).

Affordability: The popularity of Sundance saw Park City prices skyrocket for housing, dining, and parking near the ski resorts in Park City and Deer Valley. It became a problem for Sundance attendees as well as the festival, which must bring host filmmakers and local staff. In recent years, Park City seemed less welcoming. “It’s a tough road for the city to handle,” said Pearce. “It’s been tough for festivalgoers and the festival itself. It has been a challenge on both sides.”

Move the festival to Salt Lake, with Park City as a special opening- or closing-weekend location, and costs plummet. “Park City is a small, small town,” said Pearce. “Salt Lake and Park City got together and came up with some innovative ideas about how to create a new experience that expands the festival footprint to Salt Lake. There are more hotel rooms, more venues, more restaurants. It’s a larger city, and so those costs would be negotiable in a much broader way. The pitch we made is keeping some things in Park City, just because it’s got that feel that people love, but growing a lot more in Salt Lake. It’s up to Sundance to think about what would fit best with their programming needs.”

Sponsor Opportunities: Upscale Park City and Deer Valley would remain a lure for sponsors who want to entertain clients in ski resorts. Salt Lake City offers “all of the things you get with a big city,” said Pearce, “but you can also be skiing at six or seven resorts within 30 to 45 minutes. So I don’t think much would change.”

Pearce expects Utah Health would remain a loyal supporter as well as longtime sponsor Adobe, which has a significant presence in SLC’s tech center, Silicon Slopes. “Tech would be a great area to expand into,” she said.

Airport Access: SLC is a Delta Airlines hub with a still-new airport and direct flights from most major cities, including Atlanta, New York, and Minneapolis, plus super-cheap fares from Los Angeles. The airport is four miles from downtown and 45 minutes from Park City.

Local Vibe: Salt Lake has grown into a sophisticated urban sprawl with a vibrant downtown, thriving art scene, and bustling nightlife with street vendors and musicians. “You can be in the outdoors, skiing, and hiking and biking in 15-20 minutes,” said Pearce. “It’s easy to get in and out, it makes a great space for creative and business people alike.”

Skiing is way off-site in several locations, including Park City. Salt Lake’s an enormous city, after all; it accommodated the Winter Olympics in 2002.

“The most fun of this process is getting all of the partners together,” said Pearce, “like the Downtown Alliance and the Chamber of Commerce, and thinking about how could we host a big festival down here? They obviously host giant events like the NBA All-Star Game all the time.”

Bottom Line: According to Utah’s economic impact report, in 2024 the Sundance Film Festival generated some $132 million in gross domestic product for Utah, plus 1,730 jobs, $69.7 million in Utah wages, and $13.8 million in state and local tax revenue.

“Sundance belongs in Utah,” said Pearce. “It’s been here 40 years. I have personal history with them. Two other members on our host committee were former managing directors. It’s hard to go anywhere in Salt Lake without hitting someone who has worked for Sundance. Everyone has a place in their heart for the festival in Utah. A lot of people just can’t imagine it being anywhere else.”

From the start, Utah has supported the festival financially at the state, county, and city levels. “Both cities, Salt Lake and Park City, have been supporting financially since the beginning,” said Pearce. “The legislature has been supportive and allocated $3.5 million to Sundance.” If Sundance stays in Utah, the legislature will approve an ongoing 10-year contract at that level.

Yes, but: There’s one serious rub. The Republican Governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, currently has on his desk a bill (HB77) passed by the Utah legislature that would ban the flying of certain flags in all schools and government buildings, including the LGBTQ pride flag.

“Bye Felicia,” Senator Dan McCay, the sponsor of the flag ban bill, posted on social media. “Sundance promotes porn. Sundance promotes alternative lifestyles. Sundance promotes anti-lds themes. Sundance does not fit in Utah anymore.”

LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have urged the governor to veto the bill. Cox has until March 27 to sign it, and has been hedging. Clearly, while he wants the festival to bring revenues to the state, he has not thought through all the ramifications of signing or vetoing the bill. “No, I won’t veto that bill,” he told reporters. “At least I don’t think I will. I don’t know. Maybe I will. I don’t know.”

Back in January, Cox sang a pro-Sundance tune at his monthly PBS Utah news conference: “Sundance is Utah, and Utah is Sundance,” he said. “You can’t really separate those two. So we’re really hopeful that we can provide the type of package … to keep Sundance here.”

If Cox signs the flag ban bill, it would represent a hostile environment for the notably inclusive Sundance in Utah and the festival would have reason to go elsewhere. For now, Sundance is keeping mum. “Yes, HB77 could contribute to Sundance’s decision to leave Utah,” Troy Williams, executive director of Equality Utah, posted on X. “Please … veto this bill.”

“Once we have Sundance’s decision,” said Pearce, “it will be an easier conversation to have about the future.”

Cincinnati

Venues: Cincinnati wants to host Sundance in its Over-the-Rhine neighborhood. Once a German working-class neighborhood, it’s now one of the hipper spots in town. The neighborhood’s Washington Park is flanked by several historic theaters that would become Sundance venues, including nine walkable spots within a radius of a few blocks. These include the Cincinnati Music Hall, Memorial Hall OTR, and the Woodward Theater, all accessible via a free streetcar that traverses Over-the-Rhine.

There are 30 venues within three miles of the proposed festival footprint, including an AMC multiplex on the other side of the Ohio River that would leave room to grow. Some will require larger screens, but Kristen Schlotman, Film Commissioner of Cincinnati, says the houses vary in size to offer diverse options for Sundance’s screenings.

Lodging: In addition to a healthy mix of hotels and Airbnbs across the city, most major hotels are within a 15-20 minute drive from the airport. Nearby University of Cincinnati also offers a number of lodging amenities and with three major sports teams, it’s equipped for tourism. Schlotman added that at least eight new hotels are being built over the next two years.

“Cincinnati truly is on the precipice of some great change and growth, and doing that with a partner that’s also on the precipice of great change and evolution … is a really exciting time for both,” Schlotman said.

Affordability: Because it’s not a traditional college or resort town, Schlotman believes Cincinnati has more affordable options for attendees. She also promises that the Film Office is working with the tourism board to make sure “rates aren’t gouged.” She also points to filmmakers like Todd Haynes, Alexander Payne, David Lowery, Yorgos Lanthimos, Kelly Reichardt, Jennifer Kent, and George Clooney, who have all shot films in the city. Cincinnati worked hard to convince filmmakers to shoot there; wooing Sundance will be about convincing people of the “quality of life” Cincinnati has to offer.

Sponsor Opportunities: Once the home to many Fortune 500 companies, some of Cincinnati’s major events that have attracted other buzzy sponsors include BLINK, a street art, light-installation, and projection mapping festival; and AFCI, the Association of Film Commissioners International, which will bring its 50th anniversary to Cincy in 2025. The University of Cincinnati also has a School of Communication, Film, and Media Studies that, in theory, could partner.

Airport Access: A 15-minute drive from the festival footprint is a major plus. That said… it would be a stretch to describe the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) as a major consumer hub. (CVG handled 9.2 million passengers in 2024; SLC handled 28.4 million.) It’s a cargo hub for Amazon and DHL, and an operating base for low-cost airlines Allegiant, Endeavor, and Frontier. Schlotman says the city is securing letters of intent from various carriers to increase air traffic for Sundance, much as it did when Cincinnati was in the Super Bowl in Los Angeles. For now, however, there is one nonstop between Los Angeles and Cincinnati; it’s a Delta redeye.

Local Vibe: Cincinnati is not a cozy mountain town, but Schlotman believes that Race Street in Over-the-Rhine has enough independent shops, restaurants, and bars to capture the vibe of Main Street. Schlotman emphasizes its walkability, green space, and natural beauty.

“Look, I can’t build mountains in Cincinnati, but I can certainly understand that it’s important to be connected to nature, to community, and to nurture the individual storyteller,” Schlotman said. “As long as we’re reflecting that, I think that’s what we can do.”

Bottom Line: Cincinnati’s biggest challenge remains perception. (One Sundance attendee told IndieWire they didn’t like the idea of eating at The Cheesecake Factory after a world premiere, to which Schlotman said, “Ohio is not one big strip mall.”) She said Cincinnati offers the largest fundraising entity for the arts in the country. Some of the city’s champions, like producer Christine Vachon, have made the case to the film community that Cincinnati has as much of an artistic presence as anywhere.

“I don’t know that people realize that Cincinnati has long been a place for discovery and innovation, and we’ve been investing in the arts and nurturing artists — individual artists and the film industry — for a long, long time,” Schlotman said. “I think that might surprise people. People might not know the importance of the arts to a city like ours.”

The current mayor for Cincinnati is a Democrat, but JD Vance’s half-brother Cory Bowman, a Republican, is running for the mayor seat. Schlotman couldn’t comment on the incentive the city is offering, but a local report suggested that Cincinnati has already approved $2.5 million for Sundance upfront, with an additional $2.5 million (bringing it to $5 million) if it is selected as the host city.

Boulder

Venues: Right off Boulder’s Pearl Street, a four-block pedestrian mall that spans from 11th to 15th street is the century-old, 850-seat Boulder Theater. From there, it’s a mile and a half to the 16-screen Cinemark Century Boulder, offering four times as many screens as Park City’s annual venue Holiday Village, which is itself about the same distance from Park City’s Main Street corridor.

Other Boulder venues include the beloved and beautiful Macky Auditorium, a concert hall that seats more than 2,000 and could become the city’s version of the Eccles for big-ticket premieres. The Dairy Arts Center, a 20-minute walk from Pearl Street (which hosts many of Boulder’s hotels) seats 500. There are various screening spaces at the University of Colorado Boulder, whose own robust film program, which offers training in cinema studies and filmmaking, could provide an ample student volunteer body as well as other partnership opportunities.

As Visit Boulder CEO Charlene Hoffman said, “There is also a new arts and events center already in the works as part of a 1-million-plus-square-foot, mixed-use residential and arts district, as well as discussions to winterize Chautauqua Auditorium if awarded the bid.”

Added Colorado Film Commissioner Donald Zuckerman, “We’re in the Mountain West, and this town has a lot of history with the Redfords. Why wouldn’t Sundance want to be in the Mountain West? People identify Sundance with that. We have wonderful proximity to the university. We’ve had conversations with the Sundance hierarchy and they’re thrilled at the idea of working with kids who study at the university.

“These kids can work at Sundance and meet the filmmakers,” he said. “Right now, it’s too expensive to go to Park City. Kids can’t do it. Young filmmakers can’t do it. There’s been talk that they’ve outgrown Utah. We believe that’s true, and we believe we can offer everything they’ve got that was positive and more. More reasonable prices. Walking distance between venues. Great weather, don’t forget that. We have cold snaps here and there, but it snows here and melts the next day.”

Lodging: Boulder offers a share of both luxury and economy hotel options, including the Limelight Boulder hotel opening this August, with 252 guest rooms and 26,000 feet of event space — including a first-for-downtown-Boulder conference center that could host festival panels. The Moxy Boulder, located near the Macky Auditorium, also opened in 2024. The downtown St. Julien Hotel & Spa brings a luxury option .

Affordability: Anyone who’s visited Park City in peak season, whether for skiing or Sundance or both, has experienced rate-gouging. Boulder, which is not a ski town, typically sees a dip in tourism in the early winter months (January and February). That suggests the city has the infrastructure and readiness to welcome something like the 72,000 attendees Sundance saw in 2024 (spread out, of course, across its 10 days, but with most coming for the first weekend).

“We collaborated with our local lodging partners to secure stable hotel pricing for the Festival over the proposed 10-year period, safeguarding attendees from price surges,” Hoffman said. “Our home-sharing program offers structured pricing tiers and incentives to enhance affordability and accessibility. And our downtown business community is committed to demonstrating to Sundance that they prioritize a long-term partnership over short-term profits.”

Sponsor Opportunities: Boulder’s rugged surrounding terrain and hiking culture could lure outdoor recreation sponsors, while Google offices on Pearl Street provide an opportunity for partnership with the tech giant.

“The entire Colorado Rocky Mountain wilderness sits at Boulder’s doorstep, and our luxury tour operators routinely provide customized outdoor experiences designed for travelers seeking to experience adventure in comfort,” Hoffman said. “As one of the wellness capitals of the West, it’s also a place where attendees can embrace unique relaxation, nourishment and rejuvenation experiences. Exceptional art, Michelin-star dining, and the ‘Rodeo Drive of outdoor apparel shopping’ on Pearl Street round out Boulder’s offerings.”

Airport Access: Boulder is about a 45-minute drive from Denver International Airport, the third largest international airport in the United States. That’s on par with the schlep from Salt Lake City’s airport to Park City. The Denver airport services nonstop flights from Los Angeles and New York and is a hub for international flights coming into and out of the United States.

Local Vibe: With sunshine most days of the year and gentler winters, the walkable and wood-nestled Boulder has public transportation that circulates around town year-round in part due to the university population. “Pearl Street is a walker’s paradise right in the heart of town filled with stores and restaurants that are primarily one of a kind, they’re not chains, and it’s wide and roomy and closed to traffic,” Zuckerman said. Plus, there’s nearby skiing in Breckenridge, Aspen, and Vail.

“Producers and financiers are going to come to Colorado and say, ‘Why don’t we think about making a movie here?’ We’ve been very light on incentives compared to neighboring states, and that’s starting to change,” he added. Zuckerman said that a well-known Hollywood producer plans to move his production company to Boulder this spring.

Another incentive: Recreational marijuana is legal for those 21 and over in Colorado. The state also doesn’t have Utah’s alcohol laws, which has some of the strictest volume limits in the country.

Bottom Line: Governor Jared Polis is the first non-incumbent openly gay man elected to Congress, and the decidedly blue Colorado doesn’t carry Utah’s baggage of hostility given its current anti-LGBTQ legislation on the table. Ohio trends toward the GOP; it will inaugurate its next governor in January 2027, weeks before the Sundance Film Festival. Sundance is celebrated as a festival of diverse viewpoints, and whatever political backdrop the event heads into, the festival will want to take that into consideration.

“We are a blue state. We will remain a blue state,” Zuckerman said. “We don’t believe in censorship. We don’t have a book-banning law on the books. We don’t have anti-trans bathroom law on the books. We are one of only two state legislatures in the country that have a gay person in the legislature [trans Colorado representative Brianna Titone]. We’re a perfect home for anybody who wants to come here. They will not be treated poorly ever or with anything but respect.”

In terms of incentives, Boulder is less competitive than Salt Lake but offers robust cash for Sundance’s relocation. The Colorado Economic Development Commission approved a one-time $1.5 million incentive to support Sundance’s move to Boulder, with other contributions from the city and regional partners. The Colorado Office of Film Television and Media, meanwhile, has committed to $250,000 over five years.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Warner Bros.’ Mishandling of ‘Looney Tunes’ Under David Zaslav Is Nothing New — Just Extremely Silly,https://www.indiewire.com/features/animation/why-warner-bros-mishandles-looney-tunes-zaslav-1235110127/,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","While it looks like there may yet be some justice in the case of “Coyote Vs. Acme” — if it indeed finds a new home and a theatrical release with Ketchup Entertainment — fans of the “Looney Tunes” still find themselves at the mercy of far greater forces than Bugs Bunny behind an animator’s desk.

Warner Bros. Discovery pulled its catalog of the original “Looney Tunes” cartoons, a collection of animated shorts that stretch from 1930 to 1969, beginning on March 16 as part of a wider effort to rebrand the streaming platform as a place much more for adult and family content as opposed to children’s programming. One consolation is that there are some iterations of “Looney Tunes” made between 1995 and 2022 that are still available. Another is that this isn’t the first time Warner Brothers has decided to vanish “Looney Tunes” content.

Back in the early 2000s, Warner Bros. pulled “Looney Tunes” off of Cartoon Network. Where previously the likes of Elmer Fudd and Foghorn Leghorn had shared programming space with Batman and Fred Flintstone, Warner Bros. left a void that they themselves then tried to fill with different “Looney Tunes” cartoons. “[It was] a year or so before ‘Looney Tunes: Back In Action’ was released. That move really hurt the franchise,” animation historian and CalArts professor Jerry Beck told IndieWire. “And of course, ‘Back In Action’ tanked.”

In August of 2024, Warner Bros. also put the kibosh on Genndy Tartakovsky’s R-rated, Looney Tunes-inspired 2D film “Fixed,” from New Line and Sony Pictures Animation (made by Renegade Animation and Lightstar Studios), about a dog that has 24 hours to have fun before getting neutered — that may be another rescue mission for Ketchup Entertainment if “Coyote Vs. Acme” goes well.

Whatever the streaming performance numbers on Max, “Looney Tunes” has always been a very healthy IP and the top studio brass’s dismissal of Duffy and his chums hasn’t stopped non-stop licensing and merchandising of “Looney Tunes” characters. But it’s a bit of a lonely echo of the standard operating procedure a couple of decades ago when a young Eric Bauza, now the voice of Daffy and Porky in “The Day The Earth Blew Up,” would spend all of his allowance money on “Looney Tunes” merch at the mall while watching the cartoon and practicing his Mel Blanc impression.

“You look at our competitors from across the street and they’re just cranking out shows left, right, and center with these characters — multiple shows with these beloved characters. Granted, they do have a nice theme park and we have a small section of Six Flags,” Bauza told IndieWire. “I wish it were different.”

‘The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie’ Ketchup Entertainment

Beck told IndieWire that Warner Bros. Discovery seems much more comfortable placing their bets on Batman and DC Comics IP, with Hanna-Barbera stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo” filling the gaps, when it comes to animation. “They can never go wrong with those,” Beck said.

DC and “Batman,” in particular, also have the benefit of playing far more into the darker fantasy worlds that anchor HBO’s favorite live-action children, “Game of Thrones” and “Harry Potter.” Even if the “Looney Tunes” put their spin on more operas, there’s a lighthearted, clever playfulness that doesn’t quite fit the current grim-dark brand.

“Looney Tunes” also fights against a tide that is currently running away from 2D animation. “The industry seems to have moved on — but 2D will exist and continue. There are always rumors that Pixar or Dreamworks have a 2D feature in development and my animation students at CalArts, Woodbury, and UCLA are chomping at the bit to join a hand-drawn project. There is a lot of talent waiting in the wings for a revival,” Beck said. “ I believe that will happen at some point.”

‘The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie’ Ketchup Entertainment

In fact, the beauty of 2D is something that “The Day The Earth Blew Up” hopes to use “Looney Tunes” to prove. “[2D is] kind of a lost art form and hopefully a movie like this will [revive interest],” Bauza said. “It’s a very art deco style and that’s all [writer/producer/animator] Alex Kirwan’s part in this film. He’s a big Art Deco guy and harkens back to a Mary Blair-type style, very simple shapes. We also have an artist named Nick Cross who did some of the art direction on this and a lot of the paintings. Just some really renaissance artists worked on this, I believe.”

A true revival will need the success of more than one feature film and some willingness on Warner Bros. Discovery’s part to reinvest in the inventive mayhem that “Looney Tunes” represents. “The cartoons just need to be out there on some platform to support it,” Beck said. “If they will be back, Warner Bros. Animation (Sam Register and crew) understand the characters — the company on high doesn’t. It’s pretty sad.”

But the good news is that, even if they aren’t on Max anymore, the iconic characters aren’t yet in danger of fading into the Merrie Melodies title card in the sky. “All the ‘Looney Tunes’ are available on a free broadcast channel that anyone can pick up: MeTV TOONS. All you need is an antenna,” Beck said. “In New York and LA, MeTV TOONS is on Spectrum Cable, the Frndly TV and Philo apps, and multiple broadcast sub-channels. And Warner Archive Collection has released numerous Blu-ray collections of the best of the best Looney Tunes (a new one, ‘Looney Tunes Collector’s Vault Collection,’ comes out in June).”",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,‘One Battle After Another’ Teaser: Leonardo DiCaprio Teaches His Daughter to Shoot in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Tenth Feature,https://www.indiewire.com/news/trailers/one-battle-after-another-teaser-leonardo-dicaprio-pta-1235110215/,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 13:43:57 GMT","Paul Thomas Anderson‘s mysterious film finally has a title — and a new release date. Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” which has been deemed his most “commercial” project yet, reunites him with Warner Bros. Pictures film chiefs Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy, the executives who produced Anderson’s most recent film, his 2021 feature “Licorice Pizza.” De Luca also brought “Boogie Nights” to the screen during his New Line tenure.

With “One Battle After Another,” auteur Anderson is working with both new and familiar faces, the biggest of whom is Leonardo DiCaprio, who is making his PTA debut with the comedy-thriller. It’s a “Licorice Pizza” reunion for Anderson with Alana Haim and Sean Penn; the cast also includes Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor, Shayna McHale, Wood Harris, and “Presumed Innocent” star Chase Infiniti, who plays DiCaprio’s onscreen daughter.

The teaser still leaves a lot of questions about the film’s plot. However, it’s rumored that “One Battle After Another” is inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s 1997 novel “Vineland” about a “zone of blessed anarchy in Northern California that is the last refuge of hippiedom,” per the book’s synopsis.

The full novel description reads: “Here, in an Orwellian 1984, Zoyd Wheeler and his daughter Prairie search for Prairie’s long-lost mother, a Sixties radical who ran off with a narc. ‘Vineland’ is vintage Pynchon, full of quasi-allegorical characters, elaborate unresolved subplots, corny songs (“Floozy with an Uzi”), movie spoofs (Pee-wee Herman in The Robert Musil Story), and illicit sex (including a macho variation on the infamous sportscar scene in V.).”

It is known, though, that Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” is set in the present day. Anderson wrote the script and produced the film alongside Sara Murphy and the late Adam Somner. The feature, which was shot on 35mm film using VistaVision cameras, is getting an IMAX release from Warner Bros.

DiCaprio has a slew of other projects in the works, including various Martin Scorsese collaborations. The long-awaited “Devil in the White City” adaptation is now set at 20th Century, with Scorsese directing and DiCaprio starring. “Home” is also in the works at Apple with Scorsese producing. The rumored Frank Sinatra biopic with DiCaprio portraying the singer (and Scorsese directing) has since been shelved.

“One Battle After Another” will be released in theaters on September 26 from Warner Bros. Check out the teaser below.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Mystery Dramedy ‘Ludwig’ Gets Everything Right — Apart from Its Actual Mysteries,https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/ludwig-david-mitchell-bbc-britbox-detective-mysteries-1235103340/,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 18:00:00 GMT","“If we can demonstrate who did it, and how, then the why doesn’t really matter,” claims Detective Chief Inspector (sort of) James (sort of) Taylor in BritBox’s latest cozy murder mystery, the original smash hit “Ludwig.” It’s a get-out clause for both the character and the show itself, neither of whom are particularly interested in the concept of motive. In fact, when it comes to its cases-of-the-week, the six-part series isn’t really interested in the culprit or the method, either.

First screened on the BBC last September to great acclaim and a large audience, “Ludwig” is an unusual detective dramedy in how it appears to treat its whodunits as an afterthought. The first investigation, for example, centers on a solicitor stabbed to death with an antique letter opener — a crime which instantly positions the show in twee middle England territory a la “Midsomer Murders” and the forthcoming adaptation of literary phenomenon “Thursday Murder Club.”

Yet we learn nothing about the victim, or the parade of suspects hastily whittled down via a logistics puzzle so incomprehensible even the police force can’t interpret its results. Any armchair sleuths hoping to test their clue-cracking skills will be left similarly frustrated by the fact breadcrumbs are practically non-existent throughout.

When the resolution isn’t head-scratchingly convoluted, it’s hopelessly mundane. See Episode 5, where the killer frames a schoolmaster’s murder as suicide within a locked room, the laughably lazy explanation for which wouldn’t appear out of place in a pantomime. The second episode’s case of the disappearing scam artist, meanwhile, hinges on a microscopic change in wallpaper patterns.

Those with homicidal tendencies also possess a remarkable inclination to confess all when confronted with evidence so circumstantial it would be laughed out of court. Almost every episode gathers all possible defendants, Agatha Christie-style, to point the finger at someone who conveniently crumbles for the flimsiest of reasons.

‘Ludwig’ BBC/Britbox

For a premise rooted in the world of conundrums, its answers rely far too heavily on ol’ dumb luck.

Luckily, the show’s overarching storyline, and the motley crew it envelops, aren’t so groanworthy. Come for the deadly mysteries, stay for the familial love triangles, abandonment issues, and fish-out-of-water comedy derived from the identity theft of an identical twin.

All three center around David Mitchell’s John Taylor who, as the sudoku-led title sequence suggests, earns his living writing cryptic puzzles under the pseudonym of his favorite German composer (whose sonatas cleverly permeate the soundtrack). But his reclusive, borderline agoraphobic lifestyle is suddenly torn apart when sister-in-law Lucy (Anna Maxwell Martin) calls him out of the blue and insists he make the 140-mile taxi journey to her home, no questions asked.

Trusting the bond they developed as childhood friends — highlighted endearingly by Lucy’s bargaining tool of spaghetti carbonara — John reluctantly follows such orders to learn his detective twin brother James has gone missing. To determine his whereabouts, and why he left a worrying “Burn After Reading” letter of resignation beforehand, Lucy demands John impersonate him to retrieve a potentially revealing notebook at Cambridge police HQ.

“Ludwig” draws plenty of comic mileage from this scenario alone, as John struggles to get to grips with anything outside his hermetically-sealed wheelhouse: his car parking skills, for example, which make Mr. Bean’s look flawless, or the mobile phone he hasn’t used since it was gifted at Christmas 2004. Then there’s his painful attempts at small talk. “You know kids today… with their skateboards,” he responds after a “colleague” enquires about his “son.”

‘Ludwig’ BBC/Britbox

Of course, John is forced to further overcome his fears of the outside world when his roleplay proves to be a little too convincing. Apparently Cambridge’s greatest minds aren’t able to tell the difference between their confident, competent colleague of many years and his untrained, socially inept doppelganger — even when he amusingly refers to a post-mortem as a “how did they die test?” — and he’s soon roped into the first of many unsolved murders.

Mitchell might not exactly be stretching himself here — he’s essentially playing a more sympathetic version of his star-making, typecasting role in “Peep Show.” Nevertheless, few comedy actors are better at inhabiting the bumbling, buttoned-up Brit. And he gets plenty of opportunity to showcase his strengths, whether it’s wrestling with car seat belts and police tape, desperately trying to avert his eyes from the sight of a corpse, or rallying against the ills of the modern world.

“Buildings, offices, computers,” he vexes after a stress-inducing first day on the job. “Everyone talking at once — moving around with no structure, no purpose!”

As you’d expect, John soon becomes the force’s secret weapon, much to the ire of Lucy, who grows increasingly irked at how his small undercover mission has turned into a new career. Best-known as permanently exasperated mom Julia in “Motherland,” Maxwell Martin bounces off Mitchell brilliantly, also lending their lifelong relationship a will they/won’t they frisson which intensifies the longer they spend in each other’s company.

‘Ludwig’ BBC/Britbox

John’s rapport with the rest of the unit is just as entertaining. Possibly connected to the case which scared James into hiding, Russell (Dipo Ola) serves as the audience’s stand-in, responding to all of his new partner’s idiosyncrasies with a mixture of bewilderment and awe. Sophie Willan and Gerran Howell provide plenty of laughs as sardonic IT consultant Holly and wide-eyed newbie Simon, respectively. And Dorothy Atkinson is a regular scene-stealer as firm but fair boss Carol.

As the BBC’s most-watched scripted original of 2024, “Ludwig” has already been given a second season. That’s a good get, considering its central enigma — which throws in everything from conspiracy theorists to police corruption into the knotty mix — remains open-ended. If it’s to continue investigating elsewhere, however, then “How do you make a murder mystery worth investing in?” is the riddle it first needs to solve.

The first two episodes of “Ludwig” are now streaming on BritBox, with new episodes available weekly through Thursday, April 17.",indiewire

“Coco 2” will reunite the original film‘s directors Lee Unkrich (“Coco,” “Toy Story 3”) and co-director Adrian Molina (“Coco”). Oscar-winning producer Mark Nielsen (“Toy Story 4,” “Inside Out 2”) will produce the film. The film is tentatively slated for release in 2029.

“While the film is just in the initial stages, we know it will be full of humor, heart and adventure,” said Iger. “And we can’t wait to share more soon.”

Disney and Pixar’s “Coco” introduced Miguel, a 12-year-old with dreams of becoming a musician despite his family’s generations-old ban on music, who ventures to the vibrant Land of the Dead to unlock the real story behind his family history. “Coco” won two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song (“Remember Me”). The film also won a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture–Animated, a BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and Critics’ Choice Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Song.

The original “Coco” made $817 million worldwide for Pixar at the box office back in 2017.

Upcoming for Pixar are “Elio” coming out this summer, which is an original property, as well as “Toy Story 5” coming next year. After a few disappointing turns at the box office with “Lightyear” and others that were kicked just to Disney+, Pixar is returning to the well for other IP, as it did with “Inside Out 2” last year, and it’s also moving away from longer-form series such as the recently released “Win Or Lose” or “Dream Productions” on Disney+.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,‘Revelations’ Review: ‘Train to Busan’ Director Yeon Sang-ho Returns with a Glossy Netflix Thriller About a Pastor Who Sees God in All the Wrong Places,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/revelations-movie-review-netflix-yeon-sang-ho-1235110262/,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:00:00 GMT","Effectively splitting the difference between the crude human drama of his animated work (e.g. “The King of Pigs,” “The Fake”) and the genre spectacle of the blockbuster fare that followed (“Train to Busan,” “Psychokinesis”), Korean director Yeon Sang-ho returns with a glossy psychological thriller about a church pastor who’s cucked so hard that he convinces himself it’s an act of God.

And yet, the real problem for Pastor Sung Min-chan (“A Taxi Driver” star Ryu Jun-yeol) is that he’s not alone in mistaking earthly hardship for a kind of divine instruction, as “Revelations” will soon find the good father crossing paths with a serial kidnapper who claims his crimes are committed at the behest of a “one-eyed monster,” as well as a young detective who believes that her dead sister — one of the criminal’s previous victims — is urging her to catch him from the afterlife.

Each of the characters in this unholy trinity is trying to quiet a voice in their head, and as the uneven strands of Yeon’s morally complex but narratively convoluted movie begin to knot together, those voices will start to scream over the others in an effort to sound like justice.

Reworked from Yeon’s comic of the same name (co-written by Choi Gyu-seok), “Revelations” is the kind of layered yet messy adaptation that results from someone trying to find new ways of telling a story they’ve almost thought to death already. It’s a movie with slippery footing and a solid foundation, both of which are on full display throughout a needlessly complicated first act that puts all of its characters in motion (while taking great pains not to reveal the full extent of their personal traumas and/or relationships with each other).

That starts with the zealous Min-chan, whose eyes burn with evangelical zeal as he preaches in front of a neon red crucifix at his rundown church in a sad part of Seoul. It’s the kind of place that tends to attract lost sheep into its flock, and so Min-chan is unfazed when the visibly unwell Kwon Yang-rae (Shin Min-jae) wanders into a rainy afternoon service. Unlike us, the pastor hasn’t seen Yang-rae stalk a scared teenage girl into the building (he’s too preoccupied with the private detective who’s been documenting his wife’s torrid affair), and by the time Min-chan starts to suspect that his newest parishioner might be a wanted abductor, Yang-rae is already halfway out the door.

When the pastor’s son goes missing from daycare later that afternoon, Min-chan assumes that Yang-rae must be the culprit (an assumption encouraged by his cheating wife’s insistence that all of this is the pastor’s fault, and therefore his problem to fix), and so he follows the felon to a road that snakes into the hills outside the city… where Yang-rae attacks Min-chan, and the man of God seems to kill the criminal in self-defense.

That would be a legally acceptable explanation, but Min-chan — concerned about the impact that ending someone’s life might have on his chances to be hired as the pastor of a new mega-church — elects to bury the body, even if that might complicate the police’s efforts to locate Yang-rae’s latest victim. Not Min-chan’s son (he’s fine), but the girl who Yang-rae followed into his service earlier that day. This decision will prove to be a great frustration for Detective Lee Yeon-hui (Shin Hyun-been), who’s made it her mission in life to avenge her dead sister and bring Yang-rae to justice.

It’s a sweaty set-up made all the sweatier by director Yeon’s reliance on flashbacks, cell phone mishegoss, and his immediate struggle to balance this triangular story between the pastor and the policewoman who unequally prop it up. Detective Lee’s introduction is awkwardly shoehorned into the chaos of Min-chan’s descent towards Hell, and at no point during the 100 minutes that follow does “Revelations” find a way to make her personal journey feel like a meaningful counterweight to Min-chan’s crisis of faith. It doesn’t help that Shin is given exactly one emotion to play (guilt-stricken rage), while Ryu — as a hyper-pious man who would rather warp any number of evils around God’s will than question the righteousness of His word — is invited to sink his teeth into the juicy role of a jilted pastor who sees a divine plan in every sick twist of fate.

They say God reserves his toughest battles for his strongest warriors, but to watch Min-chan provide emotional comfort to the missing girl’s mother as the police search for where Yang-rae might have stashed her, it would seem that he only feels like one of God’s strongest warriors because he turns every part of this story into a battle of biblical proportions (a dynamic that Ryu’s performance makes vividly clear as it bends his character’s goodness all the way around into an evil of its own). Yeon has been critical of organized religion in the past, but “Revelations” serves as a fascinating counterpoint to “The Fake” because its protagonist isn’t a charlatan so much as a feverishly sincere believer — one who sees Jesus’ face in the side of a rock formation, and the shape of an angel flapping its wings in the clouds above.

Min-chan becomes convinced that punishing Yang-rae is his divine purpose here on Earth, to the point that he begins to interpret every wild development in this story as its own deus ex machina (which conveniently allows Yeon’s screenplay to get away with murder). The pastor’s need to make beautiful sense of this badly fucked up world opens the door to any number of sins, until his egocentric perspective is in such violent conflict with the detective’s own justifications — and perhaps the kidnapper’s as well — that “Revelations” threatens to spill into Park Chan-wook territory.

There’s gripping entertainment to be found in the sequences where Yeon’s characters desperately try to arrange themselves into a shape that might satisfy their own sick angles, and there’s no denying that Min-chan and Yeon-hui make for compelling adversaries. Alas, “Revelations” has great difficulty threading a basic detective story into the fabric of the operatic moral thriller that Yeon weaves around it, and the film’s thesis — people invent gods and monsters in order to explain the senseless tragedies that befall them — is ultimately sanded down to its broadest form in service to the cheap suspense of rescuing a missing child before it’s too late.

Far more interesting than the race-against-time climax is the quieter coda that follows. “Why does the lord keep leading me back to you?,” Min-chan asks Yang-rae earlier in the film. Perhaps, the uneasily ambivalent final moments of this movie lead us to wonder, because the pastor couldn’t think of anywhere else to go.

“SNL” alum Fey co-creates, co-showruns, writes, executive produces, and stars in the upcoming series “The Four Seasons,” which is based on the 1981 feature film of the same name. “The Four Seasons” reunites Fey with her “30 Rock” collaborators Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield, who also co-create, co-showrun, write, and EP the show (Fisher additionally directs).

Fey is joined by former “SNL” cast-mate Will Forte and “Date Night” co-star Steve Carell for the series, which is a reunion within a reunion (within a reunion) for the cast. Fey and Forte play a couple who have to sniff out which of their other married pals are on the brink of divorce across four vacations.

The official synopsis reads: “Six old friends head for a relaxing weekend away only to learn that one couple in the group is about to split up. The three couples, Kate (Tina Fey) and Jack (Will Forte), Nick (Steve Carell) and Anne (Kerri Kenney-Silver), and Danny (Colman Domingo) and Claude (Marco Calvani), are completely upended by the news. Over the course of a year, we follow the friends on four vacations, and watch how this shake-up affects everyone’s dynamic — sending old issues and new bubbling to the surface.” Erika Henningsen also stars.

“The Four Seasons” is additionally executive produced by David Miner, Jeff Richmond, and Eric Gurian.

The original “The Four Seasons” film was written and directed by Alan Alda, produced by Martin Bregman, and starred Alda and Carol Burnett. The film followed a couple (Alda and Burnett) who vacation with their friends and get entangled in a comedy of errors. Alda was a recurring guest star on Fey’s “30 Rock.”

“The Four Seasons” also is one of the many Netflix projects Colman Domingo has been a part of: The actor/producer starred in series “The Madness,” and led Netflix’s “Rustin” which earned him an Oscar nomination. Aside from Netflix, Domingo is set to make his directorial debut with “Scandalous” starring Sydney Sweeney as Kim Novak and David Jonsson as Sammy Davis Jr. Domingo previously helmed an episode of “Fear The Walking Dead.”

“The Four Seasons” premieres May 1 on Netflix. Check out the teaser below.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,"‘The Residence’ Review: Netflix’s Wacky, Well-Padded Whodunit Doesn’t Hold Up",https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/shows/the-residence-review-uzo-aduba-netflix-1235104286/,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","There’s no mystery to the guiding ethos of Shonda Rhimes’ new Netflix series, “The Residence.” Episodes take their titles from popular mysteries like “Dial M for Murder” and “The Last of Sheila.” Characters name-drop fictional sleuths like Columbo, Sherlock Holmes, and Benoit Blanc. (“Knives Out,” a Netflix property, also lends its title to Episode 3.) Shots center a book by Agatha Christie, and dialogue references the board game “Clue.”

Like the White House edition of Hasbro’s oft-copied party game, “The Residence” is a murder-mystery, a detective story, a whodunit. As if there was any doubt to its classification, someone actually says, “Ooo, I love a whodunit” in the middle of answering the question within the noun. But it’s not only a whodunit, nor was it created by the genre’s usual suspects: “The Residence” is also a comedy, filled with more caricatures than characters and less suspense than bemused curiosity.

That it was produced by Rhimes’ Shondaland studio (known for the period romance “Bridgerton,” the sudsy medical drama “Grey’s Anatomy,” and the White House-set political thriller, “Scandal”), written by Paul William Davies (who wrote for “Scandal” and last created the short-lived ABC legal drama, “For the People”) and “inspired by” former White House correspondent Kate Andersen Brower’s nonfiction book, “The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House,” speaks to just how many peculiar cooks were crowded into this particular kitchen.

None of whom, it should be said, are known for dishing up who-donuts. “The Residence” capably imitates its many mentioned influences, and its affable cast helps the hour-long episodes go down easily enough, but it also treads water too often, struggles to shape its own story, and traps its lead performance in a hollow character’s shell. Even without an answer to the series’ central question — only seven of the eight episodes were made available for review — it’s clear Cordelia Cupp’s inaugural case doesn’t hold up.

“Who’s Cordelia Cupp?,” you may be asking. Played by three-time Emmy winner Uzo Aduba, Detective Cupp is the world’s top investigator. Her name sparks the aforementioned comparisons to famous fictional counterparts — she’s the “real” Jessica Fletcher, Miss Marple, or, in true alliterative harmony, Charlie Cale. In this week’s episode year’s season, Cupp’s task is typical: She has to find out who killed A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito). What’s atypical is the setting: Mr. Wynter, the former chief usher at the White House, is found just a few doors down from where the President sleeps, as a densely attended State Dinner takes place downstairs.

Not only does the site of the murder up the investigation’s profile, but the 157 people wandering around at the time of A.B.’s death also makes identifying his killer a huge time-suck (and, you know, quite difficult). Cupp has to sit down with everyone, sort through their stories, separate fact from fiction, conduct her own research, and avoid getting boxed out of the investigation by the powers that be (who rush her, doubt her, and generally get in the way of things). It’s a considerable challenge, and one Cupp takes on with exacting patience and precision.

First, she’s got to get to know the bigwigs. The President of the United States, Perry Morgan (Paul Fitzgerald), isn’t all that pushy, but his family more than makes up for it. His indecisive husband (Paul Witten) takes too long to share too little substantive information. His drunk mother-in-law, Nan (Jane Curtin), takes too long to share too much insignificant information. His brother (Jason Lee) is a deadbeat who can’t be trusted to tell the truth until the third or fourth try, and President Morgan’s oldest friend, Harry Hollinger (Ken Marino), keeps trying to steer Cupp toward a conclusion that’s as politically innocuous as possible in order to protect his best bud (and meal ticket).

But the bulk of Cupp’s conversations — as well as the heart and soul of “The Residence” itself — are held with the staff: the butlers, servers, engineers, chefs, managers, housekeepers, electricians, and many more of the men and women who keep the President’s household in pristine condition. The show comes alive when digging into the details mined from Brower’s book, whether it’s the historic policies that dictate treatment of the First Families or how the house is mapped out like a game board, complete with hidden passageways and secret rooms. A.B. used to run the show, so every one of his behind-the-scenes assistants has their own opinion of the deceased, as well as first-person accounts of his whereabouts that night, water-cooler gossip about various White House goings-on, and plenty more subjects that may or may not matter to determining who dun it.

“The Residence” indulges these ostensibly off-topic tangents for reasons that are both adequately addressed in the narrative and purely beholden to its length. Early on, Cupp responds to the complaints of her impatient colleagues by explaining she needs context to accurately understand what happened to A.B. Wynter. She can’t simply pinpoint a suspect, push them to confess, and call it a day. She needs to see the situation from every angle and then question anything askance until it’s been straightened out. To that end, Cupp doesn’t even believe in “suspects.” She just finds people (and what they have to say) “interesting,” which only infuriates her fellow authority figures who want to resolve the case as quickly as possible.

Here, though, is where “The Residence” starts to deteriorate. For one, Cordelia may need to talk to everyone and hear everything, but the audience watching her does not. This is a TV show. It’s meant to be entertaining. A good murder-mystery keeps you guessing, sure, but it does so by planting persuasive red herrings and following promising leads. It doesn’t just overwhelm you with superfluous information while talking down to you at the same time — like it’s holding your hand in a rapidly flooding room instead of simply turning the nozzle to quell the rising tides.

Instead of action driving the story, Davies (who writes every episode and serves as showrunner) tries to create momentum through regular repetition and quick cuts; dialogue bounces back and forth between characters like a ping-pong ball — the same core names or phrases batted between parties, who add just the slightest spin to each line to lend the appearance of actual progress. (ex. “Hold on.” “Yes?” “Him?” Yes.” “Who is he?” “St. Pierre.” “Say it again.” “St. Pierre.” “Just St. Pierre?” and so on.)

“The Residence” also repeats itself visually by spreading itself across three timelines: You’ve got Cordelia in the White House, conducting her investigation — let’s call that the present. Then you’ve got the White House staffers recalling the events that lead up to A.B.’s death (obviously, the past). And then you’ve also got a third timeline — the actual “present” — set during a Congressional hearing meant to clarify for the American people what really happened that night. (Al Franken and Eliza Coupe play opposing senators leading the committee.)

Seven hours into the eight-hour first season, I can’t tell you why we need three timelines, except to make sure viewers who are only half-watching don’t get confused, and to help extend “The Residence” to the standard length of a modern TV season. (Without all the redundancies, this could’ve been wrapped up in, oh, three-to-four hours, max.)

That time would’ve been better spent, however, investing in characters — or at least one character. With such a large ensemble, it’s inevitable that most parts will be one-dimensional. That’s fine. Let Jane Curtin lean all the way into her drunk judgey mother-in-law. License Jason Lee to turn loose his screwball side. Demand Ken Marino crank his politco’s sleaze-meter all the way up to 11. These are suspects who largely exist as comic relief — they don’t need to be deep, they just need to be funny (and, when the story calls for it, suspicious). (They’re also the best performances, alongside Susan Kelechi Watson, who shines despite serving as as a de facto tour guide.)

But why is Cordelia Cupp similarly one-note? Beyond the audience’s preexisting adoration for Uzo Aduba, there’s very little about her character to latch onto. Here’s what we know about Cordelia Cupp: She’s patient (when she needs to be patient), she’s dedicated (to the point of obsession), and she really, really, really likes birds. She’s an avid bird-watcher — a birder. Wherever she goes, she carries around binoculars to spot birds. She carries around a big book of birds to identify birds. She carries around a little checklist of birds she’s seen and where she’s seen them. She uses birds to explain herself, she uses birds to explain the case, and she even eats like a bird — she eats tinned fish, like a seafowl that’s adapted to land.

“The Residence” leans on Cordelia Cupp’s birding fixation to make her seem quirky and eccentric — because anyone who’s smarter than everyone else can’t look or act like everyone else — but birding isn’t a personality. It’s a hobby. It doesn’t develop Cordelia as a character. It just traps her in a single character trait, while emphasizing her lack of depth and the show’s lack of imagination. Combined with Cupp’s rude and repeated dismissal of the universally affable Randall Park (who’s so inextricable from his character they share a last name), her flat characterization keeps her far removed from the beloved TV detectives she’s built to imitate.

This isn’t an investigator you’d happily follow from one unsolvable case to the next, so much as a plot device masquerading as a person; her single-minded obsession with the case a transparent mask for the show’s single-minded focus on reminding viewers of other, better whodunits.

Maybe just watch those instead.

https://indiewire.com,How Ryan Gosling and the Pandemic Helped ‘The Actor’ Find Its Tone,https://www.indiewire.com/features/podcast/ryan-gosling-helped-duke-johnson-give-the-actor-voice-1235103088/,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","Director Duke Johnson‘s new film “The Actor” creates a unique bond between its lead character and the audience, using a variety of subjective techniques to convey the title character’s perspective to the viewer. From repurposing sets and actors playing multiple roles to various aural and visual motifs that all contribute to a sense of disorientation and déjà vu, the movie is filled with moments that allow the audience to intimately share the protagonist’s experience.

As an actor struggling to figure out who he is and where he belongs after an accident leaves him with amnesia, André Holland is so perfect for the part that it’s difficult to imagine the movie without him. But Johnson initially spent a lot of time working with another actor — one whose discussions with the director ended up dramatically influencing the shape of the script.

“The original script found its way to Ryan Gosling,” Johnson told IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “We ultimately ended up working together over the course of a year and a half during the pandemic, developing the script and trying different iterations.”

One of the film’s greatest strengths is its delicate and unique tone, which is haunting and dreamlike yet clear in its intentions; the script skillfully balances humor, tragedy, and suspense without ever losing sight of its larger philosophical concerns related to identity and memory. Finding the right mix of elements largely grew out of Johnson’s conversations with Gosling. “The story could go in a lot of different directions,” Johnson said. “There are opportunities for humor, there are opportunities for thriller and more surreal elements.”

Johnson and Gosling explored all of those possibilities through a variety of script iterations. “We wrote a more thriller-leaning version, we wrote a more rom-com-leaning version,” Johnson said. “It was a nice way to work. It was more labor intensive, but were had nothing to do because there was a pandemic. So it was kind of fun to try all of these iterations and see what floated to the top. That just organically shaped the narrative that we ended up trying to shoot.”

Ironically, by the time Johnson was ready to film his script he and Gosling felt their collaboration had shifted somewhat. “At a certain point Ryan felt more like my collaborator in a creative development kind of way,” Johnson said of the actor, who retains a producing credit on “The Actor.” “The story that we were shaping ultimately seemed like it wasn’t the right vehicle for him. And when scheduling conflicts started to arise, we started talking about ideas for other actors. Once André’s name came up, it was one of those things like, ‘Oh yeah, we wrote this movie for André, it’s meant to be.'”

https://indiewire.com,William Chisholm to Buy Celtics in Record $6.1 Billion Deal,https://www.sportico.com/business/team-sales/2025/bill-chisholm-celtics-sale-6-1-billion-1234843982/,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 13:52:35 GMT","A group led by William Chisholm and backed by private equity fund Sixth Street has reached an agreement to buy the Boston Celtics, according to multiple people familiar with the agreement, in what will be the most expensive NBA team sale in history.

The managing partner of Symphony Technology Group, Chisholm has agreed to buy the team in two stages, which was the stated goal of the Celtics’ current ownership, led by the Grousbeck family. The deal values the team at $6.1 billion in the first payment.

Irving and Wyc Grousbeck announced the deal Thursday morning in a letter to Celtics investors. Sixth Street has committed more than $1 billion to the deal as an equity partner, according to multiple people familiar with the process. The group also includes Rob Hale, a current Celtics investor, and Bruce A. Beal Jr., president of Related Companies.

“This was an extremely thorough, rigorous sale process,” the Grousbecks said in the letter. “We had tremendous interest from potential control owners and we’re grateful for the considerable time and effort bidders put in over the past few months, especially. In the end, Bill and the group he put together came in with a superior final bid.”

Wyc Grousbeck will remain the team’s governor through the 2027-28 season.

The agreement concludes a sale that was closely tracked, both in the NBA and other U.S. leagues, as a barometer for sports valuations overall. The Celtics are among the NBA’s most successful and most popular franchises, but they are a tenant in their arena and own just a small piece of their local media partner. Sportico values the team at $5.66 billion. A common question among insiders over the past few months has been whether the team would sell for more or less than $6 billion.

This deal carries a blended valuation of about $6.6 billion. That’s by far the most ever paid for control of an NBA team, eclipsing the $4 billion valuation when Mat Ishbia bought the Phoenix Suns a few years ago.



Chisholm was born and raised in Massachusetts and attended Dartmouth College, as did two of his children. He is the co-founder, managing partner and chief investment officer of STG, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif. STG’s portfolio includes more than 50 active and closed investments, with about $10 billion of assets under management, as of March 2023. Prior to starting STG, Chisholm co-founded The Valent Group, and he also worked at Bain & Company and PaineWebber.

Sixth Street has more than $100 billion in assets under management. In addition to its Giants LP, its other sports holdings include Legends and NWSL club Bay FC, plus minority investments in the San Antonio Spurs, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona.

Sixth Street would join Arctos Partners and Blue Owl as PE firms with multiple NBA team investments. Arctos is invested in the Golden State Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers, Sacramento Kings and Utah Jazz, while Blue Owl holds stakes in the Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota Timberwolves and Kings.

The current Celtics owners bought the NBA team in 2002 for $360 million. They announced that the franchise was for sale last July, less than two weeks after winning an NBA-record 18th championship. The group’s stated reason was estate planning in the Grousbeck family, who currently control the team. Irving Grousbeck is about 90 years old, and his son Wyc has run the team for years. Wyc said that week that his family wanted to sell the Celtics in two stages—51% now, and the rest in 2028—with the provision that he stays in control until the second transaction closes.

Sportico reported last week that four groups remained engaged in the process. They were Chisholm, Phillies owner Stan Middleman, the Friedkin Group, and existing investor Steve Pagliuca.

Pagliuca was viewed by many throughout the process as a front-runner, and said his group was “saddened” by the outcome in a statement on social media. “We made a fully guaranteed and financed offer at a record price, befitting the best sports fans in the world,” the statement said. “We had no debt or private equity money that would potentially hamstring our ability to compete in the future. We felt it was the best offer for the Celtics.”

He added that if the Chisholm sale doesn’t go through, “my partners and I are ready to check back into the game and bring it home.”

BDT & MSD and JPMorgan Chase co-led the sale process for the Celtics. Jordan Park served as an advisor the Grousbecks.

(This story has been updated with an excerpt from the Grousbecks’ letter to investors, and near the end with Pagliuca’s statement. It has also been updated in the third paragraph to add additional clarity around Sixth Street’s investment.)",indiewire

Bolden made history as the first Black U.S. Secret Service agent assigned to the White House detail, where he guarded President John F. Kennedy who had personally appointed him in 1961.

Coates has written the screenplay for the movie The Unseen Shield and will also direct the film, which is currently in pre-production with his producing partner Fetteroff Colen.

Bolden, a U.S. Secret Service agent stationed in the Chicago office, first met Kennedy while on assignment in that city. Bolden had played a key role in thwarting an assassination plot in Chicago months before JFK was tragically assassinated in Dallas. Thanks to Bolden’s investigation, Kennedy canceled a planned trip to Chicago, where he was set to address supporters of his 1960 election campaign.

“For many years,” Coates says, “dark forces have tried to erase the true story of former Secret Service Agent Bolden. After Dallas, Bolden used his personal time off to travel to Washington D.C. and offer his testimony to the Warren Commission investigating the President’s assassination. Bolden was surprised to be whisked back to Chicago and arrested on fabricated charges of soliciting a bribe. He was acquitted but re-tried and convicted ending up sentenced to six years in prison.”

Watch on Deadline

Coates has retained Stephen Jaffe — a former Special Assistant to the New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner in Oliver Stone’s JFK), who famously re-investigated the Kennedy assassination in 1967-1968 — to serve as a technical consultant on the film and an executive producer. Jaffe was a producer of the first feature film on the Kennedy assassination, 1973’s Executive Action, starring Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan. It was written by Oscar winner Dalton Trumbo and produced by Edward Lewis.

“Bolden’s story was known to us back then but not directly relevant to what happened in Dallas,” Jaffe says. “However, the efforts to silence him were clear proof that there had been several plots to assassinate President Kennedy before Dallas.”

After Bolden’s 1964 conviction and sentencing, a movement to clear his name was started by people who learned of his compelling story and read the book. Finally, President Joe Biden granted Bolden a “full and unconditional pardon” in April 2022.

Coates, who just wrapped the psychological thriller Madonna Non-Grata starring Tamara Taylor, Eric Roberts and Isaac Keys, says he hopes to begin pre-production later this year as soon as he and his producing partner, Colen, have cast the lead role.",indiewire

https://indiewire.com,Who Is New Celtics Owner William Chisholm?,https://www.sportico.com/personalities/owners/2025/boston-celtics-new-owner-william-chisholm-background-1234844036/,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:38:48 GMT","William “Bill” Chisholm is set to become the next owner of the Boston Celtics in the largest sale for a North American sports franchise. Chisholm led a group that will buy the team in a $6.1 billion deal, Sportico reported.

“When we announced the sale of the team last July, we noted how important it was to us that the next owner of the Celtics fully appreciated what this team means to the city it represents and its fans far and wide,” current owners Irving and Wyc Grousbeck said in a letter to investors Thursday. “We know that Bill does (quiz him on Celtics trivia if you want to be sure).”

Wyc Grousbeck will stay on as CEO and Governor, overseeing team operations through the 2027-2028 NBA season.

Here’s a quick rundown of what to know about Chisholm, the man set to become the new Celtics owner, pending league approval.

Who is Bill Chisholm?

Chisholm was born and raised in Georgetown, Mass., 30 miles north of Boston. He played soccer at Dartmouth from 1988 to 1991 and then studied at Penn’s Wharton School, joining Bain & Company in 1996.

As an investor, Chisholm is the hands-on manager of Menlo Park, Calif.-based Symphony Technology Group (STG), a private equity firm with roughly $10 billion in assets under management that focuses on developing software businesses. Prior to starting STG in 2002, he also co-founded The Valent Group. Chisholm owns about a quarter of STG with cofounder Romesh Wadhwani holding the rest, according to a 2024 regulatory filing.

The Chisholm family has primarily lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, and they have been active in supporting type 1 diabetes research through leadership positions on the local board of Breakthrough T1D, formerly called the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF). Bill’s wife, Kimberly, is a published author who previously taught at Cal-Berkeley. She discusses literature on YouTube and in online classes.

They also have homes in the Northeast, with the intention of buying property in Boston, according to a report from The Boston Globe.

What is Symphony Technology Group?

According to a 2009 profile of STG by Forbes, the company is known for a traditional private equity approach of seeking to improve portfolio companies’ operations with its in-house know-how. As of 2016, the company boasted more than 15,000 employees. In past interviews, Chisholm has emphasized STG’s single-sector focus, staff of experienced operators and desire to grow or “transform” portfolio companies.

What is Bill Chisholm’s net worth?

Chisholm’s net worth has not been publicly reported. However, STG has continued to grow in recent years. The company debuted on Buyouts’ list of the top 100 PE firms in terms of fundraising, with STG placing 54th thanks to its nearly $10 billion haul across five years.

The STG VI fund, which closed on $2 billion in 2020, generated an IRR of 6.48% as of 2023, Buyouts reported based on public records.

Wadhwani, who stepped aside as STG CEO in 2017, has an estimated net worth of $5 billion.

Who else is buying the Boston Celtics?

Chisholm’s group includes current Celtics stakeholder Rob Hale and Related Companies president Bruce A. Beal Jr., as well as global investment firm Sixth Street. NBA teams are allowed to sell private equity groups up to 30% of each franchise, with no single fund able to own 20% of a club. Controlling owners are required to hold at least 15% of their team.

The bidders beat out three other contenders for the Celtics, topping the previous high paid for an NBA team—$4 billion for the Phoenix Suns in 2022—by 50%.

What are Bill Chisholm’s plans for the Celtics?

While Chisholm has yet to address the media, he emphasized the franchise’s role in the Boston community—and his desire to bring more titles to TD Garden—in a statement announcing the sale.

In a separate statement, Wyc Grousbeck said Chisholm “burns with a passion to win on the court.”

The first film took in over $83 million at the domestic box office against a budget of just $7 million. “I Can Only Imagine” told the backstory of how the best-selling Christian single of all time, MercyMe’s song of the same name, came to exist. “So much of Millard’s story is simultaneously relatable and optimistic that the movie works for the same reason the song does: It lightens the burden of the pain people are shouldering today, and gives them something to look forward to,” Variety‘s chief film critic Peter Debruge wrote in his review.",indiewire

“My first custom wig fitting,” the Bling Empire alum, 42, wrote alongside a clip from her consultation with her hair stylist Maranda Widlund shared via the professional’s Instagram Story on Wednesday, March 19. “For those who don’t know, I am experiencing sudden and dramatic hair loss.”

Chiu added that she had already “lost 99 percent of my hair over the last few months.”

While Chiu does not know the cause of her hair loss at this time, she has been “running labs, ultrasounds [and] tests” to find out the root issue.

In the clip, Chiu donned a dark brown wig with luscious long locks that fell down to her torso. Widlund styled the hairpiece and gave her tips as Chiu sat in the salon chair.

“When it gets styled, it just has a lot of life in it,” Widlund explained.

Christine was an original cast member on Bling Empire for all three seasons. She was joined on the series by her husband, Gabriel Chiu, whom she wed in 2006. The couple share son Gabriel Chiu III, also known as Baby G, whom they welcomed in 2018.

On Bling Empire, Christine was known for her affinity for wigs and rocked countless styles. She has a collection of pieces including wigs, extensions and hair accessories.

During the series, Christine was also candid about her struggles to conceive a child. She underwent six sessions of IVF before welcoming her son.

“I had held it in for so long and that wasn’t great for my mental health,” she said of her experience to Netflix’s Tudum in May 2022, noting only a “handful of people” were aware of her treatments at the time. “There’s so much power in sharing our journeys and being there to support each other and talking it through. That was something I didn’t have when I was going through it.”

“[I’m] still not pregnant [and I’m currently] on my period,” Caelynn, 29, said in a Wednesday, March 19, YouTube video. “It’s hard. I’m putting way less pressure on myself than I was in the first few months of trying.”

According to Caelynn, her mom had gotten pregnant “so fast,” and so, the Bachelor Nation star assumed that her journey would follow suit.

“I was like, ‘That’s gonna be me,’ and I was really disappointed when it didn’t happen in the first month, second [or] third,” Caelynn said. “So, now, I’m like, ‘Whatever’ and everyone I’ve talked to they’re like, ‘This is meant to be fun’ and it’s going a lot better than it was in the beginning ‘cause I was really sad and down.”

“I am going to get some testing done [and] same with Dean and figure out what’s going on,” Caelynn explained on Wednesday. “Hopefully, [it’s] nothing.”

The Bachelor alum further noted that she wants two children “max,” but isn’t interested in homeschooling their future offspring.

“We will not homeschool [like Dean did but] maybe do a co-op if our friends have kids the same age and we can make it work,” she said. “But, probably not.”

Earlier this year, Caelynn admitted that getting pregnant was on her 2025 “vision board.”

“I was extremely hot,” Newell, 32, told Us Weekly exclusively on Wednesday, March 19, while discussing Pippin’s 50th anniversary concert special, now streaming via BroadwayHD. “It was so warm in that theater. Like, I remember going outside and it was cooler outside than it was in the physical space. That’s why that was the first thing out of my mouth when I got up there because that’s all I could think about was how hot it [was].”

Newell took home the trophy for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical at the 2023 Tony Awards, which were held at the United Palace in New York City. At the beginning of their acceptance speech, Newell teased, “I’m not gonna hold y’all, because it’s hot in here.”

The excitement didn’t end there. “I also was supposed to go to the press room and never made it because my show [Shucked] was performing right after I won the Tony,” the actor — who previously starred as Unique Adams on Glee — recalled to Us. “So I was shoved to the bowels of the theater to take off all of my couture and put on my show costumes. And I could not stop sweating. It was a sticky mess.”

Newell made history at the awards show, becoming the first nonbinary performer to win their category. They starred as Lulu in Shucked, a pun-filled musical comedy centered on a small town’s love for corn.

Fellow Broadway star J. Harrison Ghee also broke new ground at the 2023 Tonys as the first nonbinary winner of Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical for Some Like It Hot. Newell is hopeful they won’t be the last.

“It’s truly just about willingly being able to adapt and not think about everything being so archaic and set in such hard, transfixed stereotypes and traditions,” the singer told Us when asked about the evolution of the Tony Awards. “I think every [ceremony] needs to really zoom out and start looking [at] how when they say representation matters, how they want to show that.”

Shucked played its final Broadway performance in January 2024, but Newell stayed booked and busy. In April 2024, they starred as Leading Player in the 50th anniversary concert production of Pippin in London’s West End.

“It was a labor of love,” Newell told Us, noting that they were working on the movie Another Simple Favor (the sequel to the Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick film) in Italy while rehearsing for the concert. “It’s funny, because I was supposed to play the Leading Player my junior year in high school. And I couldn’t because I was filming Glee … so it became a show that I really wanted to do.”

CAUSE ILL NEVER FORGET,” the Margot vs. Lily alum wrote via Twitter at the time […]

With music and lyrics by legendary composer Stephen Schwartz, the original Broadway production of Pippin ran for nearly 2,000 performances from 1972 to 1977. The show opened in London in 1973 — and hadn’t been seen on the West End since.

“[The excitement] was very palpable in the theater,” Newell recalled. “I think that’s what made it so special. Everyone was, like, hungry for it.”

Newell spoke with Schwartz about the project “briefly” and was given his “blessing” to have “free rein” on stage. Newell’s interpretation of Leading Player wasn’t entirely outside of the box, however.

“There’s no way of not honoring people that have come before you to play a role [in a revival]. And so there are makes and models of the role that are always there, that I think I leaned into, because it’s what’s expected out of the text, and what’s expected from an audience point of view,” they told Us. “And I think being a fan of musical theater, while doing musical theater, you get the special creative process where you get to honor the past and still make it what you want to do at the same time.”

“Welcome to The Kelly Clarkson Show and our 1,000th episode,” Clarkson, 42, exclaimed in a preview clip from the show’s Thursday, March 20, episode. “Our show premiered on September 9, 2019, with the help of some great friends. Over the next five-and-a-half years, we have made 999 episodes. I cannot believe today marks the 1,000th. It’s crazy.”

Clarkson reflected on some of the show’s biggest moments over the years, from chatting with celebrities and “inspiring everyday heroes” to doing the show amid the coronavirus pandemic and moving to New York City.

“For 1,000 episodes, we have laughed together, we have cried together with beautiful stories, sang together with some people, danced together, celebrated and competed together,” she stated. Hinting at her divorce from ex-husband Brandon Blackstock, Clarkson continued, “I’ve lost, alone, a lot, and along the way, we found comfort in one another. And looking back, we are all incredibly proud of what we’ve built and the community we’ve created.”

The Grammy winner, 42, will reportedly resume filming The Kelly Clarkson Show on Thursday, March 13, according to multiple outlets. Clarkson’s recent slew of absences began on March 3, with Simu Liu filling in as a guest host. […]

Clarkson concluded the clip by stating she is “grateful to everyone who has been a part of this journey,” adding, “It has been such a cool time.”

Thursday’s episode, which was pre-filmed, will see Clarkson chat with celebrity guests Tyler Perry and Alicia Vikander, and will feature a musical performance from Venezuelan musical duo Mau y Ricky.

Actor Kal Penn kicked off this week’s episode by stepping in as a guest host on Monday, March 17. Clarkson returned to the series on Tuesday, March 18, but was absent again the following day. Andy Cohen took on hosting duties on Wednesday, March 19. In addition to Thursday’s episode, Clarkson is set to round out the week as host on Friday, March 21.

Clarkson’s recent absences began earlier this month, with Simu Liu stepping in to host the show’s March 3 episode. Despite a brief return from Clarkson two days later, several celebrities have guest hosted the show in her absence, including Roy Wood Jr., Wanda Sykes, Brooke Shields, Willie Geist and Molly Sims.

Clarkson’s hiatus was reportedly due to a personal matter, though she has not publicly addressed the reason for her break. (Us Weekly previously reached out to her rep for comment.)

What Is Your Favorite Daytime Talk Show?

The show’s executive producer and showrunner, Alex Duda, called the fan intrigue in the host’s absence “so funny” in an interview with Deadline published on Thursday, adding, “Every season there’s been a period where we had to go to guest hosts for one reason or another. But for some reason this year they wrote about it.”

Tracie Wilson, executive Vice President of NBCUniversal Syndication Studios and E! News, chimed in by stating, “I love that they missed their Kelly, but we’ve done this before. I can’t even tell you how many texts I got from family and friends too. Yes, we’ve had guest hosts a lot over the years, so it’s just something about this year. But you’re right, people love their Kelly and they want her on the air, so we appreciate that.”",usmagazine

https://usmagazine.com,Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Suni Williams Return Home: What's Next?,https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/barry-butch-wilmore-and-suni-williams-return-home-whats-next/,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:46:17 GMT","Astronauts Barry “Butch” Wilmore and Suni Williams returned home safely on March 18 after being stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) for 286 days.

The duo made history in June 2024 as part of Boeing’s Starliner test flight to the ISS, but what was supposed to be an eight-day mission stretched out for more than nine months due to technical problems. SpaceX finally sent its Crew-8 Dragon spacecraft to bring the two astronauts home this week, with the craft safely landing off the coast of Florida after a 17-hour journey. Now, as Wilmore and Williams reunite with their families, Starliner will face questions on why its test mission failed.

Keep scrolling for a full rundown on Wilmore and Williams’ planned test mission, what they can expect now that they’re home and reactions from prominent figures:

What Happened

Former NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams were originally supposed to take part in an eight-day mission for Boeing’s Starliner when their craft took off June 5, 2024. The mission was designed to test the viability of rotating crewed commercial space missions, but Boeing faced unexpected setbacks.

I always ask them if they think that they would want to go to space. And if they say yes, […]

Helium leaks were a recurring problem throughout Starliner’s journey, forcing flight controllers to close off two helium manifolds, which in turn disabled 6 of Starlinder’s 28 reaction control system thrusters. The issue was repaired sufficiently enough that Starliner moved forward with its planned docking at the International Space Station.

However, as Starliner approached the ISS, mission teams discovered that eight of the craft’s reaction control system thrusters had ceased functioning. Wilmore and Williams were forced to keep Starliner in stasis outside of the space station’s no-fly zone until mission crews on Earth were able to reset the thrusters with a series of tests.

Once Wilmore and Williams were safely aboard the ISS, NASA decided in September 2024 it would have to bring Starliner back to earth without any human crew members on board in order to conduct further testing. This left Wilmore and Williams essentially stranded on the space station until NASA was able to launch a rescue mission in March.

By the time of Wilmore and Williams’s rescue, they had logged 286 days (or nine months) in space, which is significantly longer than the six-month missions that astronauts routinely take on the International Space Station.

Wilmore told reporters, from space, in March: “We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short.”

“That’s what your nation’s human spaceflight program’s all about,” he went on. “Planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.”

The Rescue

Wilmore and Williams were originally set to leave the space station on June 14, 2024, but that date was repeatedly pushed back until NASA chose to bring Starliner back to earth uncrewed.

“We don’t feel abandoned. We don’t feel stuck. We don’t feel stranded. I understand why others may think that,” Wilmore told CNN in February. “We come prepared, we come committed.”

While NASA and Boeing were working on a rescue plan, Wilmore and Williams conducted more than 900 hours of research, according to Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator of NASA’s Space Operations Mission Directorate.

President Donald Trump ordered NASA to move up its timetable for a rescue mission when he took office in January. In response, NASA made changes to its flight plan by selecting a SpaceX capsule for the mission at a cost of roughly $100 million to $150 million, according to Reuters.

On March 18, Wilmore and Williams left the ISS to join two other astronauts, NASA’s Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, on board the Crew Dragon spacecraft for a 17-hour journey back to earth.

SpaceX’s Dragon landed safely off the coast of Florida at around 5:57 p.m. ET. Cameras were on the scene to capture the moment when Wilmore and Williams disembarked the Dragon and stepped back onto Earth for the first time.

What’s Next

Wilmore and Williams could now face a variety of physical and emotional challenges after their nine-month stay on the International Space Station.

According to Reuters, humans who endure lengthy periods in microgravity can face facial swelling and potential vision problems due to increased cranial pressure. Astronauts can also experience bone density loss and muscle atrophy as well as blood pressure irregularities.

Additionally, they regularly endure balance and coordination complications once they return home, plus the possibility of psychological stress and sleep changes due to living in isolation for lengthy periods.

Because Wilmore and Williams were originally contracted for an eight-day mission but spent more than 900 hours doing research by the time of their rescue, NASA addressed whether they would receive overtime pay in addition to their reported $152,000 salaries.

“When NASA astronauts are aboard the International Space Station, they receive regular, 40-hour work-week salaries. They do not receive overtime or holiday/weekend pay,” NASA told People. “While in space, NASA astronauts are on official travel orders as federal employees, so their transportation, lodging and meals are provided. They also are on long-term TDY, and receive the incidentals amount for each day they are in space. The incidentals amount is reduced by the percentage required for the length of the trip per federal travel regulations.”

As for Starliner, NASA commercial crew program manager Steve Stich told reporters ahead of the rescue mission that Boeing would need to mount another test flight — potentially uncrewed — before pursuing regular missions to the ISS with human crew.

“What we’d like to do is that one flight and then get into a crew rotation flight,” he said. “So, the next flight up would really test all the changes we’re making to the vehicle, and then the next fight beyond that, we really need to get Boeing into a crew rotation. So, that’s the strategy.”

Stich later confirmed that Boeing was in the process of organizing another Starliner test mission, following speculation that it could be too costly an investment for the aerospace company.

“[We are] working hand in hand with Boeing as well on certification of Starliner, getting that vehicle back to flight,” he said, via BBC News.

Reactions

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk appeared on Fox News on March 18 to thank his rescue crew for bringing the two stranded astronauts home safely.

“Thanks to the excellent work of the SpaceX team working with NASA, the astronauts are now safely home. And so congratulations to the SpaceX / NASA teams on excellent work,” he said.

Jimmy Fallon made light of the rescue mission during his opening monologue on the March 18 edition of The Tonight Show.

Fallon quipped, “Today, the Boeing astronauts who were stranded at the International Space Station for nine months finally returned to Earth. Right now, they’re the first people in history to honestly text someone, ‘Sorry, just saw this!’”

“Yup, they were up there for nine months, or as the two astronauts put it, ‘There’s three of us now,'” Fallon added.

Millions around the world documented on social media what it was like to watch Wilmore and Williams return home after their unexpectedly lengthy stay in space.

“In an age of division, let’s take a moment to recognize an achievement that transcends politics: the safe return of our astronauts. This extraordinary feat is a testament to human ingenuity, perseverance, and the boundless possibilities of science and engineering,” The Biggest Loser star Jillian Michaels wrote via X. “It reminds us that when we channel our collective efforts toward exploration and discovery, we achieve the impossible. Today, let’s celebrate not just the individuals who embarked on this journey, but the generations of visionaries, scientists, and engineers who made this moment possible. @SpaceX.”

Happy Days legend Henry Winkler shared, “The Astronauts are home … what a moment !!!! Welcome back to earth.”

NASA Acting Administrator Janet Petro said her team was “thrilled” to welcome all four astronauts back to earth following the successful rescue mission.

“Through preparation, ingenuity and dedication, we achieve great things together for the benefit of humanity, pushing the boundaries of what is possible from low Earth orbit to the Moon and Mars,” Petro noted.",usmagazine

Answering questions via her Instagram Story on Wednesday, March 19, Roper, 38, addressed one fan who asked for advice on how to conceive a boy or girl.

“We didn’t try anything specific for either, but I do know that when we conceived Emmy, Tanner made me do a headstand afterwards for a few min, and we didn’t do that with the boys,” she wrote over a pic of her and husband Tanner Tolbert. “Hahahaha. So maybe that’s worth a try for a girl.”

In addition to Emmy, 7, the couple share sons Brooks, 5, and Reed, 4. They met on Bachelor in Paradise season 2 in 2015 and tied the knot the following year.

The pair’s daughter, Emmy, was born in August 2017, nearly two years before baby No. 2 joined the family. Roper gave birth to their eldest son, […]

As Roper has been sure to explain, the family of five does not plan on getting any bigger. She declared “we are done” in a February Instagram Q&A when asked if the couple was “done having babies.”

“I still get baby fever all the time and probably will forever, but I don’t envision us having one more,” she wrote. “Time for Tanner to get the snip!”

She said the same last November, writing via yet another Instagram Q&A, “I think we are done. Which is very bittersweet. I’m that person that I guess I don’t think I’ll ever feel that feeling of ‘our family is complete.’”

She also discussed how she and Tolbert are able to balance the needs of each of their children, saying she wants to make sure they “feel loved enough/feel time is equally spent with each kid.”

Simple as reading books at bedtime and snuggling and talking about the day.”

Roper revealed in 2020 that she had suffered a miscarriage before the couple conceived Emmy and that she had a chemical pregnancy before conceiving Brooks. She suffered another miscarriage in 2023 with a son they planned to name Beau.

“Our sweet Beau was diagnosed with Down Syndrome, so we think his tiny heart wasn’t strong enough,” she explained in November 2023. “A lot of DS diagnoses are accompanied with congenital heart conditions.”",usmagazine

“For months, horrific accusations have been made about me in various lawsuits regarding my former boss,” Khorram said in a statement to Rolling Stone on Tuesday, March 18. “These false allegations of my involvement are causing irreparable and incalculable damage to my reputation and the emotional well-being of myself and my family. I have never condoned or aided and abetted the sexual assault of anyone. Nor have I ever drugged anyone.”

She continued, “The idea that I could be accused of playing a role in — or even being a bystander to — the rape of anyone is beyond upsetting, disturbing and unthinkable. That is not who I am, and my heart goes out to all victims of sexual assault. I am confident that the allegations against me will be proven to be untrue.”

Khorram has worked for Diddy, 55, for more than a decade. In a January 2021 Facebook post, the mogul gushed about her work, describing her as his “right-hand” woman.

Related: Diddy’s Attorneys Claim Videos of Him and Cassie ‘Confirm’ His Innocence INF/INSTAR Sean “Diddy” Combs has been under investigation for at least a year after being accused of sexual assault by multiple people. The rapper and music mogul, 54, made headlines in November 2023 after his ex-girlfriend Cassie accused him of sexual abuse in a bombshell lawsuit. She accused Diddy of beating her, forcing her to […]

“Meet Kristina Khorram, Chief of Staff at Combs Enterprises,” he wrote at the time. “Kristina aka KK keeps everything in my life and my business running. She’s been my right hand for the last 8 years and has consistently proven to execute and get s— done. Don’t know how I’d function without her.”

Last year, music producer Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones named Khorram in his sexual assault lawsuit against Diddy, calling her the “Ghislaine Maxwell to Sean Combs’ Jeffrey Epstein” in his court filing. Jones alleged that Diddy sexually harassed, drugged and threatened him while they were working on Diddy’s 2023 album, The Love Album: Off the Grid.

Jones claimed that he subsequently told Khorram about these alleged unwanted encounters. According to Jones, she allegedly responded, “You know, Sean will be Sean.” He also claimed she “attempted to downplay Mr. Combs’ groping … as friendly horseplay, stating that those acts were Mr. Combs’s way of ‘showing that he likes you.’”

Jones further alleged that Khorram paid hired sex workers for Combs and required his personal employees to carry a fanny pack filled with illicit substances that she ordered and distributed, including “cocaine, GHB, ecstasy, marijuana gummies and Tuci (a pink drug that is a combination of ecstasy and cocaine),” according to the lawsuit.

Related: Diddy’s Legal Troubles Detailed in Multiple Docs: Biggest Revelations Since Sean “Diddy” Combs was arrested in September 2024, multiple documentaries — two in total as of January 2025 — have detailed the allegations against the rapper. The first, Peacock’s Diddy: The Making of a Bad Boy, started streaming on January 14. The 90-minute film included interviews with the mogul’s childhood friends and former employees […]

Diddy’s attorney Shawn Holley denied Jones’ accusations in a February 2024 statement to Us Weekly, calling him a “liar.”

“Lil Rod is nothing more than a liar who filed a $30 million lawsuit, shamelessly looking for an undeserved payday,” Holley said. “His reckless name-dropping about events that are pure fiction and simply did not happen is nothing more than a transparent attempt to garner headlines.”

Holley continued, “We have overwhelming, indisputable proof that his claims are complete lies. We will address these outlandish allegations in court and take all appropriate action against those who make them.”

Khorram was also named in a lawsuit against Diddy filed by Phil Pines, who claimed that he participated in so-called “Wild King Nights” with the rapper. Pines alleged that he once witnessed Diddy kick a woman to the ground and demand she return his sweatshirt, leaving her topless.

In the January Investigation Discovery docuseries The Fall of Diddy, Pines claimed that Khorram knew about the alleged assault and did nothing.

“My direct supervisor, Kristina, was aware of what happened. Kristina told me to never speak about it again,” he alleged. “Kristina was his day-to-day manager. Eventually she became the chief of staff. Everybody at that level has a right-hand man or a right-hand woman, someone who can be trusted with everything from personal to business to good to bad. Like a marriage. A lot of times delegation would come from her.”

Diddy’s legal team addressed Pines’ lawsuit in a statement to Us in December 2024, saying: “No matter how many lawsuits are filed, it won’t change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone — man or woman, adult or minor. We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth, and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail in court.”

According to court documents obtained by Us Weekly, Lively filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Thursday, March 20.

“This lawsuit is a profound abuse of the legal process that has no place in federal court. California law now expressly prohibits suing victims who make the decision to speak out against sexual harassment or retaliation, whether in a lawsuit or in the press,” Lively’s lawyers Mike Gottlieb and Esra Hudson told Us in a statement.

The statement continued, “This meritless and retaliatory lawsuit runs head first into three legal obstacles, including the litigation, fair report, and sexual harassment privileges, the latter of which contains a mandatory fee shifting provision that will require the likes of … Wayfarer Studios, and others that brought frivolous defamation claims against Ms. Lively to pay damages. In other words, in an epic self-own, the Wayfarer Parties’ attempt to sue Ms. Lively ‘into oblivion’ has only created more liability for them, and deservedly so, given what they have done.”

Related: Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds Seek to Dismiss Justin Baldoni’s Lawsuit Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds are seeking to dismiss Justin Baldoni’s defamation lawsuit. Lively, 37, and Reynolds, 48, told a federal judge on Thursday, January 30, that they will move to dismiss the legal action filed against them by the It Ends With Us director, 40, Variety reported the same day. Per Variety, each side’s […]

A spokesperson for Lively also told Us, “The painful reality is that Ms. Lively is not alone in being sued for defamation after speaking up about being sexually harassed at work. That is entirely why California recently enacted AB 933, the Privileged Communications Incident of Sexual Assault, Harassment, or Discrimination Act, which codified California civil code section 47.1. While Ms. Lively has suffered greatly by speaking up and pursuing legal claims, it is important for other people to know that they have protections, and that there is a specific law that expressly protects them from being silenced or financially ruined by a defamation lawsuit because they had the courage to speak up.”

Us has reached out to Baldoni’s team for comment.

News broke in December 2024 that Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment and allegedly launching a “social manipulation” campaign against her to destroy her reputation. Baldoni denied the allegations.

Related: Justin Baldoni's Lawyer Reacts to Blake Lively Statement: 'Heinous Pivot' Justin Baldoni’s lawyer Bryan Freedman fired back at Blake Lively’s response to the director’s $400 million lawsuit. “After my clients filed a comprehensive lawsuit packed with almost 200 pages of undeniable facts and documentary evidence which crushed their false allegations of a smear campaign by providing doctored communications to The New York Times, Blake and […]

He went on to file his own $400 million lawsuit against Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and her publicist in January, citing defamation among other claims. The couple denied the accusations. Reynolds filed to dismiss the lawsuit in court documents obtained by Us on Tuesday, March 18.

https://usmagazine.com,Amanda Seyfried Thought Guardians of the Galaxy Would Hurt Her Career,https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/amanda-seyfried-thought-guardians-of-the-galaxy-would-hurt-her-career/,"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 16:33:57 GMT","The star-studded cast of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy almost featured a different famous face.

Amanda Seyfried opened up about why she turned down the role of Gamora in the Marvel film franchise on the Thursday, March 20, episode of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, admitting she viewed the original 2014 movie as a risk at the time she was offered the part.

“Being a part of the first Marvel movie that bombs ain’t good for your career,” she shared. “I thought that because this was about a talking tree and a talking raccoon that it was gonna be Marvel’s first bomb and that Chris Pratt and I would never work again. I was wrong.”

Despite declining the offer, Seyfried has nothing but love for the film’s director, James Gunn. “[He’s] a genius and he’s fun and he’s a wonderful filmmaker, and he can make anything work,” she told podcast host Josh Horowitz. “But I was way too scared. I was at a precarious moment in my career, and I didn’t want to suffer for the work.”

For Seyfried, a large part of what turned her away from the role was the intense makeup process for playing a green alien. “I was really scared of the idea of being stuck and painted a different color because of the amount of time that the X-Men people had been, ‘cause I was working out with the same trainer that trained a bunch of people who were doing X-Men,” she said.

In addition to not wanting to live and shoot in London “for six months out of the year,” Seyfried had another project lined up that she was more interested in doing. “There was another movie that I really wanted to do with Seth MacFarlane called A Million Ways to Die in the West,” she revealed. “It felt like a really good opportunity.”

At the end of the day, Seyfried said movies that require heavy makeup and lots of special effects just aren’t for her. “I had done some green screen stuff, and it wasn’t my cup of tea, and I don’t regret any decision that I made,” she stated. “I made it for myself in the moment that I made it. It was good for me then, and it’s good for me now.”

Reflecting on the Marvel offer, Seyfried thinks everything worked out just as it should have, explaining: “I also think that Zoe [Saldaña] and Chris and everybody who’s a part of that movie are having the best time and it worked for them, and I love that. And I love that I was able to stay with my gut.”

What Is the Best Marvel Movie of All Time?

The role of Gamora ultimately went to Saldaña, 46, and the movie was a massive success, earning over $772 million at the worldwide box office. The recent Oscar winner portrayed the anti-hero daughter of Thanos in 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy, 2017’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, 2018’s Avengers: Infinity War, 2019’s Avengers: Endgame and 2023’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.

Saldaña has since confirmed she will not reprise her Guardians role in any upcoming Marvel projects. However, she has hopes that the character will return in a new capacity thanks to the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s expanding multiverse.

“I keep saying this time and time again — I can’t wait to see what’s next for Gamora,” Saldaña shared with Variety last month. “I hope they’re not done with her, and I hope a woman of color or a woman with special needs can take on the role next. That would be incredible.”",usmagazine

When Us Weekly caught up with Ciara, 29, shortly after Summer House premiered last month, she hinted that she was surprised by the implied drama between her, Lexi, 27, and Jesse, 29, in the season 9 trailer — which included Lexi accusing Jesse of being flirty with Ciara.

“I am gonna watch and figure it out with the rest of you guys because I still don’t know,” Ciara told Us. “In my head — and maybe this is just my world — I don’t really see it as a big deal.”

Ciara added, “Once we watch it back and we see … then, I’ll see you at the reunion.”

Related: Ciara Miller Drags ‘Annoying’ West Wilson in ‘Summer House’ Clip Ciara Miller is taking no prisoners in the Summer House season 9 premiere — especially when it comes to West Wilson. “What was your car ride up?” Paige DeSorbo asked Jesse Solomon in Us Weekly’s exclusive clip from the Wednesday, February 12 episode. “Was West nervous?” Jesse, 29, said no. (It’s important to note that […]

During the Wednesday, March 19, episode of the series, fans saw Jesse tell Ciara it was “turning me on” to have her leg touching him on a pool float. Andy Cohen was a big fan of the moment, asking the Watch What Happens Live audience if Ciara and Jesse “should just go for it” in a poll during Wednesday’s episode of the late night show.

“I say yes,” he said as the fans voted. “I want to know if you’re open to it.”

Ciara replied that she’s “done dating men on Bravo,” referring to her flings with Austen Kroll and West Wilson.

Ciara and Jesse met and became friends during season 8 of Summer House, which aired last year.

“Me and Jesse were really cool [going into the summer]. I mean, we’re still really cool,” Ciara said. “Me and Jesse fight and it’s fine. We’re gonna get over it. It’s typically always me mad at him for something or he’s annoyed that I said something or it was a little bit too honest. But that’s our relationship.”

Part of that relationship includes Jesse being a “flirt.”

“It’s just Jesse,” Ciara told Us. “He’s a flirt. He’s gonna flirt. He loves his female friends, like, he loves the female species. … If you wanna gossip, you call Jesse. He’s like, ‘You got tea for me?’ I love a FaceTime with him.”

She joked that the women of the Bravo show appreciate a man who can gossip — unlike OG star Kyle Cooke. “Kyle is not so good. We’ve been working on him for years,” she quipped.

Lexi, meanwhile, joined Summer House for season 9. During her first weekend in the Hamptons with the group, Lexi and Jesse hit it off and quickly struck up a romance.

“Lexi coins herself as a lover girl. I don’t think it was uncharted territory for her,” Ciara said of how quickly Lexi and Jesse got together. “I was kind of like, ‘Jesse, just as a word of advice, pump the brakes. I’m not gonna tell you what to do, [but I] have walked in your shoes once or twice.’”

Ciara also had kind words to say about Lexi, who she described as “so cute” and “super nice.”

“When you think of Canada, in my head, I think of Lexi, like, she’s just so nice. And then her ‘o’s are super drawn out and she eats ketchup chips,” she said.

“It’s very, very selective and it will be up to them because Drew is now becoming 5 years old and you could have a conversation with her. It’s more so up to them,” Shawn, 33, exclusively told Us Weekly on Tuesday, March 18, while discussing her partnership with Beam Kids. “I don’t ever want to cross a boundary where I’m showing something that they wouldn’t want. Everything we try to show, I would never want them to be embarrassed by.”

She added, “I’m not outing their most vulnerable moments. I’m not showing them in exposing ways. My husband and I always say at the end of the day, our social media is about us as parents and not them as kids.”

Shawn and Andrew, also 33, have been married since 2016 and share daughter Drew, 5, as well as sons Jett, 3, and Bear, 15 months.

Related: Shawn Johnson and Andrew East's Family Album With Kids Shawn Johnson East became a parent in November 2019 and has been sharing sweet family photos ever since. The Olympian wed Andrew East in April 2016 in Tennessee, and they announced the following year that they had suffered a miscarriage. They announced their rainbow baby’s conception in April 2019. “You are our everything,” Johnson captioned […]

“I do think soon, like, as our kids graduate to a certain age, they will be off of social media because they become real little people around the world,” she added to Us. “It’ll be up to them if they want to be seen.”

Since expanding their family, Shawn and Andrew have frequently documented their little ones’ milestones on social media and via YouTube vlogs. As Drew, Jett and Bear grow up, the couple made a conscious decision to limit their children’s presence via social media uploads.

“We show our children less and less as they get older because they’re becoming more and more recognizable. They’re no longer just infants and babies, but they’re becoming people and they have opinions,” Shawn explained on Tuesday. “I don’t want my daughter to go to kindergarten and have people be like, ‘Oh, I saw your vacation.’ It’s more of a parent’s perspective of what we’re going through.”

The retired gymnast continued, “It’s always a very fluid conversation that my husband and I are having. We always deem it as shareable home videos [and] we have the unedited versions, where it’s all the moments that are so sweet that we get to experience and then we try to share it with the world in a relatable way.”

Shawn and Andrew’s parenting journey also inspired their partnership with performance supplement brand Beam to launch a youth-oriented version made with a chocolate milk flavor and over 40 nutrients, including a probiotic, a multivitamin and a greens blend.

“I worked with my pediatrician, a dietician, everything, and I made it for my kiddos,” Shawn said on Tuesday. “I got really frustrated trying to piece together all the different supplements for kids and they’re all in gummy form and I just felt like I was giving them candy and, by the time I was buying all of them, you’re buying, like, five different things and I just got frustrated.”

According to Shawn, she and her former football player husband also make their own protein shakes with Beam nutrients each morning.

“It’s something that our kids can’t have and they always wanted to have their own protein shake,” Shawn quipped. “We were making fake chocolate milk stuff and whatever, long story short, Beam, [created by] Matt Lombardi, ended up making this for our children. They got to go to the lab and pick out their own flavors, and then after they had been using theirs for six months, we were kind of like, ‘We should maybe share this with people.’”

“Everyone’s been saying such nice things,” Cooper shared during a March 2025 interview with Variety following the show’s premiere. “My agent has seen it and she said it was really good. I don’t know what it is, but I don’t really watch it like I’m watching a normal show. I just watch it because I’m in it.”

The seemingly modest young star said he has “heard positive things” from the series, which is getting him early Emmy Awards buzz.

Cooper also noted that costar Stephen Graham, who played his dad on the show, was “always checking in” throughout the emotionally charged shoot.

“When it was just us two — with no camera — in the police cell, and he scruffed me up and said, ‘You’re never going to see your mum again, you’re never going to see your dad again,’ and was going on and on,” the teen recalled. “Before then, I’d been frustrated because I hadn’t been getting emotional. But after that point I was emotional in every take. So that helped me a lot. He was amazing to work with.”

He Was an Athlete

When asked by Variety about his previous acting experience, Cooper replied, “Literally nothing.” He had dreams of being a professional soccer — football in the U.K. — player.

Tom Holland Inspired Him

After watching Holland in the 2012 movie The Impossible, Cooper decided he wanted to be an actor.

“I want to play Spider-Man,” he told i-D in March 2025. “A lot of films I watch are not films I should be watching.”

He Is a Trained Actor

Once Cooper decided that he wanted to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, he started taking classes at The Drama MOB in Manchester, England.

“The lessons were just hourly lessons on a Tuesday where we’d get a piece of script and just read it off,” he told Variety. “But I was just doing it for a hobby and didn’t expect much from it. And then when Adolescence came, I obviously took it a lot more seriously. And I just took it on the chin really, and just did it.”

‘Adolescence’ Is His Acting Debut

There was “literally nothing” on Cooper’s acting resume when he filmed a self-tape for Adolescence.

“In the first one, you had to pretend to go into a headmaster’s office and act like you’ve not done anything at all — but you actually haven’t, you’re innocent,” Cooper recalled when telling i-D about filming his audition. “And then in the second one you had to act like you haven’t done anything wrong — but you really had.”

Multiple outlets confirmed on Wednesday, March 19, that Kevin Sussman‘s Stuart Bloom will lead the show, which is titled Stuart Fails to Save the Universe. Sussman, 54, will reprise his role as the comic book store owner alongside fellow alums John Ross Bowie as Barry Kripke, Lauren Lapkus as Denise and Brian Posehn as Bert.

The potential spinoff, which has yet to receive a formal series order, is the fourth project in the Big Bang Theory universe. CBS’ hit sitcom aired from 2007 to 2019 and starred Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco, Johnny Galecki, Simon Helberg, Kunal Nayyar, Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch as a group of friends made up of scientists and their significant others.

As TBBT came to an end, CBS expanded with the Young Sheldon prequel, which focused on Sheldon (Iain Armitage) as a child prodigy growing up in Texas. Viewers met Sheldon’s brother, Georgie (Montana Jordan), and that paved the way for his love story with Mandy (Emily Osment) to become the focus of another spinoff, Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage.

The hit sitcom, which aired from 2007 to 2019, starred Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco, Johnny Galecki, […]

“You can watch Young Sheldon without knowing anything about The Big Bang Theory. And I believe you can watch Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage without watching Young Sheldon,” Jordan exclusively told Us Weekly in October 2024. “It’s a new start.”

Fans continue to wait for new information on the third offshoot — starting with appearances from more familiar faces. Bialik, 49, recently weighed in on whether she would return to the upcoming Max series.

“I haven’t been contacted,” she exclusively told Us in January. “I’ve seen what’s been announced and I think that’s where a lot of people’s knowledge of it is right [now] — me being one of them.”

Bialik expressed her excitement as a fan, adding, “These characters were so iconic and so significant to people. [Creators] Chuck [Lorre] and Bill [Prady] really created a world of characters that people want to know about and follow up on. So, I’m very flattered and I would be very flattered if I am contacted.”

At the time, Bialik admitted she wanted to reprise the role of Amy Farrah Fowler, the character she portrayed from 2010 to 2019.

“I love being known as that character and I love what it means to people. So for me, it would be a thrill to be part of it in any way,” she noted. “It was a really, really fun experience to be part of that [during my guest appearance with Jim Parsons] on Young Sheldon. I also get to interact with [creators] Steven [Molaro] and Steve [Holland] and a lot of our writers and producers, so it’s a whole world that I still feel very connected to.”",usmagazine

Hulu released the first look at season 2 on Thursday, March 20, where Stassi, 36, was seen reuniting with Lisa Vanderpump nearly five years after Stassi’s time on Vanderpump Rules.

“Remember when I used to tell you don’t get involved in other people’s business? Well now, I want you to do the exact opposite,” Lisa, 64, tells Stassi about being her “eyes and ears” at the castle, to which she replied, “I’m excited to stick my nose in business where it doesn’t belong.”

Luckily there is plenty for Stassi to keep track of — including a flirtationship between Marciano Brunette and Demi Engemann. The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives star makes an appearance in Italy alongside Jen Affleck, Jessi Ngatikaura, Layla Taylor and Mikayla Matthews.

The teaser shows Demi asking Marciano if he was allowed to make a move on the guests. In one scene, Marciano acknowledges the “an instant connection” between them — despite her being married to Bret Engemann.

Demi and Marciano later share an intimate hug. “There’s still so much unresolved. It’s been up and down, up and down,” Demi tells Marciano, who replies, “Are you living with regret?”

Outside of keeping track of the cast of The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,. Stassi is seen arguing with husband Beau Clark. “You feel safe with me, I can make you feel unsafe,” Stassi tells Beau after one of the staff members at the château found himself stuck in the middle.

Stassi joined Vanderpump Villa as part of a larger deal with Hulu that includes her own show, Stassi Says. The half-hour docu-comedy is currently in development.

“Endlessly relatable, utterly hysterical and questionably sane, Stassi is the anchor of a fresh ensemble of comedic and chaotic characters who are dealing with identity crises and major life crossroads of their own — and Stassi’s the one who has to keep them all afloat,” read the synopsis for the series, which was announced in August 2024.

Vanderpump Villa, meanwhile, is a Hulu reality series set in Lisa’s luxury French villa, Château Rosabelle. The show, which originally debuted in 2024, highlights the staff as they live and work together while catering to their high-profile guests.

Despite their similarities, Lisa previously told Us Weekly that the series was not a copy of Vanderpump Rules.

“It is not Vanderpump Rules because it’s more immersive and it’s got guests and it’s kind of more decadent in a way,” she explained in March 2024. “It is a little bit of Below Deck [with] that upstairs, downstairs feel. But it doesn’t feel as tight as Below Deck.”

The restaurateur also discussed the challenges that came with filming, telling Us, “When you are in the middle of the French countryside, you’ve got people that have filled positions. If they get it wrong, you can’t say, ‘OK, go home. You are out, you’re suspended.’ Because there are 12 jobs and I need 12 people to do them. So there was a lot of push and pull. It is a lot of fun. There’s definitely a real feel-good factor to [the show], but it is complicated.”

A woman in Indiana was arrested after she and her two kids allegedly beat up a student ... and, the fight was seemingly caught on shocking video.

Latea Hentz -- a 36-year-old mother -- and her teenage son and daughter are accused of hopping on a school bus to throw hands with an 8th-grade student they claim was bullying the son.

Watch the clip ... the three people in the vid -- identified by local outlets as Hentz, her 17-year-old daughter and her 13-year-old son -- throw punch after punch at this other student. One person in the fray screams at this kid to never touch her son again.

It's a pretty shocking clip ... and, many students onboard are begging the three to let the kid go, though they don't leave until they've landed quite a few punches.

According to local reports ... Hentz told cops the student had been bullying her son for weeks, but the school wouldn't do anything to stop it. The day before this went down in early March, she says, he slapped her son.

Police say the kid who was beaten up went to the hospital for treatment, where it was determined his nose was fractured and his left eye was bruised and swollen.

Riibe -- who has not been charged in Konanki's suspected drowning -- got held up at the airport in Puerto Rico Wednesday because his brand new U.S. passport wasn't properly stamped, NotiCentro reports.

The 22-year-old was issued a replacement passport from the U.S. consulate in the D.R. after local law enforcement reportedly refused to give his original passport back -- despite a Dominican judge ruling he was allowed to go free after being subject to police surveillance due to his connection to Konanki.

NotiCentro cameras captured Riibe's father, Albert Riibe, in a state of frustration at the airport after he was separated from Joshua. He was seen yelling to Joshua down a hall ... ""Ask for your lawyer!""

He also pleaded with reporters to let him and his son be, explaining ... ""I'm just a dad, who had his son taken away, and I don’t understand. We just spent two weeks trying to stay together, and now … I don’t understand."" It's unclear how long Joshua was held.

Joshua, a student at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, was named a person of interest after surveillance video recorded him as the last person seen with Konanki before she disappeared.

The pair were seen walking toward the beach at Riu República Hotel in Punta Cana early in the morning of March 6. Surveillance video also shows both Konanki and Riibe vomiting at the hotel's bar shortly before the time of her disappearance -- although they were not mingling at the time.

Riibe told law enforcement they were in the water together and nearly got swept away by a giant wave ... but he was able to pull them both to shore. He remembers last seeing her walking knee-deep in the water to grab her belongings.

TMZ has learned.

Crisona and another man -- Father John Taggart -- have been arrested and charged with several felonies connected to alleged abuse at St. Thomas the Apostle School in Wilmington, Delaware.

The Delaware Attorney General's Office says Crisona was a teacher at the school for a year and a half back in the mid-1990s before he was removed from his post following a student complaint. Taggart, now 80, is accused of abusing the same individual as the 57-year-old Crisona. The victim was in their 7th and 8th grade years at the school, according to the AG.

Crisona -- who the Delaware AG's Office states is currently working as an elementary school teacher in Florida -- has been charged with several crimes, including unlawful sexual contact, unlawful sexual intercourse, unlawful sexual penetration, and continuous sexual abuse of a child.

Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said ... ""The State’s indictment alleges a pattern of gravely serious abuse against a juvenile by two adults in a position of trust. As prosecutors, and as parents, these kinds of cases keep us up at night -- but they also give us purpose.

""The victim in this case suffered profound trauma over a period of years and deserves justice. I’m grateful to the police, prosecutors, and social workers who have been critical to this investigation and who are committed to getting justice.”

Crisona appeared on ""Family Feud"" back in 2010 ... Steve's first season as show host.

The 20-year-old NBA player spoke out in a feature with The Athletic ... on the heels of a confrontation between LeBron and Stephen A. Smith at the Lakers game earlier this month -- which was sparked due to the ESPN talent's comments on the four-time champion's son.

Bronny said all the outside noise doesn't go unnoticed ... but instead of letting it hurt his pride, it's actually having the opposite effect.

""My first thought about everything is I always try to just let it go through one ear and out the other, put my head down and come to work and be positive every day,"" Bronny said.

""But sometimes it just, it fuels me a little bit. I see everything that people are saying, and people think, like, I’m a f***ing robot, like I don’t have any feelings or emotions.""

Bronny continued ... ""But I just take that and use it as fuel for me to go out, wake up every day and get to the gym early, get my extra work in, watch my extra film every day, get better every day.""

Bronny -- averaging 20.6 points in the G League -- believes he is improving physically and mentally. He attributes his progress to his newfound confidence.

""That’s what Rob [Pelinka] wants me to do as a young guy, coming in, playing in the G League, and learning from far on the bench watching the Lakers play,"" Bronny added.

An interview was scheduled, but before it, he told Lakers public-relations staff he couldn’t quite place a face with my name. He knew I wrote about his childhood at the Akron, Ohio, private school he attended when his dad played for the Cleveland Cavaliers, but otherwise, he needed a memory jolt. So, after a recent Lakers win, in the locker room, I was called over to say hello ahead of our discussion the following day.

Advertisement

As soon as Bronny saw me, his face lit up as though he remembered. I saw the same smile I recalled from when he was just a boy, dribbling circles around his friends on the court after a Cavs win. I saw the same grace from the time his grandmother ordered him to remove all the luggage off the conveyor belt at the airport after a family trip (we were on the same flight), instead of having Cavs security do it, and he obliged without complaint. I witnessed the same politeness from when Bronny was a freshman at the University of Southern California, recovering from a major health scare, and he stopped in the Lakers press room during a game and spoke in conversation with “yes, sir” and “no, sir.”

But was the 20-year-old, 6-foot-2 shooting guard standing in front his locker, shaking my hand and making jokes, the same basketball player I saw just five months ago join LeBron James, the league’s all-time leading scorer and proverbial “face of the NBA” for more than a decade, as the only father-son duo to play in the same game in NBA history?

No, I can’t say he was the same. This version of Bronny James is better.

“I definitely think I’ve improved, not only as a player, but just having a different mindset as a player to go out and play my game and play the game that I know how to play,” he said. “I feel really good about it — I see the progress.”

It’s not just Bronny, or me, for that matter, who thinks so. The Lakers say Bronny has improved this season, the confidence he’s playing with when he’s on the court in the NBA suggests it, and the numbers he’s put up in the G League insist it’s true.

As of this writing, Bronny appeared in 20 NBA games for the Lakers, averaging 1.7 points and shooting just 26 percent from the field in about five minutes per game. Now, if you haven’t seen him, you may be thinking, “This is an improvement?” Hold on a sec.

In a recent, close loss to the Denver Nuggets, the Lakers were without several of their rotation players, including Bronny’s dad and new Lakers superstar Luka Dončić. Coach JJ Redick turned to Bronny for 16 game minutes, and though he made just one of the five shots he took, his bucket was a crucial 3-pointer in a pressure situation. He also got to the foul line and turned in a steal.

“It’s great that JJ had the level of trust to throw him into a big game the other night at Denver, which is a tough place to play, and he got in the game, made a couple defensive plays, made a corner 3, and I think that’s what he prides himself in is the 3-and-D type of archetype,” Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka said. “And for him to be doing it in moments in NBA games, that’s great that he’s even grasped that already.”

Redick added that Bronny “has been fantastic in practices” lately, his confidence and aggression have grown, and his “biggest area of improvement is probably his playmaking, and I don’t just mean that in terms of passing, but just his ability to play on and off the ball as a decision-maker — either a scorer or a passer.”

So that’s what the big-league Lakers think of their second-round draft pick, taken 55th overall in June. They see an improved, young player deep on their bench, which is where he should be at this point in his career. Any outside suggestion or expectation that Bronny, who missed half of his lone college season recovering from cardiac arrest suffered during a summer practice caused by a congenital heart defect, would do more for the Lakers than what he’s done this season was off base.

But his growth in the NBA’s minor league, the G League, is more substantial. In 16 games for the South Bay Lakers, Bronny is averaging 17.4 points on 31 percent shooting from 3-point range, with 4.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists in 30 minutes per game.

If you’re not immediately impressed, consider this: Bronny never averaged that many points, in college or in high school. In one pro season, the most scrutinized rookie campaign in the history of the NBA G League, because of who Bronny’s father is, this young man turned himself into a scorer.

“I just think it’s a confidence thing,” Bronny said of his transformation. If you’re wondering, he averaged 4.8 points in 25 games for USC, and in high school at Sierra Canyon in suburban Los Angeles, he averaged 12.8 points for his career and 14.2 points as a senior.

“I think in high school, I would hold back a little bit, just because of how young I was, my experience, stuff like that,” Bronny continued. “Then college came, and with the scare that happened, didn’t really come back with a good amount of confidence. … I also wasn’t really given that freedom in college, even though I wasn’t producing like I wanted to.

“But going out and getting reps under my belt after that scare, it’s been good for my confidence.”

After the Lakers drafted Bronny, they signed him to a four-year, fully guaranteed contract. He would be a Laker, and any time he spent in the G League was to be temporary. It was unusual for a player of Bronny’s relative inexperience, and the statistics he turned in during his one partial season in college, to get that kind of contract and security. His drafting and the contract that followed brought accusations of nepotism, given LeBron’s status with the Lakers. Then it appeared Bronny would only play in the G League for home games (the South Bay Lakers play at the NBA team’s practice facility in El Segundo, Calif.), which only seemed to create more harrumphing on the outside toward Bronny.

The Lakers franchise, Bronny and his advisers decided he should play road games for South Bay — maybe not all of them, but when they made sense. It was clear he needed the reps and would not be getting them in the NBA. Pelinka said he discusses with Bronny when it looks like a good opportunity for Bronny to join South Bay and said Bronny has met every requested assignment with positivity and agreement.

Bronny’s first road game for South Bay was on Dec. 12, against the Phoenix Suns’ affiliate, and he enjoyed his first 30-point game as a pro — more notable because his first three games in the G League hadn’t gone that well (six points on 2-of-9 shooting in his debut; four points in the second game; 16 points but 6-of-15 shooting in the third). He was again inconsistent in the three G League games that followed, and he had a trip planned with South Bay for just after Christmas to go to Cleveland, where his grandparents still live and where he spent some of his formative years, for two games.

Bronny scored 38 points total in those two Cleveland games and has been even stronger since. He’s had games of 31 and 28 points, and even on the nights he doesn’t shoot particularly well, he finds ways to score and otherwise impact the games. This was not the case for Bronny during his Lakers’ summer-league session (averages of seven points on 33 percent shooting in six games) or the NBA preseason (4.2 points and 8.3 percent shooting from 3-point in six games).

“I saw consistency coming (before that Cleveland trip), and that’s like the biggest thing I’ve been criticized about for a minute, just being consistent as a player,” Bronny said. “I started to see that, and it kind of drove you to (consider that), well, maybe these people don’t think that I could be consistent as a player, be a good player, produce as a player. So just seeing those numbers and seeing myself on film, I believed in myself more, and that boosted my confidence. That little Cleveland stretch definitely sparked a little something.”

In our talk, it was Bronny who first brought up the criticism. Because of who he is, and the history he and his father made, and his draft and contract status, Bronny was always going to have a brighter spotlight on him than any other late second-round pick (or even front-runners for Rookie of the Year or the No. 1 pick in last year’s draft, for that matter).

Perhaps the worst of it, if only because of the platform held by the man who issued the criticism, came on Jan. 29, when, after Bronny went scoreless in a game for the Lakers, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith said on “First Take”: “I am pleading with LeBron James as a father: Stop this. We all know that Bronny James is in the NBA because of his dad.”

The incident angered LeBron, who let Smith know about it in a face-to-face exchange after a Lakers home game earlier this month.

Throughout Bronny’s brief pro career, his father had always said that Bronny tunes out or doesn’t hear the critics — he keeps his head down, focuses on the game and so on. But in our conversation Bronny said, multiple times, he actually does hear some of what is said about him, and he uses it to his advantage.

“My first thought about everything is I always try to just let it go through one ear and out the other, put my head down and come to work and be positive every day,” Bronny said. “But sometimes it just, it fuels me a little bit. I see everything that people are saying, and people think, like, I’m a f—— robot, like I don’t have any feelings or emotions.

“But I just take that and use it as fuel for me to go out, wake up every day and get to the gym early, get my extra work in, watch my extra film every day, get better every day,” Bronny continued. “That’s what Rob wants me to do as a young guy, coming in, playing in the G League and learning from far on the bench watching the Lakers play.”

Bronny said he’s up at 8 each morning that he isn’t on the road with the Lakers or in the G League. He’s at the practice facility by 9, when his work begins. It includes film study and individual work, playing in “stay ready” games for players at the end of the Lakers bench and physical therapy.

He said he doesn’t get much time to work out with LeBron, in part because of the Lakers’ sporadic practice schedule when the games come quickly and also because Bronny is in the G League on occasion.

“I am hopping from team to team, I’m not always with him on the Lakers,” Bronny said. “So not as much right now, but for sure when summer comes and when the offseason comes around, we’ll definitely be in the gym a lot together and working out and stuff like that.”

And maybe, after LeBron’s 22nd season and, hopefully for him and the Lakers, a deep playoff run, father and son will find time for some one-on-one.

“I can definitely get by him,” Bronny said, when I asked.

If Bronny continues his current trajectory, perhaps they will get more court time — in practices or games — for the Lakers before his dad retires. Bronny still has much ground to cover to get to that point, but he has, inarguably, made strides in his first season.

Moments before I saw Bronny in the locker room this week, he had been serenaded by the Lakers’ home crowd, who demanded he get into the game with chants of “Bronny, Bronny.” Redick obliged, and Bronny promptly drained a 3, to the delight of everybody in the building, other than perhaps the player guarding him.

“He doesn’t seem to take a day for granted,” Pelinka said. “He really embraces every day, and you just love to have people like that in your program.”
