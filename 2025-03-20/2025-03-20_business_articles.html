Hindalco will be investing  ₹45,000 crore across its aluminium, copper and speciality alumina businesses in the future, Aditya Birla group chairman Kumarmangalam Birla said on Thursday.

Speaking at an event to unveil a new brand identity for Hindalco, Birla said the company wants to be a force for good and affirmed the country's largest aluminium producer's commitment towards it.

"...we are committing  ₹45,000 crore across the aluminum, copper and specialty alumina businesses to deliver both upstream as well as next gen, high precision engineered products," Birla said at the event.

Aluminium, copper, and alumina are integral to solar modules and battery storage, Birla said, without spelling out a timeline for the investment.

Birla said the company is adding 150 MW to its renewable energy capacity to take the overall generation possibility to 350 MW.

The company has "pioneered" a 100-MW renewable energy solution in Odisha for aluminium smelting, combining wind, solar, and pumped hydro storage for stable, round-the-clock energy, Birla said.

The company is working on solutions in different areas, including EV mobility, renewable energy, energy storage, semiconductors, and high-end electronics, Birla said.

In auto, Hindalco is enabling lighter, more fuel-efficient, and EV-ready vehicles, and has helped design and manufacture lightweight battery enclosures for two-wheeler and cars, he said.

The company is setting up India's first Copper Foil facility for EVs, and also looking at high-speed transportation sector, Birla said, pointing that the first hyperloop test track has Hindalco's high-precision aluminium extrusions.

It is also developing hard alloy products for defence and working with ISRO on one-of-a-kind components for Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan.

Birla Copper is setting up India's first e-waste recycling plant, extracting and recycling metals from discarded devices, the head of the conglomerate said.

Hindalco runs 52 plants across the world and employs 47,000 people, Birla said.

			2.18pm 20th March 2025	 -
				Innovation Centre 

Skidattl has announced the commercial launch of its augmented reality engagement platform, which applies geospatial intelligence to bridge the gap between the virtual and physical worlds for businesses seeking to connect more closely with their customers. 

This groundbreaking technology allows anyone to create enhanced real-world experiences for their customers and prospects by providing virtual information overlays in physical spaces. By revolutionizing how people interact with their surroundings, it transforms outdoor experiences, encourages real-world exploration, and connects businesses with their audiences in more meaningful ways.

In the golf space, Turtle Bay Golf Course in Kahuku, Hawaii, has conducted a pilot of Skidattl and has reported significant enhancements to the interactions it has had with golfers, in addition to the experiences that their customers have with their offerings. For example, golfers can look through their phone to see the direction and distance to any green, providing real-time caddy advice and course information – all done with beacons overlaid on the real-world setting.

“Skidattl brings a brand new innovative element to the game of golf,” said Travis Joerger, Director of Golf at Turtle Bay. “The way it augments the real-world experience of golfing with digital insights is game-changing.  We have been delighted to participate in the early development of Skidattl's golf features and look forward to deploying it on a daily basis.”  

Founded by serial entrepreneur Randy Marsden, known for numerous successful ventures including Swype, acquired by Microsoft, and Dryft, acquired by Apple, Skidattl represents a paradigm shift in geospatial technology applied to augmented reality applications. Also, unlike traditional AR experiences that require extensive programming knowledge to create and focus on gaming or fantastical elements, Skidattl lets anyone use AR as a practical tool to enrich real-world engagement. 

Marsden envisions a future where virtual information seamlessly integrates with the real world, and Skidattl's architecture transcends mobile phone access, offering brands an evergreen conduit for immersive engagement across interfaces including AR glasses and other wearables, heads-up displays and others that will emerge.

Key features of the Skidattl platform include:

“Skidattl isn't just another AR company; it's a paradigm shift in how we interact with the world around us using geospatial technology,” said Marsden. “We're creating a bridge between the virtual and physical realms, encouraging people to step away from their screens and engage with their surroundings in meaningful ways. 

“In the next few years, I envision Skidattl becoming as intuitive and ubiquitous as social media is today, but instead of isolating people, it will connect them more deeply with the physical world. This isn't about replacing reality with virtual elements; it's about enriching our real-world interactions through seamless, contextual information. Skidattl represents the next evolution in human-computer interaction, one that prioritizes our connection to the physical world while leveraging the power of digital information.”

The platform is now available for enterprise subscriptions, with plans starting at $5,000 per year.

Two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray has been signed as a brand ambassador for Callaway Golf as he switches up his focus to bagging aces on the golf course rather than the tennis court. 

Vilamoura Golf reinforced its sustainability credentials when the Portuguese resort's four courses were each awarded two of the highest environmental, social and governance accolades in recognition of a dedication and commitment to biodiversity and strong environmental strategy.

Simon Grand, Course Manager at North Foreland Golf Club in Kent, has reported impressive results from using BASF's Attraxor, a plant growth regulator recommended and supplied by Agrovista Amenity.

Slightly more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, but layoffs remain historically low

Slightly more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, but layoffs remain historically low.

U.S. jobless claims filings rose by 2,000 to 223,000 for the week ending March 15, the Labor Department said Thursday. That's just less than the 224,000 new applications analysts forecast.

Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have remained mostly in a range between 200,000 and 250,000 for the past few years.

The four-week average, which evens out some of the week-to-week swings, inched up by 750 to 227,000.

It's not clear when job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or “DOGE,” will show up in the weekly layoffs report, though the Labor Department's February jobs report showed that the federal government shed 10,000 jobs. That's the most since June of 2022. 

Economists don't expect the federal workforce layoffs to have much of an impact until the March jobs report.

Those layoffs are part of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through DOGE, spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk.

Senior U.S. officials set the government downsizing in motion late last month via a memo dramatically expanding President Donald Trump's efforts to scale back the workforce. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired — though two federal judges last week issued orders requiring the rehiring of thousands of those workers.

Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains healthy with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.

The Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added a solid 151,000 jobs last month, and while the unemployment rate ticked up to a 4.1%, it remains a historically healthy figure.

Some high-profile companies have announced job cuts already this year, including Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta.

The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of March 8 rose by 33,000 to 1.89 million.

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DataRobot, the provider of AI that makes business sense, today launched AI application suites for finance and supply chain operations with SAP, built to seamlessly integrate AI into customer environments and business processes. The new AI suites enable AI teams to rapidly implement AI, securely utilize business data, and accelerate the delivery of AI solutions where and how business users need to work.

"We are excited to expand our partnership with SAP as an AI partner.

These AI applications will be available as insight apps on SAP Business Data Cloud, leveraging its core services, data products, AI-driven insights, and real-time analytics to enhance decision-making for all SAP customers.

	(Reuters) - Reliance group-owned Jio Financial Services has reached a preliminary agreement with Germany's Allianz SE to form an insurance business in India, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.


	This comes after Allianz earlier this week agreed to sell its 26% stake in its non-life and life insurance joint ventures with Bajaj Finserv to the Bajaj Group for around 2.6 billion euros ($2.82 billion).


	Bloomberg said that billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Jio and Allianz were in the process of finalising the ownership structure.

RTL's streaming subscribers in Germany, Hungary and France jumped 21 percent to 6.8 million last year, the company announced, with streaming revenue up 42 percent at $440 million.

	European television giant RTL Group is closing in on profitability in its streaming division, with subscriber figures and online revenues surging last year and start-up costs falling. 


	In its year-end results, published Thursday, RTL said subscribers to its streaming services RTL+ in Germany and Hungary and the new M6+ platform in France jumped 21 percent to more than 6.8 million. Streaming revenues were up an impressive 42 percent at €403 million ($437 million), boosted by price hikes for the RTL+ service in Germany. RTL's German service accounts for the lion's share of the group's subscriber business, with some 6.06 million paying subscribers. Streaming start-up losses at the division were down some 22 percent to €137 million ($149 million)

	RTL CEO Thomas Rabe hailed the results as a “turning point” for the company's digital future. “Our streaming services continued to grow dynamically and significantly reduced their start-up losses in 2024. We are firmly on track to reach profitability by 2026,” Rabe said in a statement.

	RTL's aggressive push into streaming was further bolstered by a renewed partnership with Deutsche Telekom, extending RTL+ Premium's integration into Telekom's MagentaTV through 2030. The move is expected to drive further subscriber gains in Germany. Rabe also pointed to promising early results in France, where the company rebranded its streaming service M6+ (from 6play) and launched last May, noting monthly users on the new platform were up 30 percent and streaming hours increased by 35 percent compared to its predecessor. 


	Looking ahead, RTL projects 9 million streaming subscribers and €750 million ($816 million) in revenue by 2026. 


	RTL's free TV business, still the company's core, presented a less rosy picture. The combined audience share of RTL Deutschland's German networks in its key 14-59 demographic fell to 26.3 percent from 27.4 percent a year earlier. TV ad revenue was flat at €2.35 billion ($2.56 billion). Rabe put a positive spin on the figures by pointing to the worse-off competitor ProSiebenSat.1, noting that RTL Deutschland's audience share over ProSiebenSat.1's combined channel reach was 6.3 percentage points, the widest in more than 10 years. 


	Overall, group revenue at RTL was stable at €6.25 billion ($6.81 billion), with total group profit down slightly at €555 million ($604 million) compared to €598 million a year earlier. 

	











	Revenue at Fremantle, RTL's content production division, saw an 8 percent “organic” decline, which the group attributed to the 2023 U.S. actor and director strikes and by budget cuts from streaming services and advertising-financed broadcasters. The drop was particularly offset by Fremantle's acquisition of TV production groups Asacha Media and Beach House Pictures. Asacha, a private equity-backed group, owns several production outfits in France, Italy and the U.K., including Death in Paradise producers Red Planet Pictures; Italian scripted groups Picomedia (Beyond the Sea, La Storia) and Stand by Me (Diaries); and France's Srab Films (Saint Omer, Happening) and Mintee Studios (Cimetiere Indien). Singapore-based Beach House has a non-scripted focus and produces shows including Netflix's Mind Your Manners and Mr. Midnight as well as local versions of global franchises such as Masterchef Singapore.


	On the creative side, Fremantle enjoyed a banner 2024, with Yorgos Lanthimos' Poor Things, produced by Fremantle-owned Element Pictures, picking up four Oscars.


	But with revenues of €2.25 billion ($2.45 billion), Fremantle is still a long way off its stated target of €3 billion ($3.26 billion) in annual revenues. RTL on Thursday casually moved the goalposts for that target, saying it hopes to hit the €3 billion mark “mid-term,” not by 2026, as originally forecast.

London has edged closer to becoming the world's top financial centre, fresh research shows, but concerns have been raised over the City's future competitiveness.

The 37th edition of Z/Yen Group's Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI 37) showed London maintained its second-place ranking amongst the world's top financial centres, whilst climbing 12 points from its last rating in September.

New York topped the table yet again, but its lead over London has narrowed.

London dominates the European rankings, with a 19 point lead over Frankfurt which missed out on a spot in the top ten, ranking eleventh globally.

The capital was in the top three centres for all eight major industries and scored first for banking.

Elsewhere, in fintech London was chomping at the heels of the Big Apple, reducing the gap between first and second place to a singular point.

The survey also questioned respondents on their home centre prospects, with London ranking as one of the top centres anticipated to become more competitive.

However, concerns exist over risks to London's future status, given that business confidence has taken a hit since the Chancellor's Autumn Budget.

The latest release from the Office for National Statistics showed the economy shrunk 0.1 per cent in January, in another blow to growth prospects.

Reeves had pledged to unlock growth across the country, which has included the launch of a National Wealth Fund and slashing regulation.

London market's woes have continued into 2025, after 2024 saw the largest outflow of listed companies since the global financial crisis, according to data from auditing giant EY. In total, 88 companies moved out of the market last year, compared to just 18 new listings.

London ranked 12th on a sub survey focusing on future prospects, with only 17 respondents mentioning the City as a centre they consider likely to grow in significance over the next two to three years.

The Middle East and Asia dominated the top 15, with seven of the centres in the Asia/Pacific region and six in the Middle East and Africa.

Dubai scored first with 63 mentions and Seoul second at 48. 

Professor Michael Mainelli, chairman of Z/Yen and former Lord Mayor of London, said: “Confidence in leading international financial centres remains strong, with a high degree of stability in rankings.

However, Mainelli noted the index period of the report falls outside of the new US administration, which has triggered a period of economic uncertainty.

“A slowdown in US centres may indicate some projected decoupling from global markets,” Mainelli added.

The GFCI generates ratings through a combination of survey respondents and a statistical model.

GFCI 37 used 140 instrumental factors combined with 31,314 survey assessments of financial centres and 4,946 respondents to an online questionnaire for the research.

In a win for the oil and gas pipeline company Energy Transfer,  a nine-person North Dakota jury found the environmental group Greenpeace liable for more than $660 million in damages and defamation for the 2016 to 2017 Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline.

In their lawsuit, Dallas-based Energy Transfer claimed Greenpeace was responsible for defamation, disruption and property damage for the protests that captured national attention in 2016. Greenpeace claimed the lawsuit threatened its freedom of speech. 

In a statement, Energy Transfer said, "This win is really for the people of Mandan and throughout North Dakota who had to live through the daily harassment and disruptions caused by the protesters who were funded and trained by Greenpeace. It is also a win for all law-abiding Americans who understand the difference between the right to free speech and breaking the law."

Greenpeace plans to appeal the verdict. "This is the end of a chapter, but not the end of our fight. Energy Transfer knows we don't have $660 million. They want our silence, not our money." Sushma Raman, interim executive director of Greenpeace Inc., told CBS News.

Greenpeace accused Energy Transfer of filing a "SLAPP" lawsuit, short for strategic lawsuits against public participation. SLAPP lawsuits have been criticized as being a method of curtailing free speech and assembly by individuals, organizations or press by threatening lengthy and expensive legal proceedings in court. 35 states have anti-SLAPP laws aimed at preventing these types of lawsuits. North Dakota is not among them. 

Energy Transfer previously filed a federal RICO lawsuit against Greenpeace seeking $300 million in damages in 2017, but that case was dismissed by a federal judge. Energy Transfer then filed a lawsuit against Greenpeace in North Dakota state court shortly after.

"The verdict against Greenpeace not only represents an assault on free speech and protest rights," said Rebecca Brown, president and CEO of the Center for International and Environmental Law, in a statement. "This case is a textbook example of corporate weaponization of the legal system to silence protest and intimidate communities. This misuse of the legal system stifles legitimate dissent and must be seen as a direct threat to environmental justice and democratic freedoms."

In the weeks and months preceding the trial, Greenpeace raised the alarm that the damages sought by Energy Transfer, thought at the time to be in the $300 million range, would be catastrophic to the group, claiming that would amount to 10 times the group's annual U.S. operating budget. Energy Transfer reported over $82 billion in revenue in 2024.

The damages ultimately awarded total roughly $667 million and will be split up among several arms of Greenpeace. Greenpeace USA is on the hook for about $404 million, while Greenpeace Fund Inc. and Greenpeace International must each pay some $131 million, according to The Associated Press.  

The 1,172-mile pipeline crosses four states and has been operating since late 2017 despite the controversy and the protest, which stemmed from a pipeline crossing under Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe called the pipeline a violation of its treaty rights and claimed the pipeline route risked polluting the tribe's primary water source and would damage sacred sites. 

The protests at Standing Rock drew thousands of people from around the country who camped outside the pipeline's construction site. Celebrities and prominent figures including now-Trump cabinet members Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard also visited the camp. 

But violence erupted between police, security guards and protestors several times, culminating in tear gas and water cannons being used against protestors. The camps were cleared in February of 2017. More than 140 people were arrested at the Standing Rock protests.  

One of the organizers of the protests was Chase Iron Eyes, an attorney for the Lakota People's Law Project, who was arrested during the demonstrations and charged with felony inciting a riot. Iron Eyes questioned Greenpeace's liability for the protests.

"I never met a single Greenpeace person, a representative, or ever went to a training or anything like that," Iron Eyes told CBS News. 

Instead, Iron Eyes found the ruling to delegitimize the concerns and agency of Native Americans who chose to protest at Standing Rock. "To hold them solely responsible for our fight, this is a tribal nation fight," he said. "I think it's disrespectful to tribal nations, to the Sioux Nation in particular, it was our nation, and our people who stood up."
