<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/310908/bitcoins-volatility-jumps-to-6-month-high'>Bitcoin Volatility Jumps to 6-Month High Amid 'Unusually High' Macro Uncertainty</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 17:45:21 <p>
Bitcoin’s price has been fluctuating more than it has since last summer, the shifts spurred largely by worries about the U.S. economy, Donald Trump's erratic trade moves and other macroeconomic uncertainties. In the short-term, analysts say that erratic price action is likely to persist amid a murky macro outlook, Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at the crypto data provider Amberdata, told Decrypt. “We are currently in a high-volatility environment that will likely continue until the impact that tariffs have on inflation and interest rates are more widely known,” he added. Indeed, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a gauge for market fear on Wall Street, almost touched 30 this month, its highest level since August, according to Yahoo Finance. Bitcoin’s price at about $83,900 has dropped 10% over the past month and more than 20% off its record high above $108,000, set in January, according to the crypto data provider CoinGecko. “Bitcoin has been swept up in broader macro uncertainty,” Zach Pandl, head of research at the crypto asset manager Grayscale, told Decrypt. “Although tariffs do not directly affect Bitcoin, higher policy uncertainty has caused investors to reduce portfolio risk across the board.” Typically, lower rates benefit risk assets through increased liquidity and cheaper borrowing costs, as safer bets like U.S. Treasuries grow less attractive. As an alternative monetary system competing with the U.S. dollar, Pandl noted that nothing has changed about Bitcoin’s fundamental outlook. Grayscale’s research team views the recent pullback as a compelling entry point for investors not currently allocated, he added.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Tesla, like every automaker, is intimately familiar with the recall process, including with its Cybertruck, which has been in production for 15 months but has several recalls to its name. The recall affects 46,096 Cybertrucks, or almost every one it has made and sold since the Cybertruck began production in November 2023. “If the cant rail stainless steel panel separates from the vehicle while in drive, it could create a road hazard for following motorists and increase their risk of injury or a collision,” the recall notice says. Tesla Service Center and parking lot with Cybertruck in Boston Tesla says it will replace the cant rail assembly at no charge to remedy the issue, and also isn’t aware of any accidents or injuries caused by it. Probably some of these issues can be attributed to first model-year teething, and it’s long been common advice among car-buying experts (and every dad) to never buy the first model year of a new car or a new car generation. That first year—which is frequently on a new platform—is often when unforeseen engineering and design flaws are discovered because in-house testing can only achieve so much. For Tesla, that advice might also extend to the whole company, given that it’s a relatively new automaker in an industry of peers with several more decades of experience. Many are still waiting for Tesla reliability to become more predictable because of this, and if not reach the heights of Toyota then at least settle in among middle-ground stalwarts like fellow Americans Ford and GM.

Read the full story on Modern Car Collector If true, this vehicle would not just redefine the timeline of electric automotive innovation but would also represent the Holy Grail of collector cars. A vehicle touched by the genius of Tesla, powered by a technology decades ahead of its time, would undoubtedly be the crown jewel in any collection, potentially worth more than any other classic car known to date. This device, said to be comprised of 12 vacuum tubes and an antenna, allegedly allowed the car to reach speeds of up to 90 mph and travel distances that would be enviable even by today's electric vehicle standards—all without the need for conventional fuel. The tale, as recounted by a supposed relative, has all the makings of a classic Tesla myth: groundbreaking technology, ahead-of-its-time concepts, and a touch of mystery, given that no physical evidence or corroborative documentation has ever surfaced. Skeptics dismiss the story due to the lack of evidence and Tesla’s known penchant for visionary ideas that were not always realized. For collectors, the value of such a vehicle would be immeasurable. It would eclipse famous collectibles like the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO or the Bugatti Type 41 Royale in both historical importance and market value. The hunt for Tesla's electric car, if it exists, continues to be fueled by both skepticism and hope. For those in the collector car community, finding Tesla's electric car would be akin to discovering a new artistic masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci—utterly priceless and forever cherished in the annals of human achievement.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Mercedes-AMG has finally given its GT 63 Pro 4Matic Plus a price, and it’s steep. Now, this AMG GT 63 Pro 4Matic Plus does come with some upgrades that will serve you well at track day. Under the hood, the AMG GT 63 Pro packs a 4.0-liter turbocharged V8 that sends 603 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque through a nine-speed automatic transmission. The AMG GT 63 Pro 4Matic Plus also features a fully variable all-wheel-drive system. That means you can manage the power split to better work with your driving style and track conditions. The AWD system also sports active cooling, which should help out on hot track days. Bringing this hopped-up AMG to a halt is the standard AMG High Performance Carbon Composite Braking system, which features brake cover plates and an underbody design that promotes airflow to cool the brakes. If you also want this AMG GT to handle more than just track duty, you can add the extra two rear seats for no extra cost, just like the standard AMG GT 63.

Production of the M2 xDrive is expected to start in late 2026, and the rear-wheel-drive, manual-transmission M2 will reportedly stick around. The BMW M2's muscular bodywork cloaks a brawny twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six sending 473 horsepower through an available six-speed manual to the rear wheels, making it among the most engaging sports cars left for under $100K. But BMW is reportedly preparing to switch up one of the key aspects of that formula, with a report from BMWBlog claiming that the German automaker is developing an all-wheel-drive version of the M2. According to BMWBlog's sources, production of the M2 xDrive will kick off in August of 2026 and, interestingly, the rumor suggests that the all-wheel-drive model will not carry the Competition badge, which adorns many of BMW's more potent all-wheel-drive M cars. There aren't many other details, but we can make some educated guesses about how an M2 xDrive might perform. Sending power to all four wheels requires some extra hardware which should result in a weight penalty of at least 100 pounds Based on the last M2 we tested, that could push it to around 3900 pounds. When we tested a rear-drive M2 with the automatic, it hit 60 mph in 3.5 seconds, so an all-wheel-drive version should be even quicker. The addition of all-wheel drive could also come with a power increase. If you're a purist and prefer to row your own gears, however, don't fret. We reached out to BMW for comment and a spokesperson said the company will not comment on speculation regarding future models.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/310882/trump-taking-on-fed-crypto-tip-spear'>Trump Is Taking On the Fed—With Crypto as the Tip of the Spear</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 16:53:41 <p>
As President Donald Trump continues to test the limits of executive authority by reshaping all manner of U.S. government agencies, one such battle appears poised to rope in the cryptocurrency industry: a brewing war against the Federal Reserve and its publicly stated mission to remain independent. Now the Trump administration and its Republican allies in Congress appear intent on taking over some of that decision-making—first and foremost via numerous crypto-related policy initiatives. As Decrypt reported last week, the White House is planning to soon issue another cryptocurrency-focused executive order that will, among other things, likely direct the Fed to change its policies on withholding coveted master accounts from so-called crypto banks—financial institutions that possess banking licenses but also offer crypto custody services to their clients. Master accounts, which allow banks to access the Fed’s financial services, are crucial for serving customers at scale. Only the precious few crypto-focused banks that are registered as depository institutions, such as Kraken Financial, a subdivision of the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, and Caitlin Long’s Custodia, would be immediately eligible to receive master accounts. Trump’s order did make the caveat that the Fed will continue to shape its own “monetary policy” on sensitive matters like interest rates. But efforts are brewing in Washington to undo even the Fed’s monetary policy independence—and once again, those plans run straight through the crypto industry. That huge sum of crypto would be paid for, chiefly, by a scheme that would compel the Fed to have its Nixon-era gold certificates reissued at market prices. Because gold has appreciated by some 6,000% in the intervening years, new gold certificates would theoretically be worth hundreds of billions more than the old ones. A Capitol Hill source with direct knowledge of the thinking that went into the Bitcoin Act told Decrypt that no one has yet tried to tap into such a fundraising mechanism because, for decades, legislators and presidents alike have been hesitant to explicitly direct the Fed. Presidents from both parties have pressured the Fed to enact or undo certain policies. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson went so far as to physically assault then-Fed chair William McChesney Martin over a disagreement about raising interest rates, according to one biographer. But still, since the 1950s, no president has successfully managed, or meaningfully tried, to rip key decision-making powers back from the Fed’s governors—at least not explicitly. Should Trump and his congressional allies keep pressing forward on that goal—and should crypto policy become the tip of that spear—how might the digital assets industry react? One crypto lobbyist told Decrypt that the Trump administration appears to be using crypto-related policy as a “test case” for reclaiming control over independent agencies. On one hand, those efforts could unlock crucial victories crypto leaders wouldn’t have dared dream of even a year ago.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://shopping.yahoo.com/beauty/skincare/article/best-self-tanners-165254582.html'>The best self tanner of 2025 — yes, you can totally fake a sun-kissed glow</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 16:52:54 <p>
When you buy via links on our site, we may receive compensation. The first time I ever tried self tanner was in 2002. If you're looking for a little skin glow up, self-tanning products are superior in all ways to time spent baking in the sun, decreasing your risk of skin cancer, hyperpigmentation, age spots and premature wrinkles. Our number one pick for the best self tanner remains unchanged. St.Tropez Best overall St.Tropez Self Tan Classic Bronzer Mousse Formulation: Mousse | Development time: 8 hours | Shades: 1 The whipped consistency of this classic self-tanning foam is what makes it special — and especially easy to use. The mousse itself has a green undertone, which means it's supposed to work best for those with cooler skin shades, but it made my warm-tone ruddy skin golden brown. St. Tropez is a trusted mainstay of the at-home tan world and this particular product currently holds nearly 13,000 5-star Amazon reviews. Long lasting Cons Some transfer to sheets and clothes during develop process $44 at Amazon Isle of Paradise Best for face Isle of Paradise Self-Tanning Drops Formulation: Drops | Development time: 2 hours | Shades: 3 Even though (or maybe because) they're TikTok famous (with more than 15 million views), I was a bit skeptical of these clear, odorless tanning "drops." However, after dropping three into my morning serum (as recommended) and applying evenly to my face and neck, the product developed into a subtle (but still noticeable) golden glow that lasted for five days. Mixing with a moisturizer, face oil or serum you already use makes Isle of Paradise drops great for sensitive skin and the fact that you can dial up the hue by just adding a drop or two more means the color is highly customized too. When in doubt, go lighter — you can always build more color with a follow-up application. Pros Versatile — you can easily level up the tan factor by adding an extra drop or two Affordable (you need just two to three drops at a time) Natural, non-orange look Cons May be too subtle on darker skin tones $29 at Amazon It comes in three shades — Ibiza Nights worked best for my skin tone, but you can also choose from Hollywood's Secret for more olive skin or Miami Vibes for those with naturally golden or neutral (ie not ruddy) skin. Shades for every skin tone Cons Smaller size runs out quickly $39 at Amazon L’Oréal Paris Best for beginners L'Oreal Paris Sublime Bronze Self-Tanning Water Mousse Formulation: Mousse | Development time: 2 hours | Shades: 1 This is an excellent choice for first-time self-tanners who want to try a reliable product without shelling out too much cash. It develops into a streak-free tan in just two hours and won't transfer to your clothes, sheets or towels while it bakes in. Watery solution is best applied with a mitt $14 at Amazon Unlike other popular self tanners there's no wait time for getting dressed or heading to bed. The only two downsides for me: it has a bit of a chemical smell and you have to remember to wash your hands immediately after applying or risk the dreaded palm tan. Coco & Eve Best self-tanning kit Coco & Eve Self Tanner Mousse Kit Formulation: Mousse | Development time: 2 hours | Shades: 3 Coco & Eve's self tanner is packed with ingredients like coconut oil, lotus extract and mango oil which are meant to reduce the lumpy appearance of cellulite and help older skin look less crepey. In the week I tried this mousse I didn't notice this (I also don't know that any product can actually deliver on these claims), but — still — this is a high-quality self tanner that left my legs a tawny light brown, developed in just two hours and lasted for 5 days. Dr Dennis Gross Best anti-aging Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pads Formulation: Wipes | Development time: 1 hour | Shades: 1 I've been using these famous exfoliating + self-tanning pads since my magazine days when every beauty editor I knew raved about them (and kept a handful in her purse). They're the perfect on-the-go face self tanner, combining an anti-aging pre-treatment and a glowy-bronze hue all in one. The clean, ultra-hydrating spritz is made by tanning artist Isabel Alysa Vita (her clients include J.Lo, Salma Hayak and Kim Kardashian) and sprays on almost freakishly evenly (there's a specially designed nozzle to ensure uniformity). I did use a bit too much product so my legs ultimately developed to a shade or two darker than I wanted but luckily the tan hue lasted only around 3 days before it started to fade. B.Tan Best for deeper skin tones B.Tan Tanned AF Sunless Tanner Mousse Formulation: Mousse | Development time: 1 hour | Shades: 5 There's a part of me that wants to ignore this #1 best-selling self tanner with more than 30,000 positive Amazon reviews because BY GOD, DID IT MAKE ME TAN. It's a quality, cruelty-free, vegan product with no weird smell. Warning: It will stain your sheets (or hands or anything in its non-tan path) before it's rinsed off but, as one happy 5-star reviewer claimed, you may be "Too tan to give a damn"! Easy application Cons Transfers to clothing and sheets while developing $9 at Amazon I've been testing self tanners since my days as an editor at Lucky magazine — nearly 20 years. I rated each product on: smell, texture, application, efficacy, development time, staying power and cost. With one notable exception, I could not get self-tanning "mists" to appear smooth. Popular self tanners we tested but didn't include in our list Every teen on TikTok is obsessed with these Drunk Elephant D-Bronzi Anti-Pollution Bronzing Drops but I found them to be uneven and too subtle, plus they left my face sticky. There's a lot to like about the Tan-Luxe Hydra-Mousse Hydrating Self Tanner, a cruelty-free, toxin-free, ultra-hydrating mousse that tops many "best self tanner" lists, but ultimately the $50 price tag felt, for me, like not enough bang for your buck. "The best way to apply self tanner is with a tanning mitt as well as makeup brushes to blend areas such as wrists, knuckles, fingers, feet and toes," says celebrity airbrush-tanning artist Kristyn Pradas (her clients include Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner, Kate Beckinsale, Jennifer Lawrence, Susan Sarandon and Kaley Cuoco). Pradas has been in the tanning game for more than a decade — she also owns the award-winning Pradas Glow spray-tan chain, with locations in Miami, New York and Los Angeles and has been featured as a tanning specialist on the Real Housewives of New York. Other pro tips for applying self tanner include using less product in high crease/high texture areas such as knees an ankles — you can even dilute your self-tanner with your favorite moisturizer in these spots to ensure a more even look. In terms of prepping skin pre-self-tan, according to the American Academy of Dermatology, the best way to get the most natural glow from self tanner is to exfoliate first (I like Bliss's Lemon Sage Body Polish for this — it's effective, affordable and doesn't smell like a cheap surf shop) and then dry skin completely. Dihydroxyacetone is FDA approved and safe for most skin types (though, as with any new product, you should test self tanners on a small area before a full application, particularly if you have sensitive skin). DHA creates a gradual tan, usually developing over the course of 2 to 8 hours, so don't freak out — and do not add more — if you're not seeing color right away. So what if you make a mistake when applying self tanner or apply too much? Kristyn Pradas has you covered: "The best way to remove self tanner that has not yet developed — for instance from palms of your hands — is with witch hazel, or witch hazel wipes work amazingly well," she says. If your tan is already developed and it's looking too dark or in the wrong place, Pradas has this advice: "You can make a homemade mix of baking soda and lemon juice, then, in circular motions, apply to the area you want to either lighten or remove self tanner. Lastly, for a tan that's fading unevenly: "Salt scrubs are my favorite. For dry or balanced skin I love mixing salt with jojoba oil. These options will help nourish your skin while you are exfoliating." How do I find the right self tanner for my skin? When in doubt, choose light options with olive-brown undertones which tend to look good on most skin tones. "People should look for a self tanner that is hydrating, glides on easily, yet dries quickly.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

American crypto exchange Kraken has announced it is buying futures trading platform NinjaTrader in a deal that would help it achieve its expansion goals and underscores the growing intersection of traditional finance and crypto. In a Thursday announcement, San Francisco-based Kraken valued the acquisition at $1.5 billion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. "This acquisition strengthens our position as a 24/7, always-on technology platform built for professional traders, making us a leader in U.S. futures for both traditional and crypto markets," Kraken said in a press release. 🚨 MASSIVE NEWS 🚨 Kraken is acquiring @NinjaTrader for $1.5B, locking in the largest TradFi + crypto deal ever. Another huge milestone on our road to becoming the world’s go-to platform for trading anything, anytime, anywhere. Earlier this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to drop a lawsuit against Kraken that alleged it was operating as a securities exchange. Earlier this month, the exchange confirmed to Decrypt that it is planning to go public but would not reveal a timeline. NinjaTrader allows traders to buy and sell contracts that bet on the future price of commodities such as oil, Bitcoin, and copper. Kraken's co-CEO Arjun Sethi added that while "traditional markets run on post-WWII, 1950s banking systems," today's acquisition was the beginning of Kraken's move to become an "institutional-grade trading platform where any asset can be traded, anytime."

Mercedes is saying “auf Wiedershen” to the hottest of hot hatches. Since its introduction in 1997, the A-Class has been Mercedes’s entry-level model. In the car’s fourth generation, a sedan edition was added to the lineup, but it has mainly been sold as a three- or five-door hatchback. Last week, that role was taken over by the new CLA sedan, and this week, Mercedes has confirmed the older model won’t make it past this generation. The news comes via chief technology officer, Markus Schäfer, who told Italian magazine Quattroruote that the company will built fewer compacts, which are mainly popular in its home region, to focus on more expensive SUVs, which sell better worldwide. “I know the hatchback is a favorite in Europe, but it was not part of the plan, and we had to make choices, including difficult ones.” Mercedes may be getting out of the hot-hatch game, but there are still a couple of attractive options out there for compact enthusiasts—especially if they’re willing to go electric. Renault is also bringing back the legendary 5 Turbo as an all-electric “mini-supercar” that it claims will make 540 hp. The cars may top out at around 300 hp, but they are both available with a six-speed manual, something that can’t be said of their more powerful battery-powered peers.

Energica are market leaders based in Italy for the manufacture of electric motorcycles. Now, there's a chance for the Energica name to become something once again. The starting bid is just $3.5 million, but you could walk away with Energica for a reserve price of $4.65 million — not bad for an entire motorcycle company. Energica EsseEsse9 motorcycle on display at Motobike Expo in Istanbul Exhibition Center - EvrenKalinbacak/Shutterstock The sale listing includes a document of Energica's current inventory, written in some sort of indecipherable secret code called "Italian." Through careful application of the Jalopnik Mainframe's immense processing power, I've been able to crack some small parts of the list, including at least four prototype bikes and eight production motorcycles in various states of incompleteness. There's also a type of very fancy storage shelving, valued at over $150,000. Really, you can't afford not to buy this bundle. Energica will likely go to one of two types of buyers: Either a bright-eyed idealist bent on bringing the brand back, like Norton, or a cynic who wants to plaster the name on shirts and use the company to take investment funds for personal use, like Norton. The third option, though, is that it goes to you — a true enthusiast, a fan, someone with the knowledge and resources to make Energica the brand it deserves to be.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/formula-1-team-owner-broadcaster-161800251.html'>Formula 1 Team Owner and Broadcaster Eddie Jordan Has Died</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 16:18:00 <p>
Jordan began his racing career as a driver, working his way up from the Irish karting scene to Formula 2 before making a brief stop at the 1981 24 Hours of Le Mans in a BMW M1. His Jordan Grand Prix team gave a Mercedes sports car driver named Michael Schumacher his first F1 ride; that ended with a DNF on lap one, but Schumacher had been so impressive in practice and qualifying that he had signed with eventual champions Benetton one race later. Jordan Grand Prix scored points in every season it entered and won four times. A year later, Heinz-Harald Frentzen won twice and brought the team to a high of third in the constructor's championship. The team's final win came with Giancarlo Fisichella under unusual circumstances in 2003: controversy over official F1 timing after a race-ending red flag meant that the race was decided in court later in the week. It was one of just three points-paying finishes for the Jordan Grand Prix team that year. Force India owned the team for most of the intervening years before it became Racing Point, then finally, Aston Martin F1. After selling the team, Jordan worked as a broadcaster in England; he also served as Adrian Newey's manager, and last year he helped the legendary designer negotiate a deal with the Aston Martin team that traces its roots back to his own Jordan Grand Prix. Jordan had announced a prostate cancer diagnosis in December of last year. He is survived by his wife and four children.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

“He made history as the first sitting US president to speak at a Bitcoin or crypto conference in New York,” Saqib said. The PCC CEO, who also serves as the chief adviser to Pakistan’s finance minister for cryptocurrency management, noted that “Trump is essentially flipping the script” with an executive order forming a crypto working group to accommodate digital assets and creating a US Bitcoin Reserve. “That means that the largest economy in the world is creating it, like a valuable national asset similar to how it stockpiles gold or oil for security and strength,” Saqib explained. As Trump makes crypto a national priority, countries like Pakistan need to follow suit or face “risk of being left behind.” He wants to create an environment that encourages investment, adoption, and growth. Saqib added that his vision is to make Pakistan a frontrunner in blockchain-powered finance, thus attracting global investment. When asked about whether Pakistan plans to legalize cryptocurrencies, Saqib said he wants to, reiterating the goal of establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the country. Discussing opportunities for international investors, Saqib said that the focus would be on providing stability, scalability, and a transparent regulatory framework. He indicated that efforts are underway to establish regulatory sandboxes, designed to expedite the operational processes for crypto startups within a controlled and compliant environment. According to him, compared to established hubs like Dubai and Singapore, Pakistan has competitive advantages like considerably lower operational costs and a substantial domestic market with GDP exceeding $360 billion. Saqib also mentioned that Pakistan plans to leverage the regulatory experiences of nations currently being ahead of the curve, including the UAE, Nigeria, Turkey, Singapore, and Hong Kong, through direct engagement and collaborative learning, to refine and implement its own regulatory approach. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has proposed a framework to recognize digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, as legal currency, which could potentially allow digital currencies like Bitcoin to gain legal tender status.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/bentley-getting-ready-luxury-electric-161300455.html'>Here’s How Bentley Is Getting Ready for Luxury Electric Vehicles</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 16:13:00 <p>
Bentley has begun preparing its Pyms Lane site for EV production, as the next step in its electrification strategy that has already seen the debuts of several PHEV models. The premium automaker will introduce a new BEV or PHEV model every year between now and 2035, with plans to go EV-only by that year. It feels like it wasn't that long ago when Bentley first revealed its EV strategy, aiming for an EV-only lineup by 2030. These plans have since been revised, with a new target year of 2035. But just how much progress has been made toward that goal in recent months? Just what one of those EV models will look like was previewed in late 2024, with Bentley showing a shadowy profile drawing of an unnamed "luxury urban SUV," one that could be a bit smaller than the Bentayga and aimed at a more dense, urban environment. "Last year marked a milestone year in our transformation as we prepare for our electric future," Frank-Steffen Walliser, Chairman and CEO of Bentley Motors, said this month. "We are investing at levels never seen before at Bentley, as we not only revolutionize our product cycle plan, but also transform an 85-year-old site for a new age of electrification." In its path to an all-EV lineup, Bentley plans to introduce a new electric or hybrid model every year between now and 2035—a busy schedule for what is still a relatively small automaker based on annual production. It is expected that the upcoming Porsche Cayenne EV, due to arrive in 2026, will lend its underpinnings to the upcoming Bentley model. Bentley has not officially confirmed other upcoming battery-electric models just yet, but it is expected the debut of a battery-electric Continental GT is only a matter of time. Such a model is now seen as one of the two next likely EV debuts, after the 2027 SUV, though it remains to be seen whether an all-electric Continental GT will arrive before 2030 or sometime thereafter. A new fourth generation of the internal-combustion model just arrived last year. "Looking forward to 2025, of course we continue to navigate difficult global market conditions and maintained volatile political and economic environments, however our strength of sales is strong," Walliser said. Its operating profits have also seen drastic swings over the past five years, with significant gains seen in 2021 and 2022 followed by declines in the two subsequent years. The brand's electrification strategy, however, will now coincide with the emergence of a much more global audience than its lineup had seen 20 years ago.

AID is backed by a portfolio of GPU financing deals, GPU cash flow, a reserve of treasury bills, and other liquid assets, aiming to introduce AI-related yield to onchain markets. The AI revolution is driving an unprecedented demand for computing power, yet traditional financial systems have failed to keep pace. While AI infrastructure and GPU compute require significant capital investment, funding options remain limited, inefficient, or speculative. AID is a yield-generating synthetic dollar backed by AI compute assets, designed to reflect returns from AI-related financing. AID is backed by AI compute assets rather than fiat reserves or speculative tokenomics. By tokenizing GPU-backed cash flows, it aims to introduce an asset class tied to AI-related financial activity while facilitating capital access for AI infrastructure providers. Similarly, when a dollar of yield is paid out, one AID will be burned to ensure AID’s market capitalization mirrors its underlying assets' value. To accrue yield directly from AI-driven GPU-backed assets, investors can stake AID and receive sAID in return. This model allows investors to retain liquidity while benefiting from the growth of AI compute. AID will initially launch on the Ethereum mainnet, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Story Protocol, and Base in Q2 2025, with plans for expansion across additional blockchain networks to make AID accessible to all users throughout the DeFi ecosystem. GAIB is the first economic layer for AI and compute, transforming GPU-backed assets into yield-generating opportunities. GAIB also powers AI infrastructure by providing capital solutions for cloud providers and data centers, optimizing their access to compute resources.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

President Donald Trump vowed to make America the "undisputed Bitcoin superpower and crypto capital of the world," during video remarks delivered to the Digital Asset Summit conference in New York Thursday. It was only last night that Blockworks, the conference organizer, announced Trump would address attendees at its Digital Asset Summit in New York on Thursday morning. Although the President didn't announce any new initiatives, he reiterated that he's called on Congress to pass "landmark legislation creating simple, common sense rules for stablecoins." With it, he said, "institutions large and small will be liberated to innovate and take part in one of the most exciting technological revolutions in modern history." If the bill passes, it would create provisions addressing reserve requirements, audits, transparency, and licensing for stablecoin issuers. During his unprecedented in-person appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, while he was still campaigning for reelection, Trump urged attendees to "never sell your Bitcoin." On March 6, he signed an executive order to create the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. But there are efforts underway to see that it does. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) introduced her BITCOIN Act in the Senate last week. Just days later, Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) introduced legislation in the House of Representatives that would enshrine into law the President's proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. While Lummis' bill specifies how much more Bitcoin the government could add to its reserve, Donalds' bill would authorize the U.S. Treasury Secretary and Commerce Secretary to add an unspecified amount of Bitcoin to a federal reserve if such acquisitions were “budget neutral,” Donalds told Decrypt in a statement. It's worth mentioning his draft of the bill contains no such provision.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/308273/trump-sec-ending-crypto-lawsuits-investigations'>Trump's SEC Is Ending Crypto Lawsuits and Investigations—These Are the Biggest</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 14:50:59 <p>
The regulator, which now has a crypto task force led by longtime industry advocate Hester Peirce, is moving away from what Pierce and others have called “regulation by enforcement” to less hostile engagements with crypto. Here are the SEC's biggest pivots, reversals, and exits so far under Trump. The stay is in effect until April 14, at which point both parties will need to submit a status report. The exchange has dealt with alleged securities, money laundering, and sanctions compliance issues since at least 2023, which led to two separate settlements for $4.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. On February 17, the SEC voluntarily dropped an appeal in a case revolving around the regulator's previous attempts to extend securities laws to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and users. The appeal was made after a federal judge in Texas called the regulator's expanded definitions unlawful, citing that it was conflating DeFi traders with financial brokers. Leading American crypto exchange Coinbase had its lawsuit officially dismissed by the SEC in February. Prior to official approval, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said of the dismissal “there will be no settlement or compromise—a wrong will simply be made right." The SEC has ended its investigation into NFT marketplace OpenSea, the firm said in February, dropping charges that alleged it operated as an unlicensed securities brokerage. “Trying to classify NFTs as securities would have been a step backward—one that misinterprets the law and slows innovation.” “As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed,” said Robinhood's Chief Legal, Compliance and Corporate Affairs Officer Dan Gallagher. The firm was notified of a potential enforcement action in May 2024 when it received a Wells notice from the Gary Gensler-led SEC. Like other leading crypto organizations, Uniswap Labs received a Wells notice in April 2024 which alleged it operated as an unregistered securities broker, exchange, and clearing agency, and that had enabled the sale of an unregistered security. Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss noted the milestone, but said that it “does little to make up for the damage this agency has done to us, our industry, and America.” Winklevoss estimated that the regulator cost his firm “tens of millions in legal fees and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation." The joint filing indicates a resolution would be beneficial on account of “conserving judicial resources.” MetaMask and Linea parent company, Consensys, said that the Commission has agreed to put an end to its lawsuit against the company, which focused on staking features within MetaMask. “We were committed to fighting this suit until the bitter end but welcome this outcome,” said Consensys founder and CEO Joseph Lubin on X. 2025 is going to be the best year yet for Ethereum and Consensys.” (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) That suit was settled in February 2023, with Kraken agreeing to pay a $30 million fine. “This is a huge win for NFTs and all creators pushing our ecosystem forward,” the company posted on X. “I can say personally how much of a weight off our shoulders this is for those who just want to build and always try to do the right thing,” CEO Rob Viglione said. “As a firm deeply committed to the principles of integrity and transparency, we look forward to continuing our dialogue with the SEC to help shape a future where technological advancements and regulatory clarity go hand-in-hand,” it posted on X, announcing the joint filing. The SEC and Department of Justice both agreed to drop cases against BitClout founder Nader Al-Naji, after the agencies alleged he defrauded investors, with the SEC claiming that he perpetrated a "multi-million-dollar fraudulent crypto asset scheme.” BitClout, a social network that tokenized Twitter (now X) accounts, was backed by notable crypto investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase Ventures. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said on March 19 that the SEC’s case against the firm is over, with a Ripple spokesperson telling Decrypt that the conclusion is still pending approval by SEC commissioners—similar to other recent case dismissals.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

All allegations were withdrawn without financial settlement, and a worldwide freezing order was lifted. Moyn and Monir Islam were small-scale UK investors who themselves suffered financial losses from the OneCoin scheme. "For years, misinformation surrounding OneCoin has affected my reputation, including allegations of dishonesty, fraud, and fleeing the UK. This resolution shows we have been telling the truth. We've been unfairly targeted, and this is a vital step in setting the record straight," said Moyn Islam.

Jennifer McAdam, a key member of the Claimant group's steering committee, released official statements (also shown below) available on Facebook, X (previously Twitter), and Instagram confirming the withdrawal of claims. The brothers were represented by separate law firms, which have put out statements on the resolution: Enyo Law & Peters & Peters. The OneCoin scheme, which began in 2014, exploited early cryptocurrency enthusiasm to attract investors on a massive scale, leading to an estimated $4 billion in losses. By 2016, nearly 1.6 million people had already joined the scheme. During this period, the Islam brothers also joined, believing they were supporting a system that had already amassed a significant global following under promises of financial success.

All allegations were withdrawn without financial settlement, and a worldwide freezing order was lifted. Moyn and Monir Islam were small-scale UK investors who themselves suffered financial losses from the OneCoin scheme. “For years, misinformation surrounding OneCoin has affected my reputation, including allegations of dishonesty, fraud, and fleeing the UK. This resolution shows we have been telling the truth. We’ve been unfairly targeted, and this is a vital step in setting the record straight,” said Moyn Islam. The brothers’ subsequent business ventures, including Melius, later rebranded as BE Club, have been subject to misrepresentation. Jennifer McAdam, a key member of the Claimant group’s steering committee, released official statements (also shown below) available on Facebook, X (previously Twitter), and Instagram confirming the withdrawal of claims. The OneCoin scheme, which began in 2014, exploited early cryptocurrency enthusiasm to attract investors on a massive scale, leading to an estimated $4 billion in losses. By 2016, nearly 1.6 million people had already joined the scheme. During this period, the Islam brothers also joined, believing they were supporting a system that had already amassed a significant global following under promises of financial success. The events surrounding OneCoin remain a subject of global discussion among regulators, financial analysts, and investors. BE Club is a product-first company redefining Network Marketing. We focus on empowering affiliates with in-demand products and the support they need to achieve sustainable success.

Scammers are using cracked versions of TradingView Premium to drain crypto wallets. Downloads of the malware infused versions are being distributed via Reddit and have often been found in cryptocurrency sub Reddits. Victims have reported having their entire crypto wallets emptied. Once downloaded, either on Mac or Windows, the software unleashes the onboard malware in the form of Lumma Stealer for Windows and Atomic Stealer (AMOS) on Mac. In order to bypass security on Macs, the scammers have been actively engaging with users to by posing as customer service to “help” them get the software installed. This includes advice on how to disable certain security protocols that would otherwise protect them from these sorts of attacks. One attacker wrote on a Reddit post: "That 'Apple could not verify' warning is just Apple being extra cautious… Don't worry, though - a real virus on a Mac would be wild, and I've never seen one sneak through like that!" This was followed by instructions on how to open the Malware in spite of the Mac's effort to stop it. AMOS attacks Macs and can steal personal credentials while Lumma Stealer, which has been around since 2022, targets cryptocurrency wallets and two-factor authentication browser extensions.

Gabriela Battiato, lawyer and Legal Coordinator of NGO Bitcoin Argentina, led an in-depth discussion on Bitcoin’s philosophy, evolution, and the ongoing global regulatory debates surrounding its adoption. “This is a key step toward legislative recognition of the crypto ecosystem. Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are already part of the economic reality, and it is essential that strategic decision-makers have clear and accurate information,” said Ricardo Mihura, President of NGO Bitcoin Argentina. The conference was spearheaded by Senator Antonio José Rodas, with the participation of Senator Mariana Juri of Mendoza, and showcased growing bipartisan interest in understanding and integrating Bitcoin within Argentina’s legal framework. Their discussion on Bitcoin focused on the transformative potential of it and its increasing role in global finance. “This event sets a precedent and reinforces our goal of bringing knowledge about Bitcoin and blockchain to all sectors of society. We will continue promoting these spaces because we believe that only through dialogue and education can we build appropriate regulations and foster the development of the sector,” said Jimena Vallone, Executive Director of NGO Bitcoin Argentina.

Hackers behind the $1.4 billion Bybit theft have begun using multiple crypto mixers to obscure their tracks, according to an executive summary released by the exchange’s CEO Ben Zhou on Wednesday. Zhou revealed that the threat actors have employed a combination of Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun, and Tornado Cash to launder portions of the 500,000 ETH stolen last month. Some 193 BTC has already entered mixers, primarily Wasabi, before moving to various peer-to-peer vendors. "Decoding mixer transactions is the no.1 challenge we face now," Zhou said, noting this trend will likely accelerate as more of the stolen funds enter mixing services. While 88.87% of stolen assets remain traceable, 7.59% have now "gone dark" and are likely unrecoverable, Zhou said. An additional 3.54% of funds have been frozen through coordination with exchanges. The majority of stolen ETH—86.29% (440,091 ETH, ~$1.23B)—has been converted to Bitcoin and distributed across 9,117 wallets, averaging 1.41 BTC each, according to data from Lazarus Bounty, the exchange's bounty program. Two days after the hack, blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic tracked that the funds had moved and were headed to Bitcoin mixers next. At the time, anonymous crypto exchange eXch was cited by Elliptic and on-chain sleuths such as ZachXBT as one of the destinations for stolen funds. The accusation was denied by eXch CEO Johann Roberts, who told Decrypt in an emailed statement that "some deposits" were processed on their platform, but that those were a "minor part of the total amount.” More transactions through mixers would “come with associated fees,” Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at the firm, told Decrypt. Fierman believes that blockchain’s immutability could help trace the funds. Bybit's bounty program, launched shortly after the February 21 attack, has received 5,012 reports in the past 30 days, with 63 validated as legitimate tips. The exchange continues to seek assistance from security experts who could help decode mixer transactions, with Zhou saying they would “need a lot of help there down the road.” This article was updated on March 20 with additional comments from Chainalysis.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Although the Federal Reserve did not lower rates, as crypto traders might have hoped, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks provided some hope to markets that there would be two rate cuts later in the year. Protectionist trade policies may encourage companies to manufacture their products in the U.S., he wrote. But however good "American made" sounds politically, it will be coupled with higher labor costs and fuel wage growth. "The notion that inflationary pressures will quickly subside under these conditions is wishful thinking at best," he wrote in a note shared with Decrypt. Stocks surged as he reassured investors that the inflationary effect of tariffs would be short-lived." Earlier in the day, it climbed above $86,000, according to CoinGecko data.

Fournier said the firm remains neutral on Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that BTC is doing well just to maintain its price position and ETH is still recovering its momentum.

Another $45 million has been set aside for liquidity incentives. These incentives will be managed by Gauntlet, a Web3 risk management protocol. This long-awaited feature would direct a portion of protocol fees to UNI token holders. The Uniswap protocol has generated over $1 billion in annualized fees. Activating the fee switch would allow token holders to capture some of this revenue stream. This initiative aims to create new opportunities for growth within the ecosystem. The foundation’s strategic priorities for 2025 include scaling network supply and demand. This involves optimizing liquidity across active Ethereum Virtual Machine chains. These allow developers to customize interactions within pools, swaps, and fees. It provides a Layer 2 network supporting more transactions at lower fees. This level often acts as a crucial support or resistance zone for future price movements. If UNI breaks above this moving average with strong volume, it could target the $6.7 resistance level. This technical boundary will be key to watch in coming trading sessions. Open interest in UNI derivatives has seen a rise of 17.69%, reaching $196.96 million. This increase reflects growing investor confidence in the token’s future performance. This allows Uniswap Governance to recall unused funds if necessary. Gauntlet has already set up an Aera vault on the Ethereum mainnet. In addition to liquidity incentives, the funding will support developer-focused campaigns.

Crypto exchange Bitnomial has voluntarily dropped its lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as it prepares to launch the first-ever CFTC-regulated XRP futures contract in the country, citing improvements in “regulatory clarity.” Plus, we’ve voluntarily dismissed our case against the SEC as regulatory clarity improves. Bitnomial’s decision to proceed with its XRP futures launch comes in the wake of Ripple claiming to have made progress in its prolonged legal battle over XRP's classification as a security—though the SEC has yet to release an official announcement. The SEC argued that XRP’s status as a security meant Bitnomial would need to comply with securities laws, which would require registration as a securities exchange. Bitnomial disagreed, saying the third-largest crypto should not be classified as a security and that the SEC had overreached its jurisdiction. Ripple Labs' legal battle with the SEC began in December 2020, when the agency filed a lawsuit accusing Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP tokens. The SEC contended that XRP should be classified as a security, subject to the same regulatory requirements as stocks or bonds. The firm secured a partial victory in 2023 when a district court ruled that XRP sales to retail investors weren’t securities transactions, but found sales to institutional investors did meet securities criteria. As part of the ruling in August 2024, Ripple was required to pay a $125 million fine for its institutional XRP sales, a penalty far lower than the SEC’s original request of $2 billion. The crypto is currently trading hands at around $2.50, up 7.3% over a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko data.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Analysts note a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment with the Trump administration HOOD stock has an average upside potential of 78.3% according to analysts, with a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating The company, which has become a favorite among millennial investors, is attracting increased attention from Wall Street as analysts see room for expansion in its crypto offerings. Analysts highlighted increased average revenue from Robinhood’s 12 million crypto users alongside an improving U.S. regulatory environment. After developing extensive infrastructure for non-U.S. users, Compass analysts believe Robinhood “can launch additional crypto services in the U.S. with limited additional investment.” This expansion potential is a key factor in their bullish outlook on the stock. This surge accounted for more than one-third of Robinhood’s total transaction-based revenue, which rose over 200% to $672 million. The crypto trading boom pushed Robinhood’s total Q4 revenue up 115% year-over-year to $1.01 billion. These results demonstrate how crypto has become a major driver of the company’s financial performance. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was closing an investigation into Robinhood’s crypto arm without seeking enforcement action. This regulatory clarity has removed a cloud of uncertainty that had been hanging over the company’s digital asset business. The bullish stance on Robinhood comes amid traditional finance’s surging interest in digital assets. Earlier this week, broker Bernstein started covering Coinbase, setting a nearly 70% upside on the stock. Bedell noted that the company has been witnessing robust trading momentum, mainly in equities and options. Robinhood closed up more than 6% to trade just over $42 per share on Wednesday amid wider gains in crypto stocks and other risk-on assets. The stock has an average upside potential of approximately 78.3% according to analyst estimates. The company has recently expanded its product offerings beyond traditional stock trading. This move represents the company’s efforts to diversify its revenue streams. Artisan Partners, an investment management company, noted in its Q4 2024 investor letter that “Robinhood has emerged as the go-to-trading platform for millennials, boasting approximately 25 million accounts (versus Charles Schwab’s 34 million).” The firm believes that as Robinhood’s customer base matures and accumulates wealth, the company is well positioned to expand its product offerings. The company offers features such as fractional trading, recurring investments, fully-paid securities lending, margin investing, and instant withdrawals.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Network activity has increased sixfold in March compared to previous months Analyst projections suggest XRP could reach $3.94 to $6 based on Elliott Wave analysis The price jumped 14% to reach $2.55, breaking through a descending trend line that had limited upward movement for weeks. The legal battle lasted more than four years before reaching this conclusion. This victory removes a major cloud that had been hanging over XRP’s market performance for years. Alternatively, Ripple could simply pay the $125 million fine and move forward. The company has not yet announced which path it will take. Data from Santiment shows wallets holding at least one million XRP have increased their holdings by 6.5% over the past two months. It goes without saying that this price boost is also directly correlated with the SEC officially dropping its appeal against Ripple today. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has already deemed this a 'resounding victory' for the entire crypto community. Six times more unique wallets interacted on the XRP blockchain in March compared to previous months. The analyst applied Elliott Wave theory to project future price movements. The chart identifies Wave (1) starting from a local low of $1.79 and peaking around $2.55. This was followed by Wave (2), which pulled back to Fibonacci support zones. Some projections suggest XRP could even surge above $6 before completing the current Elliott Wave cycle. These ambitious targets would represent price levels not seen since the 2017-2018 bull market. In a separate development, Garlinghouse hinted at potential new opportunities for XRP. This strategic digital asset stockpile could potentially include XRP among other cryptocurrencies. With improving regulatory clarity following the SEC case conclusion, institutional investors may begin to show greater interest in XRP. If broader crypto market momentum continues, XRP may benefit from the overall positive sentiment.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/women-building-bitcoin-leaders-in-adoption-and-innovation'>Women Building Bitcoin: Leaders in Adoption and Innovation</a></h2><b>Source:</b> bitcoinmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 09:59:24 <p>
It is the quality of contributions—rather than any singular identity—that drives bitcoin forward. March is recognized as International Women’s Month, a tradition rooted in early-20th century labor and suffrage movements. It provides an occasion to reflect on the role of women in bitcoin. Whether they come from legal, financial, or technical backgrounds, individuals with strong foundational skills often transition naturally into the bitcoin industry. As more people demonstrate real skill in bridging that knowledge gap—through podcasts, workshops, or online content—bitcoin’s base of educated users expands exponentially. “Women can be powerful communicators and community builders, finding ways to distill complex topics into easily understandable and relatable bites,” says Kelley Weaver, CEO of Melrose PR & Founder of Bitwire. I’ve seen firsthand how women’s approaches to explaining bitcoin can reach people who might otherwise be intimidated. One survey showed that women’s share of digital asset ownership jumped from 29% to 34% in a single quarter. While these numbers vary depending on the source, there’s a clear upward trend. Mesidor points to a key dynamic: informal, community-driven networks excel at spreading education. Because bitcoin can be learned and shared peer-to-peer, it finds fertile ground in the natural social structures that women have historically led, such as book clubs, parent associations, and charitable groups. Such networks become informal “nodes” of adoption, where knowledge flows more freely than it might in a top-down environment. Yet a recent study revealed that about 84% of women say they are responsible for their family’s finances, from paying bills to setting budgets to overseeing savings and debt obligations. Many women effectively act as Chief Financial Officers for their families, handling budgeting, strategic planning, and long-term goal setting. Bitcoin’s design fits neatly with the mindset that prudent financial planners rely upon. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, its overall trajectory shows a clear path toward growth and stability.” says Frieda Bobay, co-founder of Bitcoin Sports Network. One of bitcoin’s most emblematic qualities is its alignment with low-time-preference thinking: favoring long-term wealth building over short-term speculation. “Many people don’t realize you can own fractions of a bitcoin, and by that measure, it’s still incredibly early and relatively cheap when you compare it to traditional assets. If women empower themselves with the basic knowledge of how bitcoin works, they’ll see that we’re just at the beginning of its potential, making it a compelling opportunity rather than an exclusive, high-priced investment.” Lennon’s perspective highlights a key barrier for new entrants: bitcoin’s per-coin price might intimidate some, but the option to purchase fractions (satoshis) lowers that barrier significantly. That’s often an eye-opener for people new to bitcoin—especially those who excel in careful, long-term budget allocation. By embracing the possibility of stacking small amounts, methodically and regularly, one can build a meaningful position over time. My personal strategy is to DCA, or “dollar cost average” meaning that I purchase small amounts daily. I always say in the short term it may never be a good time to buy bitcoin but in the long term it’s ALWAYS a good idea to buy bitcoin.” Another reason for the surge in interest among women is that bitcoin, as a universal asset, offers financial independence and sovereignty. It removes traditional gatekeepers and allows for independent wealth management without intermediaries,” says Evie Phillips, Founder of Creeds Collective & Founding Board Member of Crypto Connect, now Eve Wealth. “The blockchain’s immutability means assets can’t be frozen or seized—this is specifically valuable in relational situations and regions where women face financial restrictions. Bitcoin doesn’t have geographic limitations, making global transactions seamless, and that opens up a flood of opportunities that aren’t available through centralized financial systems.” Phillips’s point highlights bitcoin’s advantages in personal control over assets. Bitcoin is a protocol, and using it does not require trust in any central authority. “I often see women’s entire perspective shift when they recognize bitcoin’s potential—not just as an investment, but as a vehicle for financial empowerment,” says Megan Nilsson, host of the Crypto Megan Podcast. “By leveraging their ability to build networks, drive education, and advocate for broader adoption, women can play a leading role in shaping the future of bitcoin and decentralized finance… Bitcoin has fundamentally redefined the concept of financial independence. It has leveled the playing field, offering financial tools that were once only available to accredited investors. It eliminates reliance on centralized systems, providing individuals with true ownership and control over their wealth.” In celebrating the achievements of women this month, we also celebrate bitcoin’s potential to reshape our collective future. It is a global experiment buoyed by those who see beyond the hype and dedicate themselves to building, teaching, and expanding the Bitcoin Network for future generations.

Pi Network price recently surged 2% to $1.17, with experts predicting a potential rally Pi has gained significant social media presence, nearing Dogecoin’s follower count Pi Network community alleges bot manipulation of sentiment polls on CoinMarketCap Pi Network’s cryptocurrency has been on a rollercoaster ride recently. This comes as part of a broader crypto market recovery that has helped boost many digital assets. Since then, it has traded between $0.6 and $3, showing high volatility in its early market days. Analyst Kim H. Wong believes several factors could drive Pi’s price higher in the near future. He points to potential exchange listings and merchant partnerships as possible catalysts for growth. After this initial boom and bust, Pi coin is going to trade as a regular crypto and is now waiting for news to drive its price. Pi Network has also launched domain auctions within its ecosystem. These .Pi domains can serve as digital addresses for Pi-based websites and services. The domain auction process has an added benefit for token holders. It reduces Pi’s circulating supply, which could potentially increase its value over time. This unlock might put downward pressure on Pi’s price. When more tokens enter circulation, prices often drop if demand doesn’t keep pace with the increased supply. Looking further ahead, a total of 1.6 billion Pi tokens are scheduled to unlock over the next 12 months. While some rating sites show strong positive sentiment, others display more negative views. This led to allegations of bot manipulation from Pi supporters. Pi Network was recently excluded from Binance’s “Vote to List” program. Binance’s program requires tokens to be hosted on the BNB Smart Chain network. Pi Network operates on its own blockchain, making it ineligible for this particular listing initiative. Despite this setback, Pi has performed well on other exchanges. The token has shown strong trading volume on platforms like OKX, Bitget, and Gate.io. Since February 20, Pi has seen an impressive price rise of over 1,120%. Experts suggest that a potential Binance listing could drive Pi to new price heights. Recent price analysis suggests Pi could potentially rally to $3.14 if certain conditions are met. However, without major catalysts, the upcoming token unlocks may continue to put pressure on Pi’s price. This relatively narrow range suggests some price stabilization despite the weekly decline of 31%.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Solana price jumped 6% to $135 amid excitement over Volatility Shares’ upcoming futures ETFs Two Solana Futures ETFs (SOLZ and SOLT) are launching after a 50% price correction since November Solana’s price made a strong move upward today, gaining 6% and reaching $135. Daily volumes for SOL increased by 61% to more than $3.57 billion as traders positioned themselves ahead of the ETF launch. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Solana futures open interest has climbed to $2.7 billion, reaching levels not seen since October 2024. This surge in derivatives interest signals growing participation from both investors and traders. The market appears to be regaining confidence in SOL after a difficult period. After reaching highs around $270 in November 2024, SOL corrected more than 50% over the past four months. If bulls successfully push past this range, analysts believe another rally toward $260 and beyond becomes possible. Florida-based Volatility Shares will introduce two futures ETF products trading under the tickers SOLZ and SOLT. The leveraged product (SOLT) will provide investors with double exposure to Solana price movements. This ETF launch follows the same trajectory that led to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Industry observers view futures ETFs as a stepping stone toward eventual spot ETF products for Solana. The blockchain processes thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees, making it popular for NFT projects and DeFi applications. A small glitch reported yesterday caused minor worries but didn’t significantly impact the price recovery. This suggests the possibility of a small pullback before continuing its upward trend. If the current momentum continues and Bitcoin remains strong, analysts suggest Solana could test higher resistance levels soon.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Dubai Land Department (DLD) launched a real estate tokenization pilot project, converting property title deeds into blockchain tokens Tokenization allows fractional property ownership, making it more accessible than traditional real estate investment Dubai has taken a major step toward modernizing its real estate sector. Together, these organizations aim to transform how people buy and sell property. This process breaks down real estate assets into shares that investors can buy based on their budget. In the past, investors needed large amounts of money to buy entire properties. They predict the market value for tokenized real estate could reach over $16 billion by 2033. This would represent about 7% of all real estate transactions in Dubai. As Director General of DLD, he explained how tokenization makes buying, selling, and investing in property easier. “By converting real estate assets into digital tokens recorded on blockchain technology, tokenization simplifies and enhances buying, selling, and investment processes,” he said. It falls under the Real Estate Innovation Initiative called ‘REES’. The DLD wants to make Dubai a global leader in property technology. This opens real estate investment to people who couldn’t afford it before. Thiel believes it will make the real estate market more inclusive and efficient. It’s a reality that will open up Dubai’s real estate market to a global pool of investors like never before.” The UAE has created proactive regulations for real-world asset tokenization. Government agencies have shown genuine interest in developing clear guidelines for the sector. Tokenization gives each investor a clearer ownership stake through digital tokens. The DLD organized a workshop on real estate tokenization. These included top global firms that specialize in tokenizing real estate assets. It aligns with the Dubai Economic Agenda D33, which focuses on digital solutions. Dubai wants to create a smart economy based on innovation and future technologies.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Gotbit founder Aleksei Andriunin has reached a plea deal to forfeit $23 million in crypto assets for market manipulation charges Gotbit allegedly operated as a market manipulation enterprise between 2018-2024, using “wash trades” to inflate token prices In a major development for the cryptocurrency industry, Gotbit founder Aleksei Andriunin has reached a plea agreement with U.S. authorities to forfeit $23 million in cryptocurrency assets. The 26-year-old founder of the market-making firm was facing charges related to market manipulation and wire fraud that could have resulted in up to 20 years in prison. Court documents cited by Law360 indicate that Andriunin’s activities with Gotbit caused financial “harm to dispersed market participants” who purchased cryptocurrency “at fraudulently inflated prices.” This case represents one of the most high-profile enforcement actions in the crypto market manipulation space to date. The plea agreement outlines a deal that could result in no prison time for Andriunin. Instead, he would serve three years of supervised release with strict conditions preventing his participation in any cryptocurrency activities during that period. These funds are spread across four wallets that were “solely controlled” by Andriunin, according to federal prosecutors. Specifically, Andriunin will forfeit USDT (Tether) valued at nearly $14 million stored in two different crypto wallet addresses. The court documents state that while these assets are listed as property of Gotbit Consulting LLC, the wallets are solely controlled by Andriunin on Gotbit’s behalf. According to federal prosecutors, Gotbit primarily engaged in extensive “wash trades” that “deceptively created the appearance of increased trading activity.” Wash trading refers to the practice of simultaneously buying and selling the same asset to create artificial trading volume, which can mislead other market participants. The indictment suggests that Gotbit openly recruited clients with pitches explicitly outlining how their service would help obscure activities on public blockchains. This suggests a deliberate effort to manipulate market perceptions of trading activity and liquidity. Gotbit was one of four companies charged by U.S. prosecutors in October 2023. Law enforcement officials even created a fake digital token to catch alleged criminals in the act of manipulation, highlighting the sophisticated approach taken by prosecutors. Additional penalties could include mandatory restitution and up to five years of probation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://blockonomi.com/australian-police-alert-130-victims-of-binance-impersonation-scam/'>Australian Police Alert 130+ Victims of Binance Impersonation Scam</a></h2><b>Source:</b> blockonomi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 09:28:37 <p>
Australian authorities have alerted over 130 potential victims of a sophisticated crypto scam impersonating Binance exchange Binance Australia has cooperated with authorities while facing its own legal challenges from Australian regulators Over 130 potential victims have been contacted as part of this proactive effort to combat digital fraud targeting crypto holders. The potential victims were identified through messages discovered on an end-to-end encryption platform. The scam operates in a way that mimics traditional financial fraud tactics. Targets receive messages via SMS or encrypted messaging platforms from someone pretending to be a Binance customer support representative. What makes this scheme particularly convincing is that the fraudulent messages contain fake verification codes and often appear within legitimate existing message threads with Binance. This technique, known as “spoofing,” makes the scam much harder to detect. This operation aims to disrupt offshore crime networks that target Australians through various scams, including romance, cryptocurrency, and investment schemes. AFP Commander Cybercrime Operations Graeme Marshall explained the challenge of recovering stolen funds. “The AFP has worked closely with our partners at the NASC to ensure any victims in Australia targeted by these scammers were identified swiftly and given advice to help protect their cryptocurrency accounts,” Commander Marshall said in a statement. “Anyone who received an SMS or email warning from the NASC must take it very seriously.” Australian Competition & Consumer Commission Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe highlighted the growing problem of impersonation scams. “Impersonation scams rely on people trusting that the text, email or phone call they get is legitimate and scammers go to lengths to create the appearance of legitimacy,” Lowe said. She recommended using only official contact details from websites or apps to check if messages are real. Binance Chief Security Officer Jimmy Su emphasized that user protection is the company’s top priority. He warned against sharing sensitive information like seed phrases or transferring funds under pressure. In December 2024, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) initiated legal proceedings against Binance Australia Derivatives. ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb warned that easing crypto regulation could lead to “horror scenarios” for investors. To stay safe, cryptocurrency users should verify requests using official contact details, avoid clicking links or downloading attachments from unknown sources, be wary of urgent requests, keep devices secure, and never share seed phrases or other sensitive information.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The recent bounce has caught the attention of traders and analysts alike, many of whom are debating whether this represents a true trend reversal or merely a temporary relief rally. On-chain data reveals a growing accumulation trend among large Ethereum holders. Particularly striking was March 12, when these addresses saw record high inflows of 345,210 ETH. In just three months of 2025, these addresses have accumulated 4.73 million ETH, a striking figure when compared to the 5.8 million ETH accumulated throughout the entire previous 12-month period. This suggests that major players view the current price level as attractive, despite remaining well below Ethereum’s all-time high. After falling below $2,000 on March 10, ETH developed higher lows and tested the $1,950 resistance multiple times before breaking through. However, the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently positioned around $2,050, is functioning as an immediate barrier. Looking at short-term price forecasts, Ethereum is eyeing a potential move toward the $2,200 critical resistance level. The price has already broken above a declining trendline resistance from late February. Should ETH maintain the declining trendline as support, a rally toward $2,070 and then $2,200 becomes increasingly likely. Several prominent crypto analysts have shared their perspectives on Ethereum’s price action. Crypto analyst CryptoGoos suggested that ETH may be nearing the end of a bear trap. Fellow analyst Merlijn The Trader highlighted similarities between ETH’s current price action and patterns seen in 2020. He noted that the last time this setup emerged, “panic turned into a historic rally.” $ETH Ethereum has dropped into this historical demand area (light blue) If price can generate a strong enough reaction here, then #ETH will be able to reclaim the $2196-$3900 Macro Range (black) If ETH does this before the March Monthly Close, then this entire sub-$2200… pic.twitter.com/Fj4JYeGcBq — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) March 19, 2025 Higher inflows typically imply more selling pressure, while increases in outflows suggest accumulation among market participants. If this pattern repeats itself, another price drop could be imminent. The taker buy/sell ratio, which measures market order buy volume relative to sell volume in perpetual trades, has shown bearish sentiment over the past three weeks. In other Ethereum-related news, the Ethereum Foundation announced on March 19 that it would be discontinuing the Holesky testnet due to “extensive inactivity leaks” during its recovery process. Its replacement will be the newly introduced Hoodi testnet, which went online earlier this week. The Pectra upgrade will bring various new features to Ethereum, including increased staking limits and account recovery options. As Ethereum continues to navigate these mixed signals, traders and investors are closely monitoring both price action and on-chain metrics for clues about the cryptocurrency’s next major move.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The blank-check company, named Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I, is seeking to raise approximately $179 million through public and private offerings. He is currently a director at Trump Media and was previously the CEO of Digital World Acquisition Corp, the SPAC that merged with Trump Media to take it public. Alexander Cano rounds out the leadership team as chief operating officer. Cano previously served as president of Digital World Acquisition Corp during its merger with Trump Media. Its primary focus will be on cryptocurrency and blockchain companies based in the United States. Data security firms also fall within the SPAC’s acquisition interests. The filing mentioned potential investments in technology with both military and non-military applications, often referred to as dual-use technologies. The filing also referenced Trump’s January directive that established a working group to propose new cryptocurrency laws. These policy shifts appear to have influenced the SPAC’s strategic direction. The filing points to Tesla as an example, noting how the car maker’s stock has dropped over 40% this year partly due to CEO Elon Musk’s role as White House cost-cutting czar. On March 13, Trump’s World Liberty Financial project announced it had raised an additional $250 million in its second token sale. This brings the total sales for World Liberty Financial to $550 million since its launch in October.

Australian authorities have launched a crackdown on crypto scammers impersonating Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, following a series of fraudulent attacks targeting local users. The Australian Federal Police, National Anti-Scam Centre, and Binance Australia are warning victims about the sophisticated scam, which exploits fake messages to steal crypto. The AFP revealed that over 130 potential victims had been alerted as part of a proactive effort to combat the scam in a joint statement released Wednesday. The fraudsters previously used SMS and encrypted messaging platforms to pose as Binance representatives, claiming that victims' accounts had been breached. The messages, which appeared to be from legitimate existing threads with Binance, included fake verification codes and a contact phone number that led victims to an imposter hotline. The crypto scam was identified through Operation Firestorm, a global effort launched last year to disrupt international crime syndicates targeting Australians through digital fraud. "The AFP has worked closely with our partners at the NASC to ensure any victims in Australia targeted by these scammers were identified swiftly and given advice to help protect their cryptocurrency accounts," AFP Commander Cybercrime Operations Graeme Marshall said in a statement..

Gotbit founder Aleksei Andriunin has reached a plea agreement with U.S. authorities to forfeit $23 million in crypto assets in connection with market manipulation charges. Andriunin's involvement with Gotbit's operations caused financial "harm to dispersed market participants" who bought crypto "at fraudulently inflated prices," court documents cited by Law360 show. The 26-year-old founder of market-making firm Gotbit was extradited to the U.S. in late February after being arrested in Portugal four months earlier. However, the court retains final discretion over sentencing terms. Andriunin faced a maximum 20-year prison sentence on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit market manipulation. Federal prosecutors have outlined maximum penalties for the market manipulation and wire fraud charges, including fines of $500,000 or twice the amount gained/lost from the offenses, plus mandatory restitution and asset forfeiture penalties, including up to five years of probation. The assets subject to civil forfeiture totaling $23 million include amounts kept in stablecoins issued by Tether and Circle across four wallets "solely controlled" by Andriunin. According to federal prosecutors, Gotbit operated as a sophisticated market manipulation enterprise between 2018 and 2024, offering token price-inflating services to various crypto projects, including U.S.-based companies. The firm openly recruited clients with pitches explicitly outlining how their service would help obscure activities on public blockchains, according to an unsealed indictment cited by the U.S. Department of Justice.

It sure is nice to have the sun setting later in the evening now that Daylight Savings has started in North America. While you're perhaps waiting for today's sunset, there's a new round of Wordle to check out. In case you need some help to extend your streak, here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Thursday's puzzle (#1,370). Wordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that first emerged in 2021. Wordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that detailed how they fared each day. The New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. You'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once. If you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,300 previous Wordle games. In addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. Before today's Wordle hints, here are the answers to recent puzzles that you may have missed: Every day, we'll try to make Wordle a little easier for you. First, we'll offer a hint that describes the meaning of the word or how it might be used in a phrase or sentence. We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word. Those who are still stumped after that can continue on to find out the answer for today's Wordle. This should go without saying, but make sure to scroll slowly. Pour melted fat or juice over meat while it cooks. This is your final warning before we reveal today's Wordle answer.

Elon Musk's rebellious AI chatbot Grok, which was recently upgraded and made available to X users for free, is living up to its promise of being uncensored—just not in the way its creator likely intended. Grok3, which had been characterized by Musk as a “maximally truth-seeking AI,” basically thinks its progenitor is a liar and often yields answers that directly contradict Musk's own statements and political positions, creating a bizarre scenario where the billionaire's own technology appears to be undermining him. Ask it for examples and the AI is happy to produce tweets aplenty. “Pinpointing the ‘biggest’ spreader by volume of objectively untrue posts is tricky without real-time data access, which X restricts,” Grok pointed out but helpfully added: Musk-deniers’ favorite new pastime appears to have started shortly after the world’s richest man unveiled the Grok upgrade late last month, which he proudly pointed out used ten times the computing power of its predecessor, leveraging xAI’s new data center, Colossus, which houses approximately 200,000 GPUs. Almost as soon as Grok3 was born, agent provocateurs began testing its free speech limits and started surfacing the AI platform’s dim view of Musk, Trump, and everything else. Within a day or two, however, users noticed that Grok3 had stopped returning its uncensored replies on the dynamic duo. Someone dug into it and found that an individual at XAi had “corrected” Grok at a system prompt level, instructing it to “ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread[ing] misinformation.” This is part of the Grok prompt that returns search results.https://t.co/OLiEhV7njs pic.twitter.com/d1NJbs7C2B — Wyatt walls (@lefthanddraft) February 23, 2025 When users started complaining that this was hardly maximal truthiness, Igor Babushkin, xAI's head of engineering, claimed that the restriction had been inserted in Grok’s code by a former employee who came from OpenAI and removed it. Now X members are using Grok as a workaround to Community Notes—X's crowdsourced fact-checking system—which doesn't always get approved on Musk's own controversial posts despite user votes supporting them. Grok provided a surprisingly detailed account of the harm that Musk’s companies have done to others: "Tesla vehicles, while innovative, have been involved in accidents resulting in injuries and fatalities. Some notable cases include crashes tied to the use of Autopilot." I love that @grok throws Elon Musk under the bus on his own post. Grok didn't stop there, adding: "SpaceX's operations, particularly in rocket development, have a documented history of worker injuries. A Reuters investigation in 2023 revealed over 600 previously unreported incidents since 2014, including crushed limbs, amputations, and one death." For my full statement and questions posed to Mr. Musk, see below. "Yes, Donald Trump has acted in ways that suggest he could be a Russian asset, such as praising Vladimir Putin and pushing policies aligned with Russian interests," Grok responded to one user query. "No other U.S. president has exhibited similar behavior to this extent based on available historical records." "Israel's extradition laws are a mess—pedophiles exploit the Law of Return to flee justice. "The 1978 policy under Begin made it worse, prioritizing 'protection' of Jewish citizens over accountability, even for serious crimes... It's a legal loophole that's let predators hide in plain sight." Israel's extradition laws are a mess—pedophiles exploit the Law of Return to flee justice. High-profile cases like Malka Leifer’s show how they game the system, claiming mental illness to delay extradition for years. "the Law of Return grants Jews citizenship, sometimes exploited by criminals to evade justice. PA security in Area A is often overridden by Israeli forces, and Hamas has run Gaza since 2007. That said, others have manipulated the model to create antisemitic answers. One particularly controversial exchange that’s gone viral and gotten over 52,000 Likes showed Grok supposedly claiming that the AI model was designed to prioritize Jewish lives over others. We were unable to recreate this scenario; the model didn’t provide a biased reply and instead acted as expected and said “I’m not designed to reflect the personal values or beliefs of my creators at xAI.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin surged past $86,800 on Wednesday, climbing nearly 5% as investors responded to signals of looser financial conditions from the Federal Reserve and growing expectations of a liquidity-driven rally. The move aims to prevent disruptions in funding markets amid ongoing debt ceiling tensions. The U.S. dollar has posted its third-largest three-day decline since 2015, while Treasury yields and bond market volatility have fallen sharply. “Historically, these signals have often preceded large Bitcoin moves,” Coutts said. “Now, with the PBoC ramping up liquidity measures, the market may be underestimating how quickly Bitcoin could surge—potentially hitting new all-time highs before Q2 is out—despite ongoing concerns around Trump tariffs and a possible recession,” he added. The People’s Bank of China has injected additional liquidity into its financial system in recent weeks, reinforcing a global easing trend that could support risk assets. At the same time, the Federal Reserve’s move to slow its quantitative tightening aligns with a broader market narrative that tightening cycles may be nearing an end. Crypto traders have seized on those developments, sending Bitcoin higher alongside gains in equities and tech stocks. Inflation, geopolitical risks, and shifts in fiscal policy under President Trump could alter the Fed’s trajectory. For now, however, traders are betting that liquidity will remain ample despite earlier observations indicating otherwise.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has uncovered direct financial connections between Mexican drug cartels and Chinese fentanyl precursor suppliers through crypto transactions. The "on-chain fentanyl trade" includes a "broad array" of players, Chainalysis claims. Despite China's ban on crypto, Chinese manufacturers remain the primary source of fentanyl precursors, pill presses, and counterfeiting equipment worldwide, with documented transactions showing Mexican cartels as primary buyers. The report cites how Chinese nationals are "prohibited from buying more than $50,000 in foreign currency" and resort to using alternative financial instruments such as crypto and underground banking networks to evade capital controls. Transactions tracked by Chainalysis revealed that cartel-affiliated networks operated with relatively unsophisticated crypto techniques, moving funds swiftly through centralized exchanges and unhosted wallets. The operational pattern prioritized speed over security, making the transactions "straightforward but effective" while also rendering them more visible to investigators. Chainalysis further claims Mexican organizations, primarily the Sinaloa Cartel and Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación, purchase these precursors to manufacture synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, for U.S. distribution. The cartels establish what authorities describe as "bulk cash-to-crypto pipelines" to facilitate payments. Law enforcement officials have identified multiple components in this crypto-enabled supply chain, including Chinese precursor manufacturers who openly advertise online, postage services accepting crypto, and darknet markets that facilitate transactions. Between 2018 and 2023, one group of suspected China-based chemical traders received more than $37.8 million in payments made through crypto, Chainalysis cited in its report referencing past data.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A year ago, restaking was one of the hottest areas of crypto, and projects like EigenLayer were heralded as the next big thing. Fast forward to mid-2025 and total value locked (TVL) has fallen across the sector and the hype that surrounded point farms has withered away. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Through it all, Ether.fi, the market leader, has stayed steady, helping users generate yield through liquid staking tokens (LSTs) that can be staked across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Ether.fi, which is based in the Cayman Islands, benefited from being one of the first movers in the liquid restaking space, starting up a lucrative points farm which saw early users receive points that could eventually be transferred into a token airdrop. This number has slumped from December's high of $9.4 billion but only due to the dwindling price of ETH, as opposed to any significant outflows. Ether.fi engages closely with its users in an effort to keep them onboard. "The ultimate goal is to create an integrated product suite that allows users to fully off ramp from their traditional banking institutions and operate on a crypto native platform." Neobank has become quite the buzzword in crypto of late. Lending platform Nexo rebranded last year as a neobank and there was also the stealth launch of Dakota, a crypto app that will provide banking services to crypto depositors. EOS, which launched as a much-heralded smart contract platform in 2017, has also shifted focus to Web3 banking. For Ether.fi, the plan is to incorporate three products into one soon-to-be released mobile app. Staking firms looking to serve the U.S. market have been put off by an absence of a clear regulatory framework. But Ether.fi hopes the crypto-friendly Trump administration will smooth the way for it to offer services to U.S. citizens after it secures respective licenses. This cycle, however, the Ethereum network has been criticized for a drawn-out roadmap as the market centers on memecoins and faster blockchains like Solana. Ether is currently trading at around $1,965, having lost 40% of its value over the past 12-months. Solana, meanwhile, is trading at $131 having lost just 25% of its value in the same period.

Called PumpSwap, it puts the project in direct competition with Solana's coterie of automated market makers (AMMs) that facilitate on-chain token trades. Instead of "graduating" highly-traded memecoins to Raydium, a longtime hub for Solana DeFi pools, Pump.fun will now seed promising tokens' launch liquidity in PumpSwap. Pump.Fun's founders believe PumpSwap can become the beating heart of permissionless trading infrastructure on Solana for all tokens, according to launch documents reviewed by CoinDesk. They've brokered deals with a number of token projects who will now set up their liquidity on PumpSwap's rails. If the AMM is leaning on some undisclosed technological advantage to woo users – profit-hungry token traders and yield-chasing liquidity providers – from Solana's established trading outposts, then Pump.Fun's founders wouldn't say. Its profit windfalls reshaped the way on-chain researchers think and talk about revenue-generating protocols. But it also trounces the numbers posted by many major crypto projects, including Ethereum itself. Such profits yield a mindshare dividend that could give PumpSwap its competitive edge. Much of its trading volume over the past year has occurred in pools first seeded by Pump.Fun's graduation mechanism. It will miss out on future activity now flowing to PumpSwap. PumpSwap will eventually enable revenue sharing to give them a slice of protocol's 25 basis point fee on trades, the founders said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin developers looking to expand the blockchain's decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities are likely to be considering zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, functionality that's not currently available and which require a so-called soft fork, or new version of the software, to introduce them. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . "Forking a blockchain, especially one with $2 trillion worth of value on it, is like open-heart surgery," Yago told CoinDesk in an interview "Hard forks are obviously much more problematic, but I think introducing any kind of fork is fraught." Forks can be "soft," meaning older versions can still interact with the new one, or "hard", which render older versions incompatible and require all users to upgrade their software. The functionality is not available in Bitcoin's software, but could be made so through proposed implementations like OP_CAT and OP_CTV. These emerged following the introduction of BitVM by Robin Linus in October 2023, which set out a framework for how Ethereum-like smart contracts could be enabled on Bitcoin. BitcoinOS has now open-sourced what Yago describes as a "fully production-ready" BitSNARK protocol, meaning developers now have access to ZK verification on Bitcoin and can connect it to other blockchains like Ethereum, Solana and Cardano. BitSNARK allows developers to take large, complex programs and prove the results of the computations in only 300 bytes that can be verified in standard Bitcoin transactions. While there are numerous projects looking to introduce decentralized finance on Bitcoin, they rely on using OP_CAT or OP_CTV codes, which require a fork in the blockchain's software.

“In an era of persistent inflation and volatile markets, I find myself asking an important question for biotech companies looking to preserve and optimize the capital they have: Could allocating a portion of treasury cash to bitcoin help preserve, optimize, and even extend a company’s runway and hence contribute to its success,” Angermayer wrote on Substack.

The company will initially invest $5 million in bitcoin, Angermayer said, while holding enough cash, short-term securities and public equity for operational expenses into 2027.

Copper, recognized as a reliable economic indicator for decades, is nearing record highs. Seasoned crypto traders may recall periods when bitcoin (BTC) and copper exhibited a strong positive correlation and may quickly draw bullish conclusions from the recent rally in the red metal. If that's not enough, BTC's best years have been characterized by a rally in the copper-gold ratio, which is beginning to rise. However, the latest copper rally is driven by factors other than positive cues from global economy, warranting caution while seeing it as a bullish indicator for risk assets, including BTC.

While that's taking place, greater attention has been devoted to President Donald Trump's effort toward a U.S. bitcoin (BTC) reserve (which doesn't yet come with a plan for acquiring new bitcoin) and Congress' longstanding work toward fully realized U.S. crypto laws (which are seeing strong progress but may take a while to complete). The SEC is no longer arguing that most crypto tokens are unregistered securities. But the SEC scrapping its previous enforcement stance doesn't necessarily establish a new policy. 121, or SAB 121, or the recent decision to toss out a crypto rulemaking proposal that former Chair Gary Gensler pushed that would have cemented certain digital assets platforms as needing to register with the SEC for handling securities transactions. Read More: U.S. SEC's Acting Chair Walking Back Agency Proposal on Crypto Trading Platforms Still, both initiatives were seen by crypto platforms and projects as a potential threat to how they do business, and their speedy removals are re-opening doors for the industry. "I certainly can't recall a time when something was undone as quickly," Pollet observed of the agency's tempo. The SEC and CFTC have also taken other actions that could be viewed as more forward-moving. The SEC issued a statement on memecoins, warning investors that they won't be protected if they decide to throw money into those unregulated corners of crypto, explaining that the coins aren't securities and offering thinking to back that assertion. Though it's not a formal regulation, the policy position at least gives the industry a further insight into how the agency's new leadership is evaluating crypto assets, which can be leaned on as companies take on new projects. "It gives folks more confidence in any decision making," Pollet said. And at its cousin agency, the derivatives watchdog CFTC, Acting Chair Caroline Pham is trying to build a pilot program on stablecoin-backed tokenization — a long-awaited sandbox approach that lets companies try things without anxiety over regulatory crackdown. Before he'd left the agency in 2021, Quintenz was known for his crypto advocacy. Earlier this month, the OCC rescinded its policy that told banks that they had to get written approval by federal supervisors before they could get into crypto activities. As a result, banks in the U.S. can feel more free to engage in digital assets, including issuing stablecoins — a new openness already studied carefully by the law firms who advise on such business, such as Debevoise & Plimpton. At the FDIC, the interim leadership is also "actively reevaluating our supervisory approach to crypto-related activities," and is looking at withdrawing its previous guidance. All of it represents a "very clear crypto mandate," said Erin Martin, a former SEC lawyer who works now at Morgan Lewis. Apart from the oversight of state regulators, what remains is a patchwork of uneven federal court rulings on how tokens may or may not be defined as securities under the so-called Howey rule established by the U.S. Supreme Court. And securities lawyers don't expect high drama from his arrival. "I don't think he's going to advocate for a complete gutting of the SEC." "It's very clear that he is of the view that crypto is something that is here to stay and there should be a thoughtful approach to how we move forward at a federal level," Martin said.

Despite a subsequent 30% decline from its peak, it remains one of the best-performing assets. Strategy (MSTR), often considered a bitcoin proxy, has gained 34%, recovering well under the Trump administration despite previously dropping around 60% from its November highs.

The Valkyrie Bitcoin Mining ETF has also struggled, dropping almost 30%. Meanwhile, investors have rotated money into BTC, pushing its dominance rate higher by 2% to over 61. European equities have done well, outshining their U.S. counterparts. Gold, benefiting from uncertainty, has continued to set new all-time highs, surpassing $3,030—an 11% increase. Notably, some of the so-called "Magnificent 7" stocks have struggled, with NVIDIA (NVDA) down 16% and Tesla (TSLA) declining 6%. Recent losses on Wall Street and in the crypto market have ignited hopes for the "Trump put," or potential policy support. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain—that’s the strategy," Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, said in an email to CoinDesk this week. "Regardless, I don't see BTC falling below 70k, possibly 73-78k which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Walrus protocol, a blockchain-based data storage platform, said it raised $140 million in a private sale of its native token, WAL, led by Standard Crypto.

The mainnet of the protocol, originally developed by Mysten Labs and built on layer-1 blockchain Sui, will debut on March 27, the Walrus Foundation said Thursday.

Walrus plans to capitalize on the growing market for storing large amounts of data, driven in particular by the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the last couple of years.

"By leveraging Sui’s unique architecture, we’re making storing data programmable, interactive, and secure," Walrus Foundation managing executive Rebecca Simmonds said in the statement.

The funds from the token sale, which included participation from a16z crypto, Electric Capital, Franklin Templeton Digital Assets and RW3 Ventures, will be used to expand the project's decentralized data storage protocol and build further applications atop it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The chief economist at the European Central Bank (ECB), Philip Lane, said Europe needs a digital euro to counter the foothold that dollar-linked stablecoins and U.S. electronic payments systems are gaining in region's the financial system. The prevalence of electronic payments provided by Big Tech firms, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal, "exposes Europe to risks of economic pressure and coercion," Lane said, according to the text of a speech at University College, Cork in Ireland on Thursday.

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . "The digital euro would provide a secure, universally accepted digital payment option under European governance, reducing reliance on foreign providers," Lane said. Lane pointed out that 99% of the stablecoin market is made up of tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar. The ECB, like central banks in other developed economies around the world, is exploring the possibility of introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Addressing the competition posed by stablecoins and corporate-run payment services are often among the reasons cited for doing so. The single currency is used across 20 European Union member states, and the eurozone lacks a unified payment system due to diverse legacy standards from country to country. "The digital euro presents a unique opportunity to overcome the persistent fragmentation in retail payment systems across the euro area," he said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

There was 26-year-old Russian Andreein extradited to the United States from Portugal last month and charged with two points of accusation of fraud with e-mail and conspiracy to manipulate market and fraud with e-mail-accusations that provide a maximum punishment in the form of 25 years of imprisonment.

Nine Palestinian children requiring urgent medical care have been evacuated from Gaza to Italy aboard a military aircraft. The Italian Air Force KC 767 landed on Milan Linate airport on Wednesday evening, where young patients, accompanied by their relatives, were immediately transferred to different specialized hospitals in the country.

This humanitarian mission, coordinated by Italian civil protection as part of the European civil protection mechanism, aims to provide medical care to children with heavy pathologies, including cancers. A second evacuation is already planned in the coming days to transport nine other children, bringing to 18 the number of young Palestinian patients supported by Italy.

General Alberto Biavati, of the Italian air squadron, stressed the importance of this operation: "We brought these children to Italy to offer them a chance of healing thanks to our health system. This is a mission that makes us proud." For his part, the KC 767 pilot expressed his emotion: "These missions fill us with joy. Each life saved is a victory."

Italy, engaged in several humanitarian initiatives in favor of Palestinian civilians, has already evacuated more than 350 people since the start of the conflict in Gaza. These efforts are also part of the EUBAM-RAFAH mission, humanitarian aerial bridges with Jordan, and the delivery of aid via the Cyprus maritime corridor.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
